### Concerning Recent Prices

Since the issuance of the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, various prices have fallen successively, like a long-awaited rain after a drought, giving everyone a slight respite. However, it is difficult to lower prices, but easy to raise them; a drop of one unit is followed by a rise of ten, which has been a general rule for price fluctuations in recent years. The fundamental reasons for the increase in prices have not been thoroughly resolved, and there is still a tendency for the embers to rekindle.

During the period of registration for cotton yarn and cloth, retail cotton yarn and cloth shops were crowded, sellers dumped their goods, and buyers competed to purchase them. Merchants attempted to evade registration and purchase, and consumers prepared for the transitional period when there would be no goods to buy, and to avoid the suffering of high black market prices. This was the psychology of merchants and consumers at that time. Now, two months have passed, and the facts have proven that this psychology was not wrong. Because during the current registration and purchase period for yarn and cloth, allocation has not yet been implemented, there are currently no goods available on the market, and the black market prices are incredibly high. In this situation, it is inevitable that the individualism of small self-interest will rise, boasting of foresight, and therefore the psychology of valuing goods over currency still cannot be completely eradicated.

The situation of dumping and competitive purchasing by general stores and consumers during the recent soap registration period was exactly the same as with cotton cloth. However, soap allocation purchase certificates have already been issued, and small quantities can still be purchased in the market, so the situation is not as serious as with cotton cloth. All of these facts and experiences can provide a reference for those who manage prices and study price issues.

According to general estimates, the total average price index for September fell by more than 20% compared to August. The decline in prices, since June of last year, has only seen a slight decrease in August of the same year, and has increased month by month, especially between June, July and August of this year, the rise was the most severe, repeatedly reaching peaks. The reason for the decline in September should be that the general public, in view of the purchase of yarn and cloth, was deeply afraid that the scope would expand and affect themselves. At the same time, the money supply in the market suddenly became tight, so they all rushed to release domestic goods, forming a situation of oversupply.

Analyzing further, among various prices, clothing materials fell the most, and the reason was naturally the purchase of yarn and cloth, as the public wanted to evade it and dumped goods at reduced prices. Food fell the least, and the black market price of white sugar actually rose. Although the black market price of rice has slightly declined, with the new grain entering the market, according to custom, the market price will inevitably rebound slightly. At the same time, affected by the general decline in prices, the proportion of the decline should be more than this. The reason why it is actually so is that the rise and fall of rice prices in this city is not tied to the supply in rice-producing areas, but depends on the strictness of the blockade in the suburbs. Secondly, since July, the quantity of household rice has decreased, and recently the official price has increased again, which is contrary to the principle of not reducing the quantity and not increasing the price. Therefore, rice prices are difficult to fall.

Among foods, what is equally important as rice and has the greatest impact on the lives of ordinary people is the price of vegetables, especially green vegetables, which are a common side dish for the working class. This month's price has increased even more than last month, which is a matter that should be given the most attention and urgently suppressed in the current price problem. According to a newspaper report the day before yesterday, the Central Market is actively purchasing various vegetables and transporting them to Shanghai to supply the market. At the same time, it continues to assess and set standard price limits, announcing them daily, and each group of brokers must earnestly implement them and must not deliberately exceed them. In fact, the supply of vegetables in the rural suburbs has never been lacking. Recently, various green vegetables have also reached the harvest period. As long as the source is unblocked and the excessive exploitation of intermediaries is prevented, in theory, vegetable prices will not rise again, but should decline. The Central Market and the relevant price authorities should pay attention to the close relationship between vegetable prices and the lives of ordinary people, and the importance of vegetables to the nutrition and health of ordinary people, and try their best to suppress and stabilize prices. Passive price limits are certainly needed, but it is necessary to pay attention to having a price but no goods, which is like empty soup and cannot satisfy hunger. Actively unblocking the source, reducing the trouble for farmers in transportation, and the exploitation of intermediaries, and effectively suppressing the selling price, with the official market having goods to supply the market, so that the rights of ordinary people to enjoy vegetables will not be threatened and deprived by high prices.

Japanese Cabinet Officially Decides on This Year's Supplementary Budget

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — The supplementary budget for the 18th year of Showa (1943) was officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 25th and was announced by the Information Bureau and submitted to the 83rd Provisional Parliament. The amount of this additional budget is 129,007,000 yen for the general account and 7,003,000 yen for the special account, most of which will be used as the necessary expenses for the establishment of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce, the Ministry of Military Supplies, and the Ministry of Transportation and Prices, and the transfer of affairs between the ministries, which the Japanese government previously established to establish an epoch-making administration for decisive battles. The Japanese government will offset this additional expenditure with the excess revenue from the implementation of the 18th year budget, so the amount of the 18th year of Showa budget has not actually increased, which is a sound operation of the epoch-making wartime finance.

### Indians in Syonan Island Hold Mass Rally to Celebrate Establishment of Provisional Indian Government

Syonan, 25th (Central News Agency) — Chairman Jiangtela Bose of the Provisional Government of India recently announced that Burma formally recognized the government on the 24th.

Jiangtela Bose Speaks to Reporters

Syonan, 25th (Central News Agency) — Jiangtela Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, met with a group of reporters in Syonan City on the 24th. The questions and answers between the Provisional Government's establishment statement and the reporter group are as follows: (Question) What are the specific plans that the Provisional Government will implement to complete the independence movement in the future? (Answer) What we are striving for now is to enable the Indian people to launch an independence movement, and to complete this movement at any sacrifice. (Question) What will be the impact on India after the declaration of war against Britain and the United States? (Answer) Our comrades in India will be greatly moved, and people standing in different positions can also recognize the authenticity of this movement. Also, because the Provisional Government has been established, Japan and other countries have successively formally recognized it, and have officially declared war on Britain and the United States. The enemy will also realize the seriousness of the situation. (Question) What impact will the establishment of the Provisional Government and the declaration of war against Britain and the United States have on the Chongqing regime? (Answer) I don't know much about the recent situation in Chongqing, but a part of that regime is actually against the United States and Britain, especially against Britain's strong policy towards India. There is still a faction that opposes the policies of Britain and the United States. Our establishment of the Provisional Government and our declaration of war against Britain and the United States will, in the future, once the offensive begins, strengthen the conviction of this faction. Britain and the United States say that the purpose of this war is to uphold democracy, but they do not recognize India's freedom. Japan is fighting for justice and has recognized the independence of Burma and the Philippines. This time, it has further recognized the Provisional Government of India. The truth is now obvious. I believe it will have a great impact on the Chongqing side. However, if Britain forever holds the dominance of India, then the Chongqing side will not be able to realize the futility of resistance and will still look forward to opening the Burma Road to achieve final victory. But once the Indian National Army liberates the provinces of Bengal and Assam in India, then Chongqing's desire for the opening of the Burma Road will be completely hopeless, and the transportation expenses through Assam will also be cut off. The Chongqing regime may clearly realize the futility of resistance. What I don't care about now is an appeal to the Chongqing side, because the Chongqing side has not yet reflected on the future complete liberation of the provinces of Bengal and Assam. I must make an appeal to the Chongqing regime. (Question) What is the morale of the National Army? (Answer) According to a third party who is connected with the National Army, the National Army has made great progress in the past few months. All the soldiers are more and more enthusiastic under the banner of "Go to Delhi". In the future, the National Army will not retreat, only advance or die in battle.

### Anniversary of the South Pacific Naval Battle; Japanese Lieutenant Commander Discusses Fierce Fighting

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — October 26th marks the first anniversary of the "South Pacific Naval Battle," that is, the day the Japanese and American fleets encountered each other in the northern waters of the Santa Cruz Islands in the South Pacific, staging an unparalleled sea battle. On that single day, the U.S. fleet suffered losses including three aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, one destroyer, three ships of unknown type, and over 200 aircraft. In addition, one destroyer was heavily damaged. The scale of the Japanese military's achievements can be described as unprecedented. From this battle onward, the enemy fleet had no choice but to change its operational policy from fleet decisive battle doctrine to base advancement doctrine. The following is a recollection of the situation a year ago from a certain lieutenant commander of a certain ship who participated in the battle: "The South Pacific Naval Battle was the largest-scale naval battle involving enemy fleets with multiple aircraft carrier groups, responding to the Guadalcanal Island operation, and engaging the Japanese fleet on a large scale several times. The enemy occupied Guadalcanal Island in early August of last year, and unwilling to accept the heavy blows suffered in the first and second Solomon Sea battles, and in order to support the landing forces on Guadalcanal Island, gradually concentrated its naval forces, creating a situation of uncertainty around the Solomon Islands for about two months. The enemy, in order to lure the fleet into its sphere of influence, never left the range of its aircraft's capabilities. The South Pacific Naval Battle was a trap to lure us in, secretly measuring our offensive and implementing a lightning-fast attack. As a result of this battle, the enemy's forces were greatly weakened. In addition to losing several aircraft carriers, other losses were also significant. Therefore, afterward, in that area, they had no choice but to change the maritime operational doctrine of the fleet to a base advancement doctrine. The enemy fleet's movements had been anticipated by the Japanese side, so reconnaissance aircraft were dispatched at dawn that day to detect a large enemy fleet heading north from the west of the Santa Cruz Islands. Aerial attack units were immediately dispatched and an aerial alert network was set up. As soon as the deployment was completed, a large formation of enemy carrier-based aircraft appeared over the Japanese fleet, and the heroic battle began. Two Japanese aircraft carriers and one cruiser were damaged as a result. However, looking at the enemy side, the ships that were attacked by the Japanese military's aerial attack units at the risk of their lives and sunk were three aircraft carriers, one battleship, three cruisers, and 200 aircraft were shot down. The scale of the results was truly unprecedented. Due to the characteristics of the attack and defense capabilities of aircraft carriers, the time when the aircraft they carry are on the ship is the time of maximum attack power, but the defense power is weakest when the aircraft on the ship have not yet fully taken off and an enemy bomb hits, causing multiple bombs to explode. Conversely, once all the aircraft have taken off, the defense power immediately becomes the best. This is different from general warships, so if the enemy is detected early, the attack and defense power will be reversed, and this is the key to victory or defeat. The reason why the Japanese side won the South Pacific Sea Battle and suffered the least losses was because the enemy fleet was discovered earlier, and we were able to launch a preemptive strike. The great achievements that the Japanese soldiers obtained in this naval battle with their lives are etched in the hearts of all the people and will never be forgotten. In this battle, the Japanese soldiers broke through the enemy's iron barrel defense formation, drove their beloved aircraft in hand-to-hand combat, and some detonated their aircraft after launching torpedoes at the enemy aircraft carrier. Some drove their dive bombers into the enemy aircraft carrier, and then crashed directly into the enemy escort ship, causing it to catch fire. There was also a heroic anecdote in which a gunner measuring the angle of elevation on an aircraft carrier suffered severe injuries to both hands during combat, and continued to engage in artillery combat with the handle of the ruler in his mouth. Such heroic anecdotes are too numerous to mention. This unforgettable South Pacific Naval Battle has passed a year ago, and the overall situation of the war has become more serious than before. Therefore, I hope that the people in the rear will not forget the importance of this naval battle, and that all will rise up and rush to the war."

### Japanese Military Position on Various Islands in the South Pacific Becomes More Solid; U.S. Admits to Expecting Long and Arduous War

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) — General Barbey, Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Southwest Pacific, stated: "The U.S. military will face a difficult and lengthy war in the Pacific. Americans have not yet damaged the Japanese military's vitality. If U.S. forces advance and make contact, the Japanese military will become even more tenacious. The main difficulty for the Americans is that the Japanese military has advanced to its current position, and the Americans must push them back. Future operations against Japan will likely be amphibious in nature, as the Japanese military has established solid positions on a large number of islands. If these islands cannot be occupied, it seems impossible to drive them back. The Americans have their own operational plans. However, an event that should be noted is that when we approach the Japanese military, the Japanese military's resistance will increase."

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) — According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval aircraft launched a surprise attack on the enemy's Woodlark Island and the Trobriand Islands in New Britain early on the 23rd.

### Fighting Reaches Its Peak on the Lower Dnieper Front; Germans Announce Abandonment of Melitopol

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A communique released by the German Headquarters on the 24th stated: "After fighting in the city of Melitopol for several days, the German army withdrew from the city to the western outskirts on the night of the 21st to the 22nd."

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A German High Command report stated: "The major offensive and defensive battles at the focal points on the central and southern routes of the Eastern Front have reached a particularly intense stage yesterday. Several Soviet divisions launched an offensive on a narrow front from south of Melitopol to southeast of Rongpuluki. They were repelled and suffered heavy losses. Several places in the German positions were dented and then quickly filled in. In Dniprodzerzhynsk (southeast of Kryvyi Rih), the enemy attacked from both sides under cover of heavy fog, establishing several bridgeheads on the west bank of the Dnieper. At the breakthrough point southeast of Kryvyi Rih, the enemy launched a fierce attack on the German defense line. The German army retaliated with a counterattack. The enemy has intensified its breakthrough offensive in Kryvyi Rih, and fierce battles are currently underway. There are also fierce battles west of Smolensk. The enemy's attempts to break through were thwarted by the heroic resistance of the German army, and the German army recovered its temporarily lost positions during the counterattack. Several small groups of enemy troops were annihilated. In the remaining battle areas on the Eastern Front, there were only local engagements. In the past two days, the Soviet army has lost a total of 282 tanks between the Sea of Azov and Kryvyi Rih."

The Staircase-Shaped Line of Defense is Impregnable

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) — A report from the German News Agency stated: "On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet army continued to attack at the key points on the Eastern Front, but failed to achieve decisive results. The German army once again achieved a complete defensive victory along the entire line. On Saturday and Sunday, the Soviet army only pushed back the German front line by a few kilometers in a few places. But generally speaking, the enemy's offensives were all blocked by the deep and long staircase-shaped defensive system of the German army. The enemy was repelled everywhere and was unable to break through the German positions anywhere. Between the Sea of Azov and the Dnieper bend, the Soviet army launched an offensive along a wide front. Its main force was concentrated in the northern and southern areas of Melitopol. In the fierce battles throughout the day, the Soviet army's offensives were all repelled by the German grenadiers. After being held by the German defending forces for several days, the ruined town of Melitopol was evacuated that afternoon. The Soviet army's offensive against the German fan-shaped positions on the western outskirts of the town collapsed, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. North of Melitopol, German mountain troops gained and held a position during a counterattack. The Soviet army's repeated offensives were unsuccessful."

German Battlefield Results North and South of Kyiv

"At the gap northwest of Dniprodzerzhynsk, the Soviet army launched an offensive along the entire line with newly arrived infantry and tank divisions, targeting the flanks of the German army and the German positions in front of Kryvyi Rih. The German grenadiers in front of Kryvyi Rih were forced to withdraw their lines westward under the strong pressure of several groups of Soviet tanks. But at the same time, the German flanks continued to defend successfully. The Soviet army lost a total of 78 tanks in one area on Saturday and Sunday. North of Kyiv, German infantry and tank units repelled the Soviet army eastward in a courageous attack and seized a large batch of war spoils. More than 1,000 prisoners of war fell into German hands. The Soviet army's offensive to break into the German positions in the central Dnieper was blocked by the resolute defense of the German infantry. On the road between Smolensk and Orsha, the German defending forces also won a great victory on the third day of the defensive battle. The Soviet army had reinforced its artillery units and joined the battle with several teams of tanks and motorized infantry under the cover of heavy fog. The German army had to temporarily withdraw to the front of its positions in order to allow the German artillery units to fully exert their defensive power. After several hours of fierce fighting, the German grenadiers won a great victory, causing the Soviet army to retreat to its original positions. Currently, only local battles are occurring in the northern part of the Eastern Front south of Lake Ladoga. That afternoon, the Soviet army broke into the German positions, but the gap was immediately sealed off during the German counterattack. Four Soviet tanks fell into German hands, while another eleven were disabled. Stanbury Island"

### German Forces Build Strong Positions in the Balkans, Focusing on the Entire Black Sea Coast

Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Reuters reports: Field Marshal Rommel, commander of German forces in northern Italy, is building positions along the Balkan coast to prevent Soviet and Anglo-American forces from invading the Balkans, while also actively strengthening existing positions. However, it is generally observed that the anti-Axis forces' invasion routes into the Balkans are, on the one hand, across the Adriatic Sea, which is controlled by British forces, landing in Albania; and on the other hand, by Soviet forces landing on the eastern coast of the Balkans from the Black Sea. However, Field Marshal Rommel believes that the ongoing Moscow Conference is aimed at coordinating simultaneous operations by British, American, and Soviet forces. According to Swedish press reports, German forces are currently mobilizing labor and soldiers from morning to night to construct solid fortifications and trenches, airfields, and install long-range artillery along the entire Black Sea coast from Odessa to the Turkish border. Citizens of various European countries are also participating in this work. Another Swedish newspaper also stated that the situation in the Balkans is becoming increasingly tense.

He recently issued a warning regarding the fact that the anti-Axis forces are too dispersed on various battlefronts around the world, saying that the reserves of British and American forces in the Mediterranean are not inexhaustible, and using these forces on overly broad deployment lines poses a danger to military operations in this region. Furthermore, British forces cannot simultaneously launch several large-scale offensives on various fronts with sufficient forces. The overuse of anti-Axis military power reduces its strength. These remarks by the British military commentator were made in response to the foolishness of starting combat in Burma. The action in Burma is "unwise" because it affects operations in the Mediterranean. He did not say that if the anti-Axis forces can occupy Burma at the cost of weakening the Mediterranean forces, it would be a losing proposition.

### American Planes Stationed in Chongqing Blindly Bomb Hanoi

### Japanese Planes in Burma Heavily Bomb Tamu

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - On the 20th, Japanese Army Air Force units dispatched a combined large formation of fighters and bombers to attack Chittagong, an enemy forward stronghold in eastern India, heavily bombing its military facilities.

More than a dozen were completely destroyed, and fires broke out in several places. The Japanese aircraft returned safely after achieving their objective. Tamu is located upstream of the Naf River, 40 kilometers from Maungdaw, and is the enemy's front-line base. Since attempting to counterattack Burma, the enemy has actively prepared military supplies and built barracks in the Naf River upstream area centered on Tamu in preparation for an offensive. The expansion of the stronghold is necessary for an offensive on the Arakan front.

### U.S. Military Police Arrive in Kunming

### Minister Mei Talks to Reporters About Promoting Government Orders

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Minister of the Interior Mei Siping met with Chinese and Japanese reporters in the capital at the department's auditorium at 3 p.m. on the 24th. More than twenty reporters attended. This was Minister Mei's first meeting with the press since taking office. Minister Mei answered each question raised by the reporters one by one. The following is a summary: Question (1): The success of a nation's politics depends on whether government orders are smoothly implemented. What are the Minister's thoughts on this? (Answer): I have been studying this issue for more than ten years. When I was a university professor, I taught administrative law. Later, as a local official, I actually dealt with this issue, so I attach great importance to it. China has a history of thousands of years. In the past, it was difficult to promote government orders locally. There was no such thing as internal education before the Republic of China. The biggest reason was that local officials had too little power. Taking the county magistrate as an example, not only was his position low and his powers limited, but his funds were also insufficient. This had a great impact on the implementation of government orders. I believe that in order to promote government orders and put national politics on the right track, we must improve the status of local officials and increase county finances. I am currently considering a plan and intend to inspect the county administrations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and other places in a month to provide suggestions for improvement. Question: What new plans do you have for promoting the Baojia system? (Answer): The Ministry of the Interior has established a Baojia Promotion Committee to promote the Baojia system. In September of this year, after careful discussion by the former Minister Chen and others, it was decided to expand the organization of the Baojia Committee and draft a plan. The principles have been approved, and the Social Welfare Department of the New People's Movement and the Central Party Headquarters will participate. From now on, the Baojia Promotion Committee will be responsible for matters related to promoting mass movements. The same applies to all regions. (Question) Are there any new plans for promoting county administration nationwide in the future? (Answer) The focus of promoting county administration should be on both the Baojia and the police. The former is the organization of the people, and the latter is related to local security. Both have close links with county administration. In the future, the promotion of administrative work will start from these two aspects and strive to promote it so that county administration nationwide can be promoted smoothly.

### Anti-Axis Side Acknowledges Difficult Operations in Italy, Mountain Offensive Suffers Setback

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a communiqué issued by General Alexander's anti-Axis 15th Army Group in Italy: All roads lead to Rome, but unfortunately, these roads are all mined with landmines and all bridges have been blown up. Alexander's forces have experienced the difficulties of fighting in Italy. It is estimated that there are 35 to 40 divisions of strong German forces in Italy and the Balkans, so progress is naturally not rapid.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After a tour from Tunis, Malta, Sardinia and Naples, U.S. Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. declared in Algiers: Americans are too optimistic. When we look at the towering Mount Volturno Valley and its tendency to increase in altitude to the north, we feel that we must continue to engage in arduous mountain warfare. This is Morgenthau's feeling about the Italian battlefield. He also said: Before we reach Rome, there will be a period of hard and bloody fighting. When I return to the United States, I will tell the American people that we still have difficult work ahead of us. This may be beneficial to everyone, because the sooner Americans learn the truth, the better.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German news agency reports: On Saturday, British and American forces once again launched attempts to break through at various focal points on the southern Italian front with powerful forces. The British and American forces were met with intensified German defenses everywhere. The characteristic of the German defense was the reinforcement of heavy artillery and the participation of mobile artillery units in the battle. The mobile artillery units used 8.8 cm caliber guns and took joint action with infantry assault teams. This cooperation caused heavy losses to the British and American forces in Ganbochilo in the Apennine Mountains on Saturday. A large number of enemy "Xu Men" tanks were destroyed, and the attacking enemy forces were repelled and routed. Four anti-Axis forces attempted to use mule columns to control the impassable wilderness mountains north of Piedmont. This flanking encirclement attempt was detected by the German forces in time and suppressed with accurate artillery fire. Between Piedmont and the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the British and American forces launched two offensives on the same [blank] scale, after large-scale artillery preparations, but were soon hindered by the German artillery and completely defeated by the German counter-attack. The roar of the [blank] army's heavy artillery prevented the British and American material preparation teams from entering the combat area. As a result, the German army finally annihilated or captured most of the U.S. military sub-units. West of the upper reaches of the Volturno River, British and American forces launched repeated sporadic offensives, [blank] trying to split the German defenses, but the enemy's attacks were repelled everywhere. The main German forces launched two powerful counter-attacks at Rocheda and Sbalanies, making it clear [blank] the effectiveness of the German resistance at the northern exit of the Campania Plain. In this battle, German [blank] infantry captured many prisoners of war and seized a large number of light and heavy infantry weapons [blank] trophies, which shows the heavy price paid by the British and American forces.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to official sources: A strong German bomber formation violently attacked the port facilities of Naples last night, as well as anti-Axis transport ships docked at the harbor. The enemy's losses are not yet known.

### Foreign Envoys to Italy Return to Venice

Venice, 20th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Republican Fascist government has designated Venice as the residence for foreign envoys.

A delegation from the Japanese Embassy has moved here. Envoys from Slovakia and Croatia have also moved here, but the Thai envoy has gone to [blank]'s Meiqi.

### U.S. Submarine Sinks in Pacific

Buenos Aires, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 24th: "The submarine USS Dorado did not return to base as scheduled and has [blank] sacrificed in the Pacific. The submarine was launched in May 1942.

### German Submarine Commander Establishes Extraordinary Merits

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A German news agency reports: On Sunday, the German leader personally presented the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves and Diamonds to [blank] Naval Lieutenant Commander Ludsdehai, a German submarine commander. Russ is the first person to receive this diamond award. Lieutenant Commander Russ recently returned to Germany after completing fifteen long-range expeditions. The length of time he was on expeditions has set a new record among independently operating submarines. Admiral [blank] Nitz also issued an order, highly praising the 30-year-old lieutenant commander.

### German Light Warships in Black Sea Attack Anapa Port at Night

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to German military authorities, a night raid on Anapa Port on the eastern shore of the Black Sea shelled anti-Axis ships. Enemy ships in the middle of the night on the 23rd.

### Moscow Conference Reaches Important Stage

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Reuters special correspondent Kim Harro reported from Moscow last night that the Moscow Conference has entered its most important phase. Experts from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union held their first discussion of complex issues from 9 PM until 2 AM the next morning before adjourning.

Moscow, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) – U.S. Secretary of State Hull, British Foreign Secretary Eden, and Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov held their sixth meeting at the Guest House here at 4 PM on the 24th.

Invasion of Western Europe Must Wait

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) Washington dispatch: The order for U.S. General Marshall to be appointed as the commander-in-chief of the forces invading Western Europe, which was originally scheduled to be announced on October 25th, has now been postponed. The "Army and Navy Records Report" stated that General Marshall will remain in Washington until the beginning of next year. This newspaper, which is close to the U.S. Department of the Army, indicates that the plan for the anti-Axis forces to land in the Netherlands or France will not be implemented until the spring or summer of 1944 at the earliest. The New York correspondent of the "Swedish Daily News" stated that the opening of a second front cannot be realized in the short term. The war on the Eastern Front has completely misguided the United States' estimates. The United States believed last winter that after another year of war, the strength of Germany and the Soviet Union would be exhausted. In this case, the anti-Axis forces could not only land in Europe, but also easily resolve European affairs without being constrained by the Soviet Union. However, in fact, the Soviet army's summer offensive has shattered the wishful thinking of the United Kingdom and the United States, and the United States is worried about the progress of the Moscow Conference due to its current unfavorable position.

### Fundamental Issues of Enhancing War Power

What are the contents of enhancing our war power under the decisive battle? How should we deal with it? The following items are described in detail. However, the problem is extremely profound and very complicated. The center of this problem is the aircraft industry. However, the war power enhancement problem is not only related to this, but also related to the entire war economy. It is a fundamental issue of the total war of the entire national structure for carrying out the war and the decisive battle. In view of the complexity and importance of this problem, we intend to put forward some fundamental items at the beginning for clear examination.

First, enhancing the war power in the current decisive battle stage must embrace the principle of aviation aircraft first. The war power enhancement up to now has been the simultaneous advancement of the five major industries of steel, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft. Placing an ultra-emphasis on these five major industries is based on what is called ultra-emphasisism. Before this, no specific industry was designated, but was based on what is called emphasisism as a prerequisite. However, today, planar ultra-emphasisism is not allowed. The importance of the five major industries has not diminished in the slightest at present. In particular, enhancing shipbuilding capacity is indeed an important task that we must emphasize. However, the importance of the five major industries and the parallel establishment of other important industries based on them, and granting them so-called special cases and prioritized production enhancement methods, are things from before the stage when the decisive battle in aviation occurred one after another.

Of course, administrative special cases should be extended to all important industries. However, the expansion of special cases is not just an administrative reform. The government's "National Strength Enhancement Measures," which were decided upon the other day, aim to decisively transform the entire administrative operation into a decisive battle mode. The war power enhancement method adapted to this stage must be based on aircraft production as the apex, and on the basis of the aircraft industry series arrangement, establish a three-dimensional situation of key industries. What we first want to emphasize is this point. In this sense, this "National Structure Enhancement Measures" should aim at the rapid enhancement of military production (especially the rapid expansion of aviation war power).

Second, what is most necessary for current war power enhancement is the construction of aircraft and ships, so the purpose must be to establish a mass production style. Of course, in order to realize rapid increase in production, where are the bottlenecks for increasing production, it is necessary to accurately review the actual situation, and to bravely open up this bottleneck. For the sake of opening up the bottleneck, administrative inspection is indeed extremely urgent, and the utilization of domestic resources is also necessary. Therefore, the current production increase measures are nothing more than implementing measures to overcome this urgent bottleneck. But our enemies are the United Kingdom and the United States. Whether it is one aircraft or one ship, they should all be produced as soon as possible. However, can we overwhelm the enemy's "quantity" by gradually opening up the ordinary production increase bottleneck? It is essential to think deeply about this point. A few thousand aircraft and tens of thousands of tons three months later are fundamentally more important than tens of thousands of aircraft and millions of tons one year later.

Therefore, it is necessary not only to open up the so-called bottleneck, but also to overcome all obstacles and establish a mass production style. However, this matter requires a certain period of time. If the time is lost, the establishment of a mass production style is impossible. No, what is more important is that it cannot keep up with the time of the decisive battle. Just as the supply war in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly profound, we cannot help but keenly feel that the key point of the current war power enhancement is to rapidly shift to a mass production system.

Then, is the establishment of the aircraft first principle an easy task? Also, is the realization of a mass production system easy? No. Under today's decisive battle economy, it is not easy to solve these two problems. Therefore, industrialists must reflect more deeply; at the same time, it is indispensable to establish a genuine decisive battle administration. This problem can only be solved by a system where all the people are united with the spirit of determination and made to act as a force in the decisive battle, and with the economic system of the decisive battle standing on the basis of its total strength.

### Japan Enhancing Production Power

That is, we do not regard the war power enhancement problem under the current situation as a simple war power enhancement problem, but also believe that it is an inseparable problem from strengthening the domestic structure. This is the third point we want to emphasize.

The government has already clarified in the aforementioned "National Structure Enhancement Measures" the gist of "seeking to more clearly express the national nature of important enterprises in management, and establishing various measures such as the production responsibility system." However, the content of the production responsibility system mentioned here must be reviewed in conjunction with the concretization of the "measures" in order to be sufficient.

However, the implementation of the production responsibility system does not change the main point of view of the war power enhancement described above. The saying "clearly expressing the national nature of important enterprises in management" is synonymous with the reflection of the aforementioned industrialists. Because for the sake of realizing "mass production," it should first be implemented in the aircraft industry.

Requirements for Enhancing War Power

The requirements for enhancing war power to cope with the decisive battle stage further require the advancement of decisive battle administration. In response to this requirement, in order to thoroughly strengthen the domestic defense situation and to ensure this, the government has decided on the "National Structure Enhancement Measures" with extraordinary determination, and based on this, it plans to transform administrative operations into decisive battle mode. We intend to review the process of the decisive battle administration to date in order to clarify the necessity of this transformation of administrative operations into decisive battle mode.

Development of Production Administration

With the expansion of the war situation, the wartime planned economy has also become increasingly advanced. Based on the will of the state, economic control has been continuously strengthened. However, the responsible officials differ depending on the industrial sector, and this phenomenon also exists within the same sector. For example, materials are related to the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, labor is under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and funds and economic relations are under the Ministry of Finance. The so-called bureaucratic control, where the supervisory departments do not interact with each other, has already exposed the drawbacks of territorialism. Therefore, the economic control that should have ensured planned production has hindered the enhancement of production, deviating from its original intention. Thus, the reform of production administration has long been a pending matter. The control association method based on the Important Industry Group Ordinance is a product of self-criticism of bureaucratic control, and the theory of establishing a Ministry of Military Affairs, which emerged in the private sector at the Central Cooperation Conference of the Great Japan Political Association last autumn, is one of its manifestations.

Moreover, the war situation entered a new stage of continuous and fierce decisive battles in the second half of last year. In order to destroy the total counterattack of the United Kingdom and the United States, rapid and epoch-making production enhancement has become an urgent issue. With the development of this objective situation, production administration also developed rapidly, with the end of last year as an opportunity, and the character of the decisive battle became increasingly strong.

The first was the decision of the Cabinet meeting on November 27 last year to establish a temporary production enhancement committee. The purpose of this measure was to avoid the so-called reform of administrative institutions and to unify industrial administration through artful operation. Secondly, the Wartime Administrative Special Cases Law and the Permission and Approval Temporary Measures Law were also established in the 81st session of the Diet. Furthermore, in the Cabinet meeting on March 18, the special cases of wartime administrative power and the cabinet advisory system, the wartime economic consultation council system, and the administrative inspection envoy system, which are internally and externally related to the two aforementioned laws, were decided, and local administrative consultation councils were also created, adding epoch-making reforms to the operation of production administration.

Due to the above-mentioned wartime administrative emergency legislation, departmentalism has been curbed, and there is no doubt that the momentum of moving towards comprehensive unification of industrial administration has been established. Due to the exercise of the Prime Minister's instruction authority, the past disputes among the responsible government offices regarding production enhancement and the conflicts of opinions among the ministries have been resolved, and the drawbacks of the bureaucratic control that were criticized in the past have also been corrected.

Also. The Wartime Administrative Joint Authority Special Cases clearly stipulate that steel, coal, light metals, aircraft, and ships are the five major key industries (Article 1). The urgent production increase target at the decisive battle stage is clearly declared on the surface. In order to quickly and effectively transform various production factors with certain limitations, such as materials, labor, funds, and power, into war power, it is extremely natural to stop the past method of all-round - and thus also scattered - production expansion, and the emphasis on key production has therefore been significantly emphasized.

On the other hand, the cabinet advisory system mobilizes the knowledge and experience of private sector experts to enhance the production of the five major key industries; the advisors' insights and research will be used as various policies of the government. As for the inspection system, State Minister Suzuki's investigation of the iron and steel industry in the Kyoto area in May, Cabinet Advisor Fujiwara's investigation of the iron and steel industry and coal mining industry in the Northeast and Hokkaido regions in July, and Advisor Fujiwara's investigation of the aviation aircraft industry in late September have been conducted on-site three times, examining how material mobilization plans and other important policies penetrate lower-level organizations and are concretized, as well as discovering where production bottlenecks exist. Based on the principle of on-site decision-making, it has achieved great results in reforming production administration and grasping the actual situation of production. In particular, Advisor Fujiwara's inspection has shown his many years of experience and capabilities in the private sector, and has achieved achievements in many aspects, such as opening up production bottlenecks, improving production efficiency, and changing production conditions, and in the renovation of production technology.

Fundamental Reform of Production Administration

In response to key production, the Cooperation Council for the private sector cooperation system was established. As everyone knows, aircraft and shipbuilding are comprehensive industries, and they can only develop smoothly on the basis of expanding and arranging all related industries such as parts and raw materials. Moreover, if raw material departments such as steel, coal, and light metals cannot reliably obtain materials and equipment, it is difficult to hope for rapid production increase. Therefore, the premise of production enhancement centered on the five major key industries is naturally organic cooperation with related industries. In this sense, the Army Aviation Industry Association was established in the aircraft industry in November last year, establishing a cooperation system that comprehensively manages aircraft, engines, equipment, materials, and parts. As for the other four major key industries of steel, coal, light metals, and ships, the "Cooperation Council" composed of closely related industries was organized on March 25 through the mediation of the "Key Production Association", with the control associations of the four industries as the core. The controlling organizations of each cooperating industry also concluded a supply agreement for products with the controlling organizations of the key industries, completing the system for cooperation to promote key production.

In order to complete the production enhancement of the above-mentioned key military supplies, the improvement of production administration and the corresponding private sector cooperation system are gradually being arranged, but it cannot be said that this is all that is required to meet the decisive battle characterization of production administration required at the decisive battle stage. As explained in the above paragraphs, the adjustment of related industries for the sake of completing ultra-key production is a major problem. Vehicles, machine tools for aircraft, etc., can certainly adapt to actual needs and decide on measures based on the five major key industries, but if production administration is not fundamentally reformed, or if the guidance of the war economy is not thoroughly reviewed, then the key industries that are expanded to meet actual needs will inevitably become an "added budget" type of addition, thereby reducing the significance of key production, and there is a great risk of falling back into a list-like, planar production enhancement method.

Therefore, establishing a true ultra-key production system and fundamentally reforming the production administration that promotes this system is essential. Therefore, due to the decision on the "National Structure Enhancement Measures," we have reached an epoch-making stage. (From "Allied World Report," Volume 24, Issue 4)

### Grain Control Committee Actively Deploys Rice Purchase Work and Establishes Offices in Various Regions

Central News Agency dispatch: In order to actively carry out the work of purchasing rice, the Rice Control Committee, since its establishment, has designated major rice-producing areas in accordance with the outline, established local rice purchasing trade associations, registered and reviewed local purchasing merchants with rich experience in grain as preparatory committee members. They are responsible for organizing the association and centralizing the unified purchase of rice. In addition to convening a general meeting of the preparatory committee members on the 19th of this month, explaining the meaning of this mission to control rice and instructing them to cooperate in purchasing rice steps, in order to strengthen the organization and expand the task of guiding rice purchases, it has specially divided areas in Wuhu, Yikou, Taixian, Yangzhou, Songjiang, Kunshan, Changshu, Suzhou, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Zhoushi, Changzhou, Danyang, Jintan, Tongzhou, Nanjing, Huzhou, Yixing, Wuxi, and Zhenjiang and other 20 districts, established offices and appointed directors and deputy directors to supervise local purchasing merchants to purchase rice, and handle rice movement certificates and facilitate them, and forward the application for issuing rice transportation passports and other matters. It is learned that the association recently convened a meeting of directors and deputy directors of local offices to discuss and instruct the future rice purchase policy and the tasks that should be urged and promoted. The directors and deputy directors of the various local offices have gone to various districts to actively prepare for the establishment of their offices.

### Implementation Guidelines for Rice Purchase in Three Provinces

The Rice Control Committee is actively carrying out the work of purchasing rice. Its related matters are implemented in accordance with the "Outline of the Rice Purchase Plan for Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces in the 32nd Year of the Republic of China" decided by the Materials Control Review Committee. The implementation guidelines are formulated as follows:

Purchase Subordinate Organizations

When implementing the purchase, the main japonica rice producing areas and the main indica rice producing areas are separated. The former is called Area A, and the latter is called Area B. The lower-level organizations of the Rice Control Committee are separately formed by those responsible for purchasing in Area A and those responsible for purchasing in Area B. The lower-level organization responsible for purchasing by the Japanese side mainly uses the organization of the Central China Rice Grain Purchase Association, and the lower-level organization responsible for purchasing by the Chinese side is composed of rice merchants and uses their powerful trade associations. The Grain Control Committee is responsible for implementing the purchase under the control of the Commercial Control Committee, so it must guide and supervise its lower-level organizations so that all purchased rice is uniformly distributed by the Grain Control Committee in accordance with the Outline of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Rice Purchase Plan.

Quantity Collected in Area A

Collection guidelines for Area A: The rice collection organization, the Japanese Central China Rice Grain Purchase Association, must be quickly formed, and the Chinese purchasing organization must be quickly prepared. Both will start purchasing on September 20. It is expected that the amount collected in each area is 310,000 tons in the area governed by the Jiangsu Provincial Government and 40,000 tons in the area governed by the Zhejiang Provincial Government. As for the collection method, necessary registration and movement control are implemented in Area A. In the clearing areas implemented in the area, the main method is to adopt a quota system, and other areas will adopt a purchase system.

Quantity Collected in Area B

Collection Organization: Area B is responsible for collection by the Chinese Rice Grain Trade Association. It is expected that the collection area will include five areas in northern Anhui, southern Anhui, Nanjing, Suzhou, and Huzhou, collecting a total of 280,000 tons. Collection Method: Area B implements movement control. In principle, it is registered, and a purchase system is implemented for collection. In order to implement these two items, it is sequentially submitted to the government for promulgation of corresponding control regulations, and the local administrative organs are ordered to assist the collection in terms of promoting and guarding related controls.

Purchase Price Determination

It has been decided by the Grain Control Committee. Based on the variety and other conditions for determining the price, such as the balance of important agricultural products, the necessary procedures shall be followed. Once the price is determined, it will not be changed in principle for one year. The distribution price is calculated based on the purchase price, etc., and the necessary procedures are followed, and it is decided by the Central Grain Control Committee.

Preparation of Purchase Funds

In principle, the purchase funds are prepared by the purchasing operators of the lower-level organizations themselves. When necessary, the Chinese and Japanese sides will issue a group, and in accordance with the plan of the Grain Control Committee, lend to the purchasing operator groups.

Acceptance, Transportation, and Exchange

The acceptance and delivery of rice shall be implemented at the main points in the collection area in principle. The acceptance of military rice shall be assisted by the military procurement organization. A meticulous plan shall be formulated for transportation, and close contact shall be made with the relevant organizations. The exchange of materials is planned by the Grain Control Committee, and the association will pay it in accordance with the separately stipulated methods.

### Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School Cultivates Talent for the Deaf and Mute

Hard struggle

The upper-level organization of the Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School is the board of directors, which is the same as the Shanghai Blind Children's School. Mr. Wang Shuxian, who is enthusiastic about charity, especially the education of disabled children, serves as the chairman of the board. Principal Wang also serves as the director of education, with a total of six full-time teachers, four women and two men. Two of them are deaf-mutes, and the rest are healthy and familiar young people. They have all received special normal school education and training, are rich in educational experience, especially sympathize with the deaf-mutes, and are willing to sacrifice themselves and take the education of deaf-mute children as a lifelong career. Seeing their warm and eager attitude towards teaching children, I can't help but feel a sense of admiration and gratitude.

Although the history of Fu Deaf-Mute School is not very long, due to the hard work and serious work of leaders and teachers, it has shown considerable brilliant achievements in the past ten years. According to Principal Wang, the school has graduated approximately 300 students in the past. At least 60% of them have obtained a job and are happy in their job. The remaining 30% have gone on to further education or specialized in art. Before the war, such as the Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and the world's various book printing houses, all had graduates from the school working there. Especially those serving in the studio of famous engraving master Xiaojiang. It is said that Mr. Wang Mingchuan, who is now the deputy director of the Art Department of China United Film Company, also created a lot of advertising paintings. There are also many graduates who are committed to promoting deaf-mute education. Hu Huiqing and Lu Yinglian are in the alma mater. Jiang Jinxiu is in the Hankou Deaf-Mute School, and there are also many in the various deaf-mute schools in Shanghai. Among them, Li Shiqing, the principal of Guangzhen Deaf-Mute School and the director of academic affairs of Zhonghua Deaf-Mute School, and Chen Zugeng of Huxi Deaf-Mute School, are particularly outstanding people, and Principal Han constantly praises them.

It is precisely because of the educational achievements of Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School that not only ordinary people in this city send their deaf-mute children to study, but also students from other places have heard the news with joy and come from afar. Especially because it tries its best to arrange for deaf-mute children who are suffering and helpless, and also bears the cost of their food and clothing, and nurtures them to become useful talents in society. Therefore, various charity organizations have sent deaf-mute children to request education. There are now six children from the Charity Organization Joint Disaster Relief Zeng Yangji Yuan, two from the Xinde Society, two from the Children's Protection Association, and those sent by the Children's Protection Section of the First District Government. It can be seen the extent to which the school is needed by society.

Future prospects

According to the survey statistics of Fu Deaf-Mute School, there are about 100 deaf-mutes per 100,000 people in China. With a population of 400 million, there are 400,000 people, of which at least 100,000 are school-age children. However, there are only 20 deaf-mute schools in the country, and there are no more than 100 specialized teachers. The number of deaf and dumb students is less than 1,000. It can be seen that more than 90% of deaf and mute school-age children are still out of school, and the lack of teachers is even more needless to say. This is such a serious phenomenon. Shanghai is the most developed place for deaf-mute education in the country. The number of schools accounts for one-third of the country's total, reaching as many as seven, but most of them are very small in scale, and the number of students enrolled is small, only a dozen or dozens of people. The larger ones are only dozens of people. It goes without saying that it is not enough to meet the actual needs of society. Moreover, like the Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School, which has a certain scale and achievements, it is still in extreme difficulty. There is no way to develop.

Shanghai Fu Deaf-Mute School has no special funds. All expenditures depend on the income from tuition fees. The former Public Works Bureau provided a slight subsidy every year, but it was far from enough. It only relied on donations from the school board and enthusiastic people, but the school has never advocated raising donations from outside on a large scale. Therefore, it is always in financial straits. The school's application to the Shanghai Bu Bing Charity Relief Association for a subsidy stated its plight: "... There is no way to raise funds, and all avenues have been exhausted. It has been operating in a miserable state for seventeen years. If it is allowed to stagnate, then the past efforts will all be in vain, and deaf-mute children will all lose their education? Submersion is unbearable." Committee member Li Wenjie of the association went to investigate and confirmed that it was true. Later, the regular meeting decided to subsidize 3,000 yuan at a time. The school's expenses were originally not that large. The monthly salary of teachers and staff did not exceed 200 yuan. They had two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, and ate vegetarian food all year round. They were so poor that they were extremely poor. However, because they were teaching deaf-mute children, and because deaf-mute education required more equipment than ordinary education, the economic difficulties continued to increase. Principal Zhuo showed the school's budget for the semester from August of this year to January of next year. The income, including tuition fees, miscellaneous fees, accommodation fees, meal fees, and the 3,500 yuan subsidy from the First District Government, totaled 34,700 yuan. The expenditures, including water and electricity, rent, house donations, salaries, educational supplies fees, repairs, miscellaneous fees, additions, and meal fees, totaled 88,100 yuan (of which salaries were 8,040 yuan). The shortfall was as high as 53,400 yuan. This is something that needs to be helped by particularly enthusiastic people in society. According to Principal Wang, the school has three hopes: Raise funds, increase the number of free places, and provide relief for homeless people to create. Because deaf-mutes have no problems with their eyes and hands and have the conditions to work, they only need basic knowledge training to become useful talents for society and the country. It is not easy for deaf-mute children to understand when reading. They must be guided in many ways with facts and objects before they can slowly understand. Therefore, the school hopes to purchase specimens and instruments with the help of society, and then establish a library and research room to help teachers and students study. The school originally had a vocational department to train specialized technical talents. If society provides powerful assistance, even sewing machines needed for sewing courses can be purchased, so that they can be restored and expanded in a short period of time, and deaf-mute work laboratories can be added, and even factories can be created to increase productivity, eliminate deaf-mute illiteracy, and use human power to make up for natural defects, and can actively turn society into meaningful things for profiteers.

Economic Circle - Comments

### Economic Blood Vessels

If finance can be likened to the blood of the economy, then transportation can undoubtedly be likened to the blood vessels of the economy. The function of blood vessels is to circulate blood in the human body. Otherwise, even if there is enough blood, it will not help the health of the human body. Whether the wartime economic system is sound or not depends not only on the existence of financial regulation, but also on the strength of transportation capacity. For example, to increase production, the problem of raw materials for production must be solved first. May I ask, if there are raw materials but no transportation, how can raw materials be transformed into finished products? To strengthen distribution, the source of materials must be solved first; May I ask, if there are materials but no transportation, how can materials meet the needs of consumers? In short, strengthening the transportation mechanism is the basic work to solve production and distribution. Otherwise, even if cotton is collected, it will still not restore the factory's vitality; even if rice and grain are collected, it will still not solve the hunger of the people. Then, wouldn't everything be empty words that do not help the facts?

However, "if a worker wants to do his job well, he must first sharpen his tools." If there is no sufficient transportation equipment to strengthen transportation, then transportation cannot be strengthened. Therefore, we once advocated large-scale shipbuilding and dredging of waterways to form a circular transportation dynamic from wooden boats to factories and from factories to wooden boats, so as to solve the two problems of exchanging materials and increasing production. Recently, Guangzhou, in response to shipbuilding in mainland Japan, is using local materials to build machine sailboats. The first and second ships have been launched, the third ship is under construction, and the fourth and fifth ships are being prepared for construction. This kind of continuous effort to use local materials to increase transportation equipment is really worthy of emulation by economic figures in Central China, especially the promotion of transportation and industrial authorities, in order to connect our economic blood vessels.

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee Promulgates Regulations for the Movement of Flour Bran

The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee has been handling the unified purchase and centralized distribution. There are some ambiguities regarding the method of movement and the certificate. Recently, the Flour and Wheat Transfer Committee has promulgated three regulations. The main points are as follows: For local movement, less than ten bags require a certificate from the local Sino-Japanese Trade Association or other office; For ten bags or more, in addition to the stipulated procedures, a certificate from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee's office is also required. For movement between regions, it is necessary to have the necessary personnel from the local Flour and Wheat Special Committee's office and the Grain Bureau. In addition to the prescribed regulations, it is also necessary to have a permit from the Materials Permit Office.

### Tianjin Hot Money Flows to Shanghai - Authorities Seek to Suppress

Tianjin in North China is equivalent to Shanghai in Central China. In the past, it was the only port for foreign trade. Commerce was prosperous and hot money was abundant. Since the outbreak of the Pacific War and the recovery of the Tianjin Concessions, the hot money that used to specialize in speculation and hoarding in the concession areas has gradually lost its room for activity under the strict control of the authorities. Up to now, Tianjin is managing the market and strictly prohibiting accumulation and restricting the free buying and selling of various major commodities, which is even stricter than Shanghai. Therefore, a large amount of hot money has nowhere to escape. In general, investors have to find ways to open up avenues for themselves to survive. Therefore, recently, Tianjin's hot money has been flowing to Shanghai, but detailed figures cannot be statistically determined. It is understood that relevant parties believe that the large-scale southward movement of Tianjin's hot money will have some impact on Shanghai's finance in the future.

### The Interior Pan Meeting at the End of the Month Changed to Today

Money supply gradually relaxes, various industries are at peace

The end of the month for Shanghai's industrial and commercial sectors is approaching in an instant. For the remittance and exchange of long-term credit loans from money shops, they have already contacted each other separately. For those business firms with good credit, each remittance and exchange shop, in order to regulate finance, has made appropriate accommodations to extend the term. The Shanghai Money Industry Association originally scheduled to hold a meeting for the internal pan at the end of the month yesterday (25th) (to decide the market price for the internal pan at the end of the month). It is now understood that the association has temporarily decided to convene a special meeting at 3 pm today (26th) to be particularly cautious and on the one hand, promote speculation and hoarding. Regarding the joint bank reserve, the colleagues will continue to handle it today. All member banks and shops may provide property as collateral and apply to the association's treasury for short-term cash loans due to legitimate business needs. After each bank and shop makes adjustments, they will fully maintain the legitimate development of various industries and remain stable. The money supply is even more relaxed than before. The interest rate on short-term loans is continued at 0.2 points, and the listed price is 1.2 points. Various industries should be able to get through this period safely.

### Paper Money and Aluminum Paper Association Holds Inaugural Meeting

The department is currently working with relevant personnel to secretly formulate the price, and it is expected to be announced soon. The cotton collection work for this year will also be launched on a large scale.

### Current Problems of the Commerce Control Council

Since its establishment on March 16th, the Commerce Control Council has been in operation for seven months, actually controlling materials, establishing an autonomous control system for the Chinese economy, and gradually promoting all its work. The nature of the Commerce Control Council itself, its operational direction, and the necessity of further developing its advanced functions, along with its future trends, are all subjects of general public attention. Here is an overview of the various issues facing the Commerce Control Council.

Progress Since Establishment

The Commerce Control Council was born with the character of an autonomous material control organization. Its greatest goal is to suppress and stabilize material prices, stabilize people's livelihoods, enhance war power, and realize economic cooperation between China and Japan. However, recently some people have been critical of the Commerce Control Council. The main criticisms are as follows: Shortcomings of the Commerce Control Council itself. Insufficient cooperation from businesspeople. The relationship between the Commerce Control Council and relevant authorities. These will be elaborated below: Shortcomings of the Commerce Control Council itself

The first problem is that the material control business of the Commerce Control Council has been transitioning from a free economy to a controlled economy for seven months. If everyone truly understood the current situation of the Chinese economy, they would understand the difficulties in implementing a controlled economy. As for the improvement of the organization, there has been an emphasis on establishing purchasing organizations for other important materials midway. Therefore, some people criticize the Commerce Control Council for focusing too much on organizational form and not considering the feasibility of the current Chinese economic organization and the controlled economy. At the same time, it is necessary to know that its promotion involves politics, and this point should be given special consideration.

Insufficient Cooperation from Businesspeople

The second problem is that some Commerce Control Council offices handle material transfers, import and export permits, and controlled purchasing and distribution of materials, which is no different from the re-emergence of a free economy. Therefore, some businesspeople are unwilling to cooperate with this policy.

This has become a cause for encouraging speculation and hoarding. National capital cannot be used to secure materials and enhance production, but instead becomes a way to buy up materials.

To resolve this focal point, the internal mechanisms of the association must be reformed internally. The last time the Commerce Control Council was reformed, the method of opening this focal point was indirectly a plan to promote cooperation.

Relationship with Relevant Authorities

The Commerce Control Council's transfer to the Executive Yuan is of great significance. The Executive Yuan decides on policies, and the Commerce Control Council promotes them. This avoids the multi-faceted supervision of the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Food and clarifies the functions and supervision system. However, this is only a partial countermeasure, so the problem in the future is to allow the Commerce Control Council to fully operate.

Influential people expressed their opinions on this, believing that although the first point has the character of an autonomous organization, all business related to material control cannot be promoted. Second, we should establish a system where national capital can be guided through the Commerce Control Council. Third, there is a lack of comprehensive economic policies.

New Directions for the Future

If the above-mentioned issues cannot be fundamentally resolved, then the rational operation of the Commerce Control Council cannot be expected to improve further than it is now, so the authorities should work on it.

This month, the Commerce Control Council reorganized the Cotton Professional Committee and established a Cotton Department. All cotton textile business is handled by this department in drafting plans. This can be taken as an example of internal organizational reform activities. In addition, the recent change of industry ministers by the National Government can be expected to have a great impact on future operations. From this perspective, the relationship between the Commerce Control Council and the National Government will become closer. Therefore, the Commerce Control Council has now emerged from its initial stage and entered the second stage of achieving its true goals.

### Autumn Scenery in the Old Capital - The Activity of Athletes

Autumn breeze is a good time for people to be energetic and struggle. In ancient China, autumn was often the time for military expeditions. Even the literary examinations were scheduled in the fall. Modern people also use autumn for gatherings. This year, the weather in Beijing in autumn is particularly good, so there are many opportunities for athletes to show their skills. Already opened is the autumn sports meet of national universities on October 18, which is organized by the General Association of Life Committees of National Colleges and Universities. Participants include Peking University: Liberal Arts, Science, Law, Agriculture, Engineering, six colleges, Normal University and male and female middle school attachments, elementary school attachments, and Foreign Languages ​​College, and specialized schools. Visitors include Chairman Wang's representative, Zhang Zhongzhi, Director of Political Affairs Office, Su Tiren from the Education Office, Wang Xun, Director of the Canteen and representatives from various agencies, tens of thousands of people, an extremely grand event. In addition to some physical performances, the overall champion of the track and field events for both men and women is Normal University. It is a pity that there are no record-breaking achievements. Is it because of insufficient nutrition? The autumn review of the Security Army is being planned. It is said that "the schedule of the review has been drafted, and other preparations have been completed, and the event is expected to begin this month." In addition, the preparatory work for the New People's Society's Joint Council has "decided to hold a grand event at the Huai Ren Hall in Zhongnanhai, Beijing from the 26th to the 30th of this month, gathering representatives of 100 million people in North China." Most noteworthy is that this time the entire joint meeting will gather 15,000 young people from various parts of North China to hold a grand review. These are all noteworthy wartime autumn maneuvers.

Agricultural Experimental Field

Going from Beijing out the Xizhimen to Longevity Hill, there is a dignified ancient road, although it has now been paved with asphalt and has become a modern road, the old cypresses and willows on both sides can really evoke the feeling of "ancient road in the setting sun". On the first Double Tenth Festival after the war, the autumn was clear and the weather was particularly mild. The reporter went to the outskirts to visit the old sites. Unintentionally, midway between Xizhimen and Longevity Hill, he saw a very modern building with the national flags of China and Japan erected high on the roof. This building turned out to be the newly completed North China Agricultural Experiment Field.

The North China Agricultural Experiment Field is an institution that began to be established in April of the 27th year (1938). It was originally called the Central Agricultural Experiment Field, and was renamed the North China Agricultural Experiment Field in June of the 29th year (1940). The director is Mr. Akimoto. The original location was the old site of the National University at Taiping Lake. Later, because the site was too small, construction of a new site in the western suburbs began in the 28th year (1939). First, a training department for technicians was established at the new site, and then it moved into the section that was completed. Now it is fully completed and the entire institution has moved in.

The North China Agricultural Experiment Field has seven departments, including the Cultivation Department, the Agricultural and Forestry Chemistry Department, the Disease and Insect Department, the Agricultural Water Conservancy Department, the Forestry Department, the Animal Husbandry Department, and the Livestock Epidemic Prevention Department. It also has a secretary, documents, and accounting sections. In addition, an agricultural technology training department has been opened, specializing in training agricultural technicians. The students are all junior high school graduates, and after two years of training, they are considered graduates. There are now five graduating classes, with approximately 500 people.

Outside of Beijing, the North China Agricultural Experiment Field also has fifteen branch fields: Shimen Yunliangcheng, Jinan, Qingdao, and Kaifeng. There is also a branch field in Changli, two experiment fields in Jiqing and Xuzhou, and thirteen original branch groups in Nanyuan, Zhangde Baoding, Handan Chengyang Tangshan Changxian An Zhangdian Linqing Cuiji, Linfen and Xinxiang.

The new building has three floors. The third floor is the auditorium, the second floor is for the various departments, and the first floor is occupied by the three sections and the various departments. In addition to this building, there are also about 11,000 acres of farmland around it, cultivating wheat, millet, sorghum, corn, rice, cotton, hemp and other agricultural products. It is a very large farm. It is said that the North China Agricultural Experiment Field will also hold a ceremony to celebrate the completion of the new building on the 15th of this month to celebrate the formation of this huge economic airport during the war.

### The Imminent Wheat Crop - Increased Production Work

— Yang

These past few days are the period when the rice harvest is about to end and the wheat sowing is about to begin. When crops are harvested, their control should be strengthened to ensure reasonable supply and demand and appropriate distribution. When crops are sown, technology should be guided to improve quality and increase production. Recently, many papers on the control of rice and grain have been seen, and discussions on increasing wheat production seem to be further developed.

Wheat, as an autumn-sown crop, has the same importance as rice in the food problem. Especially today when there is a shortage of rice, the position of wheat is increasing day by day. Take the food for the citizens of Shanghai, for example, if there is no distribution of household flour, the severity of the situation will be several times greater than it is today.

The area from Changzhou to the east on the Jinghu Line is mainly focused on the production of japonica rice, and there is very little wheat cultivation. However, northern Jiangsu, southern Anhui, the vicinity of Zhenjiang, east of Hankou, and along the Nanning Line (Nanjing and Wuhu) are all indica rice areas. Because the harvest of indica rice is very early, wheat is sown as soon as it is harvested. Therefore, the area where wheat is sown is no less than that of rice.

Chinese farmers have reached a fairly sophisticated level in their research on rice cultivation techniques, so it is relatively difficult to see results in rice improvement work. Wheat cultivation, on the other hand, is mostly laissez-faire. As long as a little guidance is given, great results can be achieved. The most important wheat improvement items are listed below.

Promote Improved Varieties of Wheat - The yield is greatly related to the quantity and quality of seeds. Before the Incident, Jinling University developed a wheat variety called 2905, which can increase the yield of wheat by 32% compared to ordinary varieties. Although this variety is now somewhat degraded due to poor preservation, a yield increase rate of more than 20% can still be maintained. Last year, the agricultural improvement zones established by the Ministry of Industry in various places mainly focused on promoting 2905 wheat, distributing it to farmers for free, and achieving considerable results. Wheat is about to be sown now. Local government agencies should urgently find ways to obtain a large amount of 2905 wheat and promote it to farmers. Inquiries about this variety can be made to the Production Increase Department of the Ministry of Food, where it may be available.

Warm Water Seed Soaking - The most serious disease of wheat is smut, and its loss is equivalent to the rice stem borer or locust plague. Diseased wheat grains have a thin membrane on the outside and black powder inside. The method of preventing this disease is very simple. Before sowing, the seeds must be disinfected by soaking them in warm water. The method is to prepare two large buckets, one filled with hot water at 49 degrees Celsius (120 degrees Fahrenheit) and the other filled with hot water at 56 degrees Celsius (132 degrees Fahrenheit), and the immersion bucket. Then, put the seeds into a bamboo basket, first soak them in the warm bucket, and wait for all the seeds to be warm before soaking them in the immersion bucket. After five minutes, take them out and pour in a large amount of water to cool them quickly, then sow them, or dry them in the shade and store them for later use. If salt water is used to soak the seeds before warm water soaking to eliminate inferior varieties that float on the surface and select full-grained, good varieties, the effect will be even better. Guide Strip Sowing - Farmers in the Jinghu area mostly use broadcasting method to sow wheat, which is extremely inconvenient for inter-cultivation, weeding, and fertilization, resulting in a great impact on yield and wasting fertilizer (ordinary strip sowers apply one burden of fertilizer per acre each time, while broadcasters need one burden per acre). Therefore, it is urgent to guide them to use strip sowing. However, strip sowing takes more time when sowing, and farmers, accustomed to old habits, are unwilling to listen, so additional guidance is needed.

Popularize Fertilizers - Fertilizer is an important element for increasing production. Nowadays, farmers are either because of costs, or because of strength, which is a cause for concern. We must pay attention to persuasion. The self-sufficient fertilizers for wheat cultivation include compost and manure. Each acre requires about ten担 of compost, and one cow can produce one hundred担 of compost per year, which is enough for ten acres of wheat field. Manure from livestock such as chickens, ducks, and sheep, as well as human manure, are also the best fertilizers for wheat cultivation. Each person excretes about one and a half担 of manure per year, which can be used for one acre of wheat field for one fertilization. As for chemical fertilizers, the manufacturing and popularization of phosphate fertilizers is an urgent need. Because ammonium sulfate requires extremely large capital, production cannot be increased arbitrarily. Phosphate fertilizer raw materials can be obtained from animal bones, which is more convenient. However, its manufacture and promotion depend on the research of experts and the guidance of the government.

The above four points are the most urgent and simplest methods for wheat production. As long as there is a right to implement the determination and to mobilize, the results can be seen immediately. Now, wheat in various places will be sown in its entirety within this month. Those who are concerned about the food problem, please pay attention to this.

### The Distress of Trade Associations

— Shui Zhaoxiong

From the perspective of time, location, and scope, trade associations are indeed insignificant. But the mission they bear is very important. It is a large family of members, a collection of the same industry. All the pains felt by member manufacturers, an excellent trade association, is to communicate unanimously. To say it again, the distress of member manufacturers is the distress of trade associations.

What distress do trade associations have these days? That is, they are mostly busy with "creating something out of nothing" all day long. As Shanghai Special Municipal Government No. 12185 promulgated, "Items are also often difficult to be detained by the medical staff, which is not right." Because this kind of thing is inevitable, the trade association has to be busy with negotiations, and one person is not enough, so two people go together. Sometimes they even have to bring in acquaintances to say something. For one thing, repeated official documents, sent in separate ways, waiting for a reply, or sending personnel again, or signing and presenting again. And the members whose goods are detained, either by telephone, or in person, wait anxiously all day long, hoping for a solution. Sometimes the goods that are detained have been taken out from one place, but unfortunately they are stopped by another place. Back and forth like this, negotiating, saying various things, so that the entire association is busy with this kind of "creating something out of nothing" thing. Although it may be due to the difficulty of the medical staff in identifying controlled items at one time, and the authorities have announced that they must not be detained for any reason, and they hope that the situation will improve, but in the eyes of others, they always think that the people who run the association are somewhat "self-disturbing". Who has ever known.

In all cases, there is inevitably a situation of being detained. The negotiation of trade associations is like jumping over hurdles, and the staff of the trade unions are like athletes jumping over hurdles. We are constantly jumping over hurdles, just to achieve a complete record. We don't expect that there will be no obstacles, and we also hope that each obstacle is not too high or too big. Similarly, we talk about business in business. For politics, we dare not over-expect, we only hope to do as Confucius said, "Politics is righteousness." To be more detailed, the hope of general manufacturers is as pointed out by Eiichi Shibusawa, the highest leader in the Japanese financial world during the Meiji, Taisho, and Showa periods: "Politics is neither power nor force. Politics obviously cannot but be morality. This is the foundation of politics." Standing on the position of industry and commerce that is not partisan, what the trade association hopes for is the combination of politics and morality, which can also be said to be the political concept of the industrial and commercial class.

### China Health Association Promotes - Eliminating Sources of Disease and Preventing Contagion

The China Health Association, for the purpose of raising funds for the relief of the poor and sick, organized a charity swimming competition, which was held at Taishan Road Lanqi the day before yesterday afternoon. Regarding the implementation of sports, it has been decided to handle the following inspection cases: Starting next month, the city's health and wellness campaign will be launched, starting with X-ray prevention of tuberculosis examination, with a total number of 10,000 people. The free examination will be given away starting next month by the Xin Shen Er Bao Social Service Department, Doctors' Association, and donors this time, in order to popularize it. Once a lung disease is discovered during the examination, compression therapy will be implemented in order to eliminate the focus of the disease, early treatment, so as to avoid contagion and spread. No fees will be charged, with a total number of 300 to 500 people. The significance of this health check and free treatment is to eliminate the existence of latent diseases in society, to achieve early treatment and early recovery and to engage in production and stabilize the social economy. Assuming that this time can achieve saving 300 to 500 people with early treatment, otherwise, if treatment is started only after the illness is serious, it will cost 30,000 yuan per person. The intangible savings in medical expenses have reached more than ten million yuan, and it will be able to engage in productivity earlier and avoid intangible contagion, and the harvest will be ten or one hundred times this number. The total amount of donations this time has reached 45,000 yuan, but it is still 150,000 yuan short of the goal. I hope that people from all walks of life will attach importance to the importance of this kind of active public health care and medical care and help to promote it, donating generously, one thousand yuan can save a life, and at the same time stabilize their family life, so that they will not be trapped by poverty and disease. There is nothing better than this for benefiting people. Donations are still collected by the Social Service Department of this newspaper until the end of the month.

### Four Days of Charity Sale for School Aid

— Wang Shouzhong

Day 1

October 2nd, Saturday

At 2:30, our team set off. At first, no one was willing to take the signs, buckets, or carry flower bags. They complained that these were too crude. The sign was like Lu Ju's shield in "Walking Mai City," the bucket looked like the Taoist bucket carried by street singers, and the bag? Like the yellow soul-calling bag of Song Jiang, who killed his daughter-in-law while sitting upstairs. Alas, who would want to take these things? Sure enough, no one was willing to do it. In the end, it was thanks to the children sent by Jiande Primary School who helped.

When we arrived on the road, we divided into groups and went to the designated areas to sell. As soon as our group of four arrived at the destination, a gentleman riding a bicycle stopped and waved two flowers at us. We all grinned, overjoyed. The first sale was not bad, but then the second gentleman gave us a hard time. He took a flower and gave us ten yuan. When the money was put into the bucket, he asked us to give him change. How could we give change when the money was in the bucket? In the end, he taught us a lesson and took two flowers to settle the matter.

Day 2

October 3rd, Sunday, around 9:00 am. Our group of three appeared at the entrance of the Great Shanghai Grand Theatre. We tried to sell to three people, two gentlemen in suits and a modern girl, but unfortunately, we were all rejected. In disappointment, we left the Great Shanghai and came to a corner of the Four Great Companies. We spent a lot of effort, humbly and smiling, calling "Sir" many times, but the results were not as good as yesterday. In fact, this was within our expectations. We were not disappointed, because most of the people who come and go on the road in the morning are diligent people who have a certain mission to use their free time. After all, there are few people who go to the early morning movie. To take a step back, the gentlemen who stroll on the road or go to the early morning movie are not generous. Being glared at by three people in the Great Shanghai is a precedent.

### Cotton Textile Guild Publication - Charity Sale for School Aid

Shanghai Special City Factory Industry Guild is the most active and vibrant group among the trade associations. Since its establishment, the association has been publishing a monthly magazine to enrich the intellectual interests of its members. The fifth issue has now been published, and the content has been increased compared to the previous issues. In addition to being read by branch members, the association has specially allocated 1,000 copies of the newspaper to be sold on consignment by this newspaper. The proceeds from the sale will be used as teaching and medical funds for this newspaper. If people from all walks of life need to purchase it for reference, they can purchase it at the consignment sales department of this newspaper for five yuan each.

### Unemployment Relief Group - Promoting Work

The Mutual Aid Unemployment Relief Group was founded by Wu Ping and Yao Yi. Private funds are accumulated to purchase daily necessities and redistribute them to unemployed members to sell. All profits are earned by the salespeople. The funds are temporarily 200,000 yuan, which is entirely the responsibility of the founder, Mr. Wu Ping, and no donations are solicited from the outside world. Currently, the group has twelve members who have begun selling daily necessities. The purpose of this work is to reduce the suffering of unemployed people. We hope that people from all walks of life will help the members of the group with support, develop human mutual assistance, and it is heard that the group will also hold auxiliary hidden poverty work. For details, please write to the group's office at 626 Yuqiaqing Road or inquire at the Social Service Department of this newspaper.

### Charity Sale of Calligraphy and Paintings - Relieving Hidden Poverty

After reading the column on the 20th of this month, there is a story about saving the poor teacher Fan. A hidden name, because his friend Yu is suffering from the same poverty and disease, plans to sell a Tang Dynasty painting from his family collection for 8,000 yuan. The proceeds from the sale will be used to donate one-quarter to Teacher Fan, and the rest will be donated to Mr. Yu. After reading it, I deeply sympathize.

Because my friend Bao is in a difficult situation, which is comparable to that of Fan and Yu. I feel even more pity. I want to provide assistance, but I am limited by my finances and unable to do so. Later, I found a way to obtain an ancient Kangxi script from my friend, totaling 40 volumes (Guangxu seven-year edition, and a large-character six-character four-sentence vertical axis, and four paintings (each character as big as a bucket), which I plan to sell. The minimum price for each item is 1,000 yuan. The proceeds will be divided into three parts, one-quarter to Fan Gui, one-quarter to the book and newspaper school aid fund, and the remaining two-quarters will be used to relieve my friend's needs. I think there are many generous and benevolent people in Shanghai who will bestow Yu to achieve success. If you have any inquiries, please write to Hu Deqin, Room 3, No. 7, Lane 230, Zhaomen Road. (Pang Zongxian)

### The Poor Teacher's Gratitude

Birth, old age, sickness, and death are inevitable stages of life. Loving life and fearing death are human nature. I, however, do not worry or fear death. As for the suffering of illness, I have often pondered why it gathers upon me. I then realized that constitutions have their strengths and weaknesses, and that being too thin makes one susceptible to disease. Now, if I want to strengthen myself, I must rely on medicine. After the Shen Bao published my humble article, on October 14th, an old gentleman came immediately to inquire about my daily life and the details of my illness. Three days later, he came again, investigated thoroughly, and bestowed funds upon me. Upon asking his name, I learned it was Wang. Late at night, a Mr. Zheng, accompanied by his friend, came to my residence with quiet sincerity and diligence. They inquired in detail, and before leaving, they secretly placed banknotes on my desk, truly generous gentlemen. A young man gave me thirty yuan, his face flushed with a sincere apology. I did not slight him for the small amount and thanked him. Mr. Wang braved the rain to come and, on behalf of his friend, gifted me with white yuan, comforting me and saying, "After you recover, my friend is willing to introduce you to a suitable job to increase your income." Mr. Qin from Dongting Mountain gifted me a copy of the Book of Poetry. Mr. Yu not only donated money but also invited his close friend, the great physician Sun Dingyuan, to jointly cover my medical expenses, demonstrating a heart of kindness and treating everyone equally, his benevolence being a cut above the rest. My classmate Shen Chunyan, whom I haven't seen in a long time, saved up his money from quitting smoking and drinking and delivered one hundred and fifty yuan for me to buy medicine. Mr. Zhao Zuli's elder brother, named Hou, is over seventy years old and was an old colleague of mine. After reading the report, he immediately asked his grandson to send five hundred yuan. From the hospital side, Deji sent someone to call the Second Emergency Epidemic

Hospital and sent a letter advising me to go for treatment, waiving all fees. I politely declined because I could not move. A certain lady saved her children's (who are currently ill) medical expenses and donated them to me, her enthusiasm being particularly commendable. Finally, that lady gave me a hundred yuan and a peck of rough rice. Who am I that I receive such attention from warm-hearted people in society? Besides being grateful and never forgetting their great kindness, after recovering from my illness, I will do my best to contribute to beneficial social undertakings to repay the kindness of everyone (Fan Xingshu).

Lecture on Scripture The Gospel Hall of the Shanghai Chinese Christian Independent Church is hosting a Great Scripture Lecture Conference from the 29th of this month to the 21st, with lectures given at Trinity Church on Hankou Road, Jiangxi Road, at 5 PM every afternoon. Prominent pastors have been specially invited to lecture. All are welcome to attend.

Lost Money Found I found some cash on Henan Road on the 25th of this month. I hope the loser will explain the details and claim it. If it is not claimed after three days, it will be sent to a charitable organization (Fan Dilang) Office at No. 701, No. 209 Jiangxi Road, Jingxian Department of the First District Public Office of Shanghai Special Municipality.

Seeking Lost Item At 2 PM on the 24th, I lost a Western-style raincoat inside my seat on the upper floor of the Nanjing Grand Theatre when the movie ended. According to the store in the theater, two people were seen holding the raincoat and claiming to deliver it to the accounting room, but the accounting room said that no one had handed it over. If anyone picked up the raincoat, please deliver it to Mr. Chen in Room of Huiluo Company, No. 98 Nanjing Road, and a reward will be offered.
