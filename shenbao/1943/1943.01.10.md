### Establishing a Wartime Political System

The National Government Should Declare War on Britain and America!

China's declaration of war on Britain and America signifies the end of China's century-long history of colonization, and also explains the full content of Sino-Japanese cooperation and co-existence.

This participation in the war may seem sudden to the people, but the national policy of a country must be supported and obeyed by the people. However, for the sake of the greater future of the nation and the people, and in order to strive for the final victory in this war, our journalistic circles should widely solicit public opinion, and even more so, offer sincere advice to the authorities. We must first reiterate what we pointed out in yesterday's editorial: in the process of implementing the national policy of participating in the war, the government authorities must, first, respect public opinion and adopt arguments; and second, cultivate national strength, especially making good use of national strength. Because any national policy, if it cannot obtain the thorough understanding, automatic and active support of the majority of the people, will definitely not be able to achieve its fulfillment.

We want to solemnly point out that, based on Japan's actual achievements in fighting Britain and America for the past year, and based on the actual needs of Sino-Japanese cooperation at present, we should assert that the focus of China's participation in the war is not military, but political and economic; it is in concentrating and developing the political and economic strength of the whole country to assist Japan in completing the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

Therefore, we the people request the government authorities to demonstrate the demeanor and spirit of great statesmen in extraordinary times, lead by example, and stand on the front line of participating in the war; the wartime spirit must be expressed through their own practice, serving as a model for the people of the whole country. Situations like the Chongqing regime's implementation of conscription, grain requisition, and unified management of materials, where high-ranking officials abused their power to help their relatives and old friends evade responsibility and engage in private gain and corruption, must absolutely not be allowed to repeat themselves in the peace zone. Only in this way can the strength of participating in the war be fully utilized.

After participating in the war, the responsibilities of the Chinese government and people become even greater. However, participation in the war is not limited to slogans and banners, so the government cannot but pay attention to the development of the people's strength. Therefore, we further request the government authorities to imitate Japan's support political system since the Greater East Asia War, and quickly establish a truly representative institution of public opinion. On the one hand, it will serve as a synthesis of genuine civilian power, supporting wartime politics; on the other hand, it will serve as the central organization for the general mobilization of the strength of the people of the whole country. However, in view of the fact that the "National Political Council" under the Chongqing regime is a tool for one family and one party, unable to reflect public opinion and develop the people's strength, the public opinion organs in the peace zone must truly absorb talents from all aspects of the people and establish a complete public opinion organ. Moreover, especially in terms of their duties, they must have the real power to supervise the implementation of government policies and assist in the decision-making and execution of policies. We firmly believe that only when the strength of the people has the opportunity to be fully developed can the national policy be implemented and the highest goal of participating in the war be achieved.

### War Against Britain and the United States: China and Japan Determined to Cooperate to the End; President Wang and the Japanese Ambassador Sign Agreement; Japan Abandons Concessions and Extraterritorial Rights

After the signing, Ambassador Shigemitsu was the first to stand up and deliver a speech, expressing his great satisfaction with the National Government's resolute participation in the war. Then, President Wang replied, elaborating on the National Government's determination to fulfill its responsibility as a member of East Asia and to defeat the common enemy. His tone was solemn, and his words were earnest. The atmosphere was extremely solemn throughout the venue. This ceremony, which will forever leave a glorious page in the history of building East Asia, concluded amidst intense and focused emotions. Subsequently, the entire group exited the auditorium in an orderly fashion and took a brief rest in the VIP room. The attending representatives from both sides shared a toast of champagne, raising their glasses to celebrate the early victory of the Greater East Asia War. The speeches of Ambassador Shigemitsu and President Wang are recorded separately below.

Speech by Ambassador Shigemitsu: On the day that the Government of the Republic of China announced its declaration of war against Britain and the United States, President Wang and I have completed the signing of the "Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration on Cooperation in Completing the War" and the "Agreement between Japan and the Republic of China on the Return of Concessions and the Abolition of Extraterritorial Rights." I am sincerely pleased. This joint declaration, taking the long-awaited participation of the Republic of China in the war as an opportunity, ensures that Japan and China will fully agree on the completion of the war. It can be said that the Empire has announced to the world its firm belief in the final victory in the war with brilliant achievements, and has built an unshakable foundation for the construction of Greater East Asia. I cannot help but share this joy with you. Furthermore, the agreement promises the transfer and abolition of all concessions, extraterritorial rights, etc. held by the Empire in the Republic of China, based on the principle of respecting the sovereignty of the Republic of China. This is a concrete result of the Empire's fundamental policy towards China. I hope that the status of the Republic of China will take a leap upwards from now on, and that it will develop further into the world as a dignified nation. What is hoped is that Japan and China will exert all their strength to cooperate in completing the war, that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will be further enhanced, and that they will achieve a successful conclusion in building Greater East Asia. I would like to briefly express my thoughts as my speech.

President Wang's reply: At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Government of the Republic of China issued a statement, resolving to share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor Japan. For more than a year, we have adhered to this principle and strived without wavering. Today, we are able to further participate in the Greater East Asia War and cooperate with our friendly neighbor Japan to defeat the common enemy, the Anglo-American aggression. The Government of the Republic of China is fulfilling its responsibility as a member of East Asia, and we are overjoyed and moved by the joy and cooperation of the Japanese Empire, which will lead to the realization of my country's Father's Pan-Asianism ideal. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly neighbor Japan has shown unlimited glory in enhancing national power for the benefit of Greater East Asia. The Government of the Republic of China, based on the principle of good neighborliness and friendship, has provided assistance to the best of its ability. Now, in order to strengthen the Government of the Republic of China, it has advanced the implementation of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty and returned concessions and abolished extraterritorial rights, so that the sovereignty of the Republic of China can be complete. The Government and people of the Republic of China will never forget this great friendship. The Government and people of the Republic of China will only encourage themselves to cooperate with our friendly neighbor Japan with the spirit of sharing weal and woe, and jointly completing the Greater East Asia War. Since taking office, Ambassador Shigemitsu has made the best efforts for the overall situation of Greater East Asia and for the diplomatic relations between China and Japan. I am very pleased to be able to sign this joint declaration and agreement with Ambassador today, which has historical and epoch-making significance in East Asia. I sincerely express my best wishes for the enhancement of relations between the two countries and the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

National Government Proclamation

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th of the previous year, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly neighbor Japan. Since then, it has launched the New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding security, improving people's livelihood, and striving to enhance national power to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States continue to use their centuries-old policy of dividing East Asia, and they have intensified their efforts, even colluding with elements in Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians slaughter East Asians. Recently, because their violence has been successively defeated by the friendly Japanese army, navy, and air force, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have increasingly resorted to cunning schemes and are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area, instigating elements in Chongqing to constantly harass and obstruct the progress of reconstruction, and even using their own aircraft, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing willingly accept Anglo-American orders and act as traitors to East Asia, which is shameful. However, the Anglo-Americans' deliberate planning for East Asia, exhausting their ability to provoke and sow discord, in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, is even more something that the East Asian nations should be united against. The National Government hereby proclaims that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will exert all its strength to cooperate with its friendly neighbor Japan to sweep away the tyranny of Britain and the United States in order to seek the restoration of China and the liberation of East Asia. The governments of Manchuria and Thailand have long maintained friendly relations and share the same aspirations for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should further cooperate in order to jointly build a new order in East Asia based on morality. Friendly nations such as Germany and Italy have been dealing with Anglo-American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly achieved glorious victories. Our country's participation in the Greater East Asia War today should echo their efforts, in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All of our citizens should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Pan-Asianism of our Founding Father, the revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the attainment of justice and peace for the entire world, all depend on this. They should be united in mind and purpose, and work hard from beginning to end, in order to fulfill this great mission of this great era.

Capital City Holds a Mass Meeting; Chairman Wang Attends and Delivers an Address

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Since the news of the National Government's official declaration of war against Britain and the United States on the morning of the 9th spread, the entire nation has been filled with unanimous hatred for the enemy, resolutely supporting the National Government's participation in the war, working together to defeat Britain and the United States, jointly seeking China's restoration and the liberation of East Asia. The people of the capital city held a mass meeting of the National Spiritual Mobilization in the capital city at 3:00 PM on the same day in the National Assembly Hall. More than 10,000 representatives of the people from various agencies, organizations, schools, and trade associations in the city attended. The Chairman of the National Government also attended and delivered an address. The heads of various agencies, including Wen Zongyao, Wang Yitang, Chen [missing character] Jun, Gu Zhongchen, Chu Minyi, Chen [missing character], Lin Bosheng, Luo Junqiang, Bao Wen樾, Ren Yuandao, Ye Peng, Xu Suzhou, and Zhou Xuechang, as well as military and police leaders and military attachés of friendly nations such as Japan, Germany, Italy, and Manchuria, etc., totaling several hundred and eighty, were also present. At exactly 3:00 PM, the meeting began in the sound of military music. Chen Weiyi and others were elected as the presidium. After the ceremonial procedures, Chairman Wang delivered a sincere and encouraging address, filled with passion and enthusiasm, which invigorated the entire venue. The entire audience listened respectfully, with applause thundering, expressing their enthusiastic support. Then, Huang Qingzhong, a representative of the presidium, respectfully delivered a dedication. Immediately afterward, everyone shouted slogans and sang the war song in unison. The singing was majestic and filled the entire venue. The National Spiritual Mobilization Mass Meeting in the capital city was declared adjourned amidst passionate shouts.

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Chairman Wang specially attended and delivered an address at the National Spiritual Mobilization Mass Meeting in the capital city yesterday. The main points of the address are recorded below.

Fellow countrymen, today the National Government has announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War, cooperating with our friendly neighbor Japan to defeat the common enemy, the Anglo-American aggressors. For a hundred years, China has experienced many wars. Needless to say, the civil wars were unfortunate, but even the foreign wars were mostly meaningless. Only this war is truly a war for independence and autonomy. As far as China is concerned, for a hundred years, it has been surrounded and invaded by Britain and the United States, and has fallen into a semi-colonial status. Only this war can revive China. As far as East Asia is concerned, for a hundred years, the East Asian nations have been deliberately made by Britain and the United States to be successors to non-Australia and West Asia. In addition to surrounding and invading them, various means of provoking discord, numbing, and enticing have emerged endlessly. If it were not for the independent support of our friendly neighbor Japan, East Asia would no longer be East Asia. Only this war in cooperation with our friendly neighbor Japan can protect East Asia.

Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been widely propagating the slogan of restoring China and defending East Asia for nearly three years. Only today can we gather the national resources to realize the Father of the Nation's painful instructions in the Three Principles of the People and his earnest expectations in Pan-Asianism. We are truly extremely excited.

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly neighbor Japan has won consecutive battles and is now moving forward to ensure victory and complete the war. Our friendly neighbor Japan has repeatedly stated that the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to achieve the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In order to fulfill this statement, it has not hesitated to provide various assistance to China. Now, on the day that China is actually participating in the war, it is returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights in accordance with the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty. We know that for a hundred years, China has been bound by unequal treaties and has fallen into a semi-colonial status. The unequal treaties, with the Treaty of Nanjing and the Treaty of Beijing as their foundation, and the establishment of concessions and the provision of extraterritorial rights, are the greatest content of the unequal treaties. For decades, China has tried its best to break free from the bondage of Britain and the United States, but has never succeeded. Our Father of the Nation's dying will was to abolish the unequal treaties and hope that his comrades who died later would continue to struggle. Only today can these unequal treaties be actually abolished, which is a consolation to our Father of the Nation in heaven and a reward for the years of longing of our 450 million compatriots. From now on, China will be able to cooperate with its East Asian neighbors and friendly nations around the world in an independent and self-reliant position, and contribute to the prosperity of East Asia and the justice and peace of the world. When we recall the past and look forward to the future, we are even more excited.

China's voluntary participation in the war has been recognized since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War as China's due obligation and right as part of East Asia. However, the traitors of East Asia, the elements in Chongqing, and the Anglo-American aggressors, fearing the realization of this, have fabricated various rumors and tried to sabotage it. Today, the facts prove that China's participation in the war is purely voluntary. In order to clarify the position of East Asian comrades, we have made this decision to join the front line of defending East Asia. At the same time, the heart of our friendly neighbor Japan is also very clear. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our friendly neighbor Japan has been at the forefront, destroying the enemy with its own strength. For China, in addition to hoping to understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War and to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity with one heart and one mind, there was no indication of hoping that China would participate in the war. After knowing China's determination to share the same hatred with the enemy, it did not hesitate at all, but readily joined hands with China and stood on a front line to defend East Asia, and fulfilled China's long-cherished wish to abolish unequal treaties, so that Chinese compatriots know that the revival of China and the defense of East Asia are actually one thing. Such a spiritual combination will not only shatter the various rumors of Britain, the United States, and Chongqing, but also show unlimited prospects for the future of East Asian comrades.

Fellow countrymen, from today onwards, we have stepped into the front line of defending East Asia. Each of us must strive to become a fighter for defending East Asia. What we want to struggle against is the shackles that Britain and the United States have imposed on China for a hundred years. What we want to achieve is the coexistence and co-prosperity of the East Asian nations. The spirit of our Father of the Nation in heaven is guiding us. We must move forward with the spirit of diligence, courage, loyalty, and integrity. Now, how heroic and magnificent are the soldiers and people of our friendly neighbor Japan on the front line. How can we be worthy of being their partners, how can we not disgrace them, and how can we not disgrace ourselves? Thinking of this, we must redouble our efforts and move forward hand in hand with the spirit of sharing weal and woe.

Japanese Government Issues Statement: Vigorously Supports China's Reconstruction

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government issued the following statement at 0:30 PM on the 9th: The National Government of the Republic of China has declared war on Britain and the United States today. The reasons for this are clearly stated in the National Government's declaration of war. This is something that the Empire, which has been subjected to the bullying of Britain and the United States for decades, can empathize with. The governments of China and Japan have immediately issued a solemn joint declaration, clarifying their unwavering determination and belief to fully cooperate in military, political, and economic aspects in order to complete the joint war against Britain and the United States. What the Empire expects is to quickly eradicate the root of the disaster that is disrupting East Asia, build a new order in Greater East Asia based on morality, and contribute to the lasting peace of the world. Since returning to the capital, the National Government has long held the same will as the Empire. Today, it is rising up and joining hands with the Empire, standing on a common front to defeat Britain and the United States. At this time, the Empire hopes that the relations between the two countries will achieve an epoch-making development in the fundamental spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation. At the same time, it deeply hopes that China will be able to quickly build a new China based on its own independence and the exertion of the National Government's political power. Therefore, it has decided to withdraw the exclusive concessions of the Empire in the Republic of China, and recognize the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Amoy Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, abolish extraterritorial rights, and provide various good intentions and necessary measures to vigorously support the construction of the new China. Furthermore, in order to adapt to the development of the new Sino-Japanese relations, the existing agreements will also be reconsidered in the same spirit. The cooperation between China and Japan is a natural principle, and Britain and the United States are the common enemies of the two countries. Therefore, the Empire is determined to move forward with the new China on this great road with the united efforts of the whole country, to defeat the enemy with the united determination of China and Japan, to complete the war against Britain and the United States, and to build a new order in Greater East Asia. The Imperial Government hereby declares this belief to China and abroad.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Hideki Tojo issued the following statement at 0:30 PM on the afternoon of the 9th: Today, the National Government of the Republic of China has declared war on Britain and the United States. This can be said to be a further step in the course of defeating Britain and the United States and completing the Greater East Asia War. In order to restore the original appearance of Greater East Asia and to resist Britain and the United States, which despise the hearts of the one billion people of Greater East Asia and attempt to dominate East Asia, the National Government of the Republic of China shares the same will as the Empire and is determined to eradicate the root of the disaster in East Asia for many years, to build a new Greater East Asia, and to contribute to the peace of the world. The Imperial Government hereby expresses its utmost respect to the united and vigorously rising Republic of China under the leadership of Chairman Wang. With the great achievements of the first year of the Greater East Asia War, the Empire has strategically established a foundation for certain victory and invincibility. At the same time, with the cooperation of the one billion people of Greater East Asia and the possession of abundant and important resources that can be immediately transformed into combat power, we will surely achieve victory with the final glory as our goal, both in administrative and strategic terms. Under the current excellent conditions, the cooperation between the Empire and its allied countries in Greater East Asia, such as China, Manchuria, and Thailand, and with its allied countries in Europe, such as Germany and Italy, is becoming increasingly close. By continuing the offensive operations, we will thoroughly strike Britain and the United States, so that they lose their ability to wage war. On the way to the war, we see the new and ambitious appearance of the National Government of the Republic of China today. The Empire has resolutely established a new Sino-Japanese relationship to adapt to the new situation, and hopes that the new China will quickly complete its entire construction. At the same time, as a member of Greater East Asia, it will participate in the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia, which is the great cause of achieving common goals, and will be able to exert its full strength here. The bond of comradeship between China and Japan will surely become closer and closer. Therefore, the Empire has decided to return all exclusive concessions in the Republic of China, recognize the recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession and the Beijing Legation Quarter, and abolish extraterritorial rights, and implement various necessary measures of good intentions in handling enemy property in China. The Empire has always been a country of faith and righteousness, and expresses this friendship to the new China, which is also the friendship that the Empire expresses to its allied countries. It is clear that this kind of friendship will be able to fully declare to China and abroad the future progress of Sino-Japanese relations, which is something that the Empire can deeply boast of. The method of making Britain and the United States give up their war intentions should be to make the unity of Japan and Manchuria, which has a ten-year history, even more solid, and to make the cooperation between the friendly countries of Greater East Asia, the Republic of China, Thailand, and the friendly countries of Europe, Germany, Italy, and other countries, more active and close. It is self-evident that their combined strength can overwhelm Britain and the United States. I would like to take this opportunity to express my great appreciation for the mutual sincere cooperation of the above-mentioned countries. At the same time, I should also express my utmost cooperation for the development of the Republic of China, because this development is not only for the well-being of the Chinese people, but also creates a shortcut to the common goal of defeating Britain and the United States. I now once again express my respect for the firm determination of the Republic of China to declare war on Britain and the United States. The allied countries will strengthen their cooperation and fight to the end with a bright future, in order to build a new Greater East Asia and contribute to the construction of a new world order.

Manchukuo Government Declares Yesterday: The Cooperation of the Three Countries is Even More Solid

Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Manchukuo government issued the following statement at 2:00 PM today regarding the Chinese government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government of the Republic of China has been assisting Japan in carrying out the war with the spirit of sharing weal and woe. Today, it has declared war on Britain and the United States with a firm determination. China is the direct object of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia. Today, it has resolutely risen up and engaged in war, which can be said to be the trend of the people's will. The National Government's struggle in the future will undoubtedly make a great contribution to the war situation. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our Manchukuo, with the spirit of death and survival and inseparable, upheld the great righteousness of Japan-Manchukuo joint defense and rose up to assist the holy war of our neighboring country. In recent years, the whole country has been making every effort to do so. This time, with the participation of the National Government, the cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has become even more solid. With one heart and one mind, we have built an unbreakable foundation to complete the great cause of East Asian liberation. We are truly delighted. On this occasion, our government and people will rise up even more, step forward enthusiastically, and strive to carry out the established national policy, and we are determined to unite our will and move towards the common goal of the East Asian nations with the belief of certain victory and success.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in the Southern Sections of the Eastern Front

Rzhev Base Suffers Another Fierce Attack; Germans Launch Counterattacks in Several Places

Fuhrer Headquarters, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The German military report this afternoon stated that there was fierce fighting in the Caucasus, Stalingrad, and Don River regions. The Soviet offensive in all areas was repelled. The Germans immediately launched counterattacks in several places, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviets. German aircraft assisted the ground forces in defensive battles with great success, defeating Soviet cavalry and mechanized units. There were skirmishes northwest of Livny, and German forces destroyed many enemy strongholds. The German base in Rzhev suffered another fierce attack by Soviet forces. The Soviets continued their offensive southeast of Lake Ilmen. The enemy stopped their attack after losing 21 tanks. The port and urban areas of Murmansk were again bombed, causing many large fires, and one merchant ship was damaged.

Berlin, 9th (Haitong News Agency) – The Soviet side announced a week ago that they had occupied Rzhev, but the German army is still holding the city. Although the Soviet army has invaded the suburbs of the city, the situation has not changed. The city is defended by a German infantry division and supplied by air. The Soviet besiegers included 11 infantry divisions, 5 brigades, and a tank company, but repeated fierce attacks have not succeeded and have resulted in heavy losses, reducing their strength by at least half. Of the 400 tanks participating in this battle, no fewer than 300 have been destroyed. The loss of Soviet tanks is increasing daily. Last September and October, the average was 20-30 tanks per day. At the end of November, it increased to 80-90 tanks per day. From December 1st to 10th, the average was 115 tanks per day. From December 10th to 20th, the average was 150 tanks per day. The loss of tanks will sooner or later affect the situation.

### Overseas Students in Japan Express Their Thoughts

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – There are currently over 1,400 Chinese students studying in Japan. They usually study diligently in preparation for serving their motherland after completing their studies. Since Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Japan some time ago, Sino-Japanese cooperation has become closer. The phrase "share life and death together," recently proclaimed by the Chairman, has further inspired young people studying abroad. They all expect the motherland to cooperate with the Greater East Asia War in a new posture. In order to understand their living conditions and their views on Japan during the war, the reporter visited the Dongya School (Jinbocho, Kanda District, Tokyo), which specializes in preparing them for learning Japanese, and interviewed Mr. Wang Yuanming and Mr. Ning Peide, who are currently studying at the school. They kindly shared their experiences since coming to Japan and their thoughts on Japan during the war. Mr. Wang said, "The Greater East Asia War has entered its second year. Thanks to the heroic struggles of the Japanese soldiers and the hard work and endurance of the Japanese people, and the united cooperation of the East Asian allies, the foundation for the final victory has been laid. We are sincerely delighted. Regarding our daily life, there are some inconveniences in terms of diet and accommodation due to differences in nationality, but the necessities of life are sufficient. It is unexpected that Japan still has such abundant resources during this war. Moreover, we have long been determined to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, so in order to strive for the final victory, we all adhere to Chairman Wang's instructions and strive for simplicity with a spirit of hard work and endurance." Mr. Ning said, "Since we came to Japan to study, the most impressive thing has been the Japanese students' greater efforts in intellectual and physical training during the war. This spirit is truly admirable. In their daily lives, the Japanese people reject everything Anglo-American and display a brand new and healthy wartime spirit. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has been determined to win and cooperate with the allied countries of China and Manchuria to complete the war in order to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and allow the one billion people of East Asia to enjoy permanent peace and happiness. We are very happy to have the opportunity to study in a friendly country. When we return to our country after completing our studies, we will use our abilities to serve our motherland and contribute to the construction and prosperity of the Greater East Asia."

### The National Government's Declaration of War on Britain and the United States is Enthusiastically Supported by All Circles in the City; The Municipal Government Issues a Proclamation Advising the People

The Municipal Government of this city believes that our country has formally participated in the Greater East Asia War. To mobilize the public, it is urgent to step up propaganda to enhance the national awareness. In addition to distributing slogans and notices and sending letters to the various district offices to organize propaganda teams to post them, the Municipal Education Bureau also ordered the primary and secondary schools in Zhabei, Nanshi, Huxi, and other areas to organize student propaganda teams to start the propaganda effort. The Municipal Government and the Shanghai Special Municipality New National Movement Promotion Committee printed tens of thousands of leaflets to advise the public in order to enhance the effectiveness of the propaganda.

Mayor Chen Delivers a Speech Yesterday

Mayor Chen delivered a speech on China's participation in the war, stating that the National Government's announcement of its formal participation in the Greater East Asia War is enough to give infinite excitement to the people of the whole country and the various nations of Greater East Asia. This is something that is inevitable, a matter of conscience and justice, and also something that the people of the whole country hope for. The original intention of the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, in advocating Pan-Asianism was to unite the various nations of East Asia to overthrow the imperialism that invaded East Asia. China's current status as a semi-colony originated from the British Opium War. The Chinese people can never forget the great kindness bestowed by Britain after a century of great suffering. Friendly nation Japan has been engaged in the Greater East Asia War for a year. How can we stand idly by, as if we do not see anything? Driven by justice and conscience, the National Government has the righteous act of rising up to declare war on Britain and its co-aggressors. We should clarify that China's automatic participation in the war is a requirement of justice and conscience, and a requirement of the Chinese people's hopes. We are doing what is right and not seeking its benefits, knowing its principles and not calculating its merits. We resolutely do not have the idea of ​​rights. Our goal is the liberation of East Asia and the liberation of China, not material desires. We also know that China's strength is very weak, especially after the country has been devastated. We must do our best to train the people, establish public security, and increase production in order to cooperate at the moment. Furthermore, we will resolutely take further steps to train the existing manpower and increase the material resources of production, with the courage to go to righteousness and solve the problems. We hope that the people of the whole country will understand this and follow its purpose.

Director Feng of the Propaganda Department Speaks

Director Feng of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department spoke on the participation in the war, stating that the National Government announced yesterday, the 9th, its participation in the war against Britain and the United States. This is the government's greatest decision based on public opinion to seek liberation. What we have been looking forward to day and night has finally come true. British and American imperialism has invaded our country for more than a hundred years. China has suffered from it, and East Asia has also been shackled. Friendly nation Japan first raised the banner of liberating East Asia. For the sake of the ten thousand-year plan of East Asia, we should take the opportunity to rise up and cooperate, share weal and woe, and conspire to break free from the shackles and smash the foundation of British and American imperialism's invasion of East Asia. From now on, there is no so-called civil war in East Asia, let alone the Sino-Japanese Incident. There is only the joint effort of the countries and nations of East Asia to fight heroically against Britain and the United States.

All Circles in This City Support Participation in the War

After the National Government formally declared war on Britain and the United States, all circles in this city enthusiastically supported it. The Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department, the Municipal Social Movement Committee, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, China Film Company, and the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association and other organizations and groups held a "Shanghai All Circles Support Participation in the War Public Assembly" at the Grand Guangming Theater on Jing'an Temple Road at 2:00 PM today (the 10th), and issued a telegram supporting the government's participation in the war. The presidium included Yuan Ludeng, Zhou Zhiren, Chen Yafo, Xi Peiwen, Xu Liqiu, Chen Binhe, and Zhao Zhengping, and invited Mayor Chen Gongbo to personally deliver a speech. Secretary-General Zhao, Feng Jie, Xi Peiwen, Zhou Huarren, Zhou Chaoran, Chen Tongbo, and others also gave speeches on the greatness of the significance of participating in the war. Various organizations, groups, and the public in this city enthusiastically participated.

Telegram from the Anti-British and Anti-American Association

The China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association reverently sends a telegram to the Chairman supporting participation in the war. The telegram stated, "To Chairman Wang of the Nanjing National Government: We have just learned that our government has decided to follow friendly nation Japan and declare war on Britain and the United States, to cooperate with each other and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. We are extremely pleased. Our association takes opposing the aggression of British and American imperialism as its mission. Since its establishment, it has spared no effort in promoting the anti-British and anti-American movement. Regarding Your Excellency's decision to participate in the war, all members of this association sincerely support it and are willing to unite with all national groups to unanimously support the government until the forces of Britain and the United States are defeated and the nations of East Asia are liberated. We respectfully send this telegram. With new efforts, the directors of the China National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Zhou Zuomin, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Binhe, and others, respectfully bow."

Minister Tajiri Informs Japanese Residents

Allied News Agency, Local Dispatch: Japanese Minister to Shanghai Tajiri told reporters at a reception that after the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, the conclusion of an agreement between China and Japan to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights was a natural consequence of Japanese policy. Japan is confident in its ability to defeat Britain and the United States, but the Nanjing declaration of war can be regarded as an expression of the National Government's determination to share responsibilities, make every effort to cooperate in the war, and defend East Asia. When China and Japan eliminate the remaining forces of Britain and the United States, relations between the two countries will inevitably make significant progress. Minister Tajiri also instructed Japanese residents in China to adapt to the new situation, saying that in the current situation, Japanese people must consolidate the domestic front and increase war efforts, and Japanese residents in China must further cooperate with the Chinese people in order to establish a decisive war system on the Chinese mainland.

Italian Ambassador Issues Statement

Italian Ambassador to China, De Rini, issued a statement greatly admiring the National Government's determination to jointly complete the war with allied nation Japan. His statement stated, "The National Government of the Republic of China resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. The ideal of a new China striving for freedom and rejuvenation and constantly hoping to unite with the Axis powers and Japan has finally been formally realized on this historic day. I initially supported Chairman Wang and maintained close contact with the National Government when it returned to the capital. China has already participated in the Anti-Comintern Pact and is closely linked to the Axis countries. I have long believed that China will participate in the Axis front with all its strength, and I firmly believe that China is determined to win the war. The nations of Europe and Asia, with a spirit of shared weal and woe, will surely achieve a just peace and a glorious victory."

### Considering the Lunar New Year Habits of Food Households, Increase the Quantity of Sugar; Those with Housing Tax Receipts Can Purchase 50 Yuan Worth

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office, considering that food households inevitably use more sugar during the Lunar New Year, reported this to the authorities for approval. The sales volume for this period has been increased. Starting today, designated retailers are allowed to sell sugar based on housing tax receipts and citizen certificates. An Shanghai Social Reporter learned from the cooperative the newly determined sugar sales method as follows:

Sugar Sales Method

The housing tax receipts held by food households, those residing in the Common Concession, Hongkou, Huxi, and Nanshi, Zhabei, and other areas, will still be based on the autumn housing tax receipts. Those residing in the French Concession will still be based on the September and October housing tax receipts. In the Nanshi and Zhabei districts, if there are no autumn housing tax receipts, a household registration certificate may be used, but each household registration certificate is still limited to purchasing sugar worth 5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Food households purchasing sugar based on the above housing tax receipts may purchase sugar worth 50 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per housing tax receipt. For the convenience of packaging and carrying, retailers are allowed to divide it into 5 packages of 10 yuan each (including 2% retail donation), with each package containing 2 jin and 4 liang of white sugar or 2 jin and 6 liang of brown sugar. The 5 yuan of sugar purchased with a household registration certificate in Nanshi and Zhabei will be 1 jin and 2 liang of white sugar or 1 jin and 3 liang of brown sugar, all weighed by balance scale. At the time of purchase, the sales clerk shall stamp a method stamp on the blank space of the above housing tax receipt or household registration certificate to avoid duplication. This period is only limited to purchasing sugar from the third period. Those who have purchased sugar in the previous two periods will not be allowed to make up for it. After being purchased by the purchaser, if there are attached households, they should still be distributed evenly according to the number of households living there, and there should be no tricks. If they are not satisfied with the distribution, the attached household (i.e. the tenant) may report to the office in writing (23, Yanghang Street, French Concession) or report to the nearest police station for investigation. Retail stores that are required to sell sugar daily, or sell sugar on alternate days, or sell sugar once every three days, should mark the sales date at their entrances for identification.

### Chinese and Japanese Flour Mills Have Been Allotted Wheat

The Huazhong Flour Milling Federation has received a huge amount of wheat, which has been allocated to the Chinese and Japanese flour mills belonging to the federation for flour milling. It is reported that the Sanxing, Dongfu, Huayou, Zhenjiang, Yangzhou, Sanjing, and other flour mills, as well as the Fuxin and Fufeng factories of Shanghai Chinese merchants, have obtained raw materials. It is reported that industrial flour, some of the factories, have fully opened flour cars, working day and night shifts to rush production. The flour produced is used to supply the Shanghai concession authorities to distribute grain to the stipulated rice shops on a per capita basis, as well as the normal needs of various industries, and to supply the people's food in North China.

### Director Pan Instructs Police Officers

Pan Da, Director of the Huxi Police Bureau, summoned police officers yesterday and delivered instructions to them in the bureau, urging them to be law-abiding, honest, self-respecting, avoid extravagance, be diligent and self-motivated. All those who listened were moved. Pan's instructions were as follows: This year is a new era, the decisive year of the Greater East Asia War. China is a part of East Asia. In order to strive for the final victory, local public security is extremely important. How should we work hard and diligently, and encourage responsibility, so as not to fail the entrustment of our superiors and the expectations of the people. Finally, he said that I and you all must keep in mind that what we must do is the ten service creeds established by the bureau: First, be friendly and neighborly; second, be united; third, be committed to orders; fourth, be loyal and responsible; fifth, be prompt in work; sixth, be upright and honest; seventh, be honest and fair; eighth, be law-abiding and self-loving; ninth, be hardworking and enduring; tenth, be kind and protect the good.

### Admonishing Citizens to Conserve Consumption

— Sheng Yudu

Mr. Sheng Yudu, the current Deputy Director-General of the Public Works Department, studied in Japan in his early years. Since accepting his current position last year, he has contributed countless suggestions and assistance to the welfare of citizens. Recently, he also serves as the head of the Public Association Section of the Materials Control Department, making significant contributions to the implementation of the authorities' policies and the communication of opinions among various industry associations. Feeling that there are still shortcomings in the wartime lives of citizens, he specifically issued an exhortation to citizens to conserve consumption. His insightful and far-sighted opinions are precise and appropriate. This newspaper hereby publishes them.

In the face of the widespread global war, Shanghai is fortunate enough to have passed the New Year in peace, which is a rare occurrence. The enjoyment of all materials may be said to be relatively free and fulfilling compared to other major cities. What we see and hear is that in warring countries, the consumption of general materials is strictly controlled and rationed. Flour, rice, cheese, sugar, eggs, fruit, meat, and other foods were subject to conservation and control in various countries from the early stages of this war. For example, during this Christmas and New Year, the French government only allowed food stores to freely sell goods for a short period. Foreign dispatches specially highlighted this situation in their communications, reflecting how strict the usual consumption controls are. The ordinary people's daily purchases and lives are so constrained that there is nothing strange about it. Because this is a normal wartime phenomenon, the residents of Shanghai, who are accustomed to free living, may find it odd. Although food, cooking oil, and sugar are currently under control in Shanghai, most goods can still be freely bought and sold, and the material enjoyment of ordinary residents is still relatively free and abundant. This phenomenon, which is considered natural in peacetime, can only be described as accidental and contingent in wartime. Compared to cities in other warring countries, the normal enjoyment in peacetime must be considered an unreasonable and distorted state. No distorted state in the world can be maintained permanently. In other words, any state that is out of step with the times can only be temporarily maintained by force; it has no permanence.

No Waste of Any Materials

How long can Shanghai's current state last? This is a question. The development of factual events suggests that difficult days are coming. Smart people should be courageous, awaken, and prepare to adapt to the environment. If they blindly indulge in past enjoyment and comfort, it is a foolish act and a source of pain. Shanghai is just a consumer city. The supply of all materials depends on imports from home and abroad. In recent years, transportation has been abnormal and inconvenient, and the consumption of materials has lost its normal replenishment. We are merely relying on past limited reserves to sustain a long and endless future. Shanghai's consumption is bound to be restricted. We should awaken as soon as possible, correct our past careless hedonism, and eliminate wasteful and extravagant habits. By saving material resources, tightening our belts, and reducing our diets, we may be able to勉强 maintain a longer period, relying on the limited material reserves in the city, and overcome this common global crisis.

Regarding the enjoyment of life and the consumption of materials, eliminate what can be eliminated, reduce what can be reduced, replace luxurious consumption with ordinary items, and replace goods that are in short supply with equivalent items. We must change our lives, be down-to-earth, and adapt to the environment. We must understand the environment and not cling to overly high expectations, lest we fall into the sadness and suffering of disappointment. After this difficult period, we still have the important task of post-war reconstruction. Only by conserving material resources in time can we prepare for reconstruction; only through hard work and endurance can we enter the path of reconstruction. Wise compatriots in Shanghai, let us awaken as soon as possible, share the difficulties together, tighten our belts in terms of materials, and endure hardships in spirit. Only in this way can we be outstanding individuals who understand the times, and only in this way can we cope with the current situation and build the future. (To be continued)

### Due to Changes in Consolidated Tax Rates, Revised Price Limits for Yarn and Cloth to be Implemented from the 11th of this Month

The Public Works Department Information Office announced: In regards to the price limits for various brands of yarn and cloth, this department issued Announcement No. 6167 on November 18 of last year. Due to changes in consolidated tax rates, all price limits for yarn and cloth should be revised. The revised price list, along with several additional price limits, will be implemented from the 11th of this month. This revised price list can be obtained from Office No. 624, Public Works Department Building, No. 209 Jiangxi Road. See also Public Works Department Announcement No. 6230 for details.

### Bureau's Explanation of Methods for Exchanging and Purchasing Noodles

The Public Works Department Information Office announced: Regarding the issue of purchasing cakes, buns, fried dough sticks, and sliced noodles in conjunction with flour or flour certificates, some newspapers have reported that noodle shops still use a cash transaction system and have not followed the regulations set forth in this department's Announcement No. 6222 of December 30. A special clarification is made as follows:

The original intention of adopting the aforementioned plan was not to say that citizens can exchange flour for the above-mentioned flour products without paying any cash. It meant that if one pound of household flour and the handling fee stipulated in the announcement are paid to any cake or noodle shop, the shop can exchange and sell cakes, noodles, etc., according to the specified weight. At the same time, if a valid flour certificate coupon (which can be used to purchase one pound and twelve taels of flour) is exchanged, the shop should sell cakes and noodles at the specified price and weight.

If any cake or noodle shop refuses to comply with the aforementioned regulations, citizens should immediately report it to the police station nearby for investigation. However, this department will not sympathize with anyone who does not cooperate with this department and provide reports so that the authorities can implement the rationing plan. This plan is implemented to benefit those who purchase and eat the above-mentioned noodle products.

### Relocation of Two Courts, Original Location for Office

The Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court and the First Special District District Court, after the incident, moved the offices and civil and criminal courts of the two courts to the intersection of Weihaiwei Road and Chengdu Road and the Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School at the intersection of the same road and Seymour Road, respectively. Later, the First Special Court moved the criminal court back to the original court address on North Zhejiang Road to hold court because the temporary office in Zhi Ren Yong Girls' School was too small for office use, while the civil court did not move back, and the Second Higher Court did not move back either. Now it is learned that in order to save expenses and facilitate office work for the two courts, the Judicial Administration Department has ordered the two courts to abolish the temporary offices before February 10 of this year and move back to the original court address on North Zhejiang Road. After receiving the order, President Xu Weizhen has notified his subordinates to repair the original court address so that the entire relocation can be completed within the deadline.

### Construction of Isolation Hospital to Accommodate 1,000 Patients

In the future, the hospital's facilities can be increased to accommodate 1,000 patients.

### Smoking Absolutely Prohibited on Trams

The Shanghai Electric Military Company of the Public Concession posted notices with the words "No Smoking" in the carriages of trolleybuses on various routes starting yesterday, and the ticket sellers advised passengers to absolutely prohibit smoking in the carriages to protect public health and implement the New Life Movement.

### The Case of Embezzlement by Lin Shiliang and Others, Trial Concluded, Judgment Scheduled

The case of embezzlement and fraud by Lin Shiliang and others has been thoroughly investigated by the General Supervisory Department of Military Law several times (details of the investigation are provided separately) and was publicly tried in the hall of the department at 10:00 AM on the 17th. Representatives of relevant officials from the central district attended the trial, including Supervisor He Jihong of the Control Yuan, Secretary-General Cheng Zhongxing of the Control Yuan, Guan Jue, representative of the Executive Yuan, Fang Dong and Huang Zu, representatives of the Ministry of Finance, Mao Diyuan, representative of the Investigation and Statistics Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission, Tan Qi, representative of the Transportation Statistics Bureau, and Luo Yinpu, 　Zeguang, and others, representatives of the Central Trust Bureau. The presiding judge in charge of the case conducted the trial. After the judge announced the opening of the court, the defendants Lin Shiliang, Xu Xingchu, and Zhang Dewu were brought in for separate questioning. After the questioning was completed (details of the trial are provided separately), the judge announced the conclusion of the case and scheduled the judgment in accordance with the law. The time was 1:30 PM.

Investigation Process

It was found that Lin Shiliang, the manager of the Transportation Department of the Central Trust Bureau, was suspected of taking advantage of his position to collude with Zhang Dewu, the manager of the Yangon Branch of the Dacheng Enterprise Company and the Lito Commercial Bank, using the name of the bureau to secretly transport a large number of auto parts from the company in Yangon, profiting 10 million yuan from it. Xu Xingchu, the manager of the Trust Department of the bureau, was suspected of being involved in the fraud. The highest authorities ordered the investigation and handling of the case. The defendants Lin Shiliang and Zhang Dewu were escorted to the department by the Supervisory Office of the Transportation Control Bureau of the Military Affairs Commission on September 18 and September 22 of this year, respectively, and the defendant Xu Xingchu was summoned on October 26. Relevant documents were obtained from the Central Trust Bureau and the Mengzi Customs of the Ministry of Economic Affairs by telegraph, and the defendants Lin Shiliang and others were interrogated in detail. In addition, personnel were sent to the Central Trust Bureau and Chongqing Airport to investigate relevant matters, and the Kunming Airport was also contacted by telegraph.

Trial Situation

First, the judge interrogated the defendant Zhang Dewu. According to Zhang Dewu, the manager of Dacheng Enterprise Company, in March of this year, due to a large number of goods that could not be transported inland and the registration period had expired, and Yangon was in a dangerous situation, on March 3, he negotiated with Lin Shiliang, the manager of the Transportation Department of the Central Trust Bureau, in Yangon to sign a contract to sell the goods to the Central Trust Bureau for inland transportation. The contract stipulated that the auto parts and 35 cars were priced at 30 million yuan, and all expenses and losses along the way would be borne by Dacheng Company, and payment would be made in Kunming. When the goods were detained in Kunming, the judge asked, "Lin Shiliang once claimed to the Transportation Control Bureau that the goods were public goods of the Central Trust Bureau and requested release. Did you know about this?" Zhang said, "I didn't know anything about Lin Shiliang's actions in going to the inspection office to claim the goods in the name of the Trust Bureau, but I did ask Lin to do so." As for Lin Shiliang's statement that he had discussed with Zhang in Yangon about the need to sell the goods to various agencies at a fair price after they were transported inland, Zhang said that he had never said that. Regarding the transportation of 35 cars, it was stated that they were all commercial vehicles, and the value of the batch of goods in Kunming was 40 million yuan. (To be continued)

### Second Act of the Scott Cup Quarterfinals, Donghua Club Meets Jewish Team Today, Yesterday St. Francis Eliminated Lianyi to Gain Final Rights

The Scott Cup football quarter-finals were held yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Wu Qixiang, Zheng Yingquan, and Gao Baozheng of Lianyi were absent and replaced by Cai Shengsen, Meng Yiliang, and Jiang Chao. Greenburg and Fu'en of the St. team were also not seen on the field, and a new Paisi and Qikailin were added as forwards, while W. Pantuo was assigned as center back. St. Francis led 1-0 in the first half. In the second half, neither side scored. As a result, St. Francis eliminated Lianyi with a score of 1-0 and won the right to the final.

The second act is scheduled to be held at the same location at 3:30 PM today, with Donghua Club, which was scheduled to be on duty in the first week, playing against the Jewish team. Donghua's lineup is the same as when they played against Lianyi in the first-tier league last week. Center back Liang Shutang serves as right forward, Xu Zhaopeng serves as left forward, and the forwards, in addition to the three musketeers Jia Xu and Dai, are Cao Qinfang and Yuan Kuntian. In last week's battle, they performed exceptionally well. In the daily league, Donghua once defeated the Jewish team 4-2. In theory, they should be able to sing a triumphant song and create victory again. However, the Jewish team actually defeated St. Francis 8-2 in the previous game, indicating that their skills have obviously improved. The winner today will determine the champion of this year's Scott Cup with St. Francis on the 24th of this month. In addition, there are a total of six games in the league today.

### List Price of Gold Ornaments Remains Unchanged, No Official Market Price in the Domestic Market

Yesterday, the listed price of gold jewelry for retail sales in the Taixin Tongxing gold shops in the city was still 3,050 yuan per tael (about 300 yuan less for purchases). The industry also received a notice from the authorities that the maximum price limit of 2,750 yuan must not be exceeded, resulting in no official market price. However, there was still some trading outside the industry in the black market, and the market price quickly returned to flat. In the morning, it was 2,820 yuan, down 10 yuan. Later, the price fell to 2,780 yuan before rebounding at noon. At noon, it was 2,830 yuan, the same as the previous day's price, with a difference of 50 yuan. The volume was thin. The listed price of silver ornaments was still 16 yuan per tael, and the price for inter-industry transactions was 16 yuan and 79 cents.

Yesterday, the interbank lending rate posted by the Money Industry Association was 1.7 cents in the morning and did not change.

### Military Tickets and Allied Certificates are Flat

Japanese military tickets continued to be stable and firm. The inter-industry trading price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and 24 li. The buying and selling prices for small money shops and bank retail sales were 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and half a fen and 4 and a half fen. Allied Certificates were still sold for 3 yuan and 7 jiao and 2 fen, and purchased for 6 jiao and 7 fen.

### Not Much Trading in Chinese Stocks, Department Stores are the Most Stable

Yesterday, Chinese stock traders had few transactions due to the Saturday holiday at the end of the year. There was still some trading in the black market, but supply still exceeded demand, and there was a feeling of having no way to sell. Market prices became even more sluggish. Public utilities, new pharmaceuticals, and cultural stocks were particularly weak. Department stores were the most stable, and the textile industry was also weak, but trading was thin. Here are the market prices of some of the more active stocks:

### Government Bonds are Low, Series C is Trading, Unified Series D Lottery

The market for government bonds is even more chaotic. The benevolent see benevolence, and the wise see wisdom. On the one hand, those with surplus funds think that having government bonds is better than having deposits. On the other hand, those who need cash are eager to sell to get cash. Because buyers and sellers often cannot come to an agreement, market prices often differ by several jiao or one yuan. However, it is only internal trading. The price is 50 yuan, 0 jiao and 67 cents. There was also a small price of 49 yuan and 8 jiao, and then someone wanted 50 yuan. The shocking situation is enough to show the direction of people's hearts, and it may not be easy to get on the right track temporarily. All other bonds are quoted but not traded.

The 14th lottery for the principal repayment of the Unified Government Bonds of the Republic of China in 1936 (Series D) was held in Chongqing on November 10, 1942. A total of twelve bonds were drawn. The winning numbers are listed below: 〇五〇、一〇四、二三二、二八〇、三六八、四九七、五二三、五六八、六一七、七〇七、八五二、九九三、

### The Search for Woolen Fabrics is Endless

Yesterday, the woolen fabric market was short and popular. Owners were unwilling to sell, and the market was obviously firm and secretly rising. Because light wool money will be cut off, the price of shredded wool and wool scraps is expensive and scarce. The distribution of Zhejiang and Hubei wool is difficult. In the future, production will inevitably be reduced. In view of the increasing daily expenses and the difficulty of lowering costs, the industry is increasingly hoarding goods. The search is endless. For example: (1) Grass green riding breeches, gabardine, thick and thin serge are out of production due to the lack of dyes. The market is quite short of goods, the demand is heavy, and the trend is brisk. Market prices are extremely expensive. (2) Although there are no large-scale actual buyers for camel cashmere, its retail sales are quite extensive. Most of the goods in the hands of the industry have been sold out, and the market is soaring. (3) Summer woolen fabrics, such as Palis, flannel, fanliding, white zhigong, feather yarn, and white serge, are all short and popular. Although owners are hoarding goods, there are still many buyers, and sellers are unwilling to sell. (4) Light-textured floral tweed woven from fine wool yarn, whether for suits or ordinary goods, is in short supply and prices are firm. Buyers outnumber sellers, and retail transactions are more common. (5) Wood factory wax money is used as hemp tape and is in strong demand. Those who sincerely order from the factory are not weak, and prices continue to rise. Gray is the most popular, followed by white, and then beige.

### Raw Starch Market Shows Improvement

Due to the long-term interruption of the source of raw starch, the market is becoming increasingly scarce. Although destocking is sporadic, the market is still improving. The current market price for Flying Unicorn brand is 950 yuan, old Unicorn brand is 850 yuan, and so on, gradually decreasing. There are very few that are easing.

### Chaotic Soap Prices

The daily necessities market continues to rise. Due to the dwindling inventory, formal transactions are quite rare. Prices are chaotic and inconsistent, and the market is becoming increasingly acute. For example, Gubenzhao is 580 yuan, Baixiangmao is 520 yuan, Huangxiangmao is 490 yuan, scissors soap is 560 yuan, Baily candle is 610 yuan, and monk hat brand is 530 yuan, all of which are much more expensive than yesterday. Matches are as stable as ever. Phoenix brand is still 3,000 yuan, and American brand is 3,200 yuan, with no significant difference. Wan Jin Oil is 34 yuan, Bagua Dan is 31 yuan, headache powder is 29 yuan, and partridge vegetable is 57 yuan.

### Cigarette Supply and Demand Balance

Yesterday morning, the cigarette market had light trading. Buying and selling were balanced, and market prices did not fluctuate much. Great Britain 9,550 yuan, Old Knife 8,550 yuan, Pinhai 7,100 yuan, Fairy 7,000 yuan, Golden Gun 2,900 yuan, Five Flowers 6,000 yuan, Red Rose 2,700 yuan, Golden Building 3,600 yuan, Quanlu 2,950 yuan.

### Bamboo Steel Bars are Stagnant

The market for 40-foot bamboo steel bars has been depressed for a long time. There has been no improvement since yesterday and today. The construction industry on Wood Street is declining, and the access of out-of-town contractors has stopped. The only transactions in the market are sporadic business from door-to-door users. There is nothing to report about wholesale transactions. The mood in the industry is difficult to be overly optimistic. The brand behavior is difficult to determine the honor or disgrace. Three- or four-point patterns sell for 11,000 yuan per ton, five-point to one-inch goods sell for 10,500 yuan per ton, and three-foot starting goods sell for about 8,000 yuan per ton.

### "Death" and "Life"

— Hai Lin

Every person with achievements should, of course, have their own vitality, will, and planned "view of life" or "worldview." Especially in today's society filled with thorns, it is even more impossible to have any vagueness. Even if we cannot emit a blazing torch to illuminate the entire dark universe, we must at least emit a flickering fire that can illuminate our own steps and see every sharp stone and mud pit, and move forward.

But we cannot underestimate the value of death. Human "life" is the accumulation of career and behavior, and human "death" is the bill for these careers and behaviors.

The true value of "death" can be said to be the most valuable lesson. Only "death" can make people understand their own lives. It can show proud people that they are just ordinary people, and make them disgusted with all the joy they have derived from pride in the past. It also proves to rich people that they are still naked when they die...

Mr. Lu Xun once said, "A person truly dies when people completely forget him." He also told us that if there is still his shadow in people's minds, he is still alive. A truly great person will not die, and his soul can always be warmly preserved in people's hearts.

Huxley also said in his famous letters on the problem of human immortality, "We live, and we want to get the price of living." Then we die, and we should also get the price of death. A person who truly loves "life" should also not fear "death." Human "life" should be lived meaningfully, then human death should be died meaningfully.

Some people look at life and death as if they were the scenery of the river bank and the reflection in the water. They regard "life" as real and "death" as a reflection, which is ethereal and empty. They regard the entire life as a mirror flower and water moon, and also regard death as mysterious and close to "inaction."

Yes, we want to live, but this life must be able to continue to live meaningfully forever. We must be able to step over the stone steps of meaningful and valuable "death" and then live forever. - These six words "meaningful" and "valuable" are the secret of eternal life. Although your stinky skin will die, the most important thing is the "immortality" of the spirit. Otherwise, if you keep the stinky skin with "better to live badly than die well" and die with the soul and spirit, it is indeed a genuine manure-making machine.

### Faraday's Apologetic Love Letter - One of the World's Famous Scientists' Letters

— Written by Lincoln Schnster, Translated by Gu Xin

Foreword

Faraday (Michael Faraday) lived from 1791 to 1867. Through his epoch-making research and experiments, he paved the way for practical electrical engineering for modern industry. He was a brilliant physicist. However, although he could arbitrarily exert a great influence on the principles of electrical power and magnetism, he could not necessarily integrate the various elements that make up a love letter. The following short note, which does not include the date, is an illustration of this fact.

"…Fantasies are swimming before my eyes…"

Body

My dearest Sarah—How terribly the state of the body affects the power of the mind is surprising. I awoke this morning with the intention of writing you such a delightful, such an interesting letter tonight; but I am tired, and many things have occurred to exhaust me in mind, so that I can scarcely think, and can only wander in imagination about you. Believe me, I have more to say, more that is warm and close to my heart, than I am skillful to use words for; and besides, when I stop to think of you, chlorides, trials, oil, Davy, steel, miscellaneous matters, mercury, and fifty other professional fancies swim before me, which in the end drive me further and further into the regions of stupidity.

From your attached lover,

Michael

Royal Institution.

Thursday Evening.

(December 1820)

Aftermath

However, not long after writing this letter, Sarah Barnard became Faraday's beloved wife and lived for many years. Their marriage was famously long and happy. (End of this article)

### Record of Bai Yunpeng

— Wu Nianci

Bai Yunpeng and his troupe of ten performers came to Shanghai to perform at the Empire Theatre, and it has been more than half a month. Let me try to comment on a few people in the troupe.

Zhao Yanfen's Beijing-style drum ballad and Fang Hongxia's Plum Blossom Tune are mediocre, and I really don't want to waste a word on them. Somewhat bearable is Zhu Guizhi's Henan Zhui Zi. Every time I listen to her "Touring the Lake and Borrowing an Umbrella," the flavor is very long-lasting. Although she doesn't love to use flowery melodies like Qiao Qingxiu, she is honest and sincere.

In between, there are two martial arts performances. One is the "Soaring Ring" stunt by siblings Song Shaozhen and Song Huiling. "Soaring Ring" is actually just kicking a shuttlecock, but Song Shaozhen's kicking method is different from others. He can use both soft and hard force, kicking the shuttlecock in front, behind, left, right, up, down, and in all directions, even on his head, using his scalp movements. The second is the crosstalk by Guo Rongqi and Liu Shirui. I am quite interested in crosstalk, but Guo's best skill is only singing a few snippets of "Bangzi" operas and new songs. (His imitation of Tianjin's "selling old clothes" is quite amazing), but as for telling jokes and being humorous, it is vulgar and far from the realm of "speaking subtly and hitting the mark."

After a ten-minute break, Fang Hongbao's Beijing-style drum ballad came on. Nowadays, among women singing drum ballads, I think Fang Hongbao should be considered the best. In this sense, it is somewhat justified to give her the elegant title of "Drum Ballad Empress." This time, I listened to her sing four acts, "Wulongyuan," "The Grand West Chamber," "Capturing Sanlang Alive," and "Xue Yan Assassinates Tang Qin." Her enunciation, singing, and acting were all excellent, truly deserving the criticism of "precise pronunciation and melodious singing, achieving a state of divine transformation."

Needless to say about Zhao Yanfen and her ilk, even the long-renowned Little Black Girl has not completely shed her coquettishness. This is a common problem among drum ballad girls. Da Hongbao completely attracts people with her skills. Her voice has all five tones, and when she goes high, it is like the cry of a crane or the howl of an ape. When she goes low, she is extremely tender and sentimental. The lyrics of "The Grand West Chamber" are similar to the "Smashing the Mirror Frame" of the Plum Blossom Tune, which is a purely joking play. The other three acts show her true skill in portraying the mood of Yan Xuejiao and Xue Yan. Fang Hongbao's singing is not only captivating in tone, but her acting is also expressive, and her hand and eye movements are all on point, which is especially commendable.

Immediately following was Xie Ruizhi, the master of single-string ballads. Everyone knows Xie Ruizhi's skills, so there is no need for me to waste words. This time, I listened to his "Zhuo Erniang Persuades Her Husband," "A Prodigal Son Returns and Gold Cannot Replace Him," etc., which were naturally excellent works, being humorous and amusing.

The finale was Bai Yunpeng. Bai and Liu Baoquan jointly held the leading position in the modern drum ballad world, one specializing in civil and the other in martial arts. After Liu's death, Bai replaced Liu and the theaters gave him titles such as "King of the Drum Ballad World" as a gimmick. Bai can perform many plays. The wonderful thing about him is that his voice is clear and his breath is harmonious, gentle and slow. Therefore, most of the stories he is good at are from "Dream of the Red Chamber." But, perhaps it's my prejudice, I always feel that drum ballads should convey tragic and inspiring spirits, or at least portray the characters' expressions and tones, making them lifelike. Just relying on singing lines and uttering the platitudes of romantic love is not enough. In particular, Bai Yunpeng lacks high notes, and the melody is too flat, without twists and turns, which is also a shortcoming.

To sum it up in one sentence: In terms of skill and mastery, Bai Yunpeng and Xie Ruizhi are of course the best, but in terms of personal preference, I prefer Wan Hongbao. Writing this, I think of the deceased Liu Baoquan, and can't help but think of the saying, "This song should only exist in heaven."

### The Choice of Food for People During Wartime

— Wang Keding

During wartime, general supplies are scarce due to transportation and production issues. In particular, the shortage of food directly affects the daily nutrition of the lower and middle classes. The remedial methods, in addition to the authorities planning to unblock the sources of supply and increase rationing, on the negative side, people should know the choice of food to seek to remedy the lack of nutrition.

For example, lacking vitamin A causes night blindness, B causes beriberi, C causes scurvy, and D causes rickets, etc.

Although milk is rich in vitamins ABD and a small amount of E, soy milk also has vitamins AB. Various eggs, especially chicken eggs, contain rich vitamins AB, a small amount of C, and DEF. But if you change to eating spinach, you can also get the same vitamins. Therefore, the general public believes that only high-priced foods have nutritional value, but the fact is not so. According to experienced doctors, tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, onions, green vegetables, yams, potatoes, peas, broad beans, brown rice, wheat (grains), peanuts, etc. all contain rich vitamins ABCD, while dried meat and pickled foods have lost their nutritional value.

Vegetables are excellent foods, in addition to containing nutritional salts, they also contain valuable plant pigments, namely chlorophyll and carotenoids. This pigment is related to vitamin A. The more of these pigments a plant contains, the more vitamin it contains. Chlorophyll is also a hematopoietic agent, and its function is to increase the number of blood cells and promote metabolism. If we eat a plate of tomatoes, cabbage, or cucumber with lunch and dinner every day, it will undoubtedly help with nutrition.

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

Chips was also doing his criticizing—Mrs. Wickett, when she came in to do his room, got her share of it. "Most—er—interesting time, Mrs. Wickett. Young Branksome tells me his uncle was Major Collingwood—nineteen-o-two—er—we had a Collingwood here once—I think it was the same. Ah yes, I remember Collingwood very well. I gave him a caning once—er—for climbing on to the roof of the gymnasium—to get a ball out of the gutter. Little devil, might—er—have broken his neck. You remember him, Mrs. Wickett? He must have been here in your time."

Mrs. Wickett, before she had saved money, had been in charge of the school linen-room.

"Yes, I remember him, sir. Seemed to me he was always in trouble. But we never had any trouble between us, just the same. He didn't do no harm. He wouldn't have done anything like that, sir. Is that him with the medal, sir?"

"That's right. A D.S.O."

"Anything more you want, sir?"

"Nothing now—er—till chapel time. He—killed in Egypt, I think. . . . Yes—er—you can bring my supper along then."

"Very well, sir."

In Mrs. Wickett's rooms, a happy serene life went on. He had no worries; his pension was adequate and he had saved money besides. His needs were few and amply satisfied. His room was simply furnished, in the style suggesting schoolmaster's hobbies: shelves of books and sporting trophies: a fireplace over whose mantelpiece were crowded photographs and signed portraits of boys and men: a worn Turkey carpet: a couple of big armchairs: several prints of the Acropolis and the Roman Forum. Almost everything had come from his old housemaster's room in the school. Most of his books were classics, which had been his main subject: but there were also history and miscellaneous items for relief. Then there was another shelf, filled with cheap editions of detective stories. Chips liked these things. (7)

### Our Newspaper Discusses the Fourth Scholarship Program

As the current semester is coming to an end and the next semester is approaching, the scholarship work organized by this newspaper is becoming increasingly intense. The responsible persons attach great importance to convening staff meetings in recent days to discuss the preparatory matters for the fourth session. In addition to designating respective duties, the principles and specific methods for the distribution of scholarships have been decided separately. The entire staff is mobilized to rush through various procedures. Those who come to the office to collect application forms are gradually increasing. It can be seen that the needy children urgently need assistance. It is found that the tuition fees of various schools have increased sharply this semester, and the fund for this session is only 120,000 yuan. It is predicted that there will be many applicants for assistance. I am deeply afraid that there will be more monks than porridge, and it will not be enough to distribute. In addition to appealing to all sectors of society for enthusiastic donations, the examination procedures for review must be strictly implemented. Applicants are requested to pay attention to all methods at any time.

### Guanyu Middle School Responds to the Poverty Relief Movement

Yesterday, we received a letter from Guanyu Middle School, which roughly stated that our school adheres to the spirit of seeking truth from facts, and strives for hard work regardless of sacrifice. We have always had a sense of sympathy for the refugees. Therefore, in the past, we have set up free places in each semester to help poor students. Recently, in view of the increasing difficulty of social life and the increasing number of dropouts, we solicited donations to increase 100 free places. Now, in addition to the support of enthusiastic people, we continue to raise funds. In order to respond to your newspaper, we donate ten free places for the first grade of junior high school in accordance with item C of Article 2 of the general outline of the poverty relief movement, to replace cash of 1,800 yuan. Please recommend or introduce them. A small number of people only express their sympathy for mankind.
