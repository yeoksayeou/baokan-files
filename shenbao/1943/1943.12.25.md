### Urgent Winter Relief

This year's winter relief effort has already established a fundraising committee, decided on fundraising methods, and set a fundraising goal of ten million yuan, to be announced in four installments. The first announcement was scheduled for November 30th, the second for December 10th, and the third for December 20th. Currently, the deadlines for the first three announcements have passed. As of yesterday (the twelfth donation report), the total amount of donations raised was just over two million five hundred fifty thousand yuan, only a quarter of the total goal. It has been more than a month since fundraising began, and such results are regrettable.

According to the plan, the fundraising units are divided into two hundred teams, each responsible for fifty thousand yuan. The team leaders are either leading figures in the business community or wealthy individuals. If they sincerely exert themselves in fundraising, it should not be difficult to raise the sum of fifty thousand yuan in a short period. In other words, if the fundraising team leaders are completely indifferent to winter relief donations, neither making efforts to fundraise nor willing to contribute from their own pockets, then it would be impossible to achieve the goal, not just in a month, but even in a year. The term "fundraising" originally implies acting out of one's own volition and a sense of justice, not a forced assignment. However, since the authorities have entrusted them with the position of team leader, they naturally have a certain reputation and status in society. Moreover, this is a public-spirited undertaking, and doing good is the greatest joy. Mencius said, "The feeling of compassion is possessed by all men." How can those with reputation and status in society have such weak compassion? We suggest that the authorities of the Winter Relief Fundraising Committee immediately send special letters to the team leaders who have not yet fundraised or have not fundraised sufficiently, encouraging them to earnestly fundraise as soon as possible and to finish within the set deadline. At the same time, we hope that the gentlemen serving as fundraising team leaders will put themselves in the position of those disaster-stricken compatriots urgently awaiting relief, think about doing good and accumulating blessings, regard it as an inescapable duty, and promptly and earnestly persuade friends and relatives to donate widely. Contributing even a small amount is relieving a portion of the suffering of those compatriots awaiting relief.

Secondly, we express our respect for those who have raised more than their assigned amount, such as Mr. Wang Yizhi and Mr. Hong Zhenliang, who each raised 240,000 yuan, and Mr. He Zhuoxian, Mr. Zhou Youchang, Mr. Wang Weiguan, Mr. Shen Weiting, and Mr. Chen Shaogui, who each raised more than 100,000 yuan. Mayor Chen also raised more than 100,000 yuan through enthusiastic fundraising.

It is heard that the new pharmaceutical industry and the silver and banking industries are both willing to pledge 1.1 million yuan, and their enthusiasm and determination are particularly commendable. We hope they will promptly realize their pledges and serve as an example for other industries. How meaningful it would be if various industries could allocate a portion of their year-end bonuses to charitable causes. There is no lack of insightful and philanthropic individuals in the various trade associations, and we hope they will lead their colleagues in advocating for allocating bonuses to help with disaster relief. How glorious it would be if the various trade associations could account for a significant portion of the winter relief donations.

In short, the weather is harsh, winter relief is timely, and fundraising is urgent. The gentlemen serving as team leaders should complete their tasks as soon as possible, aiming to finish within the year and at least reach the predetermined goal of ten million yuan. As for how to distribute the relief, we hope that the authorities in charge will promptly formulate a plan in accordance with the proposals, to satisfy the expectations of the donors and alleviate the suffering of those awaiting relief.

Finally, we will share a word with readers, especially the "enjoyers" of "carnival nights," with a heavy heart. According to the investigation by this newspaper, the consumption of dance and cuisine in major dance halls and other entertainment venues in the city last night was estimated to be over 50 million yuan, exceeding five times the total goal of the annual winter relief effort. Therefore, after "singing and dancing" and "indulging in food and pleasure," would it be too much to ask to allocate a small portion of this consumption to pay to the banks collecting relief funds, to help those miserable compatriots who are "exposed to the wind and sleeping in the rain" and "without clothes or food"?

### Naval Air Unit's Success in New Britain Island Area: Enemy Strongholds and Many Ships Heavily Damaged

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 24th: The Imperial Navy Air Force bombed enemy strongholds near Cape Gloucester and Aroe Island at dawn on the 23rd. In addition to setting fire to eight places, they also destroyed two enemy landing craft (heavily damaged). On the morning of the 23rd, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted approximately 70 enemy aircraft that came to Rabaul and shot down 24 of them (four unconfirmed). Six of our aircraft did not return to base.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The combined results achieved by the Japanese naval air units in the Cape Gloucester and Rabaul areas of New Britain Island from the 15th to the 23rd of this month (limited to those announced by the Imperial General Headquarters) are as follows: Damage inflicted on the enemy: Sinking of two enemy cruisers or destroyers, three large transport ships, four or five special transport ships or medium-sized transport ships, two special transport ships, two or more transport boats of special transport ships, two special transport ships, four small transport ships, one transport boat, and 80 large landing craft, totaling over 107 ships. Destruction of one enemy large cruiser, two destroyers, one transport ship, three small transport ships, two special transport ships, one transport boat, three large landing craft, and many landing craft and small boats, totaling over 13 ships. 62 enemy aircraft shot down (four of which are unconfirmed).

### Japanese Forces Control Airspace, Fierce Fighting Unfolds in Rabaul: 24 Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since the enemy forces landed at Cape Gloucester on New Britain Island on the 15th of this month, they have been attempting to attack Rabaul, a strategic stronghold of the Japanese forces. As a result, the fighting has intensified, and they are now engaged in fierce battles with the Japanese forces. The Japanese naval air units have been cooperating with the ground forces in their operations day after day. On the 23rd, they heavily bombed the enemy landing point at Cape Gloucester. On that day, approximately 75 enemy aircraft came to attack Rabaul, and it seems that their intention was to first destroy the Japanese base at Rabaul, so that the enemy forces landing at Cape Gloucester could advance smoothly. This is because the enemy forces have not yet been able to establish a strong bridgehead since landing in that area. However, the Japanese forces still control the airspace around Rabaul, so the enemy's attack is unprecedentedly difficult.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Since a portion of the enemy forces landed on the islands of Cape Gloucester, Aroe, and Pirae on New Britain Island, they have been under constant attack from the Japanese naval and army air units and ground forces, and they are now facing a major crisis. Therefore, they are trying to build an airfield on New Britain Island. In addition to attempting to forcibly resupply and reinforce their troops, they have mobilized all their aircraft to constantly attack Japanese bases on the island. Aiming at Rabaul, a large formation of 75 aircraft, including 27 unified B24 heavy bombers and 48 fighter planes such as Lockheed P38, Vought F4U, and Grumman F6F, attacked Rabaul on the morning of the 23rd. The Japanese naval fighter planes immediately took off to intercept them, plunging into the enemy formation. After a fierce battle, they shot down 24 of them (four unconfirmed), including five B24s, one P38, two F4Us, and nine F6Fs. Six Japanese aircraft did not return from this battle. On the other hand, Japanese naval aircraft fiercely bombed enemy landing points near Cape Gloucester. As the Imperial General Headquarters has repeatedly announced, Japanese naval aircraft have been fiercely bombing enemy reinforcement convoys, achieving great results. Also, on the 23rd, braving adverse weather conditions, they flew to attack enemy strongholds at Cape Gloucester and Aroe, dropping bombs densely. In addition to causing eight enemy military facilities to be hit and catch fire, they also heavily damaged two enemy landing craft, putting the enemy landing forces in a difficult situation.

### Japanese Troops Launch Surprise Attack on US Positions on the North Coast of the Songo River Area: Enemy Airfields and Warehouses on Bougainville Island Bombed

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese and American forces are stalemated in the area north of the Songo River in Finschhafen, New Guinea, and fierce fighting continues daily. On the night of the 19th, a Japanese suicide squad braved the rain and infiltrated behind enemy positions in the coastal area north of the Songo River, successfully launching a surprise attack. They threw bombs and grenades, attacking densely packed enemy vehicle units and field headquarters, causing confusion among the enemy forces. Taking advantage of the enemy's confusion, the Japanese suicide squad moved about freely, destroying enemy field warehouses, one enemy tank, and two enemy vehicles. Another team also launched a surprise attack on enemy positions at dawn on the same day, destroying one enemy tank and causing the enemy forces to collapse.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific: Japanese army aircraft bombed the enemy landing point north of the Songo River on the north coast of Finschhafen, New Guinea, on the night of the 17th, sinking or heavily damaging several enemy torpedo boats. Some of their facilities were also hit and caught fire.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, Japanese naval air units twice attacked the enemy airfield and warehouses at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island before dawn on the 20th, dropping bombs and causing explosions and fires in four locations. One Japanese aircraft did not return.

### Outline for School Reorganization Passed by Japanese Cabinet: Establishing a "Military-Academic Unity" Relationship

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Based on the "Emergency Measures for Wartime Education" passed by the cabinet on October 12th of this year, the Japanese Ministry of Education has been actively studying fundamental reforms to the school system and has now achieved results. The "Outline for School Reorganization" was finalized and submitted to the cabinet on the 21st. It was passed in its original form and has been announced by the Intelligence Bureau and the Ministry of Education. This "Outline for School Reorganization" is based on the measures to lower the conscription age, which were also announced on the 23rd. It is necessary to thoroughly reorganize universities, higher schools, and vocational schools, with the aim of adjusting "academics" to meet the demands of the "military," enriching the ranks of military personnel on the one hand and actively enhancing military combat power on the other, and establishing a "military-academic unity" relationship. Therefore, it can be called an unprecedented reform in Japanese educational history. The outline will concentrate wartime education on the following four points: Thoroughly refreshing and streamlining educational content. Training technical personnel to enhance combat power. Thoroughly implementing labor mobilization. Promoting spiritual sciences, etc., and striving for their swift implementation. The specific measures for the aforementioned four points are further supplemented as follows: The first point is to implement changes in admission qualifications, years of study, and schools. Vocational schools will aim to complete their education before the age of conscription. Furthermore, regarding the refreshing of school educational content, in addition to converting higher commercial schools into higher technical schools, industrial management vocational schools and economic vocational schools (both provisional names) will be reorganized. Foreign language schools will become vocational schools, enabling students to comprehensively acquire general knowledge and languages of East Asia and other countries. In addition, vocational schools specializing in industry, commerce, agriculture, dentistry, etc., will also be reformed in accordance with the times. Universities will also be reformed, such as reorganizing commercial universities with a focus on industrial management. The second point is to reorganize and expand science and engineering vocational schools and universities with the aim of producing a large number of excellent technical personnel. Regarding the third point, based on the "Outline for Establishing a Wartime Mobilization System for Students" decided by the cabinet on June 25th of this year, it is stipulated that young students will have one-third of their academic year dedicated to labor. Given the urgency of ensuring sufficient labor, the student quotas for humanities schools will be further reduced to meet labor demands, while increasing the enrollment quotas for science and engineering departments, which directly contribute to enhancing combat power. The fourth point is to subsidize spiritual research science facilities in universities with national funds. Judging from the reduction in quotas for humanities schools and the conscription situation, this reform of the school system may seem to undervalue spiritual sciences. In reality, the intentions of the Japanese educational authorities are not at all like this. Therefore, in order to promote spiritual sciences, subsidies will be provided to universities for spiritual science research.

### Enemy Aircraft Attack Marshall Islands: Twelve Shot Down

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the Pacific, eight enemy P38 aircraft attacked Miller Island in the Marshall Islands on the morning of the 21st.

### Members of Japanese Literary Patriotic Association Volunteer to Work in Military Factories

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – Members of the labor volunteer corps of the Japanese Literary Patriotic Association, saddened by the heroic sacrifices of Japanese soldiers on Makin Island and Tarawa Island and the fierce counterattacks of the British and Americans, deeply feel the importance of the responsibilities of the people in the rear. They believe that their past lives as freelance writers did not contribute much directly to the war effort. Therefore, they all volunteer to work in military factories, increase the production of military supplies to provide for the soldiers fighting on the front lines, and fulfill their duties as people in the rear. It is heard that the Literary Patriotic Association has approved the requests of its members and will soon assign them to work in military factories.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – The 84th Japanese Diet is the third regular Diet under the Great East Asia War. Since the 77th Diet, there have been three regular Diets and five extraordinary Diets during the Tojo cabinet's wartime administration. During this time, the Japanese Diet fully supported the government by approving various important bills and budget proposals submitted by the government to complete the war and promote construction, boosting national morale, and cooperating with the government in implementing wartime policies. Now, the war situation is becoming more critical. This year is the year to establish the foundation for victory. Emergency measures such as requesting students to enlist and extending the age of military service have been taken to establish a national conscription system. At the same time, measures to strengthen the domestic situation, centered on expanding the production of aircraft and military supplies, have been largely completed. This Diet will deliberate on the government's general account budget proposal of 15.2 billion yen, which is necessary to complete the decisive battle, as well as various special account budget proposals (to be decided next spring) and over 50 bills, including tax increase bills that directly fund the war effort. It is determined to exert the spirit of the Diet's approval and deliberation and to elevate the determination of the Japanese people to complete the war.

### Heavy Losses for American Aircraft in Aerial Battles on the India-Burma Border: Over 200 Aircraft Destroyed

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in Burma: Japanese army aircraft in Burma have secured absolute superiority over the India-China air route and are attacking the Chongqing-India air force. Mountbatten and the enemy's headquarters are attempting to recapture Burma or launch air raids on the Japanese mainland, but since the elite bomber forces of the army and navy bombed Calcutta, they have been shaken. For example, the New Delhi radio station broadcast the power of Japanese aircraft, even complaining to the British government. Since the end of the rainy season in October of this year, during the two months of fighting leading up to the bombing of Tinsukia, the aerial battles on the India-Burma border have undergone great changes. Since October, Japanese aircraft have shot down or destroyed over 220 enemy aircraft. Most of these enemy aircraft are large planes such as B24s, C45s, and C47s. Today, the number of aircraft and the actual strength of the pilots can almost absolutely determine the victory or defeat of the battle. In just two months, the enemy has lost over 500 pilots, and their predicament is impossible to hide. Since the bombing unit bombed Chittagong on October 20th, they have hardly encountered a challenge from enemy aircraft. When Calcutta was attacked on December 5th, although enemy aircraft were expected to challenge them, you engaged over 60 Hurricane aircraft and P51 enemy aircraft, but hundreds of enemy fighters stood idly by. It was not until the bombing of Tinsukia that there was a frontal air battle. In 30 minutes of combat, 16 enemy aircraft were shot down. The weakness of the enemy air force is becoming increasingly apparent. In other battles on the India-Burma border, enemy aircraft would take off and flee whenever they were bombed by Japanese aircraft, with no will to fight. In order to cope with the fierce bombing of Japanese aircraft, the enemy even mobilized units that were supplying Chongqing. In late November, a formation of dozens of fighter-bombers attacked Rangoon several times. The commander of an enemy B24 squadron was shot down by Japanese aircraft in a certain area, and the commander was captured, but he did not know the names of the members of the aircraft's crew. This proves that after they came to India from the United States, they were ordered to bomb Burma and had no time to know the names of the local pilots. It was not until they were captured that they exchanged names, which is an unbelievable phenomenon. Recently, the air route from the US mainland, across South America and Natal in Brazil, across the Great Atlantic, through Cairo, and arriving at Karachi is also not going well. The supply route connecting mainland China and India can only be used for guerrilla actions due to the threat of Japanese aircraft. At the same time, Japanese aircraft have been active everywhere since the end of the rainy season, while enemy aircraft have no operational plan at all. This is evidence that the enemy has no consistent operational purpose in the air war over Burma. Although the enemy has expanded its propaganda, the weakness of the enemy air force has been exposed. They are now carrying out blind bombing to disrupt the peace in Burma.

### Japanese Army in Burma Announces Cancellation of Military Administration in Shan States; Appointment of U Ba Yin as Governor of Burma

The supreme commander of the Japanese army in Burma issued a proclamation on the 23rd, stating that the military administration implemented by the Shan States government in this region will be abolished from December 23rd of this year.

Rangoon, 24th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese government recently appointed the current Minister of Interior, U Ba Yin, as the governor of the Shan States on the 23rd, in response to Japan's cessation of military administration and the incorporation of the Shan States into Burmese territory.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces Weekly War Situation: Continued Sweeping Operations in Various Locations

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency) – The press department of the Expeditionary Force in China announced the weekly war situation on the 24th, stating that after defeating the Chinese forces that reinforced Changde twice on the Hunan-Hubei front, the Japanese forces in Central China are continuing to carry out sweeping operations in various locations. In addition to attacking a strong unit of Chinese forces that attacked north of Yangguan on the 16th, and surrounding several hundred Chinese forces that attacked Yiyangguan, they also launched surprise attacks on the 10,000-strong 185th Division of the Chinese army and the 118th and 11th Divisions of the Chinese army in the vicinity of Pengjiafan (40 kilometers west-southwest) and the area southwest of Nuanshui Street on the 17th and 18th. They also encircled them near the Bianhe River and are currently engaged in annihilation battles. On the other hand, since the beginning of December, Japanese forces in Dangyang, Xinyang, and Yichang have attacked the Chinese forces under Li Zongren of the 5th War Area, who were attempting to rescue the 6th War Area, and achieved great results, leaving behind approximately 800 Chinese corpses. In North China, in addition to achieving great results, punitive expeditions are being implemented at any time. Furthermore, Japanese army air units, in addition to continuously cooperating closely with ground forces, intercepted over 40 American fighter-bombers that attacked Guangdong on the afternoon of the 23rd, shooting down 14 of them and effectively hitting 7 or 8 enemy (P-47) aircraft, causing them to flee. They also flew to attack American air force bases in Chongqing, Kunming, Yunnan, Guilin, Hengyang, Changsha, and other places on the 18th, 19th, 21st, and 22nd, shooting down 42 enemy aircraft and destroying 31. The brave attacks of the Japanese aircraft inflicted fatal blows on the Chinese side, significantly weakening their combat power. Japanese losses included 10 aircraft self-destructed and non-returned.

### Fierce Battles on the Road to Rome; Germans Defend Ortona on the East Coast

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to combined front-line reports, fierce battles are currently taking place in the triangular area formed by Venafro, Cassino, and Alfedena in Italy. Cassino is the main road directly to Rome, while Alfedena is a roundabout route to Rome. American troops have already entered Alfedena, while Cassino is still in German hands. It is reported that news received here from Algiers states that the American commando unit in the Liri River operations has approached Ortona on the Adriatic coast, which has become the central battlefield. The battle for the city is still fierce. According to a Reuters correspondent, the German defenses in the city are such that all buildings are secretly equipped with machine gun nests and sniper positions. Ortona is full of traps and mines, and the Germans have also deployed a strong elite paratrooper unit, further strengthening the city's defenses.

### British Troops Reportedly Land on Portuguese Madeira Island

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to rumors circulating in Lisbon, the British Navy has landed on Madeira Island, intending to occupy it. (Note: Madeira Island is located in the Atlantic Ocean, west of Morocco.) However, Portuguese officials have not confirmed the news. The rumor also states that Prime Minister Churchill is staying on the island for winter rest and recuperation.

### Strengthening Fortifications on the Northern Islands

The northernmost end of Japan's defense line, the Kuril Islands in winter, is now covered in wind and clouds. In the days to come, silver clouds hang low, snowflakes flutter, and the mournful cold wind blowing across the Sea of Okhotsk scatters across every island. Trees several meters tall are buried deep under the snow. Except for the faint black of pine trees on the mountains, it is a world of silver powder. Braving this biting wind and snow, the Japanese army is vigilantly guarding every moment, actively building strong bases, and silently continuing the glorious results of the southern war.

The United States, with all its strength, is constantly launching large-scale naval and air offensives in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Gilbert Islands. In the Aleutian Islands, the enemy's offensive has only consisted of two air raids on August 12th and September 12th. Since then, for about three months, a calm before the storm has been maintained.

However, even though the war situation is so calm, they still do not abandon their dream of invading the north. Since capturing Attu Island, they have been actively engaged in building forward bases and are extremely active. Coming from the Aleutian Islands, islands such as Attu, Kiska, Semichi, Adak, Amchitka, Gareloi, and Ulak are being prepared as forward bases, linking the rear bases of Dutch Harbor, Kodiak, etc., creating a powerful northern invasion route. They are armed with a fleet of six to seven hundred heavy bombers of North American B-25, Consolidated B-24, Boeing B-17, and PBY types, as well as fighter groups, waiting for an opportunity to strike from the north. Currently, apart from two special aircraft carriers, two cruisers, and some other ships, there is no movement of ships in that area. As for ground forces, part of them have been withdrawn since the landing on Kiska Island. That area, including Alaska, has a total of six divisions on standby. Japan is exerting silent pressure.

The Enemy Will Inevitably Attack Sooner or Later

It is impossible to predict when the United States, which hopes to determine the outcome with a short-term decisive battle, will turn its sharp edge to the northern invasion route. However, the United States, with its massive manpower and weapons, is waiting for an opportunity to attack the Japanese mainland directly from the Aleutian Islands, parallel to its offensives in the central and southern Pacific. This is expected from the recent new offensive on the Gilbert Islands. If the United States wants to conquer the North Pacific, it must start by occupying Shumshu Island in the Kuril Islands. If they occupy Shumshu Island, they can advance south from the Kuril Islands and attack Hokkaido. The enemy wants to set up air bases for fighters and bombers that are strategically advantageous. From this point of view, they must first seek a foothold here. The enemy will likely attack by first landing large-scale paratrooper units and tank groups. In this way, the North Pacific front may erupt at any time. In the silence of the northern Kuril Islands, a tense atmosphere is lingering.

Fortifying All the Kuril Islands

The Kuril Islands stretch north in an arc, like a breakwater preventing the fury of the North Pacific. They naturally play a major role in defending the Japanese mainland. Due to the provisions of the 1922 Washington Treaty limiting Pacific defenses, they were completely left as undefended areas. However, in the short years since the establishment of forward bases on Kiska and Attu Islands, each island in the Kuril Islands has been transformed into a large base at an alarming rate. Now, strong iron chains linking the fortresses are firmly guarding the far left end of the Greater East Asia defense line against the inevitably attacking enemy.

"The Kuril Islands are Japanese territory, and we cannot allow the United States to set foot on them." This is the consistent belief of all the officers and soldiers defending the Kuril Islands. The goal of defending the Kuril Islands is to defeat the attacking enemy in the sea, to decimate those who escape this fate on the shore, and to absolutely prevent them from landing. Therefore, day and night, they continue the intense work of building bases. As a result, on islands that originally had no roads, winding motor roads meander between mountains, and vast airfields have been opened up in the frozen soil, which was originally a forest of shrubs and dwarf trees. Large cannons are watching the distant North Pacific, where clouds and smoke mingle. The terrain of the Kuril Islands is changing day by day.

The Hardships of the Garrisoned Soldiers

One clear day, the reporter went to inspect the construction of the airfield. The white clouds covering the vast airfield reflected the sunlight, dazzling the eyes. In the air, formations of aircraft patrolled, their silver wings flashing. Construction materials were bustling around. The sounds of triangular huts being assembled and entrenchments being built pierced the sky. The construction of the base, taking advantage of the clear weather, was full of the spirit of struggle.

On the way back from inspecting the airfield, at the suggestion of the unit commander, I stayed overnight in the dormitory. The so-called dormitory was a tent, scattered sparsely across the snow. As a result of focusing on building roads, airfields, and warehouses in the northern Kuril Islands, the barracks were not given attention. Only recently has the rapid construction of barracks begun, so there are still units living in tents.

The tent is a conical canopy, with only a support pole in the center, dug into the ground. A brazier is placed inside. The ground is covered with pine needles and grass. If there are no pine needles or grass, mats are laid directly, with a layer of waterproof cloth as a mattress, and then several blankets are used as a sleeping place. So dry land is fine, but if it is slightly damp, things inside the tent will become moldy due to the moisture. After the brazier goes out, it is extremely cold and impossible to sleep.

The Japanese soldiers in the Kuril Islands, who are certain that the enemy will attack, are determined to "defend the sacred soil of the Divine Land," and are filled with the fighting spirit of "avenging Attu Island." Despite the snow and wind, they continue strict training and the construction of fortifications without any slack. (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, December 10th)

### Preparing to Issue Gold Bars for the Purchase Price of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Central Reserve Bank Scheduled to Issue in January Next Year

Central News Agency: Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, the regulations have been promulgated by the Executive Yuan and are being handled by the National Commerce Control Commission. For all special fixed-term deposit certificates of the Central Reserve Bank that are due to be paid for the purchase price, a quarter of the face value of the Central Reserve Bank deposit certificates for the portion of the yarn and cloth that has already been inspected and accepted will be issued in gold bars in January next year. Furthermore, in consideration of the merchants' difficulties, for the portion that has not been inspected and accepted, after reviewing the application content, the Central Reserve Bank may issue temporary deposit certificates so that gold bars can be issued at the same time. However, these temporary deposit certificates should be exchanged for formal deposit certificates with a definite value from the Central Reserve Bank after the association completes the inspection and acceptance and determines the purchase price. As for the amount of gold bars paid for the first time based on this temporary deposit certificate, any excess or deficiency may be made up or deducted when the gold bars are issued for the second time. In this way, a large number of gold bars will suddenly increase on the market, and all past rumors will naturally be dispelled.

Method of Calculating the Price of Uninspected Cotton Yarn and Cloth

For yarn and cloth that have not yet been inspected and for which the Cotton Industry Administration Office has issued custody certificates, the original applicant is responsible for safekeeping. The method of calculating the price is that the applicant is allowed to deduct the reserved quantity and the exempted quantity, and then fill in the price according to the standards set in the price assessment table. The Cotton Industry Administration Office of the association will issue a temporary payment certificate for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. After the calculation is completed, a contract will be signed to exchange for a special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificate, which can be used to collect the deposit certificate. However, in order to prevent abuses, it is stipulated that the applicant must be fully responsible for the goods in their custody. If any shortages, damages, or substandard varieties are found during future inspections, the difference should be calculated and deducted from the price. It is now heard that the association will affix the stamp "Inspection Not Completed" on the amount filled in on the special fixed-term deposit certificate exchange certificates issued to the applicants and on the notification letters to the reserve bank for households whose inspection has not been completed. After the inspection is completely completed in the future, the amount will be readjusted and a letter will be sent to the reserve bank to exchange for another deposit certificate. The above method has already been sent by the association to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank for verification and implementation.

### Captain Shiota Talks About the Battle Achievements of the Shibasaki Unit: Heroic Sacrifice is Admirable

Central News Agency: The Allied Fleet Reporting Department held a regular press conference at the Shanghai Naval Club on the Bund No. 3 at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 24th). Minister Matsushima was returning to the country on official business and Captain Yida spoke on his behalf. He described in detail the heroic fighting and martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit and military dependents of the Allied Marine Corps who guarded Tarawa Island and Makin Island with a small force against a large enemy, causing the enemy to suffer huge losses. The original words are as follows:

Worthy of Song and Tears

The heroic battle and martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit on Tarawa and Makin Islands not only moved the entire country, but this kind of battle situation is worthy of admiration by all mankind. The heroic battle situation of Japanese soldiers and military dependents has had this spirit for two hundred years, and the battles on these two islands are a concrete manifestation of this spirit of our Marine Corps. At the time, the Shibasaki unit guarded the two islands with only a small force of three thousand, while the enemy attacked with a crowd of fifty thousand, using hundreds of amphibious tanks and fierce shelling. Our Shibasaki unit remained unyielding and resisted to the end, fighting against an enemy dozens of times larger than us, and supported for as long as five days. They did not ask for help during the support, and sent a telegram saying: "Although our ammunition is exhausted and there is no reinforcements, our morale is strong and unusually excited," etc. Even the 1,500 members of the garrison unit on the two islands, although they were military dependents, would continue to work as usual when enemy shells fell. This kind of courage, although they are not soldiers, their spirit is like that of soldiers. Moreover, there are those who are better than soldiers. Among them, the garrison unit used tools as weapons to fight the enemy, which is even more worthy of song and tears.

American Losses

The martyrdom of the Shibasaki unit caused the American army to suffer great losses. According to the American army in Hawaii: The example set by the Japanese officers is truly admirable. Due to the above-mentioned battle results, we can imagine how difficult it must be for the American army to acquire these islands. The Pacific is not just the two islands of "Tarawa" and "Makin." There are many more islands. The American army has already exhausted a great deal of losses in acquiring these two islands. If they want to approach the Japanese mainland, they will have to sacrifice millions more manpower. "Due to the heroic sacrifice of the Shibasaki unit on Tarawa and Makin Islands, the degree of national enemy hatred among the Japanese people has increased even more." He also said: "Commander Shibasaki served as Chief of Staff of the Marine Corps in Shanghai a year and a half ago. When he talked with us, we could tell that he was intelligent and full of attacking spirit. He also had outstanding battle achievements when he fought on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi lines."

Contributions in Shanghai

It is heard that when Major General Shibasaki died in battle, the Chinese people in Shanghai also mourned deeply. The contributions of Shibasaki to Shanghai are unforgettable. I will describe them in detail below: The matters of civilian air defense in this city were also proposed by Shibasaki at that time. Now, the promotion of civilian air defense in Shanghai is like the division of cells, progressing day by day. Although the Baojia organization in this city was not created by Commander Shibasaki alone, he worked diligently to curb the activities of thugs. At the same time, in order to perfect the Baojia system, Shibasaki personally provided guidance from time to time. Even today, the water Baojia has been established. At the same time, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Commander Shibasaki was very organized in handling enemy property, etc.

### The Federation of Industry and Commerce and Others Give a Farewell Tea Party to Secretary Iwai Today Afternoon

Secretary Iwai of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy is about to leave for a new post. The Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce and the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association will hold a tea party at the Conference Hall of the Federation of Industry and Commerce in the Asia Building at 5:00 PM today (the 25th) to bid him farewell. The atmosphere at that time will definitely be enthusiastic.

### Coal Briquettes Rationed; Sales Begin on the 27th; One Catty Can Be Purchased With Rice Ticket No. 53

According to the announcement of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special City, from December 27th of this year to January 3rd of next year, each retail coal briquette store may sell coal briquettes with rice purchase certificate No. 53. Each store should sell one catty of coal briquettes at a price of 60 cents in national currency when it receives each rice purchase coupon. The names and addresses of the retail coal briquette stores can be inquired at the retail rice store indicated on the rice purchase coupon. This announcement does not apply to the territories that have recently been merged into this district.

### The New Federation Held a Editorial Committee Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Banning Opium, Gambling, and Dancing

In order to respond to the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing and to discuss expanding publicity, the Shanghai News Federation held its fifth Editorial Committee meeting at 5:30 PM yesterday afternoon on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building on the Bund. Member Ren Yunpeng, representing Xun Cheng, reported on the situation of convening discussions to respond to the movement. Chu Baochong, Wang Ping, Jiang Yunzhang, Chen Ying, Pan Leshan and others expressed many opinions on the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing. The final conclusions were: 1. Unanimously pass the movement to ban opium, gambling, and dancing. 2. Strengthen the publicity of banning opium, gambling, and dancing. 3. Emphasize the harm of opium, gambling, and dancing to the country and the people. 4. Request the government to ban opium, gambling, and dancing within a time limit. 5. Hope that the municipal government will implement the plan to ban gambling within the year and implement the ban on opium, gambling, and dancing at the same time.

### Memorial Service Held Yesterday for Slain Police Officers in the Eighth District

Central News Agency: On the 19th of this month, a bloody incident of conflict between the military and police occurred in front of the Gongwuhe Gate on Da Shanghai Road in the eighth district of the city. The eight officers who died on the spot were Qi Jingyang, Chief of the Police Defense Section of the Taishan Branch, Xue Derun, Police Sergeant, Yan Delin, Zeng Yinnian, Zhu Guilin, Jin Zhengya, and Russian officers Miloguv and Sasduv. The First Police Bureau organized a funeral committee for the slain police officers to handle the aftermath and funeral arrangements. The memorial service was held at the International Funeral Home at 2:00 PM yesterday afternoon. Secretary-General Zhao represented the municipal government to pay tribute. Because Director Chen of the First Bureau was in Beijing on official business, Deputy Director Su Chengde presided over the memorial service as the representative. Luo Junqiang, Chief of the Central Tax Police Corps, also went to pay tribute. Lu Ying, Director of the Second Police Bureau, and representatives from various bureaus, offices, and associations under the municipal government, Baojia organizations throughout the city, the Citizens' Welfare Association, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce (Cheng Zhiliang, Acting), and various trade associations also went to pay tribute. Senior officials such as the chiefs of each branch of the First Bureau and the chiefs of each section and office led the police officers to participate in the public memorial service. There were thousands of people attending the memorial service and many elegiac couplets and wreaths were received from all sides.

Brief Commentary

### Such Wartime Life

Last night was "Christmas Eve." Some Jesus believers, as well as non-believers who consider themselves fashionable, regarded it as an opportunity to enjoy themselves and revel all night long. The article "Liquidation of Luxurious Nights" published in this newspaper is a completely factual report. We will list a few comparisons:

The first comparison: Isn't the Greater East Asia front at war? Loyal soldiers, born to die, are fighting to win the freedom and liberation of all the ethnic groups of Greater East Asia, but the rear is so extravagant and depraved. What are they thinking?

The second comparison: Aren't those who are sleeping on the streets, without clothes or food, also compatriots with round heads and square feet? Winter relief donations are made with the utmost effort, but they are unwilling to open their wallets; while dancing halls and brothels spend thousands of gold coins without stinginess. What are they thinking?

The third comparison: The price of rice, coal briquettes, and general commodities is rising day and night, and most citizens are worried about it and cannot survive. But the revelers sing and dance, ecstatic and forgetting themselves. What are they thinking?

The fourth comparison: The power company is restricting electricity consumption due to the difficulty in obtaining coal briquettes. Even production enterprises and social groups are no exception. But on the night of revelry, the lights are brilliant, like daylight. What are they thinking?

We can't help but suspect that all the extravagance and waste seem to be tacitly approved by the authorities.

Such participation in the war! Such wartime life!

Soon it will be "New Year's Day" and "Spring Festival" again, all with faces of revelry. We hope that the authorities will have a crackdown to make it right.

Comments from the Economic Circle

### Sanctioning Those Who Lead Price Increases

In recent years, the prices of all commodities in Shanghai have risen in a straight line, without stopping. And each time there is a so-called leader. The initial leader of price increases was the exchange rate of the legal tender, due to the contraction of foreign exchange, the prices of imported goods rose, and the rise in the prices of imported goods led to a related rise in the prices of domestic goods. When foreign exchange was controlled, the next leader of price increases was the rise in the price of gold. Those who had goods used the rise in the price of gold as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. When gold was controlled, the next leader of price increases was the rise in the price of rice. Those who had goods used the rise in the price of rice as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. When rationed household rice and black market rice prices fell, the next leader of price increases was the rise in black market cotton yarn and cloth prices. Those who had goods used the rise in clothing prices as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. After cotton yarn and cloth were nationalized, the prices were stagnant and there was not much of a price increase for nearly three months. The next leader of price increases was the restriction of electricity and the rise in the price of coal briquettes. Those who had goods again used the rise in fuel prices as an excuse for raising the price of their goods. After this, it is not known what factors will lead to a general rise in prices again.

People's hearts are most restless in wartime, and any slight disturbance can make them feel insecure, so everywhere is enough to become an excuse for merchants to raise prices and make profits. The way to prevent this is to increase the production of materials and dredge the sources of materials. If there are still those who lead price increases, then we should cut the weeds and remove the roots so that they will never have room to operate.

### Oil and Grain Commission Investigates Purchase Situation in Various Places

The Oil and Grain Professional Committee of the National Commerce Control Commission is making unremitting efforts to collect edible oil and oil pressing raw materials. In order to understand the situation in various producing areas, the committee has specially prepared survey forms and asked the federations of edible oil industries in various regions to order their respective industry associations to report truthfully according to the forms. The contents of the forms are the quantity and price of peanut oil, soybean oil, sesame oil, cottonseed oil, and rapeseed oil that can be purchased, with the date ending in May next year.

### Egg Professional Department May Be Formally Established

Eggs are also one of the main commodities, which are closely related to people's livelihood. In recent years, due to the failure to establish an egg control organization, the production and sales parties have failed to coordinate reasonably, and the selling price has also been rising endlessly. In order to thoroughly control the industry, the National Commerce Control Federation is preparing to establish a general egg professional department. Its regulations have been passed by the joint meeting of directors and supervisors, and the organization and personnel are being carefully considered by the parties concerned, and it is expected to be formally established next year.

### Out-of-Exchange Trading of Chinese Stocks Ultimately Small Due to Tight Credit

Yesterday, after the exchange closed, a very small number of peers traded Chinese stocks out of the exchange. The situation turned from firm to flat and weak. Around ten o'clock, there was a slight upward trend at the beginning of trading, but it was soon pushed down by those cashing out due to tight credit. There were also rumors of overall price controls. Real estate was uniquely favored by buyers, with significant increases. Stocks in other industries mostly saw small declines, and trading was not active.

Our Newspaper Investigation

### Liquidation of Luxurious Night: A Fact Provided for Everyone to Discuss

Last night was "Christmas Eve." The entire Shanghai entertainment scene went crazy all night, reveling in festivities and forgetting what era they were in. Here, we conducted an investigation to settle the accounts:

Christmas dinner per person ranged from 100 yuan to 600 yuan. The Gold Valley Hotel started at 200 yuan, the New Capital Hotel started at 300 yuan, the Jingan Cafe was 300 yuan, the International Skyscraper was 400 yuan, the Paramount was 500 yuan, and the France was 600 yuan.

Paramount Ballroom entrance tickets were 100 yuan, the International Skyscraper was 100 yuan, and the France was 200 yuan.

Drinks in first-class dance halls, a cup of plain tea, Lido was 80 yuan, the same for men and women. The New Celestial Forest, Metropolis, and Ciro's all sold for 100 yuan, each offering paper hats and toys. Second-class dance halls such as the MGM, Vienna, and Cathay ranged from 60 yuan to 100 yuan. A cup of coffee at MGM cost 120 yuan.

Around 9 o'clock, Lido closed its doors, and dancers fought each other over entry and seating.

Each dance hall was packed, truly a sea of people, with those who couldn't get in lingering.

Each dance hall arranged seats in three-quarters of the dance floor, and although the dancers were like sardines, they were satisfied.

The stoves in the Russian bars were blazing, the water heaters in the MGM were warm, and other places were also filled with spring. The electric lights were as bright as day. Who said coal was difficult to obtain? Who said there were electricity restrictions?

It is said that each dance hall operated all night. Was this specially approved by the Bureau of Regulations?

Dancers and diners wore high-nosed and short-bearded masks or paper flower hats, dancing and shouting joyfully. Perhaps they would be embarrassed to revel without masks!

From the intersection of Jingan Temple Road and Mohawk Road to the New World, cars were parked continuously along the roadside, mostly gasoline-powered cars, truly the propertied and leisurely class!

Let's have another small statistic. The first-class dance halls, Paramount, Lido, Metropolis, New Celestial Forest, and Ciro's, each accommodated an average of 2,000 people. Drinks, meals, and seat tickets cost 1,000 yuan per person, and each business made 2 million yuan. The five businesses made 10 million yuan. Adding the second and third-class dance halls, bars, cafes, and hotels, the total consumption in one night was estimated at over 50 million yuan. Although this statistic is not very accurate, we believe it is very close to the truth.

A rickshaw puller told me that he earned 1,300 yuan in five hours, which cannot be said to be a Christmas gift.

In this era, with such facts, is it reasonable or not? Whose responsibility is it? Let everyone discuss!

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road: Visiting Shanghai Nanyang Hospital

Secondly, if patients have made considerable contributions to society, the nation, or even the country, or are employees of the above-mentioned institutions and are indeed in poverty, all their expenses will be borne by the hospital. For example, the previous response to Shenbao's preferential treatment for primary school teachers is one such example. However, for general poor patients, it is believed that this is an important part of social problems and should be fundamentally addressed by the authorities and society working together. The hospital's expenses have no external assistance. Although it has tried its best to help, it still deeply regrets not being able to fulfill its wishes. As for implementing epidemic prevention injections every summer, providing free medical treatment for children every Children's Day, and undertaking charitable organizations and other social groups' voluntary services, it has always been unwilling to lag behind.

A New Ideal in the Chinese Medical Community

China's population is said to be 450 million, but how many new medical talents are there? Although there are no accurate statistics, it seems there are definitely not enough 100,000 doctors. Then, on average, there is only one Western doctor for every 4,500 people! Compared with contemporary countries, what an alarming ratio! Then, what practical significance is there to protecting national health and developing medical services every day? Therefore, in today's Chinese medical community, an extremely important task has been put forward, namely, training and cultivating a large number of scientific medical talents.

The original motivation for establishing Shanghai Nanyang Hospital was to cultivate new medical talents. For more than 20 years, it is said that this task has never been neglected for a single day. The first is the daily research work of the hospital's doctors and nurses. In the medical department, there are regular case discussion meetings, specializing in discussing clinical records and difficult case reviews by interns and resident doctors. It is also stipulated that a clinical review be held once a week, that is, to review and discuss all difficult and doubtful cases, with each doctor expressing their opinions, stating theories, and conducting theoretical and practical research. In addition to the above-mentioned regular mutual exchanges and discussions, there is also the organization of a medical affairs committee, whose main goal is to connect the feelings between doctors, research academic knowledge, promote hospital affairs, and assist in the training of medical staff.

The educational work of the nursing department is even more intense, centered on the Nanyang Hospital Senior Nursing Vocational School. The school's teachers are specially hired from various well-known nursing schools, and the directors of each department of the hospital are also responsible for explaining relevant medical courses. This semester's students number 63, all of whom have a junior high school education level, and some have above junior high school level. It is said that in order to improve nursing education in the future, it is hoped that high school graduates will be admitted. As for the curriculum, it is completely in accordance with the curriculum standards of the Chinese Nursing School Senior Nursing Vocational School. The academic term is stipulated as a probationary period of half a year and a regular study period of three years. Those who achieve a score of 70 or above in each subject during the probationary period can join the regular study class. In addition to attending classes in the classroom, students also practice clinically in various wards and outpatient clinics. Each ward has two head nurses responsible for guiding students, so that they have sufficient knowledge and practical experience. Each student works in the ward for eight hours, and in addition to clinical nursing, they are also responsible for health care, disease prevention, and health guidance. The supervisors leading the nurses also hold monthly meetings to report on the work of each ward and discuss how to seek progress together, cultivating students' habits of independent research and work. Extracurricular activities include ball sports and concerts.

General medical staff also pay attention to daily continuing education within the scope of the general affairs department. In terms of work, the three-eight system is adopted, and staff and workers are divided into day and night shifts to work in rotation. Their continuing education activities include reading groups, concerts, and ball teams. The hospital workers also have newspaper reading classes and compulsory continuing education groups, implemented in three groups. Every hospital, except on Sundays, stipulates that classes are held from 7 to 9 o'clock, divided into Mandarin, simple foreign language, hygiene common sense, current affairs, stories, etc., to provide opportunities for advancement.

Dr. Gu said that in addition to working hard in their respective positions, serving patients, and striving to assist the poor, sick, and elderly, the hospital also strives to engage in other related social undertakings, in order to contribute to the liberation of the nation. He believes that the Chinese people's understanding of scientific medicine, like other scientific departments, has not yet been fully understood, and that research on the country's inherent medicine, especially Chinese medicine, lacks scientific methods, which is a major obstacle to the future development of the nation. Therefore, he believes that every scientific medical scholar and pharmaceutical entrepreneur today must start from here and open up a broad road for the nation's scientific medicine. He said that Nanyang Hospital will focus on increasing beds for the poor and sick in response to the actual situation and needs of the country and society, promoting disease prevention movements, and especially concentrating more effort on cultivating and training medical talents. In the past three years, they have focused on this, regardless of whether they are graduates of Xiehe, Tongde, or other medical colleges, in order to provide them with internship opportunities before formally practicing. They have long accepted a large number of them for training, painstakingly cultivating talents for the country and society. Apart from the Chinese Red Cross Hospital, perhaps only they are doing such hard work at the cost of sacrifice. However, they believe that before the country undertakes such undertakings on a large scale, it is best for socially far-sighted and ambitious capitalists to come out and cooperate, expanding their medical talent cultivation and training business through investment. Then, the hospital's success in the future will also be the success of the investors, and the contribution to the future of society, the nation, and the country will be truly immeasurable.

"Social undertakings should be made public to society, and powerful people in society should resolutely stand up and support excellent social undertakings." After saying goodbye to Nanyang Hospital, I deeply felt this saying. (End)
