### How to Implement the Outline of Cultural Propaganda Policy

Modern world wars are not just wars of military force, but also wars of culture. This means not only competing in strength but also in intelligence. It's not just about making the enemy fear our power, but also making them admire our virtue. This kind of new strategy is not uncommon in Chinese history. The military strategist Sun Wu had the art of "attacking the heart," and the Confucianists Confucius and Mencius had the idea of "subduing people with virtue." Furthermore, after several failures in his revolution, Mr. Sun Yat-sen repeatedly advocated the strategy of "propaganda is more important than combat," urging revolutionaries not to rely solely on military force but to focus on propaganda. (See Mr. Sun’s speech during the Kuomintang reorganization on December 1, 1923: "Success depends on party members, not solely on the military." And his speech to party members on December 30 of the same year: "The Kuomintang's method of struggle should focus on propaganda and not solely on military affairs.") Because the coercion of military force is temporary and localized, while the influence of culture is permanent and comprehensive. In particular, we Eastern nations have always respected the "Way of the King," which is completely opposite to the "hegemony" thinking of Europe and America. Today, in order to overthrow England and the United States and build a new world order, we should fully develop the characteristics of Eastern culture to assist in armed forces to complete the war objectives. Therefore, since our National Government entered the war, we have proposed the request of "Establishing the Outline of Wartime Cultural Policy". (See the editorial of this newspaper on February 15), hoping that the government will establish a comprehensive system for wartime cultural propaganda. Recently, the National Government has announced the "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy," which is in line with our expectations and is indeed gratifying.

The "Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy" announced on June 10 first determined the direction of the wartime cultural propaganda policy, clearly stating: "On the one hand, promote the completion of the Greater East Asia War, and on the other hand, strive to rebuild and develop Chinese culture, as well as integrate and create East Asian culture, and further contribute to the world culture of the new order." From then on, not only will the cultural propaganda workers of government agencies have a clear direction to follow, but the general public and the media can also be actively encouraged and mutually exhorted to cooperate in many ways under a common direction in order to achieve its thorough implementation. With such a clear direction, everyone no longer needs to be hesitant. This direction should be the mobilization of all official and civilian cultural propaganda forces. As long as the ultimate goal is to move towards this banner, we must fully utilize our abilities and bravely advance.

The Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates seven major points, with the main points clearly stated and necessary explanations added. Concrete measures for establishing a comprehensive system of cultural propaganda have been detailed. On the negative side, we must liquidate the crimes of Anglo-American aggression, eliminate the poisonous thoughts of Anglo-American individual liberalism, and eliminate the despicable psychology of relying on England and the United States. At the same time, we must prevent the disruption of international communism, eliminate the poisonous thoughts of class struggle, and promote China's inherent national ethical concepts. It specifically addresses the current special phenomena and clearly reveals the elimination of hedonistic, decadent, indulgent, and trivial habits. It also points out and corrects the erroneous ideas of blindly restoring the past and blindly worshiping foreign and rejecting foreign cultures. All these negative struggle goals actually require not only cultural propaganda to be promoted vigorously, but also the general public to be vigilant in their actual thoughts, speech, and behavior. However, we must never show fear of these objects that must be eliminated. Especially those engaged in cultural propaganda work must improve their self-confidence and carefully observe, analyze, and study with the solemn and heroic attitude of medical scientists and chemists in order to thoroughly eliminate them. Just like dealing with germs, we can only eliminate them after recognizing and studying them. If we only know to be afraid and avoid them, the result will be very dangerous.

On the positive side, the Basic Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy stipulates that we must: (1) Recognize the completion of the Greater East Asia War as a prerequisite for the realization of all East Asian ideals; national collectivism as the standard for the construction of a new East Asian order; and Chinese culture as a part of East Asian culture. We should grasp the essence of Sino-Japanese culture, promote East Asian culture, consolidate the East Asian axis, and complete the mission of the war. (2) Cultivate a diligent, positive, upward, and self-disciplined outlook on life, and cooperate with a sense of practical responsibility to complete the wartime system and enhance the overall strength of the country's combat. (3) Integrate the common will of the nation, develop the creative abilities of the whole, and revive the inherent culture to strengthen the foundation of Chinese culture. (4) Popularize science education, assist scientific research, improve science and technology, and reward scientific inventions. (5) Concentrate cultural talents, unite cultural forces, adjust cultural undertakings, and establish a comprehensive system of cultural propaganda. All these points are briefly explained in the basic outline announced by the government, which coincides with what this newspaper has advocated and suggested recently (see the Selected Editorials of Shen Bao, Volume 1). We have always believed that negative sanctions are not as good as positive leadership. This is true in politics, and it is crucial in culture. Now, the main focus of the government's cultural propaganda outline is on the point of positive leadership. The stipulation of the above points can be said to be the most reliable measure to meet the public's expectations. What we demand today is rapid and sincere practice. This not only depends on the efforts of the relevant authorities, but also on the enthusiastic participation of people from all walks of life.

The most important point in implementing the Outline of Wartime Cultural Propaganda Policy is that the government authorities should focus on positive leadership rather than negative sanctions. It is about enriching and strengthening the cultural propaganda institutions themselves, and about ensuring that cultural figures can work with peace of mind and unite in politics and economics. Especially the last point has a decisive effect on the entire policy. We sincerely hope that the government will pay special attention to this. Only when the real talents are concentrated and the real cultural forces are united, not just formally and numerically, but also substantially, can the greatest force to ensure the implementation of the policy. In the cultural sector, we hope that after the publication of this basic outline, the shadows of the past will be swept away. Everyone should strengthen their work and cultural unity with their own abilities and sincerity. In particular, the protection of the lives of cultural figures, the division of labor and cooperation in cultural undertakings, the revival of Chinese culture, and the integration and creation of Chinese and Japanese cultures depend first on the self-awareness of cultural figures themselves and the pioneering leadership of advanced elements. We really have an unspeakable feeling of anticipation.

In yesterday's Weekly Commentary, there was an article by Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida entitled "Words of a True Japan Expert and a China Expert." Some of the translations were not perfect, so they are supplemented and corrected as follows, hoping that readers will compare and refer to them.

(1) The first sentence of the first paragraph should be translated as: "Koo Hung Ming, a world-renowned civilization critic produced by modern China."

(2) Lines 1-3 of the fifth paragraph, "The Japanese patriotic spirit... did not understand the true meaning of Japan," should be changed to: "The Japanese-style patriotic spirit is gradually leading China to the light. The reason why they became revolutionaries is not so much that their actions in certain situations in Japan would provoke anti-Japanese movements, but rather that they had a praiseworthy sense of awakening..." The third line of the same paragraph, "did not have any revolutionary meaning," should be translated as "did not have the meaning of inciting revolution."

(3) The last paragraph is a quotation from Mr. Koo Hung Ming, so quotation marks should be added before and after. The first sentence is best translated as "Today's Japanese are actually true Chinese who have absorbed the essence of the Tang Dynasty." The last three sentences should be translated as: "Although it is good for Japan to use the sharp tools of modern European civilization, it must be based on the moral heart of the East to protect this flower and land."

### Pang Bingxun Delivers Speech to Reporters Clarifying His Aspirations for Participating in the Peace Movement Will Go to Nanjing to Meet Chairman Wang and Present His Thoughts

Jinan, 13th (Central News Agency) After arriving in Jinan, General Pang Bingxun met with Chinese and Japanese reporters at the Shandong Hotel here at 10:00 a.m. today, clarifying his aspirations for participating in the peace movement, saying: "What I am currently worried about is how to carry out the suppression of the Communists. I have always held a consistent idea that the Communist Party is absolutely not allowed in China. The loyal soldiers of my 40th Army, 27th Army, and Newly Compiled 5th Army have continuously fought against the Communist army for three years. And I also strongly advocated the suppression of the Communists at the several generals' conferences I convened in Chongqing. It can be seen that my lifelong commitment to suppressing the Communists is unwavering. The work of suppressing the Communists is an essential path for peace and national construction. Furthermore, since Japan implemented a new policy towards our country, I was deeply moved at the time. In addition, countries restored the abolition of extraterritorial rights and returned concessions. Therefore, the anti-Japanese forces in Chongqing were instantly destroyed. Therefore, for the purpose of truly saving the country, I led my troops to participate in the peace movement. I will strengthen my belief in the future, and I am willing to cooperate with friendly forces to eliminate the Communist bandits in order to remove obstacles in East Asia. I also intend to absorb as much as possible the remaining forces of Chongqing in North China. Furthermore, I will go to Nanjing soon to present my thoughts to Chairman Wang."

Yan Xiwu's Speech in Nanjing

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) Yan Xiwu, Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the First Army Group and Commander of the 24th Division, arrived in Nanjing yesterday. When reporters heard the news, they went to visit him and were honored to hear his speech as follows: "I do not often come to Nanjing because the defense of the cities in northern Jiangsu is important, and I cannot leave my post without permission. This trip to Nanjing is specifically to meet with the Chairman to ask for instructions and report on the situation of our army's suppression of bandits and the recent defense situation. I have long advocated the Chairman's great policy of peace and national construction. I followed Commander-in-Chief Li to participate in the peace movement. Over the past two years, I have witnessed all the bright facts, which have made me more convinced. Therefore, the more I participate in hard work, the more interested I become. As for the current situation in northern Jiangsu, taking the defense zone of our army group as an example, the bandits have disappeared, the local area is gradually becoming peaceful, and the people can live and work in peace. This is because Commander-in-Chief Li has always taken the protection of the local area as his responsibility, and the troops under his command can obey orders and work hard. Indeed, without eliminating the bandits, there is no way to stabilize the local area. Without local stability, there is no way to implement good policies. It is even more necessary to promote the policy of peace and national construction as the task of our army, that is, to follow the intentions of Chairman Wang and Commander-in-Chief Li, and start from stabilizing the local area and loving the people to make the military and the people united. Then we can increase the work of peace and construction, and work hard to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, to achieve the great plan of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism, and to coexist and co-prosper with friendly nations."

### The Chinese Communists are Increasingly in a Difficult Situation Mao Zedong to Go to the Soviet Union

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) According to reliable sources, after the Soviet Union announced the dissolution of the Third International, the Chinese Communist Party has become an orphan without a parent. Although it has not yet exposed obvious difficulties, it can be predicted that its future destiny will inevitably fall into a difficult situation without a doubt. Recently, Chongqing has exerted great pressure in various military and political aspects, which is clear evidence. The top leaders of the Chinese Communist Party are currently extremely anxious, so they have decided to send Mao Zedong to the Soviet Union at the end of this month to appeal to the Soviet Union about the current situation and future trends of the Chinese Communist Party in order to win the sympathy of the Soviet Union.

### Zhang Chongshan, Leader of the Chongqing Youth League, Participates in the Peace Movement

Kaifeng, 13th (Central News Agency) Zhang Chongshan, who was formerly a leader of the Anti-Japanese Youth League in Chongqing, deeply feels that since the National Government entered the war and Japan adopted a new policy towards China, the value of the War of Resistance has been completely lost. Therefore, he recently secretly broke away from Chongqing and came to Kaifeng. According to Zhang, he was studying at Waseda University in Japan when the incident broke out. After returning to China, he went to Chongqing via Xi'an and Luoyang and was active in political circles, being a sharp figure in the Chongqing Anti-Japanese camp. After arriving in Kaifeng, he revealed the recent real situation of Chongqing as follows: Because of fear of Japanese aircraft bombing, all administrative organs in Chongqing have been moved to the suburbs to work, which takes about two hours by car to reach. Whenever Japanese aircraft raid, Chongqing is completely paralyzed. In the air raid two years ago, 20,000 refugees were suffocated to death in air-raid shelters. The reason is that Japanese aircraft came several times, and hundreds of thousands of refugees in Chongqing's air-raid shelters could not go out for a moment. They were tightly sealed in the shelters and gradually suffocated. The refugees tried to open the door to go out, but were stopped by soldiers. The crowd then rushed to the exit, but because the door panels were blocked by the crowd, they could not be opened. As a result, the crowd suffocated one by one, and the number of dead reached 11,000. The scene was extremely tragic. Therefore, this is not the fault of the bombing, but must be blamed on the Chongqing army. Although the Chongqing authorities made various propaganda afterwards, it was too far from the truth, and the people gradually did not believe it. The Chongqing authorities, seeing that their prestige had fallen, in order to alleviate the instability among civil servants and to give them hope for the future, propagated the "relocation plan," ordering all agencies to start preparing for work from next year. The so-called relocation refers to the return to Nanjing, so none of the civil servants believed it. Later, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan successively visited China, Manchuria, and the Philippine Islands. When Chongqing heard about it, it was greatly shocked. At the same time, people in Chongqing no longer trusted the United Kingdom and the United States. When the government of that day declared that it would return the exclusive concessions in China to the National Government, the Ta Kung Pao criticized the United Kingdom and the United States, making them feel embarrassed. Also, the exaggerated propaganda made by the British last time to recapture Burma, etc., was not believed by anyone in Chongqing. As for the United States, because it constantly provided a large amount of military supplies to the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union, but the aid to Chongqing was almost extinct, so it expressed great dissatisfaction. After the news that General Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying led 70,000 troops to participate in the peace movement was published by the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao and other newspapers, the residents of various places in North China who lived in Chongqing became more eager to return to their hometowns. When I arrived in Luoyang, I heard General Pang Bingxun broadcast a declaration of peace, which had a profound impact on the various dignitaries in Chongqing. The general public's desire to escape to peaceful areas is becoming increasingly strong.

### Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi Newspaper's View: British and American Policies Towards Foreign Races

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – A Yomiuri Hochi editorial in Tokyo on the 12th, titled "British and American Policies Towards Foreign Races," pointed out that the recent delay in repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act in the United States was due to the racial discrimination inherent in the Anglo-American worldview. It forcefully argued that, to correct this erroneous view and pave the way for the peaceful development of East Asian nations, the power of the Anglo-Saxon race must be eradicated. This is indeed insightful and thought-provoking. Excerpts of the main points are as follows: At this time of increasing progress in the Greater East Asia War, what causes us the most indignation is the extremely hateful and contemptuous attitude that Britain and the United States, based on their mistaken notions of racial discrimination, continue to display towards people of color. For example, the South African Federal Parliament recently passed a law prohibiting Indians from purchasing land in the provinces of Natal and Transvaal. During the period of widespread coal mine strikes in the United States, the Packard Motor Company in Detroit, as recently as the beginning of this month, experienced a strike based on the reason of excluding black laborers. Even the U.S. House of Representatives, in an effort to appease Chongqing, had considered amending the Chinese Exclusion Act, but this has now been shelved. As a result, the truth of America's contempt for China has been exposed, placing it in an embarrassing situation. The United States, under the guise of being an ally, deceived Chongqing and Chiang, attempting to exploit them as the front line against Japan. Chongqing was taken advantage of, willingly accepting American command as an allied nation. But let us look back at the history of Chinese immigrants to the United States. It began in 1850 with their recruitment to mine gold in California. However, within ten years, anti-Chinese sentiment arose in America. Subsequently, treaties were signed in 1868 and 1880. By 1882, the United States completely closed its doors based on the Chinese Exclusion Act. Before the movement to exclude Asians became serious due to the expulsion of students in 1906, which also impacted Japanese immigration, the focus was solely on overseas Chinese. Because excluding the Japanese could create significant problems in the Pacific, while the Chinese government was powerless to intervene at the time, the atrocities against the Chinese continued unabated. Overseas Chinese were even used as test subjects for new forms of capital punishment, and "Chinatown" in San Francisco was treated by Americans as a display of exotic curiosities. The "anti-miscegenation laws" implemented in the southern states of the United States were imitated by enacting laws prohibiting Americans from marrying Mongolians, equating Asians with blacks. Furthermore, in 1917 and 1924, immigration laws were enacted to completely exclude Chinese and Japanese from the American continent. Today, the United States, witnessing Japan's friendly measures towards China, such as the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of exclusive concessions, fears that its hypocritical mask of "justice and humanity" will be torn off. Therefore, under the direction of the authorities, the House of Representatives proposed amending the Chinese Exclusion Act. However, since the review of the bill began, there has been much opposition. The House Immigration Committee, fearing its rejection would affect America's policy towards China, announced a postponement of the vote. By this point, even those who once deeply believed in America's friendship with China must now see that America views China as a slave. As for the issue of discrimination against Indians in South Africa, it began as early as 1860 when Indian laborers were recruited to work in the province of Natal. The Anglo-American people inherently possess a sense of superiority and discriminate against people of color. This, coupled with conflicting economic interests with the Indians, spurred the rise of the anti-British movement in India, leading to significant historical problems. Britain and the United States dare to act against the tide during this time of war, causing such major events. This shows that their erroneous notions of racial discrimination are deeply ingrained and beyond redemption. The American people, in order to maintain their own survival, have exhausted their capacity for aggression and oppression against other nations. The British conquest of India, the Opium Wars, the American invasion of Hawaii, the occupation of the Philippines, and the private torture of black slaves are all confirmations of this. The British and Americans are so tyrannical and ruthless that the result will be nothing more than digging their own graves. Therefore, we must continue to engage in fierce battles with them to annihilate them. Unless we overthrow Britain and the United States, there is no path to survival for the East Asian nations. This is something that the entire East Asian people must keep in mind.

### German Scientists Invent New Thermometer

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) – Dentsu News Agency reports that German scientists Klenze and Reinhart have invented a new type of thermometer. This thermometer uses a colorless liquid to replace the colored fluid normally used, as the colored fluid rises and falls erratically at excessively high or low temperatures. This colorless liquid, after a special process, can accurately measure temperature fluctuations from 200 degrees Celsius below zero to 400 degrees Celsius above zero. In contrast, mercury freezes at -36 degrees Celsius.

### Philippine Inspection Group Arrives in Japan

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) – The Philippine inspection group to Japan, led by Manila Mayor Kinde, and a group of 19 people arrived in Japan at 10:00 AM on the 13th, and are scheduled to arrive in Tokyo on the 14th. Furthermore, Mr. Di Lang, Director-General of the New Philippine Service Group, and Mr. Tomoto Hisayoshi, head of the Japan-Philippine Association, were very pleased to have the opportunity to meet again. According to reports, Mr. Okamoto and Mr. Di Lang met 11 years ago when Mr. Okamoto was a vice-consul at the Japanese consulate in Manila. At that time, Britain and the United States wanted to oppress the Filipino people as puppets, so Mr. Di Lang, as a lawyer, fought against Britain and the United States to prevent this from happening. He advocated for Philippine independence to awaken the Filipino people and ignite their passion for national liberation, and was repeatedly suppressed by American officials. He was rescued from danger several times by Vice-Consul Okamoto. After the establishment of the new Philippine government, he took on the important position of Director-General of the Service Group. He came to Japan as one of the members of the first Philippine Inspection Group to Japan and was overjoyed to meet Mr. Okamoto again.

### The Battle of the Sea of Japan and the Battle of Jutland (1)

– Ito Masanori

The two major naval battles of the 20th century occurred on May 27th and May 31st. However, people generally doubt whether they will ever see such large-scale naval battles again, and it is questionable whether it will actually happen. But I believe there is still hope of seeing them. In this situation, reviewing the historical significance of this Battle of Jutland, I believe, is even more important.

(1) Tactical Thinking and Tactics

During the Russo-Japanese War, Japanese Admiral Togo decisively initiated a bold decisive battle in front of the enemy at a distance of 8,000 meters. However, during the Battle of Jutland, British Admiral Jellicoe cautiously initiated a cautious evasive maneuver from a distance of 24,000 meters. Comparing the two is very meaningful. The former bravely advanced on the path of annihilation, while the latter was an action that only attempted artillery fire. Obviously, there is a huge disparity in strategic planning between the two, and there is also a very different tactical ideology. The difference between the Battle of the Sea of ​​Japan and the Battle of Jutland can be specifically said to be caused by the fundamental differences in the concepts of naval warfare between the commanders-in-chief of Japan and Britain. The difference lies in tactical thinking, which is completed by the commander-in-chief. I completed the annihilation tactics, while they missed the opportunity.

So, what was the artillery battle like after it unfolded? Admiral Togo waited for an opportunity while being bombarded by the enemy, without reaching a parallel combat position or an effective artillery range. At 2:10 PM, the entire Japanese fleet (12 ships) began bombarding simultaneously at a distance of 6,000 meters from the enemy. The shooting was truly amazing. At 2:20 PM, the battleship Oslyabya, at the front left of the enemy, was enveloped in flames. At 2:50 PM, the bow sank and fell out of the battle line (sank at 3:20 PM). At 3:00 PM, the flagship Suvorov was also surrounded by flames and abandoned from the battle line. Commander Rozhestvensky was seriously injured, and command of the main fleet was transferred to the second ship, Alexander III (overall command transferred to Rear Admiral Nebogatov). The second ship was also dropped out of the battle line at 3:08 PM. The third ship, Borodino, first attempted to escape and was temporarily able to escape at 3:25 PM due to the misty rain.

During this first attack of approximately one hour, the Togo fleet fired a total of 150 shells with a caliber of 8 inches or more, of which 50 were fired within the first ten minutes. This really broke the world record for naval battles. In contrast, what was the Battle of Jutland like? At 6:30 PM, the British main force began bombarding the enemy at a distance of 12,000 meters, but there were no firing orders or instructions for distributing artillery fire. Instead, the 24 ships arbitrarily decided on targets and began bombarding. German Admiral Scheer used his specialty, the turning maneuver, to repel the British ships in one go. This first artillery battle was only ten minutes long. But these ten minutes were very important. At this critical juncture, the British army became a mess because of Jellicoe's order to reduce speed by 14 nautical miles. Only 12 ships were able to fire, which was only half of the entire fleet. Among them, Duke of Iron fired six shots, Sandela four shots, and Eland and Ending Cow one shot each, totaling twelve shots. In fact, two shots hit the German Kenighark, two shots hit Maguraff, three shots hit Louzauni, and one shot hit Defflinger, for a total of eight hits.

(2) Japanese Bombardment and British Bombardment

Originally, the number of hits often shifted depending on the weather conditions. The sea conditions at the time of the Battle of Jutland were very foggy and hindered aiming, but the waves were very slight. The conditions during the Battle of the Sea of Japan were the opposite. The six-inch guns on the hull were almost completely washed away by the waves, and the waves were so fierce and the rocking of the ship was relatively large. The ratio of artillery destructive power to armor defense power was almost equal in 1905 and 1916. However, the Japanese fleet had already achieved the effect of artillery fire during the first attack, which determined the future of the battle. On the contrary, the British fleet only destroyed the six-inch-caliber gun of the German ship Derfflinger, and damaged the starboard side of the Keton Shark, causing it to tilt and immerse 4.5 degrees in the water, and then broke the wireless electrical components of the Maguraff. This pales in comparison to the firepower of the Togo fleet.

Later, due to successive artillery battles, the British army inflicted considerable damage on the German army. This was because 33 main battleships fired at the same time, and even stray bullets that were not blocked would have a considerable effect. However, the British ships were hit by 21 German fleets as severely as described above. In this respect, the Togo fleet in the Sea of Japan was much more superior.

During the second engagement from 7:04 PM to 7:20 PM, the number of shells fired by the British main battleships still recorded in history was 128, of which only 29 were hit (15 ships were not recorded, if these ships were added, the total number of shells fired was probably around 250). Due to such artillery fire from the British, the German ship Louzauni fell out of the battle line, and the four ships on Hipper's line lost most of their combat power. At that time, the British suffered very little loss, and everyone believed that the artillery battle was advantageous to the British. However, comparing this with the Battle of the Sea of Japan, a world of difference can be found.

The second attack in the Sea of Japan started at 4:00 PM. The enemy escaped by taking advantage of the mist. At 6:00 PM, the third search was conducted, and they were immediately attacked fiercely. In this battle, the new German battleship Alexander III was fatally struck, and the same type of Borodino was sunk. In other words, in the artillery battle on the first day, the enemy lost four of the five new main battleships. Compared with the results achieved by Nelson in the Battle of Trafalgar, the results of Jellicoe in the Battle of Jutland were completely different.

(3) Significant Differences in Tactical Movements

It is very interesting to compare Jellicoe's fleet movement with that of Togo's fleet. Admiral Togo repeatedly performed right-angle battles, two right-angle battles, or all-at-once turn-around battles no less than ten times. Whenever the enemy attempted to retreat and escape, our fleet would chase forward to make contact, and would often put pressure on the enemy's leading ships from North Li Dong, or from the North and West. In short, he tried to block their escape route to Vladivostok. Jellicoe did the opposite, easily allowing the German ships to escape to the west, and was very slow to maneuver for another battle. This is also a difference between the Battle of the Sea of ​​Japan and the Battle of Jutland.

In addition, a more interesting comparison is that German Commander-in-Chief Scheer implemented the all-at-once turning maneuver of the fleet three times (when retreating at 6:38 PM, when attacking at 6:55 PM, and when retreating at 7:17 PM) and cleverly escaped the bombardment of the British army. However, our Admiral Togo also implemented the same all-at-once turning maneuver three times (2:56 PM, 3:48 PM, 4:35 PM), cleverly capturing the Russian warships. The "all-at-once turning maneuver" in Japanese is "Gefechtskehrtwendung" in German naval language, and is the most outstanding of fleet movements. It is the most important and most difficult movement, but the British Navy has not practiced it in the main fleet in recent years, so there is no suitable term. The British sometimes say "Swingaround maneuver" and sometimes call it "Simultaneous wheeling away". But Jellicoe himself said in his book: "This kind of movement, in the case of a large fleet, only causes confusion and danger, so this tactic should be avoided." Therefore, he never thought that on May 31, 1916, his enemy had actually implemented it against him three times. Because he believed that this movement was not suitable for large fleets, he assumed that the enemy would not use this tactic either."

In Jellicoe's naval battle report, it was recorded that every time the German army turned around and retreated, "the enemy disappeared because of the mist and smoke," but no mention was made of the turning movement. Jellicoe knew this only after reading Scheer's History of the Battle of Jutland in 1923. His assistant, Admiral Beatty, did not know this either. To prove this, you can look at Beatty's report, which was published in the British Admiralty's naval battle report on the Battle of Jutland in 1920. Attached to it was a battle track chart, which completely omitted the German army's reversal tactics at 6:55 PM and 7:17 PM. This certainly proves that Beatty did not know that the German army had implemented reversal tactics at that time. The chart, which detailed the movements of the two armies, did not record this, which can only prove that they did not know. Beatty knew about it seven years after the Battle of Jutland, in 1923! There is reason why the British army failed in the decisive battle and was criticized!

Looking back at this turning movement, Admiral Togo performed it three times in the great naval battle that took place in the Strait of Japan eleven years before the Battle of Jutland (one of which was a continuous two times, so it can also be called four times), using this to block the enemy from escaping. This is one of the major reasons for completing the earth-shattering annihilation battle. Jellicoe may have said that he did not encounter a similar shaped movement in the Battle of Jutland. The greatness of the Battle of the Sea of Japan, even from the point of view of this movement, is unprecedented. (Tao: Translated from the June issue of Chuo Koron)

### The Axis Powers Have Long Been Fully Prepared to Defend the European Continent: An Impenetrable Mediterranean Wall Has Been Built from Italy to the Southern Coast of France

Berlin, 11th, Central News Agency Telegram: The Mediterranean war situation has entered a new phase due to the Anti-Axis forces occupying Pantelleria Island, causing extreme tension in the mainland and Southern Europe. A German military correspondent recently inspected the Mediterranean coast in Southern France and has now returned to Berlin. According to him, regarding the "Mediterranean Wall" situation along the southern coast of France from Italy to Spain, the German Supreme Command has taken comprehensive measures in the southern coastal area of France to prepare for future developments, with similar measures being taken elsewhere. Following the advance of the German army, German construction teams have arrived in southern France to build the "Mediterranean Wall." This "Wall" is not only defensive in nature but has also become an important base for attacking the enemy's supply lines in the Mediterranean. The defensive capabilities of any small point along the coast are extremely strong, and the ports have become powerful fortresses. Airfields also appear to have been built in various locations. The Germans have built submarine shelters, the "Atlantic Wall," and western fortresses over the past five years and have considerable experience. Therefore, this "Mediterranean Wall" was built using past experience. Moreover, due to the suitable climate along the Mediterranean coast and the abundance of bays and mountainous areas, construction progressed easily. Currently, the Axis forces have sharp troops stationed behind this "Wall" to prevent enemy attacks, adopting a wait-and-see approach.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reports: The Anti-Axis side, especially the British newspapers, are currently discussing the issue of invading Europe. The Berlin military only commented on this yesterday, saying, "We are prepared." The Anti-Axis and neutral countries appear to be greatly concerned about the invasion, but there is no such feeling in the military circles of Central Europe. Experts believe that this indifferent attitude is due to the German military having taken various military measures not only during the past few quiet months but also having established special defense facilities long ago. Regarding the Strait area and the Atlantic coast, defensive arrangements were immediately initiated after occupation, and the southern coast of France was also closed off in November 1942. Military officials assured that "all vulnerable points in Europe are now armored and continuously strengthened." It is also learned here that although occasional detailed articles on these defense facilities are published, the enemy cannot discern the overall strength of this defense. There is no specific expression of the German plan itself, and the German side has no doubts or hasty reactions. The military here clearly believes in the strength of Germany and its Axis allies and therefore has no doubt that they will achieve victory in future military developments.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to a Tongmeng News Agency reporter here, the main war in Europe has now progressed from land warfare to a period of decisive battles in the air. Regarding the Eastern Front, the German and Soviet air forces are currently engaged in a fierce battle for air supremacy. On the Western Front, the German and British air forces are also exerting their power to the fullest, as is the case in the Mediterranean. Military observers stated that the current air war has reached its peak, and the decisive battle of total mobilization of land, sea, and air forces on both sides is clearly approaching. The Anti-Axis camp is currently making every effort to promote the imminent landing attacks on several key points in Europe. The reporter then listed several reasons why the Anti-Axis forces cannot land in Europe. Since the completion of the Atlantic defense in May of this year, there is no gap to exploit along the coastline from the northern tip of Norway to the Bay of Biscay in the south. In particular, the southern coast of France has almost become a practical artillery position. The Anti-Axis countries must use enormous manpower and resources to invade Europe, not to mention the loss of their ships. Military observers also discussed that when the Anti-Axis forces want to launch an offensive on the European continent, the Soviet Union must simultaneously launch a large-scale offensive on the Eastern Front, but in reality, the Soviet Union does not have this combat capability. The reporter also said that the Axis forces have completed all preparations to resist the enemy's reckless actions. The German Supreme Command is currently considering that there is no need to launch a summer offensive on the Eastern Front this year, and it only needs to deplete the Soviet military's combat power in order to win the future decisive battle with the Anti-Axis forces. With this strategy, Germany is working to coordinate the occupied areas.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Since the sudden tension in the Mediterranean war, the Anti-Axis forces have repeatedly declared that they will invade Europe. The German People's Observer newspaper specifically published an article on the 12th entitled "Confident in National Strength and Complete Preparation" to explain Germany's confidence in defending the European continent. The general idea is that it would be a mistake for us to ignore the current difficulties, because to achieve the final victory, we must overcome these difficulties. The enemy has been eager to discourage our morale, but they have now clearly failed. Threats of indiscriminate bombing and the destruction of the German nation have instead proved that the enemy is aware of the difficulties of its situation and cannot cope with the war. Looking at the map, it can be seen that today's war situation is not comparable to that of 1918, because in 1918, six major powers attacked Germany and its allies, but today the two sides are evenly matched. It is expected that the European continent after the war will begin reconstruction work, the scale of which will be unprecedented in world history. We certainly know that there are still many difficulties ahead, but we are confident that if we use past experience to overcome the various current difficulties, our goals will certainly be achieved in the near future.

### The Mediterranean War Situation Has Now Entered a New Stage

Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency citing news from London, British officials announced last night that the Italian garrison on Lampedusa Island south of Pantelleria has surrendered to the Anti-Axis forces.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reports that Lieutenant Wei Bai recently communicated from Catania, Sicily, saying that Pantelleria Island has an area of only eighty-three square miles. It is unprecedented in military history that such a small island could withstand such intense bombing. The island's heroic defenders, including some German squads, bravely resisted the enemy's sea and air offensives for five weeks, and were forced to cease resistance on June 11 only due to a lack of drinking water.

Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency reporters here announced last night that Pantelleria Island has fallen. Rome now expects that the Anti-Axis forces will invade Sicily and Sardinia in the near future. The public is discussing all the actions of the Anti-Axis forces that have already been obtained from this perspective. At the same time, Lampedusa Island is still being bravely defended by its small number of defenders. Pantelleria could have resisted for longer if it had not been for the lack of water. Such difficulties are unlikely to occur on larger Italian islands, and plans to defend Sicily and Sardinia have been specified in great detail.

The Battle of Pantelleria Island
Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency, it was stated here last night that the resistance on Pantelleria lasted from May 9th to June 11th. During these thirty-three days, the garrison on the island displayed extraordinary bravery. The Italian Air Force and anti-aircraft guns shot down 162 British and American aircraft, eliminating 800 Anti-Axis air force personnel. In addition, 16 Anti-Axis aircraft were shot down by German fighter planes, 8 of which were shot down in a single day on Thursday. The island is 14 kilometers long and 8 kilometers wide, with a total area of 830,000 square kilometers. The terrain is mostly flat, with only a few high points near the coast that can be used for defense, making the defense of the island quite difficult. In the rocks of the highlands, there are caves that can shield aircraft, and the aircraft can take off from these caves to the adjacent airfields. The island has this convenience, so a part of the air force used the place as a base, but it is not easy to develop this base. The island's air defense largely relies on Sicily, which is only 100 kilometers away. Italian military circles emphasized that even if the Anti-Axis forces attempt to land on Sicily, Pantelleria Island is not very important, because Malta is a strong naval and air base, and its distance from Sicily is similar to that of Pantelleria. Moreover, the Anti-Axis forces now occupy Tunisia, so Pantelleria Island is only a weak link between the African coast and Malta. It is believed that after being damaged by British and American air raids, the possibility of greatly improving it as a base is unlikely. Pantelleria's previous importance was because it could be used by the Axis side as a base for the air force and a small part of the fleet to compete for transportation traffic in the Strait of Sicily and maintain the supply of German and Italian troops in North Africa. Regarding the fate of Lampedusa Island south of Pantelleria, Rome also has no illusions. The general view here is that the island is absolutely isolated and has only a small number of defenders, so it will sooner or later succumb to the Anti-Axis forces. Italian newspapers commented yesterday on the loss of Pantelleria Island, saying, "Pantelleria Island is a typical model of the Italian military's resistance and fighting spirit. If the enemy attempts to advance north from Pantelleria Island, they will encounter major difficulties. Pantelleria Island has done its best in terms of human capabilities to resist the enemy's advance. The Italian military's resistance will only stop when the last possible hope has been exhausted." The Tribune stated that the island's resistance lasted for six weeks, not just thirteen days as claimed by London Radio. The newspaper said, "The Pantelleria Island incident cannot prevent us from continuing to fight a magnificent and resolute battle. We will fight bravely wherever the enemy appears."

Several British and American Ships Were Sunk
Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: The German military authorities stated on the 12th that the German Air Force had achieved great results in the sea area of Pantelleria Island, meaning that the German Air Force's powerful new bomber squadrons bombed Anti-Axis ships in the Strait of Sicily and the sea area of Pantelleria Island day and night on the 11th, achieving great results, sinking one 8,000-ton transport ship and 13 landing ships, and severely damaging 5 large cargo ships, totaling 25,000 to 30,000 tons. In addition, three enemy cruisers and eight other warships were damaged, including one heavy cruiser that sank after being bombed, and one heavy cruiser and one light cruiser were severely damaged and lost their combat effectiveness.

### Speculation on the Candidates for Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Invasion of Europe

Stockholm, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to Huitong News Agency, the diplomatic correspondent of the London Observer claimed that General Marshall has a high chance of being appointed as the Commander-in-Chief of the British and American Allied Forces for the Invasion of Europe, and General Wavell may be the Chief of Staff of the Allied Forces for the Invasion of Europe. If the position of Commander-in-Chief is held by an American general, then the Chief of Staff must be a British general to be satisfactory.

### British Land and Air Forces Inspect the North African Battlefield

Lisbon, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news from the Anti-Axis headquarters in North Africa, British Secretary of State for War Sir Grigg and Secretary of State for Air Sinclair arrived in North Africa yesterday. According to a Reuters reporter stationed there, officials did not indicate any specific purpose for their trip, but they are generally expected to participate in discussions at military headquarters and may inspect the Tunisian battlefield. Among those welcoming them at the airport were Air Marshal Tedder and Minister to North Africa Macmillan.

### Fierce Bayonet Fight on the Orel Front: Soviet Offensive Finally Collapses

Stockholm, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to combined news received here, the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, due to successive defeats, was eager to reverse the declining trend. On the morning of the 11th of this month, it launched simultaneous offensives at various points on the central and southern fronts. Under the cover of strong air force, it attempted to break through the German defenses. However, it was met with fierce counterattacks by the German army everywhere, resulting in the collapse of the Soviet offensive plan. According to reports, the Soviet army southwest of Moscow first launched attacks on the 11th at dawn in Dorogobuzh and Orel. The attack in Orel was particularly fierce. After a fierce attack on the German positions with air force and artillery, it attempted to seize the German front-line fortress with strong infantry units. However, the German army immediately launched a fierce counterattack, and after an extremely fierce bayonet fight, it repelled the Soviet army. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in this battle. At the same time, the Soviet army also launched a fierce attack on the 12th along the Mius River west of Rostov, but was also defeated by the German army's fierce counterattack. In addition, the German vanguard unit in the Azov coastal area of the Kuban bridgehead advanced north, eliminating Soviet resistance, and has advanced to a considerable area.

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Huitong News Agency military visitor General Steiffreit declared that after the Soviet army's fourth major offensive against the German positions in the Kuban bridgehead failed, the war activities in the area have suddenly decreased in the past week. In this fourth offensive, the Soviet army lost a total of 13 infantry divisions, 3 brigades, 6 tank battalions, and countless aircraft in a small area northwest of Krymskaya. Although the Soviet army suffered such heavy losses, what it gained was extremely limited. The Soviet army once broke into the German front line for three kilometers, but was soon driven back by the German counterattack, and 100 tanks and 350 aircraft were destroyed. It is expected that since Stalin is determined to seize Novorossiysk Port and the Taman Peninsula to control the Kerch Strait, he will continue to attack in the Kuban area. Fortunately, the German soldiers are dutiful, and with the assistance of the air force, all the Soviet army's attempts to seize the above bases through landing strategies have not been successful.

### Italians Turn a Deaf Ear to Roosevelt's Appeal

Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: President Roosevelt has appealed to the Italians to make a certain promise to the Allies and to ask the Italians to drive the Germans out of Italy. Roman political circles told Huitong News Agency yesterday, "We will regard Roosevelt's words as non-existent." Therefore, officials or the press will not comment on Roosevelt's words, but a qualified official told Huitong News Agency that Roosevelt made this appeal when the Anti-Axis countries had admitted that they could not make the Italians submit by other means, especially aerial terrorist attacks, which is indeed noteworthy. Making an appeal at this time shows that the Anti-Axis has no other way to approach the European fortress. If we consider the example of the Near East countries and how the Anti-Axis countries treated their former ally France, it is not difficult to imagine what position Italy will occupy in the international order created by Roosevelt. In any case, Roosevelt did not mention that if Italy follows his appeal, will all the American colonies be returned to Italy? Roosevelt cannot make this promise, because we already know the United States' intentions towards North Africa, and we also know how the United States will deal with Eritrea, our oldest colony. Because Roosevelt once promised the American people that he would not send American troops outside of the Americas, everyone can see that Roosevelt is determined not to keep his promises.

### Spanish Nationalist Party Establishes Headquarters in Rome

Rome, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Stefani News Agency reports: The newly established headquarters of the Spanish Nationalist Party in Rome opened yesterday, with the participation of the Spanish ambassador, the Deputy Secretary of the Fascist Party, and a representative of the German Socialist Party stationed in Italy. The Spanish ambassador delivered a speech strongly emphasizing the importance of this ceremony. Participants in the ceremony included members of the Spanish Nationalist Party and Italian legions that had participated in the civil war in Spain. The Spanish ambassador said that this represents a kind of unity between nations fighting for justice. Spain is invigorated by the sincerity of its leader General Franco, who will surely accomplish his goals. At the end of the ceremony, the crowd cheered for Spain and its leader, as well as for Italy and its Prime Minister.

### British and American Aircraft Attack Germany, Losing Sixty-One Aircraft

Berlin, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: According to news received last night, as a result of British and American air raids on German territory day and night on June 11, a total of 61 aircraft were lost. It is believed that many damaged British and American aircraft failed to return to their bases when they flew back. It was previously reported that 54 British and American aircraft were destroyed in this battle.

### Hungarian Army Chief Replaced

Budapest, 13th, Central News Agency Telegram: Hungarian Defense Minister General Nagy submitted his resignation on the 12th, and the vacancy was filled by General Chaty. The new Defense Minister Chaty has been the Commander-in-Chief of the Hungarian Army on the Eastern Front since 1942 and has achieved considerable results.

### On the Eve of the German-Soviet Decisive Battle: A Complete Picture of Soviet Combat Power (2)

Two. In the German-Soviet War, some people believed that the Soviet Union had an overwhelming advantage in human resources over Germany. With the progress of the German-Soviet War and the loss of most of the most densely populated European Russian regions, it is necessary to make some corrections to this point. However, according to the Soviet side, it is only "some" after all. Why do I say that? According to the Soviet Union, since the beginning of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet Union has successively moved important military-industrial industries in European Russia to the east, and the labor force has naturally moved with these industries. The residents in the German-occupied areas are almost only elderly people and children without labor capacity and non-combatants. This seems to be different from the facts. According to German reports, a large number of Soviet residents actively cooperated with the German army.

Since the beginning of the first five-year plan, the Soviet Union has been able to implement the mobilization of female labor. After the start of the German-Soviet War, the mobilization of female labor was thoroughly implemented. According to the report of the New York correspondent Snow, female labor accounts for 90% of the total labor force in the military industry.

This Snow's report cannot be taken as a standard, but it can be seen that in the past, female labor was only mobilized in all departments except those that were beyond their capacity, but now there are also female labor working in departments that were previously considered impossible.

Because the men replaced by these female laborers are successively conscripted into the army and sent to the front line, the Soviet Union's claim that, from the perspective of human resources alone, the Soviet Union's position has hardly changed.

The problem lies in the training level of soldiers and the proficiency level of labor. The training level of soldiers is far behind the German army. The fact that the Red Army's damage is greater than that of the German army is enough to prove it. Of course, this does not only depend on the training level of the Red Army soldiers, but also on other reasons, such as the quality of commanders, the overall quality, and so on. After a year and a half of actual combat experience, the Soviet Union seems to have improved a lot in this regard.

Speaking of the skill level of laborers, it declines with the prolongation of the war. This is a phenomenon that can be seen in any country, and it is not necessarily the case only in the Soviet Union. The Soviet authorities are desperately engaged in the training of skilled laborers, trying to fill this gap. Various societies have also launched socialist competitions between military factories, which cannot be overlooked from the perspective of increasing production.

The second is the issue of material resources. The proportion of the machinery industry in the Soviet Union's heavy industry sector is said to be 25%, which not only exceeds that of European countries, but also surpasses the United States. Since the beginning of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet Union first moved the machine tool industry to the Urals. As a result, according to the Soviet side, all of them in European Russia have been moved to the east.

Whether this is the case in reality cannot be determined because there is no clue at present, but as seen in the Winter War, the production of tanks and aircraft cannot be ignored. British and American aid to the Soviet Union is like a drop in the bucket in such a large-scale war. Even if the tanks manufactured in the United States can escape the commercial destruction war of national submarines and reach the Soviet Union, because they are not accompanied by the necessary parts, once they are damaged on the battlefield, it is difficult to repair them. Therefore, it is necessary to disassemble the American-made tanks and use their parts to repair them.

Therefore, the British and American materials are not as effective in the war against Germany as they claim, but rather, as Germany stated, the Red Army's mechanical units are completely self-made products of the Soviet Union. The military industry that moved to the east has been on the right track since the beginning of this year, so the Soviet Union's military production will reach its peak in the autumn of this year. Germany cannot but abandon its hopeful observation and take full and timely measures!

However, the production of Soviet aircraft is far behind the German army in terms of both quality and quantity. In modern warfare, where the existence or absence of air supremacy directly determines the outcome of the war, the Soviet Union can be said to be at a great disadvantage in this regard.

The backwardness of Soviet aircraft production is partly due to the shortage of light metals, and the biggest reason is the lack of technology. The Soviet Union is now recruiting a large number of aircraft manufacturers from Austria and related technologies, striving to develop technical backwardness, and at the same time building many new aircraft factories in the Urals and Biliya, pouring all its efforts into the production of high-quality aircraft.

Three. In the effort to carry out the war, the issue of transportation capacity is of great importance. In the 18th All-Union Communist Party Congress held before the German-Soviet War, Malenkov fiercely criticized the backwardness of the Soviet Union's transportation sector. At the same time, the resolution of the conference also required the rapid resolution of the backwardness of the transportation sector.

The 18th Party Congress, as it seems today, was convened because it saw the inevitability of the German-Soviet War. The special emphasis on the issue of transportation capacity in this conference is to illustrate that the backwardness of transportation capacity is directly a weakness of the Soviet Union's ability to resist war.

Originally, the backwardness of the transportation sector can be said to be a weakness in the socialist construction of the Soviet Union. Inheriting the Soviet Union, which lacked a transportation network in the era of Tsarist Russia, although it spent a lot of effort to build railways and achieved today's achievements. However, moments of chaos and delays in cargo transportation are not uncommon.

One of the reasons why the Soviet Union suffered heavy losses due to the rapid and decisive offensive of the German army at the beginning of the German-Soviet War was the imperfection of this transportation mechanism. Since then, the Soviet authorities have desperately engaged in increasing the capacity of the transportation sector, and any acts of nostalgia that delay the transportation of troops and military supplies are executed. Since adopting this strict policy, great improvements have been made, and the above-mentioned situation has not recurred.

The 18th issue of the Communist magazine published on September 17, 1942, contains an article by Itchiryushkin entitled "Soviet Railway Workers Under the Conditions of the Motherland War," which stated that the Soviet railway transportation sector completely overcame the backwardness of the war and satisfactorily fulfilled the tasks assigned to it. The records of railway workers being executed for failing to perform their duties, which were often published in Soviet newspapers, are no longer found.

It is said that the Red Army recovered most of the territory lost in the summer during the winter battle. At the same time, it began to lay the roads that were thoroughly destroyed by the German army. The Soviet Union is now desperately repairing the damaged railways and roads, which will undoubtedly be a major obstacle in the future summer operations. According to a report from the Swedish News Agency, the Soviet Union must completely change the German-style track width to the Soviet track width, which requires a lot of labor and time. At the same time, we cannot ignore the fact that the German air force is now intensifying its concentrated bombing of Soviet railway facilities.

Finally, let's talk about the morale issue, which is the most important factor in the Soviet Union's ability to resist war. As everyone knows, since the appointment of Hitler as Head of State in 1933, the propaganda work has been greatly implemented in order to cultivate the people's hatred of Nazi Germany, and it seems to have achieved a certain degree of success. After the establishment of the German-Soviet Non-Aggression Pact in August 1939, the attacks on the Nazis disappeared on the surface. However, after the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, the Soviet propaganda machine's attacks on the Nazis became as hot as fire again.

The Soviet Union completely blamed Germany for the outbreak of the German-Soviet War, aroused the people's patriotism, shouted to defend the motherland to deal with the German army's "invasion," and re-cultivated the people's hatred of Nazi Germany. This, coupled with the 25 years of thorough communist education of the people, has achieved great success, and is reflected in the defense battles of Leningrad, Sevastopol, and Stalingrad.

The fighting spirit of the younger generation is even more vigorous. Their Stalin worship has reached a feverish level. According to Soviet reports, they would not hesitate to go to death if there was Stalin's order. In the October 1942 issue of the Tzunamiye magazine. The middle-length novel "Near Moscow" by Evgeny-Gavrilovich is worth talking about. That novel depicts the battle situation of the Red Army near Moscow in the autumn of 1941. Various Red Army soldiers appear in the novel, which is enough to arouse the morale of readers. Its propaganda value can be said to be 100%.

On the one hand, the Soviet authorities abused the issuance of the Lenin Medal and the title of "Soviet Hero" to boost the morale of the people. On the other hand, they also called the front-line soldiers "Guards" and formulated three medals, namely, Guotov, Svrov, and Navsky, to encourage the Red Army's fighting spirit.

In short, the morale of the Soviet people is becoming more and more vigorous with the progress of the German-Soviet War, and the Stalin regime shows no signs of rupture. Red Army military commentators, whenever they have the opportunity, frankly admit that the Red Army's operational mobility is inferior to that of the German army, and use vigorous morale to make up for this weakness, and strictly rectify military discipline. However, no matter how vigorous the Soviet morale is, it is an undeniable fact that the Soviet Union has difficulty making progress in purely military operations.

### Public Concession to Conduct Random Checks on Households After Registration: Each Household Should First Fill Out a Guarantee for Verification to Ensure That the Household Registration Is Not Falsely Reported

In order to strictly prevent the activities of criminals, the police and Baojia authorities of the Public Concession have begun to conduct random checks on household registrations in some areas. If it is found that there is false reporting of the population or exceeding the reported population, they will be severely punished in accordance with the Baojia Regulations. Before the random check of household registrations, the Baojia authorities will issue a guarantee to each household to fill out, guaranteeing that the household has not over-reported or under-reported the population. If there is any deliberate violation, they are willing to be punished. This guarantee must be filled out within three days and submitted to the superior Baojia for verification, so as to have a reference for the random check of household registrations. This matter has been implemented in the Xinzha District, and other districts seem to be implemented one after another.

### Unblocking the Source of Oil and Sugar to Maintain Legitimate Needs

In order to maintain the legitimate needs of oil and sugar, the Shanghai Food Oil Industry, Wholesale Department and Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Department are requesting the military distribution authorities to make every effort to unblock the source, so as to provide long-term rations of oil and sugar to households and the business needs of various industries. The reporter of Shanghai News Agency learned from relevant parties yesterday: (1) In addition to the authorities ordering and transporting food oil from Dalian and other places to Shanghai for relief, they also supply raw materials to oil mills in Shanghai, such as soybeans, rapeseed, peanuts, cottonseed, sesame, etc. The oil produced by each factory is uniformly purchased and centrally distributed. (2) Due to the reduction of sugar reserves, the authorities ordered sugar from Taiwan and other places to transport it to Shanghai for relief. Therefore, there is no shortage panic of sugar in Shanghai. According to the quota of 16,000 bags per month, the cooperative is responsible for distributing sugar to households and special allocations for various industries.

The 38th Batch of Flour Was Sold Yesterday

After the 38th batch of household rice in the two concessions was sold on the 11th, the household flour of the same batch (each person can purchase 1 city catty at a price of 4.9 yuan) also began to be sold yesterday (13th). At the same time, according to the reporter of Datong News Agency, the 10th batch of household flour in Shanghai West has also been sold since the previous day, and each person is allowed to purchase 2.5 city catties at a price of 12.2 yuan.

It is reported that the third batch of sugar purchase certificates has been completely issued yesterday (13th), and the citizens of the square can take this sugar certificate to the designated sugar retail store to receive half a city catty of sugar at a price of 2.35 yuan. It is noted that the current batch of household oil and sugar is scheduled to stop selling at 6:00 pm on the 15th.

There is a Continuous Supply of Broad Beans

The Grain Group of this city has been assigned by the Military Distribution Association to a large number of soybeans, green beans, and broad beans. Although the prices have been approved for free sale, they can still be applied for allocation. Therefore, grocery stores, tofu stores, soybean milk stalls, sauce gardens, fried goods stores, bean product stores, and bean sprout stores can still choose freely for broad beans, except that soybeans must still be matched with green beans. As in the past, they can register, pay, and ship at the place.

### Large-Scale Plan to Ban Gambling is About to Be Realized: The Request to Close Gambling Dens May Be Approved: Expected to be Cleared Within Eight Months

It is learned that Shanghai will start a large-scale campaign to ban smoking and gambling in the shortest possible time, which will be presided over by the Japanese authorities and Mayor Chen of this port. According to a proponent of the movement, the two evils of smoking and gambling are enough to cause other crimes and cause social weakness. Therefore, if you want to guide people's livelihood into the right track, you must ban smoking and gambling, curb speculative psychology, and eliminate laziness. The member recently inquired about news from Chen and officials of the Japanese military police and the Works Bureau, and learned that the plan to ban smoking and gambling will be implemented in the near future. At the same time, it was also revealed that the request to close smoking dens and gambling places will soon be approved by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. At that time, the public will be asked to report secret smoking and gambling places. The large-scale work to ban smoking and gambling is scheduled to be carried out in eight months and is divided into four stages, with each stage lasting two months. Finally, it was also declared that once smoking and gambling are banned, Shanghai will pay attention to the elimination of other crimes.

### China Railway Company Agrees to Transport Relief Grain for Free to the North: Raw Wheat and Corn Flour for Relief is Being Negotiated: The Hotel Industry Donates a Full Day's Room Fee for One Day

It is heard that the Shanghai All Walks of Life North China Relief Association has reached an agreement with the China Railway Company to transport relief food for free, so that it can be continuously transported to the area to help the famine. All donations from all walks of life, no matter how large or small, are expected to be sent directly to the designated major banks and money houses, so that formal receipts can be obtained.

Mr. Zhang Yipeng Suggests Two Points: Since the establishment of the North China Relief Association, it has been very effective in raising funds. However, the needs of the disaster area are mainly food. Therefore, how to purchase a large amount of food with the relief funds raised is the most urgent task at present. At the same time, preparations must be made in advance for the food production in the disaster area next year. In view of this, Mr. Zhang Yipeng suggested two points to the Relief Association: (1) There is a kind of raw wheat in the Suhang area, with an annual output of more than 10,000 dans. This raw wheat is only used by the locals to make raw wheat liquor and is not used for other purposes. Moreover, raw wheat liquor is also the worst kind of liquor. If the production of liquor can be stopped for one year, and this raw wheat is used as relief food, the victims will benefit greatly. At the time of the current wheat harvest, if a detailed investigation can be conducted and purchased, a part of the relief food can be solved. (2) There is a kind of corn flour in the food, which is a special product of the Netherlands, and Germany also has it. Corn flour has a special feature, that is, whether it is dry land, water land, or wasteland, wherever other organisms cannot grow, only corn flour can grow. It is three feet high and can be harvested three months after planting. It is the most suitable plant for the disaster area. German military food is mostly corn flour, and Japan also has it. If seeds can be obtained and transplanted to the disaster area, there is no need to worry about the famine next year. The Relief Association has accepted the above opinions and sent personnel to contact the Grain Department. It is also learned that the Hebei Shanghai Fellow Association continued to hold famous actors and amateurs broadcasting yesterday at the French radio station, and the results were good, surpassing the first and second days. The actual amount of money received remains to be counted and announced today. As for the Great World, it has been scheduled to hold a charity performance today, and all the income of the day will be allocated as relief funds.

The Hotel Industry Regularly Charges Room Fees for Relief: The Shanghai Hotel Industry Association held a meeting with the industry to discuss emergency relief for the disaster in North China, and decided that the full day's room fee income on the 15th of this month will be used as a relief donation, and a soliciting team will be appointed to promote it separately. After the donations are collected, they will be sent to the disaster relief association for publication in the newspaper to show good faith.

### Special Self-Police Corps Organization Law: Organized by Designated Places: Work Does Not Have to Hinder Original Duties

In addition to the regular police officers, the Public Concession originally had Self-Police Corps to assist in maintaining order. Now, in order to meet the actual needs, the police stations in each district have instructed the buildings, newspapers, companies, shops, hotels, and public places in their jurisdiction to organize special Self-Police Corps separately, specializing in indoor order and security. In this way, the ordinary Self-Police Corps on the street will complement each other, and the effect can be achieved with half the effort.

Designated Places Organize Themselves: The details of the organization method and service method of the Special Self-Police Corps were learned by the reporter of Guofeng News Agency from the competent department of the Police Headquarters as follows: (1) The Special Self-Police Corps is organized by the places designated by the police station. The members are selected from the employees of the place. The number is determined according to the size of the place and the number of employees. The corps has a chief who is in charge of everything. (2) The Special Self-Police Corps must be formed within the time limit set by the police station. Before starting service, the total number of employees, the name of the person in charge of the Self-Police Corps, the number of Self-Police Corps members, the number of Self-Police Corps shifts, and the number of people in each shift shall be reported to the police station in charge. (3) The Special Self-Police Corps shall prepare red and white armbands. The armbands shall be made by the designated places themselves, numbered, and sealed by the police station in charge before they are valid.

Indoor Patrol to Prevent Unexpected Events: (4) The Special Self-Police Corps works in shifts day and night, specializing in indoor patrols and maintaining public order. When on duty, they shall wear the armbands and pay close attention to all activities in the room and people entering and leaving to prevent criminals from mixing in to disturb or engage in terrorist acts. (5) The red armbands prepared by the Special Self-Police Corps are not allowed to be worn outside. They are limited to being collected from the person in charge when on duty and returned when off duty. Except when going out due to chasing terrorist criminals from indoors, (6) If a terrorist act occurs in the Special Self-Police Corps room, the door shall be closed immediately to prohibit anyone from entering or leaving, and the police station in charge shall be reported to suppress it. (7) The work of the Special Self-Police Corps shall be based on the principle of not hindering the original work. They may continue to perform their original duties as usual and patrol the various places in the room from time to time within the specified time. Special attention shall be paid to the corners of the room that are not easily noticed by people.

### Theft Cases Occur Frequently in Nanshi: Warn Citizens to Be Vigilant and Cautious

According to a secret report, a large number of criminals have recently mixed into the Nanshi area, resulting in frequent theft cases, which may affect public order.

### Modern Japanese Painting Exhibition to be Held at the Dasin Company Art Gallery from the 15th to the 20th

At the juncture of constructing a New East Asia, the integration of Chinese and Japanese culture is becoming increasingly close. With the support of the Imperial Art Academy, the Japan International Cultural Promotion Society is holding a public exhibition of famous modern Japanese paintings in China to celebrate the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital and to solidify cultural cooperation between the two countries. This exhibition aims to introduce Japanese art and culture to the Chinese people, enabling them to gain a deeper understanding. Modern Japanese painting exhibitions are being held in Nanjing, Beijing, Shanghai, and other places. In Shanghai, the event is supported by various Chinese and Japanese organizations, including the Shanghai Municipal Government, the Japanese Embassy, the Shanghai Office of the Publicity Department of the Shanghai Office, and the Japanese Imperial Art Academy. The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is also providing assistance. The exhibition is scheduled to open to the public on the 15th of this month at the Art Gallery on the fourth floor of the Dasin Company on Nanjing Road. The exhibition will last for six days, ending on the 20th of this month. It is said that the exhibition will feature over sixty items, all carefully crafted masterpieces by Japan's top artists and treasures from the Japanese Ministry of Education. These are extremely valuable items that are rarely seen in ordinary times. This is the first time they have been brought to Shanghai for exhibition, making it a rare opportunity. It is also learned that the association will hold a preview at the Dasin Art Gallery today (the 14th) to invite leaders and celebrities from various Chinese and Japanese circles in the city to visit, and special invitations have been widely distributed. The public exhibition will open on the 15th, welcoming anyone to visit without the need for admission tickets. A large turnout is expected.

Brief Description of Works: One of the greatest characteristics of modern Japanese painting is that it reveals the "genius of the Japanese people in building a great modern nation on a foundation of venerable tradition." This is manifested in the flourishing of the arts, and can be said to be a uniquely Japanese "creative adaptability." Japanese painters, while acknowledging the dignity of the classics, also seek to infuse the scientific and formative character of modernity, opening up new avenues in design, brushwork, and coloration. In this way, brushstrokes and hues give a modern character to the artistic creation of Greater Asia, standing in a guiding position. A brief description of the participating painters and their works in this exhibition is provided below:

Takenouchi Seiho: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He passed away last year at the age of ninety. His style is not mere realism, but requires understanding his austere and detached spirit (Work No. 1).

Yokoyama Taikan: Member of the Imperial Art Academy, member of the Japan Art Institute. The Japanese spirit and the Greater East Asia spirit are entrusted to Mount Fuji, forming a grand vision and giving people a sense of the dawn of Greater Asia (Work No. 2).

Kawai Gyokudo: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. Together with the two artists mentioned above, he stands at the highest peak of the Japanese art world. In his paintings, one can savor the elegant Oriental flavor of mountain village autumn scenery (Work No. 3).

Araki Jippo: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He is a master of bird-and-flower paintings who strictly adheres to traditional spirit and standards (Work No. 4).

Komuro Suiun: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He draws on the spirit of Japan to express Southern School painting (Work No. 5).

Yuki Somei: Member of the Imperial Art Academy, professor at the Tokyo School of Fine Arts. He creates realistic works in rich colors, but is also skilled at conveying lightness and humor in light-colored ink paintings (Work No. 6).

Matsubayashi Keigetsu: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He conveys the Japanese spirit through ink landscape paintings (Work No. 7).

Kiyokata Kaburaki: Member of the Imperial Art Academy. He excels at depicting the customs of Japanese women two hundred years ago. This work depicts the appearance of a daimyo's family at that time, fully expressing a lonely style (Work No. 8).

White Reeds

### Huang Ma

— Feng Da Wen

Huang Ma was a maid in Lane 24. She was just over forty, but her hair was already streaked with gray. She had a kind face, but her movements always showed a capable air. She had been with her master for eight or nine years. Honesty, loyalty, and amiability were her characteristics. She got along with everyone, so almost everyone in the lane knew her—and knew she was a good person.

She was very busy. Every day—even in the coldest weather—she had to get up at four in the morning. Then she would light the coal stove, wipe tables, and dust benches... Her hands and feet never stopped until the evening, when she still had to serve the madams playing cards. There was never a moment to rest, and even though her wages had been increased several times, they were still only ten dollars a month. But she didn't complain, always blaming her own bad luck. Hoping to have a more comfortable future, she wanted to do more good deeds—which made her even more famous as a good person.

She was from Hangzhou. Her husband had died more than ten years ago, leaving behind a son who had been an apprentice in a cloth shop before the war. Later, he went missing due to the war and had not returned to this day. Otherwise, he would be twenty-three years old this year. This event had made Huang Ma cry for days and nights. It still hung heavy on her mind, often bringing tears to her eyes. She hoped her son would return safely, both to carry on the Huang family line and to allow her to enjoy some happiness. So she often fantasized about happiness, dreaming of paradise.

But, "Sitting and waiting won't bring it to your door! You have to work hard yourself," this truth suddenly dawned on her. After that, she began to work hard.

She put in a lot of research and realized that to be happy and fortunate, the first thing you needed was money. The wages from her employer weren't even enough to spend, and she wouldn't be able to save up enough in a lifetime. She had to think of a way to get rich. So she often kept an eye out on the street for dropped wallets or other items that could make her a small fortune. But she was disappointed. So she had to change her approach and think of another way.

Sure enough, she found a tool that could bring her great wealth—charity lottery tickets. When she first heard that the first prize was five hundred thousand dollars, she felt like she had discovered a shortcut to wealth, and was as happy as if she had already won the first prize. She continued to inquire about the price of each ticket and then started to buy one. She wrapped it carefully in a black handkerchief and put it in the pocket of her underwear, sewing the pocket shut with thread.

"Wow—there might be five hundred thousand dollars in here, I can't lose it—"

She calculated: "If I win the first prize, no, even if it's the second prize, that would be great! I'll definitely rent a front room to live in by myself, and I'll have to find a way to get my only son back. Also, these clothes are so tattered that they can't even be patched anymore, I want to make a new set. I have to be thrifty usually, this money can be used for old age, and I can even buy a burial shroud and coffin in advance."

She had memorized the ninth day of the month for the drawing. The first, second, third... her heart was so anxious, but time seemed to pass so slowly.

On the ninth day, she couldn't sleep early in the morning, waiting anxiously for the five hundred thousand dollar first prize. She specially spent seven cents to buy a Shen Bao newspaper and asked the character-reading master at the entrance of the lane to check it for her.

"No!"

"Really no? Not even the second or third prize?" She didn't believe it and took it home again, asking her employer's son to check it again. But the result was again: "No!"

She wasn't discouraged by this. In the future, she would save money and spend less, taking out two dollars from her wages each month to buy a few more tickets, hoping to win eventually. She bought them for more than half a year, but never won anything, not even the last prize. She counted the old lottery tickets she had saved, and there were already five of them.

"Ting! This is a scam, is it really impossible to win even once? I'll never buy them again."

One clear morning, around seven thirty, Huang Ma took a small vegetable basket, got ten dollars from her employer, and went to the vegetable market. At the corner of An'nan Road, a crowd of people was gathered. She walked over out of curiosity. It was a gambling stall. She stopped and saw a person standing opposite her take out five dollars, bet it, and immediately turn it into ten dollars; then it became twenty dollars.

Money! Money was tempting her! "Isn't this a good way to get rich!"

She very readily reached out, took out ten dollars, and bet it. Sure enough, it turned into twenty dollars. She prepared to turn around and leave, but a person standing next to her, with a stern face, blocked her way. "Bet again! You'll definitely win!"

"Okay! I'll bet one more time!" She thought she might as well win a little more.

But this time, it wasn't as smooth as the last time. All twenty dollars slipped into the hands of the dealer. Her body trembled, and she looked at the twenty dollars very reluctantly. She took out the only ten dollars she had saved for a long time from her pocket, and bet it again. She said a sentence of "Amitabha" in her heart, praying silently. But where did the Bodhisattva have the power to help—she lost again!

She walked away, without a single penny on her. She couldn't buy vegetables, so she had to go to a friend's house and borrow twenty dollars, preparing to buy vegetables again.

But when she passed by the gambling stall, she couldn't help but feel envious again, wanting to win back the money she had just lost. She decided to bet one more time. At first, she waited for a while, watching the numbers that had come out several times, and then solemnly put down the twenty dollars again. Her heart was filled with chaotic thoughts, only waiting for the judgment of fate.

"Eat!" Unfortunately, she lost again.

A blur appeared before her eyes, and her body began to tremble uncontrollably. Forty dollars! What a large amount! It was a full four months' wages—she calculated that her daily, mechanical life was already enough to make her suffer. For these forty dollars, she had to work for four more months; she thought it was terrible, four months requiring her to work like a cow or horse every day!

In the past, she had endured everything, feeling that as long as she persevered, the light ahead would come! Now, she was disappointed, and even more so, she thought of her lost son; in this life, her whole life, there would be no hope!

"What's the point of living?" She couldn't help but ask this question!

Returning home, she threw the empty vegetable basket on the table, walked to the counter, found a rope, tied it to the bamboo pole, and without hesitation, put it around her neck, ending her life.

### Joy in Fantasy

— Hu Ming Yang

Isn't this spring?

Everything is so beautiful.

Let us stroll in the spring wilderness,

And be temporarily intoxicated by the spring breeze.

We see the world destroyed beside us,

Time disappearing around us.

This space-time is irrelevant to us,

We are ignorant of this space-time.

We are leisurely strolling,

Vaguely rejoicing,

This realm is so blurred:

But who beautified all this?

"An indescribable emotion."

### Letters from a Small Building

— Yan Ping

One

Friend: Outside the window, a bleak wind and bitter rain are falling, and my heart is also kneaded into a chaotic mess. I feel suffocated and can't breathe. I want to confide in you, to pour out that supreme grief. I want to cry; cry for that miserable life. Bear with me and listen to a few words! You know that our classroom window faces the morgue. Whenever the professor teaches, we often encounter sorrowful rhythms, especially today. I will never forget a scene: When the biology teacher was talking about how to solve the "mystery of life," suddenly a tragic horn sounded. Friend, you will never imagine how tragic this horn was. Our whole classroom was stunned. A ripple of emotion stirred in my heart. I looked out the window. Yes, I saw this scene: In front of the morgue, a funeral parlor car and a bicycle carrying a coffin were parked. A ragged old woman covered her face and wept bitterly. Next to her, two young men in suits were strolling leisurely. Two bodies were carried out. One was put into the car, and then the two young men followed. The car sped away, and the other body was put into the coffin. Only the old woman sat alone in the rickshaw, the horn following... It was such a simple scene, friend! Perhaps you think it's a very ordinary thing, but I remembered Dostoevsky's "Poor People." I was dazed until the end of the class. I can't erase this scene. The wind and rain are getting heavier. Friend, can you tell me for sure what the mystery of life is?

Two

Friend: How painful is the heart of a person whose life is empty. I drink cup after cup of bitter wine, and tears run down my face, but I don't know when it will end. You say I'm sick, but I don't know what sickness is. I wander in front of the hospital ward every day, wanting to explore what sickness is. When I stood at the entrance of the mental hospital, suddenly a woman with disheveled hair rushed out. She stared at me. Her hair covered her face. Her figure still showed her beauty. She grabbed my hand, "Haha! Don't be a decent person, haha, it's not good to die poor..." I was shocked and stunned. My mind was a little dizzy, until the nurse pulled her away. She was a madwoman, but friend! In the soul of this madwoman, I saw the pure and supreme sincerity of mankind. You say that the hypocritical faces in the world are clear-headed? If that's really the case, then I'm willing to be a madman, I'm willing to enter the hospital, friend! Please tell me.

Three

Friend: The heavy wind and rain are still falling, and sorrow presses on my heart, it's about to crush me. Yesterday, I ran alone to the Bund. On the pier, I faced the river wind, wanting to wake myself up. A freighter was docking, and the crane was creaking, loading packages of goods onto the pier. "Hen yu! Hen yu!" The dockworkers' faces were strained. But I found an old man, he was so thin, his body shaking, the rope cutting into his bony shoulder. His pale face showed a flush, but friend! What a terrible scene! Blood suddenly gushed out of his mouth, sweat covered his forehead, he collapsed under the rope, the goods pressing on his chest. Now his face turned so pale and terrible, his protruding eyeballs staring at people, blood flowing from the corners of his mouth. He lay quietly on the corner of the road. Another young man took his place. A man with a whip glanced at him and snorted, "Overestimating yourself..." Although he was carried onto the ambulance], but: friend! Can you imagine this tragic scene? I ran back madly, but that gaunt face with sweat and blood... Friend! Is there such sorrow in life?

Four

Friend: Let me tell you another story that happened at the same time on the pier! A rough, dark-faced man and a companion were carrying a package of goods together. As they approached the exit to get the receipt, suddenly there was a sound of "pat, pat!" I saw a hand, the hand grabbed the cotton bale, grabbed the white cotton and hid it in his arms, sweat flowing on his forehead, but he was wearing a cotton jacket. Now the receipt was coming to him, his clothes were stripped, and inside were clumps of cotton, "pat, pat!" Purple and black welts rose on his muscles. His face, which had been expressionless, endured everything. When a foot kicked him and a shout of "Get out!" was heard, he seemed to wake up, tears flowing in his eyes, "Sir! I won't do it again next time, please help me, spare me." But the expressionless eyes did not blink. He begged, kneeling at his feet, "I still have an old mother, wife, and children at home..." "Get out!" With a shout of dismissal, he stood up hopelessly, looked at his companions with a pitiful expression, sighed, and walked out of the pier, a fallen figure disappearing. Friend! My tears were so many, filling my eyes. I want to ask you, is life really a struggle?

Five

Friend: The dark night swallowed everything, the dim street lights, I walked silently in the dark corner, suddenly: "Sir! Our girl is still young, please help us!" I turned around and saw the procuress giving that nightingale a fierce look, and then a small, thin hand, "Sir..." These intermittent words contained many imaginable words, my heart trembled, I looked at her eyes, her eyes filled with tears, glittering eyelashes, a color of plea for help. I respected and strengthened myself, broke free and went forward, "Alas!" A distant sigh came.

Friend! Do you know how sad I feel in my heart? There, perhaps, there are countless sacred souls, oppressed faces, huge shackles binding them, no struggle, no resistance, only enduring and swallowing tears, waiting for people to slaughter them. They pretend to smile, using their own hands to always pull and pull, when can they not drink this bitter wine? When can they be liberated? They will forever be tormented by poison, their lives ravaged, unpitied, unloved, they are nightingales despised by people, forever living in another world, friend! Is life always in different worlds?

Six

Friend: Two days of loneliness. I like to listen to stories. Last night, I heard such a story. The wilderness is barren, without trees, without green grass, and the soil is cracked. Countless people, with outstretched hands, are crying, struggling, tree bark, grass roots, Guanyin clay,... the flesh of corpses! One by one, they are gaunt, floating, collapsing,... snatching other people's children, closing the door and cooking them to eat, or exchanging them for one,... the wilderness is full of skeletons, ghosts,... what can be eaten is eaten, and then in the barren land, they raise their hands to the sky... Friend! We at least still have pancakes and fried dough sticks! Outside the window, it seems that countless ghosts are crying out to us...

### Random Notes on "Wine"

—

People who don't drink well frown when they take a sip of wine, as if they're eating bitter medicine. People who love wine see drinking as the greatest pleasure in life, it's really strange. But what kind of pleasure is there in drinking wine, no one can say. The Jin Shu states: "Meng Jia was Huan Wen's military advisor and liked to drink. Wen asked what was so good about wine, and why he was so fond of it? He replied: 'You have not yet understood the pleasure in wine.'" He was being mysterious and didn't reveal the secret. Bai Juyi has a poem: "Waiting for the chrysanthemums to bloom and the fine wine to mature, to get drunk with you and be in harmony with nature." Emperor Wen of Wei wrote to Wu Zhi: "When we are drunk and our ears are hot, we look up and write poems, at this time, we don't know the joy." He still didn't say what the pleasure was.

Perhaps drinking can eliminate worries and anxieties and forget everything, which is the "pleasure in wine." Bai Juyi's poem says: "The common folk call it a sorrow-relieving medicine (referring to wine), nothing is faster. One cup drives away worldly worries, another cup restores harmony with nature, three cups and you are drunk, sometimes laughing, sometimes singing wildly, in a daze. Who knows what else?" With this effect, most frustrated people like to drink. Li Bai's poem says: "To eliminate eternal sorrow with you." It's the so-called borrowing wine to drown sorrows. Listen, Chen Xuan said to his nephew Xiu Jun: "I am lonely in this world, suffering from illness and old age, my property is no different from Yan Yuan, and my name has not moved the ministers of state. If I don't drink pure wine, where else can I go?" This is definitely borrowing wine to drown sorrows. Tao Yuanming was unwilling to bow for five dou of rice, resigned and returned to his hometown, and wrote the Returning Home, which says: "Leading the children into the room, there is a pot of wine, I lift the pot and drink by myself, gazing at the trees in the courtyard with joy." He lived a life of leisure. He has a poem that says: "How can I express my feelings, I will muddle through with turbid wine, no one will know for a thousand years, I will use it to celebrate today." It can be seen that his full of complaints were all vented into the cup.

Men of letters and wine have an inextricable bond. Perhaps it's because wine can stimulate the nerves and excite the "Inspiration." The most heavy drinker was the poet Li Bai. According to Du Fu's poem: "Li Bai writes a hundred poems with a dou of wine, sleeps in the wine shop in Chang'an, the Emperor calls him but he doesn't get on the boat, claiming to be a wine immortal." It is said that Li Bai was in the Hanlin Academy, writing drafts for the emperor's edicts, but he was addicted to alcohol and often indulged in drinking. Sometimes, when the Emperor issued a decree, he was drunk and could not wait. The attendants splashed water on his face to wake him up a little, and then ordered him to pick up the pen. Soon, he would finish it, and the Emperor admired his talent. Getting so drunk is a feat only he in history could achieve. But in the end, because he offended Gao Lishi when he was drunk, his bad luck began, and he spent the second half of his life in poverty and wandering, writing those good poems: "Living in the world is like a great dream, why work so hard to live? So I get drunk all day long, and lie down against the front pillar." "A pot of wine among the flowers, drinking alone without anyone to accompany me, I raise my cup to invite the bright moon, facing my shadow, there are three of us." What a touching poetic scene of wine.

The multi-talented Su Dongpo was also a lover of wine. There are many places in his poems where he talks about wine. His Nangezi poem says: "After waking up from the Maojiu wine, I'm still sleepy, the dream of the immortal village can't be realized... Bringing wine to Hengshan in the rain, sleeping late in the evening with my clothes on, I don't know when the bells and drums announce dawn, in my dream I become a butterfly and feel light..." How tasteful it is. If drinking wine always brings this feeling, everyone would be willing to have a few drinks.

Today, people drink wine and only know how to play guessing games. The ancients liked wine orders, but because they were too civilized, they were not popular. According to Zhang Bangji's Zhuangmanlu of the Song Dynasty, "At the banquet, they carved wooden figures, sharpened their bottoms, and placed them on a plate. They tilted left and right like dancing, and when their strength was exhausted, they fell. Depending on where the carved figures fell, they would reward the person there with a cup of wine, called Quanjin Hu." This has disappeared today. In Zhu Genglu compiled by Ming Zongyi, there is an even more romantic record: "Yang Tieya was fond of music and women. Whenever he saw a singing girl or dancing girl with small feet, he would take off her shoes and carry the wine cups on them, calling it the Golden Lotus Cup." In modern people's eyes, three-inch golden lotuses wearing embroidered shoes are already not aesthetically pleasing, so taking them to carry the wine cups would be nauseating. I wonder if today's dance fans would also take the dancing girl's high heels to carry the wine?

It is said that in ancient times, they used a bird's feather to make wine, called Jiu Jiu, which was extremely poisonous. Many loyal ministers and martyrs committed suicide with it when they failed. But it is also said that there is a kind of wine that will not kill you after drinking it. It is said that in the past, the Xiangshan Mountain on Junshan Mountain had fine wine, and drinking it would make you immortal. So it moved the heart of Emperor Wu of Han, and he ordered Yao Ba to seek it. The result was naturally successful, but before it was presented to the emperor, it was stolen and eaten by the witty Dongfang Shuo. Emperor Wu was furious and wanted to kill him, but the witty man calmly said, "If the wine is effective, killing me will not kill me; if it is not effective, what is the use of the wine?" He said it so humorously! Emperor Wu didn't know whether to laugh or cry. Dongfang Shuo, with the courtesy name of Manqian, was a servant of Emperor Wu of Han, and his words were full of interest, often admonishing Emperor Wu in a humorous tone. Stupid and selfish emperors sometimes do need humor like Manqian's to correct their mistakes.

Regarding drinking wine, there are also a few strange stories, originally recorded in the Taiping Guangji: Yuan Dai did not drink, but he would get drunk from the smell alone. Later, he met an extraordinary person who used a needle to pick out a small worm from the tip of his nose, saying: "This is the wine bug." That day, he drank a dou of wine. There is also the Tang Zhong Shiyi's record: Jiao Sui (who was good at drinking and was known as one of the Eight Immortals of Wine) stuttered and could not say a word to guests, but after getting drunk, he could answer like a stream, and was called Jiu Chi at the time. There is also Zhang Xu, a famous calligrapher of the Tang Dynasty, who liked to drink, and after getting drunk, he would call out and run wildly, and then pick up the pen and write in a flamboyant style. Later generations called him the Sage of Cursive Script.

I always thought that drinking wine was an elegant or despondent pastime. If you think you are noble and a poet or a refined person, or at least think you are a hero like Qiu Ran Ke or Wu Song, then you have to learn to drink several dou at a time, getting drunk. Usually, if a person wants to use a clear mind to do something for his family and society, he should not associate with drunkenness. You must understand that alcohol is anesthetic. After drinking, the nerves are stimulated and the circulation of blood is accelerated, resulting in involuntary excitement, which is more likely to spoil things than to accomplish them. Some people think that they can drown their sorrows with wine, but it is only temporary. After sobering up, they feel more sad and suffer even more. Alcohol is also corrosive. After drinking, the blood vessels of the stomach wall are eroded and soaked in alcohol. As a result, the cells swell, and after a long time, they will be poisoned and the blood vessels will harden, causing a lot of damage.

Let us recite the poems and prose of ancient and modern men of letters about drunkenness. It is enough to appreciate the poetic taste of wine, so why drink to the point of being drunk, like a drunkard?

### The Problem of Reorganizing Small Banks

The National Government has recently spared no effort in actively promoting its financial control policy. First, it transferred the bill clearing institution to the Central Bank to complete the central bank in name and reality, thereby increasing its prestige. Now, it is conducting concrete research on the issue of reorganizing small banks, which is truly a welcome development in the advancement of the National Government's financial policy.

According to general rumors, the National Government's approach to small banks requires a minimum capital of three million yuan to strengthen the banks' substance, which would be quite effective in the reorganization effort. Given today's price levels, a capital of one or two million yuan is indeed insufficient for a bank to fully function. It is only natural that the National Government authorities are focusing on increasing capital.

However, it would be a mistake to assume that the substance of small banks will rapidly improve simply by increasing capital. It is essential to understand that increasing capital is only the first step in the solution. The important issue lies in how to normalize banking operations and allow banks to perform their original functions. Increasing capital is not particularly difficult, but if the business becomes abnormal after the capital increase, it will create an even more complex and difficult situation. Therefore, we must be particularly cautious about this.

From this perspective, relying solely on the amount of a bank's capital as a standard is not the most appropriate in practice. It would be more effective to conduct a thorough observation of the deposit content. This is worth noting in the bank reorganization strategy, and it also represents a further expectation for the National Government's implementation of financial policy.

The reorganization of small banks will undoubtedly involve many difficulties and complexities in its implementation. We hope that the National Government authorities will overcome these with the greatest enthusiasm and effort. The future should be one of smooth coordination. In addition to placing high hopes on the National Government's proactive efforts, we also hope that the financial community can exercise self-discipline and assist in order to achieve tangible results.

### Bank of Communications to Handle Rural Investment Loans; Requests Government to Provide Funds and Grant Exclusive Operating Rights

The Bank of Communications was ordered to launch agricultural loans and added an Agricultural Economics Department within the bank on May 5th of this year, dedicated to handling agricultural finance business. Based on the initial survey results of the rural economic conditions in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, as well as the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai, the designated agricultural finance business policy includes: (1) improving rural economic conditions, (2) increasing agricultural production, and assisting in agricultural promotion and extension, (3) guiding farmers to establish self-managed and self-enjoyed financial systems and institutions, and (4) supporting the establishment of owner-farmers. Currently, it is actively proceeding step by step according to the policy. In the initial stage of implementation, it plans to focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans. A reporter from the Central News Agency, in order to understand the actual extent of the bank's handling of agricultural loans, specifically inquired about the details from the bank's Agricultural Economics Department, which are recorded as follows:

Establishing Four Management and Investment Offices

Since the establishment of the Agricultural Economics Department, the bank originally targeted cooperatives for rural loans. However, because the cooperatives in various rural areas have been dissolved, it was decided to send personnel to Dongtai in northern Jiangsu, Wuhu in Anhui, and Jiaxing in Zhejiang to establish agricultural economics offices to handle rural investment and loan matters before a sound organization of cooperatives is in place in various locations. Each office will administer the loan business of three to four counties, and it must be prepared and established within two months.

Starting Investment and Business Loans

The bank recently accepted requests from agricultural organizations near Shanghai, and in areas such as northern Jiangsu and Wuxi, to first handle loans for cotton merchants, pig farming loans, agricultural technology loans, agricultural tool manufacturing loans, farmland management, and other business loans. After sending personnel for a second on-site investigation, it was determined that there is an urgent need for capital adjustment, so loans have been approved, totaling 12 million yuan, and lending has begun.

Requesting Exclusive Agricultural Loan Operating Rights

In order to promote agricultural economic policies and fulfill the mission of establishing a rural financial system and institutions, the bank has specially submitted a request to the government for (1) exclusive operating rights for agricultural finance business, (2) provision of funds, and (3) compensation for net losses. It is reported that the bank's intention to request the government to grant exclusive operating rights for agricultural finance business is to adapt to the government's implementation of wartime economic policies, actively increase production, and further guide central farmer organizations to establish cooperative credit unions in various counties and cities. Therefore, the bank's agricultural finance business is different from ordinary business and is not aimed at making profits. As for the recent rumors that various banks and firms are forming a rural loan syndicate with the Bank of Communications as the center, this is completely contrary to the facts, which the bank authorities have denied.

### Regulations Approved for Discounting Bank and Firm Deposit Reserves

The Bankers Association, in order to regulate the finances of its members, has agreed with the Central Reserve Bank that the deposit reserve funds paid by various banks and firms may be used as collateral for discounting. With the guarantee of the Bankers Association, they may apply to the Central Reserve Bank for discounting and turnover. The details of the discounting method are as follows: (1) Using deposit reserves as collateral for discounting is limited to banks and firms that have paid all of their deposit reserves in cash. Those who use cash substitutes for 46% of the deposit are not included. (2) The amount of the discount is limited to a maximum of 80% of the reserve funds paid. (3) Applications for discounting should be made using the seven-day promissory notes of the respective banks and firms. (4) Applications for discounting from banks and firms should be accompanied by a separate letter of certification from the Bankers Association, proving that the loan is indeed for the purpose of providing temporary funding and should not be used for other hoarding or speculation purposes.

Reserve Funds Fully Paid

In accordance with the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Financial Institutions and the Detailed Rules for Implementation, various banks and firms have paid their deposit reserves into the reserve accounts opened with the Central Reserve Bank. The required deposit reserve is (1) 5% or more for fixed deposits and special current deposits, and (2) 10% or more for current deposits. The payment reserves for the aforementioned deposits are determined according to the balance at the end of each month and must be made before the end of each month. Since June of this year, all reserves for fixed, special current, and current deposits have been paid in full in accordance with the law.

Conducting Semi-Annual Settlements

Silver and money firms have scheduled to conduct the semi-annual settlement on June 30th. In accordance with the law, at the end of each business year, they are required to prepare a business report, balance sheet, inventory of assets, and profit and loss statement within three months, which will be submitted to the Central Reserve Bank and forwarded to the Ministry of Finance. It is reported that various firms are preparing to conduct the semi-annual settlement, urging the return of funds due in six months, and continuing to facilitate lending for the purchase of agricultural products, provided that borrowers provide guarantees to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding.

### Citizens' Consumer Cooperative to Close Stock Subscription Tomorrow

Leaders from all sectors of the city, including financial, industrial, and commercial leaders, in view of frequent price increases and the difficulty of making a living, have initiated the establishment of the "Shanghai Citizens' Consumer Cooperative." This is to collect major commodities in bulk and distribute them to members on a regular basis. Since the start of the stock subscription, approximately 40,000 shares have been subscribed. The Bank of China and the Shanghai Bank have been designated to collect the payments for shares. In order to expedite the process, the cooperative has distributed notices to all shareholders to pay their dues. It was learned yesterday that the stock subscription will close tomorrow (the 15th). All sectors are requested to complete the membership procedures within the next two days.

Dispute Arises in Paint Association: There have been two paint associations in the city, one named "Western Paint Association" and the other named "Coarse and Fine Paint Sundries Association." The two associations were previously instructed by the competent authorities to merge and form the "Shanghai Special Municipality Paint Association." After the establishment of the new association, the original two associations should have been abolished. It has recently been learned that the person in charge of the former Coarse and Fine Paint Sundries Association suddenly had a dispute with the new association and is now petitioning the competent authorities for instructions on how to proceed.

### Opinions on Improving the Lives of Farmers in the Suburbs of Shanghai

— Ma Jingnong

The lives of farmers are a major part of the national economy, and the soundness of farmers' lives greatly affects the strength of the nation. Today, as wars affect countries around the world, governments around the world are more concerned with and improving the lives of farmers than our country by several times: because the stability of farmers' lives and the increase or decrease in agricultural production directly reflect a country's wartime food policy. Therefore, improving farmers' lives is also an economic issue. In order to support the needs of long-term combat, we should often conduct extensive discussions on the concern for farmers' lives and the study of rural economics in the economic world.

Before the war, the lives of farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai existed for the most part dependent on the city, because the population density and land were not enough to cultivate. Therefore, many farmers entered factories or participated in various production businesses, and women also used their remaining time to do many side jobs. In short, because farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai did not have enough land to cultivate, in addition to planting some vegetables, miscellaneous grains, or flowers and fruits, most of them did not have the ability to be self-sufficient. After the war, because various factories closed one after another and urban life changed drastically, it directly affected their lives and exposed their own weaknesses. Especially in the last year or two, the suffering of farmers' lives in the four suburbs and the crisis of their future are even more unimaginable. Based on my own observations, I offer a few suggestions for the authorities or economic leaders to refer to in improving farmers' lives.

(1) Strictly Limit Land Sales: Although many farmers in the four suburbs feel that there is not enough land to cultivate, there are also quite a few people who own hundreds or thousands of acres of land. Because land is valuable, many real estate companies are engaged in the sale of land, as are local landowners or land brokers. Under such a degree of change, farmers who make a living from land are greatly harmed. Therefore, they are all living in a state of constant insecurity. The sale of land must be certified by the township head and the land bureau to take effect. However, there are many illegal sales or disputes, and even events that directly affect farmers' lives (such as the change of landowners and the increase of rent, etc.) are too numerous to mention. In order to stop the illegal sale of land and stabilize the lives of farmers, I hope that the authorities will use strict measures to restrict the sale of land and announce the implementation policy, otherwise, the use of farmers' lives in the four suburbs is very worrying.

(2) Organize Production and Sales Cooperative Institutions: China's agricultural production and sales originally had no organizational structure. Although there has been an indestructible tradition in the past, it has been affected by years of war and many difficulties that are difficult to reconcile. Therefore, the authorities need to give great power to improve the original production and sales mechanism into a cooperative form of mechanism. In the production aspect, try to use the existing agricultural professional talents in many agricultural farms to specialize in guiding improved farming, improved seeds, or improved animal husbandry and vegetables, and other agricultural affairs, in order to increase production. In the sales aspect, not only should the multi-faceted exploitation of brokers be improved, but the sales side should also purchase seeds, fertilizers, and farm tools to supply to farmers, seeking cooperation between production and sales. This not only reduces the difficulty for farmers in purchasing seeds and fertilizers, but also reduces the selling price of agricultural products. Although this matter is easier said than done, its importance is undeniable.

(3) Dredge Rivers and Abolish Various Unnecessary Tombs: There are few flowing rivers in the four suburbs of Shanghai, so in addition to a few more flowing rivers, most of them are silted ditches. When the rainfall is even, the irrigation of farmland can still cope. Once there is too much rain, such as the banks of the Yunzao River, it floods into almost a flood. Or, in the early years, such as the Hongqiao area, it was so dry that there was no place to drink water. Last year's drought and the high price of vegetables are clear evidence of this. I hope that the municipal council will investigate the circulation of rivers in the four suburbs and then dredge them to facilitate agricultural irrigation. The four suburbs are not enough for farming, but the Chinese maintain the tradition of tombs more than the hunger of life. If the land occupied by public cemeteries and charity tombs in various places in the four suburbs is calculated and changed for cultivation, perhaps it can maintain the lives of thousands of farmers. Therefore, if we can resolutely abolish various unnecessary tombs and rent them to farmers for cultivation, I don't think this is a meaningless thing.

(4) Increase Obligatory Agricultural Schools: Although Shanghai is the most culturally developed city, the number of illiterate people in the four suburbs of Shanghai is really shocking. According to what I know: In some villages concentrated in Yangxing to the south of Jiangwan Town, there were originally two or three hundred children who could be educated, but because of the lack of public elementary schools or because of economic poverty, only thirty or forty children were able to receive education. The authorities have already collected donations for the fields, so they cannot bear to sit idly by and watch many children drop out of school (there are certainly more children who have dropped out of school in various villages in the four suburbs). In order to eliminate illiteracy and popularize education, increasing obligatory agricultural schools or using the tea houses concentrated in various villages to run various educational lectures is really a matter that cannot be delayed.

Although food rations have been organized in the four suburbs, places like Hongqiao Town have not yet received such rations, so the lives of farmers in that area are more difficult than elsewhere. In addition to this, I hope that the wise municipal authorities will pay close attention to and improve the allocation of daily necessities and the supply of fertilizers.

Farmers in the four suburbs of Shanghai are living in extreme suffering. I hope that the wise and benevolent municipal authorities will choose to improve and save millions of farmers from the depths of suffering. (Moved to repay the loan scholarship)

### The Life of Work-Study Students

— Hui

The hard-working spirit of work-study students is often praised, but their lives are the most painful of all.

When the three of us poor students started school, we asked the school to waive some tuition fees. The school actually agreed to waive all of them, but they wanted us to teach some classes in the attached elementary school. Tuition fees can be waived completely, and teaching is a sacred thing, so we all agreed without hesitation and became work-study students.

Both middle school and elementary school only have half-day classes. We study in the morning and teach elementary school students in the afternoon. There are four or five classes every day, taught in succession, with no time to rest. There are sixty or seventy students in a class, and we practically have to shout ourselves hoarse when teaching. When the class is over, we are naturally exhausted, but we still have to take a large stack of composition books or math practice books home.

At first, there was no remuneration—no, the waived tuition fees were the remuneration. After some time, after repeated requests, the school agreed to provide us with a basic lunch, because it was often too late to go home to eat and then rush back to school for class. In addition, the school also sympathized with our suffering and gave us 20 yuan a month, but the tasks also came with it. We had to copy lecture notes for the school (which students had to pay to buy after they were printed), and calculate scores for the students after the exams. (The overall average grade was calculated according to the percentage of how many courses there were per week). Our work was extremely heavy, and we couldn't be negligent in the slightest when copying and calculating scores. Driven by a sense of responsibility, we never slacked off for a moment.

Our work is as heavy as that of elementary school teachers—a few fewer classes, but with additional tasks. However, our treatment is still far from that of the poor and suffering elementary school teachers. After all, we are still students, with no family burdens.

The principal was afraid that we would make more requests, and repeatedly assured us that he would solve our schooling problems for the next semester, and also constantly encouraged us: "Young people should endure hardship!" "Enduring hardship is tempering!" "You need to accumulate more experience!" We couldn't find a job, and we also needed to study, so we could only endure this kind of life.

I heard that next semester the principal is going to dismiss all the remaining teachers in the elementary school and recruit a few more work-study students.
