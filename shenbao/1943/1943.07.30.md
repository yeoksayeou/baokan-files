### We Must Create a Mirror

Yesterday, we discussed Japan's Fourth Central Cooperation Conference, which gathered representatives from various sectors to discuss plans for national prosperity and the people's welfare. Whenever there were criticisms of the government's policies, government officials immediately explained the reasons. For any proposals decided upon through discussion, government officials promptly expressed their sincere acceptance. In this way, the people's opinions had ample opportunity for expression, and the government showed genuine sincerity in accepting them. This is the key to the government and the people becoming one, generating a cohesive force. Therefore, we suggest that we should treat this type of Japanese conference as a mirror, examining it closely to identify all the blemishes, which must then be thoroughly cleansed and corrected. However, unfortunately, this mirror is not ours. If we merely copy the blemishes it reveals and the cleansing and corrective methods it uses, the blemishes may not be entirely the same, and the cleansing methods may not be entirely appropriate or suitable. Therefore, to accurately identify our own blemishes and to adopt more appropriate cleansing methods, we need to create our own mirror, and this mirror must be smooth, accurate, and free from distortion.

Furthermore, the blemishes revealed by this accurate mirror will undoubtedly be numerous. Some will be superficial dirt, some will be sticky grease, and some will be deep-seated ink. Therefore, the cleansing methods must be adapted accordingly, using towels, soap, or brushes, either individually or in combination. Once we know the types and locations of the blemishes and have the cleansing methods, the final and most important step is to diligently and faithfully apply the methods to the cleansing process. If we use the wrong methods, the surface blemishes may be removed, but the marks will remain unclear. If we misidentify the locations, the stains will not be cleansed, and the skin may be damaged. These are all things that must be carefully executed during the cleansing process.

Based on the above statements, we can divide the process into four steps: first, creating an accurate mirror; second, thoroughly examining all the blemishes; third, identifying the types of blemishes and determining appropriate cleansing methods; and fourth, following the cleansing methods, accurately identifying the locations of the blemishes, and diligently and meticulously cleansing them. These four steps are interconnected and mutually dependent; none can be omitted or neglected. Only through constant and tireless effort can we cleanse the blemishes and restore a fresh appearance.

What we have said may seem too abstract. But that is not the case. We must first present this matter metaphorically, so that everyone has an impression and an outline in their minds, and then everyone will realize the importance and necessity of this matter.

We ask again, if we have blemishes on our face, do we need to wash them away immediately? The answer must be unanimously "Absolutely yes!" Then, let us do our utmost to promote the realization of this matter!

But how exactly is this mirror constructed? How do we examine the blemishes? How do we determine the cleansing methods? How do we carry out the cleansing? First, the mirror is the public opinion institution, the institution for the people to participate in politics and express their opinions. It is an institution composed of representatives purely elected by the people from various regions and sectors. Second, examining the blemishes means that, during gatherings, the people's representatives each present the people's hardships and the ills of the political and economic situation. Third, determining the cleansing methods means that the people's representatives exchange opinions, discuss, and create proposals based on their own experiences and views. Fourth, carrying out the cleansing means that the government authorities sincerely accept the proposals made by the public opinion institutions, issue directives to all levels and responsible agencies for their effective implementation, and at the same time, the people's representatives return to their respective areas and fully explain the content and significance of the proposals to the people they represent, so that the public understands and assists the government in implementing them.

The nature of this type of public opinion institution is similar to the Central Cooperation Conference convened by the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association, which we have been introducing in recent days. Therefore, it can be said that the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Central Cooperation Conference are the mirror created by Japan to see its own blemishes. Japanese local representatives attending the Central Cooperation Conference is like using the mirror to carefully see the blemishes on the face. The Japanese people's representatives exchanging opinions and deciding on suggestions is like the method of cleaning the blemishes. The attendance reports of Japanese government officials and the declaration of acceptance of suggestions and the earnest implementation of suggestions is the effort to implement the cleansing. Under this step-by-step, top-down, integrated effort, the blemishes can certainly be removed, the face can be cleaned, and at the same time, more attention can be paid to nutrition at any time, and it is not difficult to have a renewed appearance.

Our country's current political and economic situation, and the people's living conditions, we must not hide it, are much more fragile and difficult than Japan's. That is, there are more blemishes on the face. Then, those with fewer blemishes on their faces still find it ugly and create mirrors to compare at any time and wash at any place. How can we, with more blemishes on our faces, be willing to be ugly and not know how to make mirrors to compare and even wash? Here, we should solemnly point out that the Japanese government's having a mirror to examine blemishes is not their stupidity, nor is it meddling. But our government's lack of a mirror is not our intelligence, nor is it saving trouble, let alone the absence of blemishes, but rather that our government authorities have not paid enough attention to this, or even if they can pay attention to it, they have too many concerns and have not been able to create it. This is a great regret in the government's and the people's inability to achieve a cohesive force.

At this time when the international situation is gradually moving towards a decisive stage, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is still to be striven for, our responsibility is very arduous, and our future status depends entirely on our efforts, so we feel even more the need to concentrate our efforts with one heart and mind. We have always believed that a purely public opinion institution is sufficient to communicate and reconcile the opinions and forces between the government and the people, and its rapid establishment is even more necessary today.

### Caring for Citizens, Widely Soliciting Public Opinion: Chairman Wang Inspects Shanghai, Hoping for Joint Efforts to Build a New Shanghai; Propaganda Department Explains the Significance of Returning Concessions

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — To inspect the general situation of Shanghai, the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, braved the summer heat and flew to Shanghai by plane at 4:15 PM on the 29th. Around 3 PM, various heads of institutions, including Xu Suzhong, Chen Qun, Li Shengwu, Gu Baohuan, Bao Wenyue, Ye Peng, Ren Yuandao, and the Japanese Naval Advisor Teraoka, as well as the Manchurian Ambassador Lu Ronghuan, arrived at the airport to see him off. At 3:50 PM, the Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, arrived in white National礼服, and amidst the respectful farewells of Chinese and foreign officials, boarded the plane along with the Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Chen Chunpu; the Minister of Construction, Chen Junhui; the Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Zhou Longxiang; and Military Commissioner Chen Changzu. Allied General Chayama also flew to Shanghai on the same plane. The military music was melodious, and the atmosphere was extremely warm. At 4 PM, the engine started, and the plane gradually ascended. Soon, the silver-grey Sea Gull special plane flew eastwards over the Purple Mountain Range.

Shanghai (Central News Agency) — This time, the National Government's recovery of the Shanghai concessions broke the shackles imposed on the nation and people by Anglo-American imperialism for a century, and realized the late Founding Father's will to "abolish unequal treaties" and "seek freedom and equality for China," causing great joy to the people. The Chairman is deeply concerned about the five million people who have long suffered under the oppression and exploitation of Anglo-American imperialism, and has particularly high expectations for Shanghai after the restoration of sovereignty. Yesterday afternoon at 5 PM, he arrived in Shanghai as the head of state to inspect, listen to local reports, solicit opinions from officials and civilians, and give guidance on future efforts. The heads of various institutions in Shanghai, having heard the news, gathered at the municipal government at 3 PM yesterday to prepare to welcome him and departed at 4 PM. Those who went to the airport to greet him in person included Mayor Chen Gongbo, Minister Zhou Fohai, Minister Lin Bosheng, Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Gong Mochun, Minister Mei Siping, Minister Luo Junqiang, Governor Li Shiqun, Secretary-General Zhao Shuyong, Su Chengde, Cen Deguang, Ma Xiaotian, Dai Yingfu, Liu Yangshan, Wu Guanxi, and over a hundred other officials, including heads of institutions from allied nations. At 5:10 PM, the Chairman's plane arrived in Shanghai airspace. All the welcoming officials lined up at the airport. At 5:20 PM, the plane landed safely at the airport, and Mayor Chen went to the door of the plane to welcome him. The Chairman, wearing a new National禮服 and looking radiant, smiled and greeted the welcomers. Accompanying him were Secretary-General Chen Chunpu, Minister Chen Junhui, and Vice Minister Zhou Longxiang. After leaving the airport, the Chairman rode in his car through the two concessions and went straight to the official residence to rest. The people of the two Shanghai concessions, hearing that the Chairman had arrived in Shanghai, were overjoyed. All the bustling roads were filled with welcome banners, and the atmosphere was exceptionally warm.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — The Propaganda Department announced that Chairman Wang left Nanjing today and arrived in Shanghai.

On the 30th of last month, when our ally Japan and our country agreed on August 1st as the date for the implementation of the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Chairman issued a statement,

informing the people of the country: (1) "We must exert our enthusiasm and do our best to make the Shanghai International Settlement even more stable and prosperous"; (2) "We must especially cleanse the Shanghai International Settlement of the toxins that have been steeped in it by Britain and the United States for a century, both spiritually and materially"; (3) "This base of Anglo-American imperialism should be transformed into a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, a connecting belt for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and further, a transportation hub for world peace"; (4) "After the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, there will be many things that require the cooperation of the government and the people. We must take on everything with a progressive spirit, in order to fulfill the late Founding Father's will to abolish unequal treaties, to live up to the great kindness of our ally Japan, and to meet the fervent expectations of the people of the whole country"; (5) "We also deeply hope that other related countries will follow the example of our ally Japan and quickly imitate the return of the Shanghai International Settlement"; (6) "We will make our best efforts to negotiate with France, and ensure that the return of the Shanghai French Concession is realized no later than August 1st of this year." After a month of efforts and the good offices of our allies, Italy has agreed with our country to simultaneously return the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement, and the recovery of the French Concession will also be implemented as scheduled on the 30th of this month.

Shanghai, which has been plundered by Anglo-American imperialists for a century, has now been completely restored, and the work of recovering the concessions has been successfully concluded. The late Founding Father's will to "abolish unequal treaties" and "seek freedom and equality for China" has now been realized. This is certainly due to the hard struggle of the people of the whole country for many years, and it is also due to the Great East Asia War eliminating the Anglo-American forces of aggression in East Asia, the peace movement, following the Founding Father's advocacy of national revolution to save China and protect East Asia, and our country's participation in the war, following our allies, uniting with the East Asian nations, sharing life and death, and our allies truly fulfilling their intention to help our country achieve independence and autonomy, so that our country can engage in recovery after its devastation, in order to share the rights and responsibilities as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere for independence and autonomy. Chairman Wang is deeply concerned about the five million people who have long been exploited by Anglo-American imperialism, has very high expectations for the future of Shanghai, and is deeply concerned about sweeping away the remaining poison of Anglo-American imperialism and promoting friendship and cooperation between China and Japan in order to complete the war and lead the East Asian nations to coexistence and co-prosperity. This time, he will listen to local reports, solicit opinions from officials and civilians, and give guidance on future efforts, hoping that the government and the people will work together to launch a great movement to build a new Shanghai, in order to contribute to the construction of a new China and a new East Asia, and ensure that Shanghai becomes a gateway for China's independence and autonomy, and China becomes an independent and autonomous country in the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. This is the first time that the head of state has come to Shanghai as the head of state, which is a concrete symbol of the integrity of territorial sovereignty. Not only are the five million citizens of Shanghai excited and inspired, but the people of the whole country are also deeply rejoicing. During this visit to Shanghai, the Chairman will focus on encouraging the people and working hard to promote the great cause of protecting Asia, and will decline all official banquets and elaborate formalities. However, leaders from all walks of life are eager to pay their respects and receive instructions, and the Chairman will hold tea parties at different times to receive them, in order to listen to opinions and announce policies.

### Advisor Ishiwatari Leaves Nanjing to Return to Japan

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — Mr. Ishiwatari, the supreme economic advisor to the National Government, left Nanjing by train at 9 AM on the 29th to go to Japan via Shanghai for consultations with the Japanese government authorities.

### Director Hori of the Japanese Information Bureau Speaks to Chinese Reporters: After China Receives the Shanghai Concessions, the Anglo-American Stronghold in East Asia is Eliminated

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) — Director Hori III of the Japanese Information Bureau, when meeting with the Chinese reporters on the 28th, gave the following speech on China's recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement: For a century, China has been a victim of Anglo-American financial imperialism under unequal treaties. The Shanghai International Settlement is truly a symbol of Anglo-American aggression against China. Using this as a base, Anglo-American forces have interfered with the entirety of China, becoming a major obstacle to China's revival. For decades, insightful Chinese have been fighting against Anglo-American financial imperialism day in and day out. The late Chinese Founding Father, Sun Yat-sen, died with this aspiration unfulfilled. However, the object of Anglo-American financial imperialism's aggression and the suffering from its heavy oppression are not limited to China alone, but extend to the entirety of East Asia. On December 8th, 1941, Japan resolutely rose up to return East Asia to the hands of East Asians and dealt a severe blow to Anglo-American strongholds in East Asia. In less than half a year, Anglo-American forces have been swept away from various parts of Greater East Asia, and the tide has now merely shifted to this side. Now, the Chinese National Government is about to recover the Shanghai International Settlement, the symbolic ground of Anglo-American aggression in China, on August 1st. This action is not only sufficient to demonstrate that China has broken free from the shackles of unequal treaties, but is also a symbol of the permanent elimination of Anglo-American financial imperialism in East Asia. Therefore, its significance is particularly profound. After the Shanghai International Settlement is recovered and contributed to the revival of China as part of the Greater Shanghai Municipality, it will be of great significance. However, it still requires greater efforts to make the main stronghold of Anglo-American aggression become the root of the revival of China. However, I am convinced that Chinese officials and civilians will be able to work together in the future with unwavering determination to achieve its complete development.

### Supreme National Defense Council Resolves Important Cases

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — The Supreme National Defense Council held its 22nd meeting today.

Consul Osakabe of the friendly nation stationed in Suzhou and Mr. Sun Tiezhou, a local notable of Suzhou, were invited to be the main speakers. More than 500 representatives from party, government, military, and police agencies attended the lecture. First, Section Chief Cai gave an introductory speech, followed by a speech by Consul Osakabe, explaining the good intentions of the friendly nation to assist China's revival, respect China's territorial integrity, and return the concessions to China as a priority based on moral national policy, and to promote other countries to return the administrative power of the concessions to China. In the future, they will cooperate with China to build Greater East Asia and hope that the Chinese people will eliminate Anglo-American thought and complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Completion of the Return of Factories in Central China: Japanese Authorities Issue Statement

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) — After the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were 140 enemy-owned factories in Central China managed by the Japanese side. Most of them have been returned to the National Government by the Japanese side one after another. On the 28th, the ten factories in the Jiangsu area were returned to the National Government. By this point, all the enemy factories managed by the Japanese side in Central China have been returned. On this matter, the Japanese Embassy authorities specifically issued a statement that afternoon, stating that after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the flames of war spread to Central China, and the property of Chinese citizens, such as factories and houses, was also destroyed or burned. However, the meaning of the Japanese army's war was to protect and manage these properties, repair the factories, and strive to operate them under various unfavorable conditions so that they would not be abandoned. In accordance with the policy of returning them to the National Government, they issued a statement to lift military management and implement the return of ten factories in the Jiangsu area based on the application of the property owners. After returning to Jiangshu area ten factories, 140 military managed factories have been completely returned. On the 28th, the final handover ceremony was held in Shanghai. After these factories were returned to China, those entrusted by the Japanese side to repair and operate the factories would bear considerable burdens and sacrifices. This is entirely a manifestation of Japan's hope for China's revival, and Chinese people related to this matter will also understand the sincerity of the Japanese army. We hope that after these factories are returned, they will strengthen China's current productivity, revive the economy of Central China, and cultivate combat power so that they can work together to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Japan Announces a Large Number of Consuls Stationed in China

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) — The Japanese Ministry of Greater East Asia announced the promotion of Vice Consul Ichikawa Shuzo to Consul, stationed in Suzhou, Republic of China; the promotion of Vice Consul Inui Shigeo to Consul, stationed in Datong, Republic of China; the promotion of Vice Consul Jinbo Shuzo to Consul, stationed in Jinan, Republic of China; the promotion of Vice Consul Onuma Tei to Consul, stationed in Qingdao, Republic of China; the promotion of Vice Consul Konjo Noboru to Consul, stationed in Xiamen, Republic of China.

Chairman Wang's Speech to Japanese Reporters

### Economic Cooperation Between the South Seas and China: Contributing to Solving the Overseas Chinese Problem and to Sino-Japanese Cooperation; Increasing Production to Remedy Material Shortages

Mr. Ogata, chief editor of the Asahi Shimbun, inspected various regions in the South Seas for a month. On his way back to Japan, he passed through Nanjing and visited Chairman Wang at his official residence at 5 p.m. on the 20th, where he earnestly discussed his impressions and conclusions from his inspection of the South Seas and exchanged opinions. The talks centered on the China issue and the South Seas issue, and Chairman Wang made important hints about the connection between the solution of the China issue and the South Seas issue, which are extremely noteworthy. The main points of his speech are as follows:

The Issue of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty

Prime Minister Tojo's statement on the solidarity of East Asian nations in the previous extraordinary session of the Diet was very meaningful. The Greater East Asia War is a war to defend Greater East Asia, so the solidarity of the one billion people of East Asia is inevitable. Among these one billion people in East Asia, China, Japan, and Manchukuo actually account for the vast majority, namely 550 million. Therefore, Prime Minister Tojo's statement to revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has given the Chinese people great gratitude and confidence.

The main purpose of fundamentally revising the treaty lies in changing the guiding spirit of the treaty, that is, revising a part of the guiding principles of the treaty. The spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation, which runs through the treaty, will naturally not be changed, but the environment has already changed, that is, the treaty was concluded three years ago, when the Greater East Asia War had not yet occurred, and the provisions of the treaty could not but take into account the relationship between Britain and the United States. However, today the power of Britain and the United States has been driven out of the Greater East Asia region, and the situation has already changed. Therefore, the revision of the treaty is actually due to the change in the environment.

Sino-Japanese Cooperation

We have said that we will live and die together, which is by no means diplomatic rhetoric, but our true spirit. The Greater East Asia War will naturally be won. If the war fails, then we will die together. The meaning of so-called living together is that if the war is won, then China can obtain rubber, gasoline, wheat, and all other materials from the South Seas. The South Seas and China can have mutual communication and economic cooperation. What is most important now is that the war has already become a long-term war, so China and Japan should have the spirit of comrades. In this long-term war, China and Japan stand completely on the same front and fight to the end.

The South Seas Issue

Since the war, the South Seas has become a Japanese-occupied territory. Today, it is impossible to exchange with third countries, so the situation of the overseas Chinese in the South Seas is completely unclear. However, although the overseas Chinese have many shortcomings, they also have the good qualities of East Asian people, such as diligence. The fact that they were able to establish their current position despite the oppression of the Dutch is entirely due to that virtue. Therefore, if these overseas Chinese can be properly guided and the overseas Chinese problem can be solved, it is believed that it will definitely make a great contribution to the development of the occupied territories.

The solution to the overseas Chinese problem is, in a sense, the key to solving the China problem and will make a major contribution to Sino-Japanese cooperation.

The Communist Problem

The recent opposition between the Chongqing regime and the Chinese Communist Party seems to be on a larger scale than before. The Soviet Union's dissolution of the Third International gave the Chongqing regime an excuse to suppress the Communists, but this point is not yet fully clear. Chongqing's diplomacy is roughly divided into pro-Soviet and pro-British and American factions, with the latter currently being more dominant. Therefore, the opposition between Chongqing and the Communist Party has intensified, but overall peace is not expected as a result. However, in my personal opinion, if the situation of conflict between Chongqing and the Communist Party develops and the conflict does not stop, then Britain and the United States will naturally be disappointed with this. Then Chongqing will also consider cooperating with Japan, which will be an opportunity for overall peace.

The Material Problem

This is not only a problem for the National Government, but also the most concerning problem for the entire population. The two phenomena of material shortages and currency inflation appear together, and it is necessary to find a way to solve them. If currency inflates but materials circulate, then unrest will not occur, so the solution to the problem should focus on increasing production. For example, looking at the problem of rice, the current peaceful areas are mostly consumer cities, while there are fewer production rural villages. The import of rice from the South Seas has also been cut off, so there is a serious shortage of rice. This can be solved by ensuring the security of peaceful areas and reorganizing rural villages. On the other hand, we should take the means of manufacturing industrial products, transporting them to the interior, and exchanging them for food from the interior. Next, in terms of cotton, the annual production before the incident was 15 million piculs, but last year it sharply decreased by about one-third, to only 5 million piculs. Moreover, only a portion of the cotton can be used by factories in Shanghai, because farmers hide the cotton and do not sell it. For example, now cotton yarn is about 30,000 yuan per picul. Although farmers sell their rice, they cannot buy cotton yarn and cotton cloth, so most of them spin and weave at home to be self-sufficient. This has a considerable impact on Shanghai's light industry. These are just a few examples. In short, there are many difficulties in the issue of prices, which must be overcome and resolved. Now the first step of the National Government is to make the people thoroughly understand that cooperating with the Greater East Asia War is the only way to survive after winning. The second step is to give the people strength and strive to prevent the depletion of the people's strength. This is China's problem, and it is also a common problem between China and Japan.

### Italy Resolves to Continue Fighting for Freedom: The New Foreign Minister Met with the Turkish Foreign Minister Before Departing to Return Home

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Hai Tong News Agency reports that last night, Rome Radio commentator Massimo issued a statement saying that Italy is now fighting for freedom against Communism and the Anglo-Americans. The anti-Axis powers only attacked Mussolini in their broadcasts and news in the past, but now they have revealed their true colors and admitted that they are fighting against the Italian people. The Italians know the details based on their past experience, but the Anglo-Americans will also learn a lesson, the price of which will be very high, because they will know how the Italians can fight. Italy is now united in fighting for the people and the fatherland. The commentator continued that Italy does not need to wait for British Foreign Secretary Eden's proposed measures regarding the British and American treatment of Italy's overseas territories, and that the so-called Atlantic Charter will one day become a scrap of paper.

Sofia, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The new Italian Foreign Minister, Galli格利亚, made a short stop in Sofia yesterday while flying from Turkey to Italy. When talking to a reporter from the "Sola" newspaper, Galli氏 said, "Italy will continue to fight to defeat the common enemy of mankind."

Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): Turkish Foreign Minister Menderes卓鲁 returned here from Istanbul, and was immediately received by Turkish President Ismet. It is reported that Menderes ended his vacation in Istanbul after meeting with the new Italian Foreign Minister, Baron Galli格利亚.

Relations Between Germany and Italy

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): Schmidt, director of the Information Department of the German Foreign Ministry, explained to international reporters on the 28th that the current Italian political change also affects the relationship between Germany and Italy. The gist is that the alliance between Germany and Italy is based on the personal friendship between Führer Hitler and 素里尼, which is a well-known fact. The alliance between Germany and Italy is formed by the close personal friendship between the two, and by the identity of the German National Socialist Revolution and the Fascist Revolution. Once this fact is recognized, it cannot be said that the fundamental relationship between the people of Germany and Italy has changed, because the survival of the people of Germany and Italy is the natural basis of the alliance between the two countries, and at the same time it is the basis for the common struggle against the Anglo-Americans and the Soviet Union. Unless the Anglo-Americans are subdued and the communist crisis in Europe is eliminated, the survival interests of the people of the two countries moving in the same direction cannot be guaranteed.

British and American Attitudes Toward Italy

Amsterdam, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): London news: President Roosevelt said in a radio speech last night, when referring to the same issues discussed with Churchill in the lower house, that the anti-Axis countries' attitude toward Italy is not affected by the change of government, and still consistently demands its "unconditional surrender." When Roosevelt referred to the Soviet Union, he said that the United States is willing to be a sincere friend with it in the future world. Roosevelt generally said in his speech that future wars are not easy, and that Germany and Japan can only be defeated on their own soil, but this requires far greater strength than at present. He concluded by saying that if the Americans want to win this war, they must devote all their efforts.

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): German News Agency reports that Rome Radio criticized Churchill's remarks about Italy on Wednesday, saying that the Italians did not find Churchill's statement in the lower house surprising, because the Italians had already expected this. There is no change in the relationship between Italy and Britain. The British claim that they are fighting against fascism and not against the Italian people, but the British have now shown the world that they want to annihilate the Italian people. The Italians will of course never trust the British. The Italians know that the British hope that a civil war will break out in Italy in order to help the British defeat the Axis plan. Rome Radio continued that Italy is now facing a brutal enemy, so fighting for freedom and glory is its only choice.

### The New Italian Government Orders the Dissolution of the Fascist Party: No Change in Foreign Policy

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): German News Agency reports that, according to a Rome Radio report, the ministers of the new Italian government held a meeting on Wednesday under the chairmanship of President Badoglio. At the meeting, the ministers stated that there is no change in Italy's foreign policy, and that domestic administration will continue to be carried out according to the established principles.

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The new Italian cabinet held its first meeting on Tuesday under the chairmanship of Marshal Badoglio, and decided to formally dissolve the Fascist Party. It is reported that the cabinet ordered the dissolution of the party in view of the new political situation in the country, but the public welfare, education, and sports institutions attached to the party will remain. At this meeting, the cabinet also decided to abolish the law promulgated on September 9, 1928, regarding the power of the Fascist Party Congress, and to restore Italy to its constitutional norms. The cabinet also ordered the dissolution of the Special National Defense Court, and all matters handled by the court will be transferred to the military courts of the Italian army for handling during the continuation of the war.

### The Last Congress of the Fascist Party: A Review of the Process

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Stefani Agency today issued the following official announcement regarding the process of the Fascist Congress causing the resignation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, stating, "The Congress has not met since September 7, 1939. The meeting on July 24 began with Mussolini reporting on Italy's political and military situation, followed by the President of the Fascist Council, Grandi, reading the minutes signed by him and many others, stating, "The Fascist Council is meeting at this extremely difficult time, and its heart is directed towards the heroic soldiers of the various armies. These soldiers are fighting side by side with the people of Sicily, reviving the traditional heroism and spirit of sacrifice of the Italian army. After reviewing Italy's domestic and foreign situation and political and military situation, the Fascist Council declares that every Italian has a sacred duty to defend Italy's unity and independence at any sacrifice. The Council strongly affirms that in this critical period that will determine the fate of the nation, all Italians must have spiritual and material unity. The Council announces that in order to achieve this goal, all national functions must be immediately restored. The Royal Government, the Supreme Council, the Parliament, and the various vocational groups must bear their responsibilities in accordance with the constitutional provisions. The Council requests the Italian King to assume supreme command of the army, navy, and air force in accordance with Article 5 of the Royal Regulations." At this point, Grandi requested individual voting. The meeting lasted for ten hours and ended at 3:00 a.m. on July 25. After the discussion ended, 19 votes were in favor of Grandi's proposal, 7 votes were against, and 1 person abstained.

Commentary

### Stronger Measures

In an important statement to the press yesterday, Mayor Chen said, "The authorities are currently planning to adopt stronger measures to control commodity prices and implement more stringent penalties. These measures will not only be implemented within the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government but also in the two concession areas after their recovery." At the same time, the authorities of the three municipal districts have already issued a solemn declaration, strictly warning against any unauthorized price increases, or face immediate prosecution.

This statement and this notice, in principle, completely conform to what this column argued yesterday: "Appropriate legal measures are the cornerstone for achieving price stabilization."

Amidst the joyful cheers of recovering the concessions, "any person, business, partnership, company, association, etc." in the economic sector must remember the old saying "excessive joy breeds sorrow," be careful in everything, and be cautious in every aspect. Do not think that the atmosphere after recovering the concessions is one of freedom, and that arbitrarily raising prices is also a freedom. Know that good freedom is protected by law, and malicious freedom is also punished by law. When the law comes to punish, even if you hold gold in your hands, you will have to transform from a guest of honor to a prisoner! Because, under the wartime demand for stabilizing people's livelihoods, speculators who only care about personal enjoyment and disregard the lives of the masses are criminals of the state and society.

### Concentrated Distribution Plan for Bran Approved by the Executive Yuan

The National Commercial Control General Association, for the centralized purchase of wheat, has been urging local branches to handle the matter based on the established plan, under the supervision of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The purchased wheat has already been transported to major regions for centralized processing. Flour mills will commence production in the near future. Approximately one million bags of wheat have already been transported into Shanghai. The Association believes that the bran from this wheat processing should be subject to a comprehensive plan for centralized distribution, in order to achieve balanced distribution and control consumption. Therefore, a temporary plan for centralized distribution of bran has been formulated, submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record, and will be implemented immediately. In addition to being published in the newspapers, registration of bran inventory is also being carried out. The measures are as follows: (1) Flour mills in various regions should submit daily reports of bran production to the branch office of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, as stipulated by the Association. Any movement is absolutely prohibited from this date forward, and no further sales are permitted, except with the approval of the Association. The quantity of bran produced and the quantity moved out since July 1 must be reported. (2) Flour merchants in various regions are required to register all their existing bran inventory immediately. From the date of registration, the inventory is not allowed to be moved. For local daily needs, an application may be made to the local Flour and Wheat Professional Committee office for a temporary movement permit, with certification from the trade association.

### Materials Adjustment Committee to Strengthen Investigation Work

Since the Material Investigation Committee began its activities to investigate materials, its work has become increasingly intense. A comprehensive investigation of the materials stored in warehouses throughout the city has been carried out. The investigation of the fifty warehouses in the French Concession is progressing gradually. In order to eradicate hoarding, it has also begun to conduct a second investigation into financial institutions' loans, based on the situation, to check whether there is hoarding behavior based on reviewing the loan accounts of financial institutions. At the same time, in order to strengthen the investigation work of the investigation team and achieve significant results, it is said that the talent of investigators will be enriched, and those with rich industrial and commercial experience will be hired to assist in the investigation work. It is also understood that recently, many people have secretly reported to the authorities the leaders of hoarding materials. It is believed that the investigation will be able to proceed more smoothly, and the evil trend of hoarding in Shanghai will be eliminated soon.

### Measures to Ban Illegal Insurance, Six Measures Set

Since the Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry began registering and issuing licenses to insurance brokers on January 5th of this year, no fewer than six or seven hundred people have applied for registration in Shanghai, Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Suzhou. It is now understood that the deadline for insurance brokers currently engaged in business to apply for registration will be August 5th. In order to crack down on illegal brokers, the Bureau has formulated six measures as follows: (1) Starting from August 6th of this year, only registered and licensed insurance brokers will be allowed to introduce insurance business. If anyone introduces insurance business without registration and licensing, they shall be punished in accordance with Article 74 of the Insurance Law. (2) Insurance brokers who have already applied for registration before August 6th but have not yet received a certificate from the Ministry of Industry will be temporarily allowed to introduce insurance business. (3) Insurance brokers who apply for registration at the Bureau from August 6th onwards may not introduce insurance business until they have received a certificate from the Ministry of Industry. Violators will be dealt with in accordance with the first item. (4) Insurance brokers' associations in various places are preparing for organization separately. Before the articles of association and commission regulations are discussed, decided, and approved, the insurance industry will temporarily pay a commission of 20% of the actual premium received. Brokers shall not make extra demands. If there is any violation, they shall be punished in accordance with Article 13 of the Insurance Brokers and Notaries Registration Rules. (5) In addition to commissions, insurance companies shall absolutely not give brokers salaries, allowances, gifts, or any other similar remuneration. If there is any violation, in addition to the broker being treated as making unauthorized demands, the person in charge of the insurance company shall be punished in accordance with Article 76, Paragraph 1 of the Insurance Law and shall be liable for damages. (6) Insurance brokers should pay attention to the provisions of Articles 8 to 13 of the Insurance Brokers and Notaries Registration Rules, and especially pay attention to the provisions of Article 9, that is, brokers may not concurrently serve as civil servants, or directors, supervisors, and staff of insurance companies.

### Rice Merchants in this City Must Obtain a Procurement Permit for Transporting and Selling Rice

Before the war, the supply of staple food in this city was handled by rice merchants who transported and purchased rice on their own. However, since the central government implemented control, all food has been allocated and distributed by the state. In order to have rice merchants cooperate in adjusting the supply of staple food, the Ministry of Food has stipulated that rice merchants transporting and selling rice must obtain a food rice procurement permit, which will be handled by the food bureaus in various places. Upon receiving the order, the Municipal Food Bureau has instructed all rice merchants to be informed. According to the application method for this procurement permit, rice merchants who are already registered in this city can carry a letter from the business and four photos of the procurement person when transporting and selling rice within the same district. They can apply for verification and issuance at the first group of the Food Allocation Department of the Bureau and can transport the rice freely. Those who transport and sell rice without this procurement permit will have the rice confiscated upon detection and will be severely punished to maintain food administration.

### Poverty and Wealth

— Shi Lin

Do not flaunt wealth, nor look down on poverty. One must know that true poverty and wealth are reflected in each person's character.

A millionaire who spends his days calculating his wealth, trying to figure out how to increase it, even if his property increases several times over, even if he has tens of millions of dollars, he is still nothing more than "poor." Can you say that constantly calculating money, hoping it will become more, richer, is not a subconscious recognition that his existing property is insufficient? Then, is not this "calculation" a manifestation of "poverty"? Therefore, this kind of person, no matter how rich his money is, no matter how the amount increases constantly to an infinitely large number, in spirit, they are constantly aware of their "poverty." This is "poverty" in character!

There are also people who, though they may seem insignificant, are content with their current lives. "Poverty" cannot change their principles. In ancient times, there was Yan Hui, who remained joyful despite having only a basket of food and a ladle of water. Although "poor," he was able to maintain his joy. The preciousness of his innate wealth cannot be discussed by millionaires. Since his thoughts contain neither "poverty" nor "wealth," then "poverty" and "wealth" can never move his will even slightly. Thus, he can maintain his faith, philosophy, and the free state of his mind throughout his life. Money cannot bind him, and poverty cannot move him. How can you not admit that he is innately wealthy? This kind of "wealth" in character is true "wealth."

### Overview of the Sino-French Institute of Sinology

— Bai You

The Sino-French Institute of Sinology in Beijing has been officially established for two years since its official establishment in October of the year before last. The first organization established by the Institute was the Folklore Research Association, which was later expanded to establish the Historical Language Group and the General Index Group.

The work of the Folklore Research Association: (1) Collecting folk deity statues, New Year pictures, and books from various places, and creating research cards with explanations. (2) Collecting papers on folklore from various domestic magazines. (3) Selecting materials related to customs from various daily newspapers, clipping and storing them. (4) Selecting major Western works researching Chinese folk superstitions, religions, and customs, creating indexes and research cards for easy reference. (5) Studying and explaining various aspects of Chinese folk customs and conducting thematic research, currently writing an article "A Study of the Five Sacrifices." (6) Selecting materials related to customs from local chronicles, copying and preserving them.

The purpose of the General Index (i.e., index) Group is to maintain close contact with the Folklore Research Association. Its work is to select ancient books rich in materials on Chinese religion, customs, and habits, and compile general indexes. Among them, "Lunheng General Index" and "Lushi Chunqiu General Index" have been published. Those still in preparation include "Huainanzi General Index," "Chunqiu Fanlu General Index," and "Customs General Index," etc. (Sales locations are the French Bookstore in the Beijing Hotel, Laixunge Bookstore in Liulichang, and its Shanghai branch.)

The Historical Language Group aims to study Yin Shang oracle bone script and Chinese language grammar, focusing on writing special topics. An article "The Discovery of Oracle Bone Script and Its Contribution" has been written. In addition, an article "The Chinese Determiner 'de'" and a book "On Chinese Grammar" have been completed. The group also plans to compile a French explanatory dictionary of oracle bone script.

The Institute holds four or five academic lectures and one or two exhibitions each year. The Institute also plans to publish a research journal next quarter. In addition, the "French Research" magazine, which was previously published by the Sino-French Cultural Foundation, has been merged into the Institute this year. The Institute also has a French evening class. The Institute's library has over 1,000 Western books and 7,000 Chinese books, focusing on Chinese folklore, linguistics, textual research, and other categories.

### Some Opinions on the Conservation Movement

— Qianli

"There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart," truly a pointed statement. Let us examine the current state of the general social mentality. Life is difficult, indeed, that is a fact; however, as long as the "difficulty" is universal, and the "difficulty" is evenly distributed, then, even if it is a little more "difficult," as long as everyone can recognize their own environment in suffering and hardship, hold firmly to the goal of struggle, use the power of the spirit to overcome the desires of the material, and continue to work "with life and death at stake," it may not be a spur to the revival of the nation. However, reality and ideal stand at extremely contradictory ends.

Amidst the cries that life is difficult, there is a clearly delineated chasm, a world of difference. On one side are tens of thousands of people who have become starving corpses and roadside cadavers; on the other side are those lucky (?) fellows, indulging in feasts of meat and wine, amidst the sounds of pipes and strings. On one side, people lament their suffering in cries of "it's unbearable" all day long; on the other side, people show off their wealth in an air of "it's extraordinary" anytime and anywhere. What is this phenomenon! What a serious social problem!

But there is still a part of conscientious, passionate people in society who, in the midst of this globally turbulent "neither fish nor fowl" situation, have burst out with a sense of "unbearable" feeling—to advocate a conservation movement in an environment of extravagance and dissipation is, in fact, a truly "responsible and honest" action. Here, let's talk about the key to the success or failure of the conservation movement:

First, our Chinese "movements" are more numerous than those of any other country; conversely, although there are many "movements," there are few results. In other words, the effects of any "movement" are not easily seen; however, the theories of any "movement" are all-encompassing. Therefore, we hope that this conservation movement, once launched, must not be relaxed until it has achieved practical results.

Second, in today's China, the conservation movement, although a suitable remedy, should pay special attention to the "target" of the "movement" when implementing this movement. In other words, it seems superfluous to ask the majority of ordinary people who are already living in an "unbearable" environment to practice strict conservation; and it is the fellows who are still showing off their wealth everywhere in the air of "it's extraordinary" that should be specially "nailed down" and specially "moved."

Third, if the conservation movement is merely an ordinary movement, then it is nothing more than a lot of idle chatter, ultimately falling into "the rut of going around in circles and getting nothing." If we want to advocate the conservation movement, what methods should we use to find effects in practice? Only then can we be considered not to have worked in vain.

Fourth, although the atmosphere of extravagance and dissipation is deeply rooted, it is not really more difficult to change customs and habits than to climb to the sky. Zeng Wenzhenggong said it well: "What does a thick custom rely on? It relies on the direction of one or two people." The so-called "one or two people" are definitely not the coolies pulling carts, nor the old scholars in the three-family village, but undoubtedly the political administrators in general. Therefore, the promotion of the conservation movement is best to first ask those in power to be able to speak and do in their own lives on the stand of saving the country and saving East Asia, strictly practicing conservation, thereby creating a kind of atmosphere, thereby contributing the saved material resources to the country and to East Asia.

Fifth, we should not only make articles on the question of "how should clothing, food, housing, and transportation be considered conservation," we must think of ways on the question of "if we discover a general group of people who deliberately do not conserve, what methods can be used to make them dare not not conserve." Although everyone has the right to freedom in clothing, food, housing, and transportation, and it would be a joke to not allow people to buy things if they have money, or to not allow people to eat things if they have money, but we must remember: in the current stage of striving for the final victory of the Great East Asia War, have we kept up with the degree of suffering and hardship of other people? And to contribute all our strength to the Great East Asia War, is there any remaining material resources for us to consume and waste on private enjoyment? We should use the methods of dealing with the enemy to punish those who squander natural resources, harm the country, and harm East Asia!

In short, everyone being able to practice the power of conservation is more practical than all the nice-sounding slogans: it is not necessarily worse than working hard in one's own position. Here, we sincerely hope that the conscientious and passionate people who advocate this conservation movement will continue to "move" forward and extract practical results from the elaboration of the already established slogans and signs of the conservation movement!

### Hoping that the Business Community Will Jointly Raise the Banner of Educational Aid

— Cheng Hailin

The results of the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao in running the educational aid fund are significant. The names of the donors listed in the newspapers, especially those with larger amounts, are mostly famous people in the business community, which is very noteworthy, because people always think that there are more "rich and unkind" people. Now, this event can fundamentally break this traditional view. However, we know that the educational aid fund is certainly the more the better. One more scholarship saves one more out-of-school youth. Therefore, we also hope that the Shanghai business community and wealthy class, whose business has been booming recently, will enthusiastically donate more. It is easy for businessmen to take a thousand from society and return one to society, not to mention that educational aid is a most meaningful act of charity. I hope that people in the business community will work hard to compete for donations and not let others monopolize the lead.

### Free Medical Consultation and Medicine

The Shanghai Special City Benevolence and Charity Association's free medical consultation and medicine for the 32nd year, in addition to the full-time service of specialists at No. 47 Nangaoli, Haining Road, in order to be more universal, has consulted with the National Medical Association to specially appoint more than 20 famous doctors in various districts to set up free clinics, and issued 100,000 free consultation tickets, so that the poor and sick can receive free diagnosis and treatment nearby. And 300 free consultation tickets will be given to this newspaper for distribution.

The Changzhou Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association will hold free medical consultations and medicine at the association's location at No. 6, Lane 102, Tongfu Road (south of Weihaiwei Road), from 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:00 PM to 4:00 PM every day.

From today onwards, Tongde Kang Pharmacy will specially invite cold and seasonal disease expert Guan Xinru (8:00 AM to 10:00 AM) and internal medicine, gynecology, and pediatrics expert Jin Zhixiang (2:00 PM to 5:00 PM) to host free medical consultations and medicine.

Entrusted by various philanthropists, Dr. Zhen Yi will, from today onwards, hold free medical consultations at the clinic at No. 1 Taoyuanfang, Villmon Road, west of the Eight Immortals Bridge, from 8:00 AM to 9:30 AM and from 1:00 PM to 3:00 PM every day.

Sun Wangzhi issued a thousand free medical consultation tickets and instructed this column to transfer them to charity organizations for distribution to the suffering people near Fuxu Road in Huxi. Dr. Sun's clinic is located at No. 17 Fuxufang, Fuxu Road. The time is from 10:00 AM to 3:00 PM, treating gynecology, internal medicine, and pediatrics.

The Buddhist Brotherhood has set up a temporary free clinic in the Tongren Village of the Fire Ground, Jinjia Lane, Feier Road, in Huxi, which has started on the 20th of this month, providing free medical treatment and medicine. And one hundred consultation tickets will be issued through this newspaper on behalf of the group.

National physician Qiu Tingyu, specializing in men's, women's, and children's diseases, will, from today onwards, give preferential treatment to teachers and staff and their families. For all school documents explaining outpatient and home visits, half of the fee will be charged. The clinic is located at No. 23, Lane 685, Youdeng Road in the morning, and Fushengtang Medicine Store at No. 176 Wenyilu in the afternoon.
