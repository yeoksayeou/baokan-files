### On Price Control Measures and Their Institutional Problems

For days, we have discussed wartime economics and wartime national life, and we have particularly pointed out the urgent need to rigorously implement wartime economic policies and rectify wartime national life under the current grave circumstances. However, here, we must also solemnly point out that one of the main obstacles to the failure of wartime economic policies to be thoroughly implemented and to the failure of wartime national life to be put into practice is the problem of soaring prices without any end in sight. Because of the inability to stabilize prices, the degree of abnormal development of materials, currency, national psychology, etc., has been deepened, and bad phenomena such as speculation and hoarding have increased, which in turn stimulates the soaring rise of prices. The interaction of these factors constitutes a serious crisis in the wartime economy. National life is plunged into instability, with no guarantee of peaceful work, and thus people's minds are restless and society is deformed. As a result, in the economic sphere, the implementation of wartime economic policies is hindered, and in the political sphere, the solemn tension of wartime national life is destroyed, and the abandonment of selfishness and devotion to public service is transformed into a phenomenon of "everyone seeking private gain." For the sake of the nation's responsibility in the new era, for the glory of the nation, and for the survival of the people, the price problem must be resolved rationally and immediately.

The problem of wartime prices is originally a very common and ordinary thing, and no country can avoid it. However, examining the actual situation of wartime price problems in various countries, no one can fail to be surprised by the deformed phenomenon of our country's price problem. Since July 1937, if the prices of 1936 are taken as the base, the lowest prices have increased dozens of times, and some special prices have risen hundreds or even hundreds of times. This ratio is not easy to see in any country in the world. Although the tide of price increases began in August 1937, the rise was very slow at that time. Until the freezing of Sino-Japanese funds by the enemy in the United States and Britain in July 1941, the price index in Shanghai for four or five years was actually lower compared with the prices in the mainland, especially in the areas under the Chongqing regime. At that time, some adventurers even used the low prices in Shanghai to smuggle goods, which can be used as clear evidence. Since the spring of 1942, Shanghai prices began to rise frantically, initially due to the sharp depreciation of the old legal tender. Last summer, the old legal tender was abolished and a unified currency system was implemented, which temporarily suppressed this frenzy. However, how long did it take before the price rise was as rampant as before? Recalling the prices in the autumn and winter of last year and looking at the current situation, it is like a world away in less than a year. Under such high prices, even law-abiding citizens cannot but panic and try to make some purchases, while speculators rely on the high prices as a shortcut to wealth. Everyone only seeks private gain, and the severity of the blow to the national economy and national policy is beyond imagination.

Now that the Shanghai concessions have been completely taken over, all parties have focused on countermeasures to stabilize prices. It is not too late to mend the fold after the sheep is lost. We sincerely hope that the authorities and relevant parties can completely improve price control measures, improve control methods, perfect institutions and personnel, earnestly enforce laws and regulations, conscientiously stabilize prices, protect people's livelihood, and concentrate their efforts to complete national policies under the supreme principles of "eliminating selfishness and serving the public" and "national policy first." In terms of institutions, the principles proposed by the Continental News yesterday are very correct. (See today's newspaper) On the Japanese side, there is no problem with the Nanjing Embassy, the Shanghai Embassy Office, and the Shanghai Consulate General working together. On the Chinese side, after the takeover of the concessions, from the Special Municipal Government to the price control agencies of the former Public Works Department, under the unified command of the Mayor, it is easier to concentrate efforts. Today, we only ask that Shanghai and the central government, and China and Japan, can cooperate effectively, cooperate thoroughly, and take unified steps. The future can be expected to be smooth. In the past, the increasingly serious price problem could be attributed to the destruction of Chongqing elements, the depreciation of the old legal tender, and the special conditions of the concessions. Now that these obstacles no longer exist, the authorities and relevant parties must be able to invigorate themselves and live up to the expectations of the country and the people!

However, "forget not the former events, they are teachers for later ones." Under the premise of sincerely trusting the authorities, we still cannot refrain from offering some suggestions. First, the past price control authorities did not spare no effort, but the reason why the results did not meet expectations was that the general speculators and hoarders first created a "fait accompli" and then accepted the price limit, thus forming a phenomenon of prices "advancing two steps and retreating half a step." In the future, such cunning behavior of hoarders and speculators must never be allowed, and this unreasonable price increase phenomenon must be completely eliminated. Second, we want to reiterate the method of comprehensive price limits and closely coordinate it with the comprehensive rationing system. On the one hand, daily necessities for the general public should be supplied as much as possible by rationing agencies or cooperatives, and they should no longer be forced to seek them on the black market. On the other hand, comprehensive control should be implemented for daily necessities and important wartime materials, so that speculative hoarding behaviors lose the basis for existence and activity. Third, we should use strong facts to stabilize the value of the currency, and at the same time guide floating capital to normal channels, so that it has no choice but to change from speculative hoarding to the right path of assisting wartime production. However, the success or failure of all these positive and constructive price control measures in the future still depends on the clarity of politics. We have always believed that no economic institution can solve the economic crisis. The dangerous signs of prices are a concrete manifestation of the economic crisis. Therefore, in order for price control measures to be effective, strict enforcement of laws and regulations, and above all, improving politics, carefully selecting talented people, accepting public opinion, and constantly seeking progress are essential and prerequisite. Whether our country's wartime economic policies can be realized, whether wartime national life can be put into practice, and even whether our country's reconstruction and development can be achieved will directly or indirectly depend on the success or failure of price control measures! We deeply hope that all levels will be united, China and Japan will work together, make a painful determination, and jointly seek its final success!

### The Italian Cabinet and the Vatican Conference Are of Great Significance

Whether the Defense of Sicily Can Be Completed Is the Key to Determining Italy's Fate

Zurich, 6th (Central News Agency) – The important cabinet meeting held by the new Italian cabinet on the 5th and the consistory meeting held by the Vatican on the 4th are both of great significance. Their content is worthy of attention, but the news from Italy has not mentioned this, so the content is unknown. However, according to local observers, it is believed that this cabinet meeting may be to reconfirm the war continuation policy announced by Badoglio when he formed the cabinet, and to review specific means, and it is recognized that the specific means are to strengthen cooperation with Germany and devote all efforts to defend Sicily. According to some well-informed sources, this cabinet meeting was to review the contents of a communication sent from a certain aspect, and it is related to the consistory meeting held by the Vatican, but the general common view is that the fate of Italy in the future depends on whether the defense of Sicily can be completed.

The Italian Cabinet Passes the Contents of Various Proposals

Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Italian cabinet met at 5 pm yesterday to review important proposals. The meeting was chaired by Prime Minister Badoglio and lasted for three and a half hours. Among the proposals passed was the one proposed by Dr. Jungardi, Minister of Corporations, to rename the Ministry of Corporations as the Ministry of Industry, Commerce and Labor, and auxiliary economic institutions will also be renamed local conferences and economic bureaus. The National Corporate Supervisor has been renamed the Director General of Industry and Labor, and the Central Corporate Agency, the Price Adjustment Committee, and the Self-Sufficiency Committee have all been abolished. The purpose of this measure is to suppress the wholehearted corporate conference: the Central Corporate Committee and the regiment. The cabinet also passed a plan to restrict newspapers based on the proposal of the Minister of Popular Culture. The publishers and editors-in-chief of daily newspapers and other periodicals must obtain permission from the Ministry of Popular Culture. The validity period of this measure is until three months after the end of the state of war. After this period, paper will restore the basic principles of freedom in the constitution. The cabinet also declared its fiscal policy to ensure the country's monetary system and people's savings. The Minister of Justice also ordered the adjustment of the civil and criminal codes, because the provisions of the codes do not conform to the spirit and judicial tradition of the Italian groups. At the same time, Article 8 of the judicial regulations, which advanced the judicial year to October 29 for political reasons, was also abolished. The cabinet also disbanded various Fascist youth organizations and reinstated three university professors who had been exiled for political reasons. The cabinet also passed various measures regarding public hardship and literary wasteland. Finally, the cabinet also emphasized that five grains must be handed over to the state, and any violation of this obligation is tantamount to treason and will not be tolerated.

### The Anti-Axis Allies Claim That They Will Attack Rome Again

The Reasons for the Retreat of German Troops from Orel and Catania

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) – German troops have withdrawn from Orel, the key point of the Soviet-German front, and Catania, which was attacked on the Sicilian front, on the 5th. According to the fact that Orel was stubbornly defended by the German army when the Soviet army launched its winter counter-offensive, because the terrain was located in the central salient of the German army's position on the Eastern Front. The German authorities recently announced the process of this withdrawal from Orel, saying that since October, the Soviet army had attacked Orel from three aspects with a huge force of 100 divisions and 10,000 tanks. However, the German army still held the area firmly and thoroughly dealt a heavy blow to it. After the German army had fully achieved the purpose of consuming the enemy's forces, it withdrew. It is generally believed that the German front line has become shorter due to the withdrawal from Orel, and the defense is easier than before. At the same time, the Soviet army has suffered great losses in this battle, and its offensive power has been weakened. With its current strength, it can never cut off the German army's contact in the central area (as for the elite German troops on the Sicilian front, in order to change to defend the Messina Strait on the German-West front, they have been stubbornly defending Catania for several weeks. Now that the area has no value to defend, the main force of the German army withdrew from the area a few days ago, leaving only a small number of troops to cover the defense.

### The Number of Students Studying in Japan from Various Parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere Has Increased Greatly

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) – The number of students from various parts of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere studying in Japan is increasing day by day. In view of this, Japanese authorities concerned began to prepare special guidance methods this year, and they are now roughly ready. The biggest problems for students studying in Japan from various regions are Japanese language learning and dormitories. Manchuria has long had complete measures for students studying in Japan, and has a student hall in Japan for students studying in Japan to live in. In order to facilitate Chinese public and private students studying in Japan to learn Japanese, the Japanese-Chinese relations authorities have also specially established the Sino-Japanese Society, which has established contact with the Chinese Embassy in Japan, and has an East Asia School to prepare Chinese students studying in Japan to learn Japanese and prepare for entrance examinations. As for students from various southern regions, before the war, there were very few students studying in Japan except for Thais, so a laissez-faire attitude was adopted. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese relations authorities and various groups have also been closely linked and have considered various measures to systematically guide students. As for the school authorities, they are now all based on the Special Admission Regulations for Foreign Students promulgated by the Ministry of Education in the 34th year of Meiji, and have welcomed and recruited students in preparation for the examination, which has achieved good results.

### Laurel's Speech

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) – After recovering from his injuries and being discharged from the hospital, Laurel, Chairman of the Philippine Island Independence Preparatory Committee, received the Japanese and Philippine press corps here on the 5th. It is said that in the future, they will only work harder to create a country and spare no sacrifice to complete the great cause of Philippine independence. The Philippine Island Independence Preparatory Committee is currently drafting the constitution, which can be completed by the end of this year. The fundamental policy of the Philippine nation-building is the same as what the Philippine revolutionary patriot Bonifacio said, "The basis of national policy lies in the welfare of the people," so the happiness of the people is the highest goal of all policies. Therefore, seeking the happiness of the people of the Yi Island is the policy of the government. The spirit of Philippine nation-building can be roughly divided into the establishment of a moral country, the unity with the neighboring countries of Greater East Asia, and the coexistence and co-prosperity of Greater East Asia. The establishment and common defense of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere are all included. Now that the Philippine Islands have established friendly relations with Japan, they have been able to recover spiritual civilization from material civilization, and the future education policy will also be changed accordingly. The basic policy of Philippine independence is first to establish a self-sufficient economy, second to cooperate with the various states of Greater East Asia, and third to prosper Greater East Asia.

### Sweden and Germany Have Established an Agreement. German Troops Have Decided to Stop Transit.

Capital of Sweden, 6th (Central News Agency) – The government officially announced yesterday that, according to the agreement established between the Swedish government and the German government, German soldiers and German military supplies will stop passing through Sweden in transit from August 15, and some trains will stop from August 20. However, ordinary passengers and goods transported by Swedish trains will not be affected, and the passage of ambulances will continue to be in accordance with the provisions of the Hague Convention. Swedish radio commented on the agreement, saying that Sweden believes that this move can avoid criticism of Sweden's neutrality policy. Sweden's policy is still based on the principle of not getting involved in the Eight Wars.

### The Turkish Foreign Minister Declares That He Will Maintain Neutrality

However, the Future Development of the Italian Battlefield Will Affect Turkey's Attitude

Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – The main force of the Allied counter-offensive is now concentrated in Italy. Therefore, places that were previously considered to be launching a second front, such as the Atlantic coast and the Balkan Peninsula, have now been reduced to subordinate military positions. Therefore, in the Balkan landing operation, Turkey's military importance will be reduced. It is to use Italy as the base point. Therefore, after launching the Italian operation, Britain and the United States immediately started political work in the Balkans. If Britain and the United States can succeed in the Italian operation as desired, it is possible to achieve the goal without military action against the Balkan countries, only with political work. Under this quiet situation, Turkey is still a place for Britain and the United States to work in the Balkans. From this point of view, Britain and the United States will strengthen the use of Turkey. In other words, although the military importance of Britain and the United States in starting the war against Italy has decreased, on the other hand, its importance can be expressed more politically. At the beginning of the Fourth Sicilian Bird operation, well-informed sources here predicted that Britain and the United States would take advantage of their favorable situation to increase pressure on Turkey. For Britain and the United States, it has long been hoped that Turkey will join their camp, especially when Balkan work is extremely urgent. Britain and the United States feel the need to have a base in Turkey. From this point of view, it is not difficult to imagine that Britain and the United States will start a new movement against Turkey. For example, the London Times on the 28th mentioned the issue and openly criticized Turkey's attitude of maintaining Chinese in today's situation, saying that Turkey should abandon neutrality and join the anti-Axis side. The general idea is that the current war situation is extremely favorable to the anti-Axis countries, and we naturally expect Turkey to abandon neutrality and approach the anti-Axis camp, but Turkey's insistence on neutrality is beyond our expectations. This argument is enough to expose the intentions of Britain and the United States against Turkey. Therefore, informed people recognize that this is a new diplomatic policy launched by Britain and the United States against Turkey. In addition, the recent major activities of the British Ambassador to Turkey, Hugh Knatchbull-Hugessen, in the Turkish capital can also be regarded as one of the outposts of the above-mentioned diplomatic offensive. As for Turkey's reaction, according to what is spread by the Axis diplomatic circles in Changdi, the Turkish Foreign Minister recently told an Axis Ambassador to Turkey: Britain and the United States will soon put pressure on Turkey, and we have already noticed it. However, Turkey's neutrality policy will not be drastically changed due to the recent new situation. However, when Britain and the United States decide on the final policy to deal with Turkey, the one that will influence Turkey's attitude is the future development of the Italian battlefield. In other words, Turkey's decision depends on how Germany handles the Italian battlefield.

Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – The Turkish President met with the Foreign Minister again at his summer residence yesterday. No public statement has been issued regarding this meeting, but it is generally believed that the meeting discussed Turkey's reply to the anti-Axis countries' request to refuse to protect Axis leaders.

Istanbul, 6th (Central News Agency) – Reuter reported: The Turkish government was busy yesterday discussing the draft reply to the anti-Axis countries' request not to accommodate political prisoners. It is generally believed that Turkey will be based on the principles of international law and the integrity of Turkish sovereignty.

### Severe Punishment for Illegally Transporting Controlled Goods by Train

Nanjing, June 6th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Recently, prices in Nanjing, Shanghai, and other places have been rising, especially for daily necessities. While this is mainly due to speculative merchants taking advantage of the situation, a small number of ignorant people disobeying the law and illegally transporting controlled goods is also a significant factor. Most illegal transportation of controlled goods is done secretly on trains. According to a spokesperson from the Road Police Administration Office of the Ministry of Construction: recently, various railways have discovered many cases of illegal transportation of controlled goods for sale. The goods being transported are mostly daily necessities, such as rice, salt, and matches being transported to Shanghai, and cloth, cigarettes, and soap being transported to Zhenjiang, Nanjing, and other places. The government, in order to adapt to the wartime system and ensure the people's livelihood, has explicitly prohibited the movement of the aforementioned goods. As the office directly responsible for ensuring railway security, we will severely punish those who illegally transport controlled goods on trains.

### Essential Wartime National Life (2)

Takada: Currently, various ministries and departments in Japan are gradually expanding. The population of Tokyo alone is approaching ten million. The populations of Osaka, Kyoto, Nagoya, and other cities are also increasing significantly. However, conversely, the rural population is gradually decreasing. Under these circumstances, the nation's overall vitality is being suppressed. This is indeed a serious problem.

Toda: That's right. The government also says it wants to maintain the rural population at 60%, but if strong efforts are not made, I am afraid it will be ineffective.

Takada: It is already at the level of 60%, but they have mostly moved to the electrical industry. In other words, they are all moving to the cities. However, the total population is generally still increasing. Especially after the war, the population usually tends to increase, but the rural population is not increasing but decreasing. The rural population has fallen to 60%, while the urban population has increased. If the number of children born decreases, Japan's future cannot be optimistic. For example, creating farmhouses of an appropriate size is still a very problematic plan. It is said that increasing the arable land per household to achieve a prosperous and comfortable life was a policy formulated during the rural panic of Showa 6 and 7. At that time, farmers were in a difficult situation. Although the area of arable land per household was about one cho (approx. 2.45 acres), it was still not enough to provide food. As for improving rural life and reducing the rural population, this consideration is still a major problem. On the other hand, many useless people and non-laboring people are gathering in the cities. Especially in places like Tokyo, in terms of age and physique, there is a considerable number of people who can be used in industry. Wouldn't it be a reasonable solution if labor could be thoroughly circulated in this area?

Toda: Yes. I think the worst thing is that those officials who receive honors are all gathering in Tokyo. This situation is truly the root of national ruin. I have always advocated that if they do not return to their hometowns, then all the honors should not be given. This way, at least they would have to leave Tokyo. Now, let's compare the Satsuma and Choshu military cliques. Both of these military cliques were famous military groups in the Meiji era. Now, how many people of general rank are there among their descendants from Kagoshima? Almost none. Needless to say, those outstanding people probably died in the Seinan War. Not only that, but even in the Choshu military clique, there were generals in the second generation. Before two generations passed, the scarcity of talent became quite noticeable. What is the reason for this? Generals from Satsuma changed their domiciles to Tokyo and did not return to their hometowns in glory. As for Choshu, the situation was very different. After receiving honors, they mostly returned to Hagi, Chofu, or Yamaguchi, retired from the military, and became ordinary people. Therefore, their descendants still produced quite a few generals or lieutenant generals. This is one example. Most of the current middle and upper-level generals come from the impoverished Tohoku or Hokuriku regions. It is probably the same reason.

Abandon External Life

Takada: The problems of food self-sufficiency, training strong soldiers, and increasing the population are all burdens on agriculture. The foundation of a country's strength and prosperity lies in the rise and fall of agriculture. Therefore, it is necessary to change the general methods for agriculture. I believe it is also necessary to vigorously respect agriculture, cherish rural areas, and stabilize farmers to increase the population. It is essential to establish this policy.

Toda: In short, introducing products made by others and profiting from them, or using someone else's belt to wrestle with them - if the majority of the population holds this kind of mindset, that would be terrible. This kind of mindset has no value as the "essence of all things". The extinction of these kinds of people is a great human physiology. In ancient times, the scholar, farmer, artisan, and merchant were ranked in that order, but now merchants dare to swagger in front of ordinary people. This is a great error. In short, if we open our eyes and want to develop Japan, then farmers and artisans are production experts. They cannot be compared to the officials or merchants who are consumers!

Takada: Proper farmers also advocate the need for agricultural experts, but in the current situation, Japan must still vigorously develop industry. Therefore, the industrial population must also be increased. However, if the entire nation is unable to leave rural life and unable to become a nation, then what kind of national system can it be? This does not mean concentrating large factories in a certain place and having them lead lives detached from the land. It means that they can work and still be in touch with the land. To put it further, there should also be factories for manufacturing parts in farmers' homes. I believe that in the future, Japan should unite agriculture and industry. This is the most important thing. In any case, if life is separated from the land, it will lead to self-destruction. People who are not intimately familiar with manure and fertilizer are absolutely useless. Walking barefoot across the earth, carrying fertilizer on one's shoulders, and playing in the fields - if the nation is not like this, then that country can never prosper.

Toda: I agree with what you said. Handling manure changes one's outlook on life, and one's spirit becomes magnanimous and great. Now, let's take the example of a certain steel factory. The factories in Toba and Kobe. In the Toba factory, people from nearby fishing villages and farming villages come to work. The industry is done meticulously, so people are quite tired. However, the workers here have no illnesses. Those who get sick are the administrative staff who manage the machines. The workers in Kobe are sallow and emaciated, seemingly suffering from edema. The factory there is simply a den of patients. What is the reason for this? The workers in Toba engage in fishing on their days off. The key to a country's prosperity and a nation's thriving is exactly the same. (Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, July 24th and 25th)

### Weaver Girl's Letter to the Cowherd, Celebrating the Recovery of the Concessions

East and West capitals. In the blink of an eye, more than one hundred years have passed. Measuring shadows and observing colors, ministers succumb to the Rong and Di. Envoys almost endured a hundred years of humiliation, but now we have recovered the territory of the nine provinces and the traces of Yu the Great. This is what this concubine has been eagerly anticipating. This concubine is ignorant and lacking in knowledge and experience. However, seeking antiquity and seeking past deeds, the journey was once bumpy and long. Following the agreed-upon laws, there was no choice but to ask the uncles and brothers for help, but they remained silent and lonely. Thus, Zhao's spirit was lost. Taking office and engaging in politics, this concubine always resides in solitude, filled with fear and trepidation. However, worldly affairs are difficult to predict, and we know that changes are inevitable. From now on, I will carefully weave silk and seize every moment. Be diligent in our duties and endeavors. We must know that governance is rooted in agriculture. If perchance there is a disturbance of the mind and a divine epidemic, I will feel that the dark moon truly illuminates. It would not hurt to seek true calligraphy for a portrait and distinguish colors. Of course, change the cap and shift uncertain stars. From now on, let us rejoice and be healthy, and forever maintain auspiciousness and prosperity. Your concubine Weaver Girl bows her head and kowtows again.

### Joint Regular Meeting of Japanese Army and Overseas Authorities

Held Yesterday

The joint guidance of the Japanese authorities in Shanghai and overseas for Chinese news reporters in this city was held as usual yesterday (the 6th) at 3:00 PM at the Hui Zhong Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. Officials from the Embassy's Shanghai Office, the Information Department, Vice Consul Fukuma, Corporal Shiota from the News Department, and Trustee Akai from the Army News Department attended. They cordially discussed the world's political situation for the past week for a long time, and the meeting concluded after an hour.

### Planning by Various Professional Committees to Procure Raw Materials for Factories Will Unify Distribution for Factory Use in the Future; If Successful, 24-Hour Operation Can Begin Within Two Months

All factories managed by the Army during the Incident have been gradually returned to our government for management. Among the 140 factories returned, textile factories account for 67. Now that the two concessions in Shanghai have been recovered, the revival and prosperity of Shanghai's factory industry is crucial to the economic construction of Greater Shanghai. A reporter from the Central News Agency recently learned from authoritative sources in Shanghai's industrial circles that since the government announced its participation in the war, in order to implement the wartime economic policy guidelines, adjust economic institutions, and implement autonomous control of materials by commercial organizations, the main focus has been on increasing production, streamlining raw material sources, replenishing the raw material needs of factories, and increasing product output. The flour and wheat professional committee, cotton industry professional committee, oil and grain professional committee, and related factory industry associations under the National Commercial Control Association are all actively procuring production raw materials and unifying distribution. At present, factories throughout the city, such as textile factories, flour mills, oil mills, match factories, silk reeling factories, and other chemical industrial product factories, will gradually begin 24-hour manufacturing and production within the next two months. Therefore, Shanghai's entire industry can restore its normal prosperity of the past.

### The End of the Cigarette Black Market; Vendors Arrested Yesterday, Account Books Checked; Further Private Operations Will Be Prosecuted in Court

In order to thoroughly eliminate the cigarette black market, the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association has instructed all wholesalers and retailers to sell all distributed cigarettes after removing the packaging and to collect all the empty cigarette packs of the distributed cigarettes. At the same time, sales outlets involved in the black market will have their distribution cards revoked and distribution permanently suspended. It is heard that supervisors have been dispatched to cooperate with the police bureaus in each district to crack down on street vendors specializing in selling cigarettes on the black market, and some vendors have already been punished by the bureau. In addition, in order to eliminate the evils of the black market and prevent sales outlets from engaging in malfeasance, spot checks will be carried out on the account books of various wholesalers and retailers to examine whether there is hoarding and participation in black market activities. A Shanghai News reporter learned from the association yesterday that the measures to eliminate the black market this time will advance simultaneously with both curative and fundamental policies. The supervision work is very serious. Violators will be punished according to the contract, and those responsible will be arrested and sent to court for prosecution. It is said that the rampant cigarette black market is caused by general vendors and hoarders competing to purchase at high prices. However, there are suspicions that sales outlets are colluding in fraud. Selling cigarettes after removing the packaging and spot-checking account books are one of the fundamental ways to eliminate the black market.

### Personnel Transferred from the First Police Bureau

Personnel from the judicial police office of the former Shanghai First Special District Local Court were originally recommended by the former Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department from various police bureaus and appointed by the court. Furthermore, when the former Shanghai Municipal Council Police Department litigated criminal cases, special reporters were sent to the court to record testimony. Currently, the judicial police have been organized into a judicial police corps by the local procuratorate. Therefore, the former judicial police office of the First Special District has been abolished, and the right to prosecute is assumed by the procuratorate. The work of recording testimony is also no longer necessary. In addition, the Legal Department of the former Shanghai Municipal Council has also been closed. Therefore, the personnel from these three departments have been transferred by order of the First Police Bureau. Those transferred to the Criminal Special High Section include clerks Jiang Baoliang and Zhao Shiyu, first-class first-level staff members Liang Bingchao, Yao Jiahuan, Shang Zhaolong, Yang Peiran, Xu Jinwen, and Qian Qiulin, first-class second-level staff members Luo Chuanzhang, Liu Zidang, Li Tongliang, Chen Bingyuan, Yuan Zhaoxin, Gu Qilu, Yao Tingmei, and fifteen others. Those transferred to the General Supervision Office include first-class first-level staff members Zhou Jinlao and Tao Wenrong, first-class second-level staff members Yuan Zhiwu, Xu Siming, and Shao Yukun, second-class staff member Xu Shide, Ni Zhonglin, and third-class staff member Chen Shouchang, and eight others.

### Public Association Section

Renamed Economic Organizations Management Section

The former Shanghai Municipal Council's Bureau of Material Control had a Public Association Section to strictly manage the various trade associations within the concession. Now that the Public Concession has been taken over, the Police Headquarters has been reorganized into the Shanghai Special Municipality Second District Office, and the Bureau of Material Control has been reorganized into the Economic Affairs Office, responsible for material control and all economic matters.

It is learned that the original Public Association Section will be renamed the Economic Organizations Management Section. As for the position of Section Chief, the former head of the Public Association Section has resigned, and a replacement is being sought, which is expected to be announced within a day.

Public Association Monthly Report

Still Required for Submission; Furthermore, the former Public Association Section stipulated that the dynamics of various industries should be reported once a month for review. The current Economic Affairs Office strictly implements this monthly report, so various industry associations must still submit their monthly reports on time. The deadline for submitting the monthly report for the previous month has already arrived, and various associations and factories should expedite their submission as scheduled to comply with regulations.

Public Association Registration

The Police Bureau Handles It Accordingly; Furthermore, the Shanghai Special Municipality First Inspection Bureau handles the registration of public associations and organizations within the former Police Headquarters according to the original procedures. Therefore, the establishment of various industry associations and social organizations, as well as gatherings, must still be registered with the bureau at No. 01, main building; otherwise, they will be banned.

### Do Not Waste Water and Electricity

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who inquired with parties managing public utilities such as water and electricity, the supply of water and electricity for civilian use has never been restricted. However, in recent years, due to the sharp increase in raw material prices, the departments do not want to increase water and electricity fees excessively to avoid increasing the burden on residents. Therefore, they have no choice but to implement restrictions, i.e., when the prescribed amount is exceeded, the bureau will charge users a higher fee for the exceeded amount of water and electricity. Since the implementation of this method, most users have been able to limit their usage. In order to conserve resources during this extraordinary period, the authorities specifically request all users to save water and electricity as much as possible, even within the prescribed usage limit, and hope that residents will cooperate and not deliberately waste water and electricity.

### Welfare Association Sends Off Major Fujioka

Major Fujioka Hideo, the head of the Japanese Shanghai Gendarmerie's West Shanghai Team, will soon be honorably transferred away from Shanghai. The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association believes that Major Fujioka has spared no effort in maintaining the normal citizens of this city during his term of office. In order to express their thoughts on his departure, they held a tea party at the association's new venue on the afternoon of the 6th to send him off. Attendees included the guest of honor, Major Fujioka Hideo, guests Su Chengde, the newly appointed Deputy Director of the First and Third Police Bureaus, as well as Yoshida Tosuke, Li Guohua, and members Ding Fubao, Wang Haibo, Wang Shuxian, Ren Qingshan, He Wuliang, Shen Yiruo, Wu Shaoting, Song Zhuozai, Di Jiuhua, Zhou Xingchu, Zhou Mengbai, Jin Zongcheng, Jin Guanxian, Lin Kanghou, Shao Baosheng, Ai Zhudeng, Tang Zhiliang, Xu Busun, Sun Duanhuang, Chen Shaoyuan, Chen Riping, Cheng Cheng Yin, Chen Bin He, Chen Hongquan, Xu Xiaochu, Xu Guanqun, Xu Jingfu, Zhang Yipeng, Ai Luqing, Xiang Kangxi, Lei Xianzhi, Zhao Jinqing, Wen Guanting, Bao Guochang, Qing Xiang, Chang Nanqun, Gu Kemin, and more than seventy others. Chairman Wen Lanting presided over the meeting. Secretary-General Zhang Yipeng delivered a farewell speech, the gist of which was: "Major Fujioka aims to bring peace and stability to Shanghai and eliminate violence, so that the residents of West Shanghai can live and work in peace and contentment. The members of this association greatly admire him." Major Fujioka then delivered a reply, in addition to expressing his gratitude, stating that he would always remember the help he received from all parties in Shanghai and use it as a compass for his future efforts in Sino-Japanese cooperation. Wen Lanting then successively introduced Su Chengde, Yoshida Tosuke, and Li Guohua, as well as Chen Riping, the newly appointed Director of Economics of the First District, and the people attending the meeting. Afterwards, everyone enjoyed refreshments and chatted happily until 6:30 PM, when the party ended with great pleasure.

### Spanish Embassy

Beijing Office to Move to Nanjing

After our National Government returned to Nanjing, the Spanish government recognized the National Government on June 30th of the 30th year of the Republic, following other Axis countries. Since the Spanish Minister to China, Marte Natrat, established the embassy in Shanghai, he has strived to promote Sino-Spanish relations and has made significant contributions.

The Anti-British and Anti-American Association of the Republic of China has specially requested the Municipal Government to suggest designating August 1st as the Revival Day of the Republic of China and requested the Municipal Government to establish a Revival Memorial Tower in the Central District (the intersection of the former Public Concession and the former French Concession) on Duoya Road. This has been submitted by the Municipal Government to the Executive Yuan, which in turn has been submitted to the Central Political Committee and then to the Supreme National Defense Council for approval. It has also been stipulated that all sectors of the country should uniformly fly flags on that day to celebrate, and local governments should convene commemorative conferences for all sectors.

### Prosecutors Rotate on Duty During Non-Office Hours

In Order to Respond Quickly

The Shanghai Local Procuratorate, following the principle of establishing an independent judicial institution in this city, as completed by the Department of Judicial Administration, has announced its establishment. The Chief Prosecutor of the Procuratorate, Chen Zhenjun, believes that the nature of the procuratorate is different from that of the judiciary, and that Shanghai has an emergency situation that should be dealt with at any time. Even during non-office hours, it should be rotated separately in order to provide quick response. Once each prosecutor is on duty, they must not leave their post without permission. In case of leave for urgent matters, they must appoint a person to act as their agent; otherwise, it will be considered dereliction of duty. Yesterday, he specifically notified all subordinate prosecutors to strictly abide by and implement this.

Members will be notified a week in advance with a poster. In addition to specifying the purchase date and location, the notice will also clearly state the types of goods for sale, their prices, and the amount that can be purchased, so that members can make their selections in advance. The supplies offered this time are purely essential daily necessities such as food, soap, oil, cigarettes, underwear (knitted goods), and fuel.

### News Association Drives Further Economy Campaign

The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Citizens' Welfare Association, the Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association, and other local people's organizations are sparing no effort to correct social decadence and cultivate a thrifty atmosphere by promoting the economy campaign. The newly established News Association is also following the lead of various groups, launching an economy publicity week from July 20th to 26th for its members.

### Renowned Athlete Li Zhitang Passes Away

Mr. Li Zhitang, a consultant for the East Asia Restoration Association, served in the press circle for over twenty years. He possessed extraordinary insight and profound arguments, and was long admired by his colleagues.

His telegram to overseas students and overseas Chinese, explaining the essentials of national salvation and listing them clearly and thoroughly, was especially praised by insightful people. In recent years, Mr. Li has been tirelessly traveling between Tianjin and Shanghai, consistently advocating for peace and reconstruction. His son, Li Gonghan, runs the Shanghai Daily in Shanghai and the People's Amusement Park in Hangzhou, aiming to guide young people, cultivate strength, and raise national consciousness. All those who knew Mr. Li mourned his passing, saying that the peace and reconstruction front had lost a great pillar.

This announcement is hereby made to inform everyone.

### Hot Water Shops to be Allocated Second Batch of Coal

The first batch of 500 tons of subsidized coal for hot water shops was stopped selling at 12:00 noon yesterday. A total of sixteen hot water shops did not go to collect the coal, possibly due to lost notification slips. The association will try its best to make arrangements with coal merchants to allow them to purchase coal in the next round. As for the subsidized coal for hot water shops north of the Suzhou River, the date of distribution is expected to be officially decided within a few days. The Hot Water Shop Association, considering that the subsidized coal obtained by the industry is still not enough for fuel, has decided to supply a second batch of subsidized coal. The specific measures have now been agreed upon and will be supplied soon.

### Letter

To the Editor,

I recently read an article in your newspaper titled "Unified Rice Distribution in Two Districts by Allied Cooperative," which was drafted by the Guofeng News Agency. The facts are inconsistent with the truth. I would like to clarify as follows:

1. The household rice ration currently distributed in Shanghai is not purchased by our cooperative, and our cooperative is not currently responsible for purchasing.
2. Our cooperative is directly under the jurisdiction of the Food Department and does not belong to the Flour Food Bureau system. However, due to the special circumstances in Shanghai, the Shanghai Food Ration Adjustment Committee has been formed separately. The type of rice and the amount of ration are decided by the Adjustment Committee. Our cooperative follows the orders of the Food Department and the Adjustment Committee. If there are any difficulties, we will ask for instructions separately before making a decision.
3. A considerable amount of food rice has been shipped to Shanghai from various places in the past month, but the figure of 200,000 bags is still only hearsay. How to make an overall plan is a matter for the local and central governments. Our cooperative has not received any explicit orders.

I am writing to request a correction for the public's convenience.

### Sports: Celebrates the Recovery of the Concession with a Successful Charity Football Match. Three Provinces Lost to the Righteous Army. An Anonymous Person Purchased a Charity Ball for 100,000 Yuan.

The Stadium Was Packed

The charity football match initiated by the Three Provinces Sports Association of this city to celebrate the recovery of the concession held its final match yesterday at 2:00 PM at the Yiguo Stadium. As a result, the Three Provinces team was defeated by the Righteous Army with a score of 3 to 1 due to insufficient strength. The event was successfully completed. The audience reached 15,000 people, which is unprecedented in recent years. The ceremony was grand, and Mr. Wu Yunzi, the chairman of the Xinwenbao, performed the opening kick.

Three Seniors Presided Over the Auction of the Ball. Midway through the match, the auction of the charity ball was presided over by three seniors: Wen Lanting, Yuan, and Deng Lin Kanghou. Cheng Zhiliang reported the price of the ball on the broadcasting stage. As a result, an anonymous person purchased the ball for a high price of 100,000 yuan. This number broke the previous price of 70,000 yuan, creating a new record. The spirit of benevolence is commendable.

The order of the venue was maintained by the 8th District, the Central Special Police Corps. At the beginning of the small match, Saint John took the lead, and Ma Ya shot through the net with a hundred steps. The athletes from the Three Provinces team were not willing to be outdone, and Jin Lusheng made a contribution on the side. The first half ended with a score of 1 to 1. After the choice of venue, the Three Provinces team changed three players. Yin Bing tried his hand and returned with success. The good times did not last long, and Saint John Gegerren immediately pulled back a goal, making it 2 to 1. Before long, time ran out, and the two sides shook hands and made peace.

The historical axis began, and the two teams waited in formation. The referee reported the corner kick, and the Three Provinces team carried the ball and invaded the Righteous Army. Luo Sier had a whim and withdrew halfway. After thirteen minutes, the Three Provinces team launched another attack, and Sun Jinshun made a through pass. A Jie changed his tricks, which was indeed effective, but Sun was offside first, and his efforts were in vain. After nineteen minutes, the Righteous Navy's Dipan Na was indeed extraordinary, and scored, and Ji Tu opened the score. At this time, the Three Provinces team's position was ravaged by the iron cavalry of the Righteous Army. Zhang Lingen saved many dangerous balls, making it difficult for the enemy to score. After the sample time, the Three Provinces rear gradually became unsustainable, and Dipan Na committed a single ride, with the momentum of breaking bamboo, as if entering no man's land. The Three Provinces team lost ground again. After twenty-seven minutes, the Righteous Navy's Machiti hand-kissed the ball and was penalized with a twelve-yard kick. Old Sun hit the ball with one kick. In the two minutes of the line field, the Righteous Army's Wei Jian Ba Cha broke into the formation and made another achievement. The Three Provinces team unfortunately lost with a score of 1 to 3.

At the match, the president of the association, Pan Sanxing, gave a thank you speech, and then the president of the Banking Association, Ye Fuzhi, presented the awards. All the income from the event, excluding expenses, will be donated to the Shengxin Second Education Scholarship. A grand charity event was then announced to be closed. Righteous events Keloni

### Respectfully Thank All Parties for Supporting the Charity Event. Mr. Pan's Enthusiasm and Perseverance are Engraved in Our Hearts.

The conference has now come to a successful conclusion. This newspaper and the Xinwenbao's scholarship fund have always received the care and support of all sectors of society, which is worthy of gratitude. And this time, the Three Provinces Sports Association, led by Mr. Pan Sanxing, took the lead in commemorating the recovery of the concession, demonstrating righteousness and hosting this grand charity event, with passionate support, which made this newspaper feel grateful. During the event, we were honored by the support of the Minister of Education, Minister Ding, Governor Li, Mayor Chen, and other officials, as well as the ambassadors of France and Italy, the military attachés stationed in Shanghai, Ambassador Wu Kaisheng, Mr. Cheng Zhiliang, Mr. Li Zeyi, etc. Li Songling, the generosity of the anonymous donation for the ball, the enthusiastic support of all sectors of society, Chen Zhongjun's cooperative efforts, and the free use of the venue by the owner of Yiguo, and the assistance of the Donghua Liaison and the two sports associations, either donating the printing of special publications or donating charity balls, are all deeply appreciated. Taking advantage of the grand closing of the conference, I would like to add a few words to express my gratitude.

### Translation and Discussion: Price Control Measures and Their Institutions

Mr. Shotaro Ishiwatari, the top economic advisor to the National Government, said in Japan, "The Chinese economic circles are also asking about the price debt issue, and a method has been set, which will be implemented soon." We believe that the price issue is an important issue, and all parties concerned are giving it careful consideration. However, in order to achieve perfection, we dare to offer the following opinions:

Prices are a comprehensive and concentrated expression of the economic situation. Therefore, when observing and solving the price problem, a comprehensive approach must be used. However, the past experience of various countries is not necessarily the case. One of the reasons is that in the previous so-called free economy, prices and prices were regarded as a natural phenomenon and therefore not subject to control. The second reason is that in previous economics, prices and price characteristics were analyzed into two elements: materials and currency, and were not studied as a unified whole. The economic institutions of any country are separate for those in charge of materials and those in charge of currency funds. There are few precedents for institutions that integrate the two and consider and plan the implementation from a unified perspective. It was not until countries gradually implemented controlled economies that they successively established competent agencies to monitor prices. However, the progress was also hindered by traditional inertia. What is the reality here? If there is the kind of situation pointed out above, then a truly ideal comprehensive institution should be established.

Regarding the issue from the Japanese perspective, what authority should the Nanjing Embassy, the Shanghai Embassy Office, and the Consulate General have in controlling prices in relation to Japan's controlled economy? Everyone knows that the three agencies are cooperating to promote various Japanese policies, but now when dealing with the current central issue in Central China and the most needed comprehensive price policy issue, we cannot help but eagerly hope to obtain excellent comprehensive results. The above three agencies should take the solution of the price problem as their current responsibility and decide on an agency and personnel with full authority.

The core of the problem also lies in China. Here, the economic control mechanism of the new Greater Shanghai should first be organically unified. The original Special Municipal Government, the Ministry of Industry and the Bureau of Public Works have been unified under the command of Mayor Chen. If price control is successful, its significance is naturally extremely important. The controlled economy of the former Bureau of Public Works, with its excellent organization and personnel, should be 100% revived under the new conditions. Secondly, in China, there is still the issue of the relationship between Shanghai and Nanjing. What is the truth in this question and how should it be dealt with? I don’t want to discuss it here for the time being.

Finally, let’s talk about the adjustment between China and Japan. The responsibility and creativity for implementing various policies in China is naturally a matter for China, and there is no need to invoke the so-called new policy. However, this statement does not mean that Japan will not provide assistance and cooperation. In accordance with the spirit of the new policy, China must be given great assistance in theory and practice. The economic advisory system is a system that embodies the cooperation between China and Japan. We look forward to Ishiwatari and other consultants fulfilling their active tasks in promoting the implementation of comprehensive policies on solving the price problem.

### People, Relationships, and the World

— Zhao Xiang

Understanding the world is all learning,

Mastering relationships is the best writing.

Older people often criticize young people: "They don't understand the ways of the world." Young people haven't been in the world long, so they probably have nothing to say when criticized like this by older people who have more life experience!

So what is "the world"? How can one "understand" it? What are "relationships"? How can one "master" them?

The so-called "world" clearly refers to everything in the world; while "worldliness" refers to the principles of everything in the world; "understanding" means having a clear understanding. In this way, practical experience in life and accepting knowledge from books can enrich our ability to observe things. Applying the analysis of dialectical materialism, the inevitable, the accidental, the contradiction, the development, the unity, we can speculate on her inevitable results, and then we can have the confidence to decide what to discard and what to take.

What are "relationships"? There is a saying in our country: "You can eat if you don't know how to read, but you can't eat if you don't know people." "Relationships" means being able to "know people"—to understand their personality, thoughts, status, etc., and to understand the relationship between people. The cells that make up society are individual people, and people cannot exist independently of society, so they cannot avoid interacting with each other. Because people's hearts are different, just like their faces, there is great value in studying the way they interact; who should be close, who should be distant, how to be distant, how to be close.

Therefore, "understanding the world" means creating an advanced worldview; "mastering relationships" means establishing a correct outlook on life.

### Eating Tomatoes

— Wang Shuai'ai

Tomatoes, the name comes from the transliteration of "Tomato". I don't know if they are imported goods, but now they are also commonly sold on the market. In the window of the fruit store, on the stall in the vegetable market, and sometimes in the basket hanging from the girls, you can see many bright red, shiny cloths. The plump appearance is already endearing, not to mention that the taste is delicious and the price is relatively cheap, the good ones are about three yuan a catty.

Maybe you can say that both are fine! Both ripe and raw are delicious. For raw ones, you can pick out the complete ones, wash them with soap, and then rinse them with cold boiled water or hot water. If you want to be more particular, you can soak them in a diluted solution of potassium permanganate in cold boiled water. It is easier to avoid losing vitamin C with cold boiled water, and hot boiled water does not lose much vitamin either. And it makes the skin easier to peel off. After peeling it off, you can make a small hole on it, pour in a little white sugar, stir it gently with chopsticks, and wait for half an hour before eating it. That's really delicious. It's best to put it in an ice cabinet, or you can cut it into thin slices and soak it in sugar juice. If you prefer to use refined salt instead of white sugar, that's also fine, it has a special flavor.

### Introduction: Introducing the Art of Mr. Yamagishi, a Famous Japanese Print Artist

Japanese print artist, Keiki Yamagishi, was born in 1892. In his twenties, he emerged in the domestic art scene, becoming a founding member of the Japanese Print Service Association. In the Taisho 15th year (1926), the Ministry of Education commissioned him to investigate prints in European and American countries. During the three wars at that time, his footprints reached fifteen countries. Art academies and museums in various countries competed to solicit his works for preservation.

In 1928, he taught in the United States at the age of only thirty-six. Originally, he was scheduled to give lectures for only a few months before returning to his country, but due to the strong retention of students, he stayed for as long as two years. In 1937, his masterpiece "One Hundred Views of the World" was completed, and his reputation grew. In the centenary year (of Japan), he began to produce "One Hundred Views of Greater East Asia." He went through hardships, entering and exiting gunfire to create on-site sketches, which shows his dedication to art. In April 1939, he was commissioned by the Naval Department to create a painting of the American warship Australia entering Yokohama Harbor. From November of the same year to March of the following year, he went to the front lines of Central and Southern China as a war artist, during which his works were abundant.

His two masterpieces, "One Hundred Views of the World" and "One Hundred Views of Greater East Asia," were exhibited at the Shanghai Gallery last year and received excellent reviews. Once transportation becomes smooth, he is preparing to travel to the Southern Hemisphere for sketching trips.

In addition to prints, he also excels in oil paintings. In Taisho 7 (1918), the Japanese Empress purchased and stored his work in the Imperial Palace. His print was presented to the Japanese Emperor on the day of his marriage, which was praised and accepted. Mr. Yamagishi has contributed the most to the glorious position of Japanese prints in the world art scene. Mr. Yamagishi has already arrived in Shanghai and will go north to Beijing Normal University in early September to teach. The northern art scene will show vigorous vitality, which can be predicted.

### Lost and Found Disposal Method

(Letter) I lost a gold watch in a tram a few months ago. Fortunately, it was found by passenger Xu Zaikang, who handed it over to ticket clerk No. 1031, who transferred it to the tram company for safekeeping. In the meantime, it was also advertised in the social services section of your newspaper. After seeing the report, I immediately went to the tram company on Suzhou Road to inquire, but unexpectedly, the company used the same excuse, delaying in every possible way. Despite months of verbal or written negotiations, I have not been able to get any results, and they have not even given a word of reply. Therefore, I advise all ladies and gentlemen that if you find any lost items in the tram, you can submit them to the social service department of this newspaper or the nearest police station for collection. Do not hand them over to the tram company again to avoid misappropriation. Sincerely, Zhuo Anhua.

### Visit to the Bosco Children's Home (II)

The Work of the Bosco Children's Home

The Catholic Charity Association, whose full name is "Catholic St. John Bosco Children's Home," is also called the Salesian Society because its patron saint is St. Francis de Sales. It specializes in using charitable methods to educate poor teenagers. Its emergence was due to the kindness and efforts of St. John Bosco, but its historical background cannot be ignored. After the Industrial Revolution in Europe, capitalism advanced sharply in Europe and America. Tens of thousands of poor people were swept into various factories, abandoning their children and unable to care for them. These children idled, played, stole, scolded, and harmed each other in the dirty streets of the slums. The degradation of the children themselves and the losses to society and the country were unbearable to contemplate. Therefore, St. John Bosco's establishment of education programs for vagrant and poor children met the needs of the times.

The Bosco Children's Home organizes the following activities: (1) Using play methods to gather children who are wandering in the streets, using good treatment to teach them basic knowledge. This is the current "Celebration Hospital" (慶禮院) enterprise of the association. (2) Gathering child laborers in general factories every night and on holidays, teaching them a little knowledge and etiquette, which is today's night school and holiday school. (3) For children without parents, homes, or jobs, boarding schools are established to accommodate and educate them. In addition to general knowledge, they are taught craftsmanship skills. This has become the later vocational school, so that children can support themselves after learning a skill, start a family, and become productive members of society and the country; (4) In accordance with the needs of various countries and regions, cultivate scientifically trained agricultural and industrial children for the country, and open ordinary primary schools, higher primary schools, and middle schools to cultivate talents preparing for advanced studies.
