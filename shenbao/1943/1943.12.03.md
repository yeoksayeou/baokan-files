### Japan in the Current Phase

— Chen Binhe

Last month, Binhe traveled to Japan for sightseeing. After returning to Shanghai, he spoke twice about his impressions of the trip eastward to inform the people of our country. Yesterday, he was again invited to a tea party by Messrs. Lan Ting, Zhang Yunbo, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Gu Nanqun, and Xiang Kangyuan, who earnestly requested him to further describe what he had seen on his trip eastward. Therefore, he does not decline to give a simple report. The following is a record of his remarks, published here, and hopes that readers will give it their attention.

Today, I want to report on the two major issues that I considered most important after arriving in Japan: wartime production and wartime national mobilization and national life. At the same time, these two issues can also be summarized into one: enhancing war capability.

First, let's talk about Japan's wartime production. In short, Japan is already mobilizing all its manpower and resources, seizing time and space, and striving for the highest efficiency in production.

First, the "super-priority industry doctrine" is Japan's general guiding principle for engaging in production. Currently, due to the escalating war in the South Pacific, and at the same time, Japanese authorities deeply feel that while the quality of domestically produced aircraft is excellent, the quantity cannot be ignored. It is imperative to exceed the enemy's quantity in order to win the decisive battle in terms of time and increase production in a short period, even more so than increasing it in the years to come. Therefore, Japan has changed its previous emphasis on the "five major focus industries" (aviation, shipbuilding, steel, coal, and light metals) to now prioritize "aviation first."

Second, the issue of production unification. Japan has recently undergone many changes, actively moving towards unification. In the past, the management of production departments was fragmented, for example, materials were under the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, labor was under the Ministry of Health and Welfare, and funds were under the Ministry of Finance, leading to inconsistencies in management. Secondly, design was under the Planning Board, while implementation was under the various ministries of the Army, Navy, and Commerce and Industry, leading to inconsistencies between design and implementation. In terms of factory distinction, the Navy had its own managed factories, while private factories were under the control of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Products from military-managed factories could not be obtained by private factories, affecting production. This was an inconsistency in management. The Army and Navy each determined production based on their needs, leading to surpluses and deficiencies in production. This was an inconsistency in ordering.

The Japanese authorities, recognizing that the various inconsistencies were obstacles to production, decided to establish the Ministry of Munitions, to expedite or slow down matters, to make manufacturing easier, and to implement unified ordering. All kinds of factories, except for those with special characteristics within the Navy, are to be managed or controlled by the Ministry of Munitions to unify management. The Planning Board is to be merged into the Ministry of Munitions to unify design and implementation. In addition, the Ministry of Transportation and Communications is to be established to coordinate port ships, railways, and other tools with wartime increased production.

The above is about the various dynamics regarding Japan's wartime production.

Next, let's talk about Japan's national mobilization and national life. The Japanese government announced on the second day that it would implement the "Domestic Posture Strengthening Plan" nationwide starting in October. The points regarding national mobilization can be summarized as follows:

University students, except for those in science and engineering, will no longer be granted deferments from military service.

Reductions in civil servants, further narrowing the scope of civil service.

Expansion of the conscription of men for labor service, prohibiting men from taking up light and easy occupations.

### Fierce Battle on Bougainville Island: Japanese Aircraft Bomb Enemy Positions, Military Facilities in Eastern India Also Attacked

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): A Japanese naval air unit in the South Pacific reported on the 2nd: On November 17th, Japanese naval air units launched a surprise attack on an enemy transport convoy sailing west of Mono Island in the Solomon Islands, destroying a large transport ship. That evening, they heavily bombed enemy positions near Torokina Point on Bougainville Island, setting one area on fire.

Argentina, Jingcheng, 2nd (Central News Agency): The Americans landing on Bougainville Island are under fierce attack by ground forces, and the fighting in that area is very intense. The losses of the American army have been staggering. It is said that in just ten days, their casualties have reached no less than one thousand men. According to a report by the Associated Press, American forces have been raiding eastern India since the afternoon of that island, bombing military facilities.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to a report from a certain Japanese military base in the South Pacific: On November 30th, at 8:00 AM, enemy B-24 and P-40 aircraft, totaling 30 planes, attacked Japanese positions near Dang in New Guinea. Japanese ground artillery shot down three of the B-24s. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### Heavy Losses in Attacking Gilberts, U.S. Admits Miscalculation, Awe of Japanese Troops' Heroic Spirit

Argentina, Jingcheng, 2nd (Central News Agency): Major General Smith, commander of the U.S. 2nd Marine Division, recently gave a speech, frankly admitting that the U.S. military miscalculated when landing on Tarawa Island. The gist of his remarks was: The U.S. military miscalculated in this operation, suffering unusually heavy losses. The Japanese military had spent fifteen months fortifying Tarawa Island and building strongholds that could only be destroyed by direct hits from 2,000-pound bombs. Within 100 meters of the coast of Tarawa Island, 105 corpses of U.S. Navy personnel were found. It is reported that preliminary reports estimate U.S. casualties at 1,902 dead and 2,680 wounded, totaling 3,772. However, U.S. authorities also admit that these figures are only preliminary estimates, and it is expected that the U.S. military lost at least 3,000 or 4,000 dead. The heroic spirit of the Japanese soldiers defending the Gilbert Islands seems to have caused extreme panic among the U.S. landing forces. U.S. commanders and war correspondents have tried their best to describe the real situation of the U.S. military operations and the losses they suffered. However, James Roosevelt, the eldest son of Roosevelt, stated after returning to Pearl Harbor that a Japanese unit had bravely attacked U.S. forces on Makin Island. He saw four Japanese officers wearing military uniforms and badges, leading several hundred soldiers to attack U.S. positions. Smith, in his report to his mobile unit in Dana, described the heroic conduct of the Japanese in the face of the enemy, stating that the 69th Regiment of New Zealand attempted to attack a certain area. Japanese troops, knowing they were outnumbered, had five officers commit suicide. The U.S. military suffered the greatest losses when landing on Tarawa. According to a report by frontline commander Edison, 2,000 to 3,000 U.S. sailors attempted to land, but only several hundred survived the fierce Japanese attack. As Smith said, the Japanese military had fortified Tarawa Island in just fifteen months, causing the U.S. military landing to be a difficult battle. Therefore, U.S. officials and the public alike recognize that it will become increasingly difficult for the U.S. military to carry out operations in areas fortified by the Japanese. For example, the New York News commented that, based on the landing operation in the Gilbert Islands, even if the U.S. military attacks Japanese bases, they will only increase casualties and may ultimately fail to achieve victory. In this case, it would be better for the U.S. military to use poison gas.

### Agricultural Development Corporation to be Established in the Philippines

### Japan's Attitude Towards Timor Island is Extremely Serious, Embassy in Portugal Clarifies Facts

Lisbon (Central News): Regarding Portuguese Timor, recent rumors from anti-Axis propaganda agencies have been completely clarified by Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar's speech last week and the special statement made by the Japanese Embassy in Lisbon on the 30th. The statement by the Japanese Embassy is as follows: The Japanese troops stationed on Timor Island are doing their best to protect the lives and property of the local Portuguese people and have never infringed upon the slightest freedom of the Portuguese people in farming and fishing. The Japanese authorities provide all possible convenience to the Portuguese people for sending and receiving telegrams and contacting their home country, but naturally cannot allow the sending and receiving of secret coded telegrams in order to maintain confidentiality. On October 5th, the anniversary of Portugal's National Day, the Japanese military commander and consul general visited the governor of Timor Island to offer congratulations. Japan's attitude towards the Timor Island authorities is very serious. The Japanese fleet also protected the Portuguese people who were arrested at the Macau Customs due to pirate disturbances, and sent them back to their families separately. They also released British women.

### Lieutenant Commander Koshiba of the Navy Gave a Speech Yesterday, Confident of Ultimate Victory

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency): Since the National Government officially declared war on Britain and the United States in January of this year, we have been preparing to drive out Britain and the United States. After China and Japan concluded a treaty of alliance on October 3rd, our country has been working closely with our ally Japan. In addition to striving for domestic construction, we are also marching in the same step towards defeating Britain and the United States. Recently, our ally Japan has demonstrated unparalleled combat power in the South Pacific and achieved great victories. Our people are extremely excited and express their infinite respect to the strong combat results of our ally, based on their position of building East Asia. This glorious victory has made a great contribution to the completion of the two major missions of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. At the same time, the enemy, Britain and the United States, is deeply afraid that the adverse fortune of successive defeats will arouse resentment among the people at home. In addition to actively concealing their defeats, they also convened a summit conference of the heads of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Cairo to discuss future war strategies and expand propaganda, in an attempt to alleviate the anti-war atmosphere among the people. The British and American empires, who boast of their superior civilization, are bound to collapse in the near future. After the Central News Agency received the Japanese Imperial Headquarters' announcement of the fourth great victory in the Gilbert Islands, it went to the naval attaché's office of the Japanese army in Nanjing and interviewed Lieutenant Commander Koshiba, assistant naval attaché, who made the following remarks: Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, it has gained abundant resources within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, giving the enemy a great loss. In order to seize this loss, the enemy has concentrated all its resources and started a general counterattack. Based on the intention to secure Australia, they started fighting in the Solomons area last fall, resulting in the battles of Rabaul and Bougainville. The enemy attempted to construct a false rampart from the Solomons, through New Guinea, and the Philippines, dividing Japan outside the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then individually defeating Japan and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, due to the disastrous defeat in the six naval battles of Bougainville Island, their offensive progress was obstructed. This time, they intended to overcome the crisis and change the system, and thus the Gilbert Islands battle began again. In that battle, the enemy has suffered four consecutive sacrifices to date. The air battles that are staged everywhere are still as fierce as the air battles in the Solomons. This kind of war is a struggle for the inner South Sea islands as a preparation for attack. The Gilbert Islands naval battle was the enemy's first clumsy work. Therefore, we have also made full preparations. We utilize the heavenly gift of the southern base, which is very easy to defend. Therefore, the enemy also feels its own danger and is returning with a renewed offensive. Because Japan possesses the unique and unparalleled islands of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, fighting for Japan and defending East Asia is a heavenly fortune bestowed upon the East Asian nations, which is beyond the enemy's expectations. The enemy has a huge fleet expenditure, years of construction projects, and an aircraft carrier that is the culmination of thousands of people's efforts. Under the threat of the Japanese Air Force, they are sinking one by one into the seabed. The blue sky knows, and there is a rightful punishment for those who act violently. The United States is deeply afraid of shaking military morale, and thus the Cairo Conference was created. Today, the situation in Burma is also progressing in our victory. All of this is enough to convince us that future victory absolutely belongs to us.

### German Military Experts Review the Overall Situation

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to the Huitong News Agency: Military experts here reviewed the losses suffered by the enemy on the European and Asian fronts, saying that in the past twenty weeks, the Soviet army's concentrated offensive on the Eastern Front has suffered extremely heavy losses, and its combat power has been greatly weakened. The losses suffered by the anti-Axis forces in the Eastern and Western theaters are also extremely heavy. For example, in the recent two weeks, the U.S. military's operations in the Southwest Pacific have resulted in the loss of seven aircraft carriers, meaning that all the aircraft carriers built by the U.S. this year have been lost here. Aircraft carriers are very important in the Pacific theater, and the loss of as many as seven can be said to be America's second Pearl Harbor event. The battlefields have not yet achieved their goals, and the U.S. military's attempt to break through the chain of Japanese island bases has not gone smoothly. Moreover, Japan has not yet deployed its main naval force, but has only used its excellent air force to deal with it.

### Fresh German Troops Open Eastern Front, Fierce Battle in Middle Reaches of Dnieper River, Soviet Defense Line at Cherkasy Breached

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to the Huitong News Agency: A military spokesman said last night that fresh German troops have now joined the fighting, so the Soviet forces on all fronts of the Eastern Front have been suppressed. Soviet war reports repeatedly mention the fact that the weather is bad and that the muddy period has begun. It is acknowledged here that the road conditions in the middle of the Eastern Front are very bad, but the greatest difficulty faced by the Soviet army is not the climate, but the fresh German troops.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency): According to frontline news: The German army has launched a large-scale counteroffensive in the Cherkasy area in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. It is reported that a German tank formation has broken through the Soviet defense line, annihilated a strong Soviet unit, and surrounded another unit. According to German sources, powerful formations of German fighter-bombers have been active on the main battlefields of the Eastern Front since the 29th, and have been actively supporting ground operations by bombing Soviet barracks, artillery positions, and mechanized units.

Fierce Fighting in the Orsha Highway Offensive and Defensive Battle

Berlin, 2nd (German News Agency): On Tuesday, the focus of the major defensive battle in the center of the Eastern Front was once again west of Smolensk. The Soviet army took advantage of the calm of the past nine days to replenish its exhausted infantry and tank divisions, and transferred reinforcements and a large number of heavy artillery units. After that, the enemy launched a predictably offensive against the German war front in the deep trapezoidal positions on both sides of the Smolensk-Orsha highway. The fierce battle between the two sides continued all day, even when it was dark, but the German divisions stationed in the area always firmly defended their front lines. Although the Soviet vanguard continued to receive reinforcements from the rear, the Soviet troops who temporarily broke through various strongholds were repelled in the immediate counterattack by the local German troops. At dusk, only narrow depressions were still in combat. At the same time, the remaining defensive positions were all firmly held by the German army. The pressure exerted by the Soviet army west and northwest of Gomel has not diminished. The German army withdrew from some strongholds in the area to shorten the defense line, without being resisted by the enemy army.

### Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Propaganda Department Formulates Propaganda Plan

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency): Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed. Over the past two years, the military victories of our allies have swept away the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, achieving glorious results. At the same time, in order to establish the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, our allies have spared no effort to assist Myanmar and the Philippines in achieving independence and the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India. Moreover, in view of the evolution of the world situation, China and Japan have signed a treaty of alliance, and the recently announced Greater East Asia Conference Declaration has ushered in a new stage in the East Asian situation. At this critical juncture of the war entering a decisive phase, as we approach the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, in order to strengthen the alliance between the two countries, enhance the awareness of the East Asian nations, promote the enthusiasm for combat, encourage unanimous cooperation to increase production, cooperate in the completion of the war, and promote the realization of comprehensive peace, the Propaganda Department has formulated a propaganda plan and distributed it to local propaganda agencies for implementation. It is learned that the plan stipulates that at 10:00 AM on the 8th, all agencies, organizations, schools, and district offices will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In order to show the solemn commemoration of the Greater East Asia War, the ceremony includes programs such as silence, paying tribute to the fallen soldiers, praying for the recovery of wounded and sick soldiers, and for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. The above gatherings are based on the principle that each agency holds them separately. If it is deemed necessary to hold joint meetings, a joint commemorative meeting can be held. In addition to the gatherings, each school and youth group can spontaneously hold sports meets or labor services and other activities to stimulate wartime spirit. As for the newspapers, in addition to continuously publishing manuscripts related to the war results of the Greater East Asia War, they will also publish a special issue commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War to increase production, detailing the relationship between increasing production and cooperating in the war, and various methods of increasing production. From the 8th to the 14th, a week-long campaign will be launched to expand wartime production promotion. Radio stations will invite celebrities to give speeches and hold special lectures on increasing production, inviting experts to give lectures. It has been learned that this propaganda focuses on achieving practical results, avoids empty and ostentatious actions, and cooperates with the overall youth rise movement in order to achieve greater results. (It is also learned) that the Greater East Asia Youth Overall Rise Movement will also begin on the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. According to the regulations of the Central Practice Committee, at 8:00 AM on the 8th, all youth in the country will get up early to implement dawn mobilization, depart for parades, express commemoration of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and implement the warm spirit of the youth in the overall decisive battle. On the day of the anniversary, people across the country will hold commemorative ceremonies separately. In addition, on the 9th, the anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war, a joint Sino-Japanese public decisive battle conference commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War and the National Government's participation in the war will be held at the Dahua Theater. Citizens and youth of the capital of China and Japan must participate, presided over by Mayor Zhou and Consul General Tanaka. After the ceremony, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department and Minister An of the Information Department of the Embassy will give speeches, and there will be Japanese military music performances and screenings of the Greater East Asia War newsreel "Bloody Battle in the South China Sea," military construction of the National Government, and other films. The propaganda slogans for this event are as follows: Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, support the Sino-Japanese alliance; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, practice the Greater East Asia Declaration; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, increase production; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, ensure public order; Commemorate the Greater East Asia War, stabilize people's livelihood; Advance bravely and vigorously, destroy Britain and the United States.

### Enemy Losses Statistics in the Battle of Bougainville Island

Personnel – 24,000 People, Material – 626 Million Yuan

Since the enemy troops landed on Bougainville Island on the morning of October 27th, up to the fifth aerial battle over Bougainville Island on November 17th, in just twenty days, the Japanese naval air force achieved unprecedented air combat results in the history of naval warfare, thwarting the enemy's counter-offensive attempts. As usual, the United States Navy Department neither confirms nor denies this major defeat, concealing the truth of the battle to deceive the public. Roosevelt fears that in addition to the failure of his war policy, admitting this defeat would be a fatal blow to his government.

At the previous meeting with foreign reporters, Japanese Intelligence Officer Iguchi strongly criticized the US authorities for quietly concealing the fact that American soldiers died in battle. At the meeting on the 22nd, he presented figures proving that the enemy suffered losses not only in terms of materials, but also in terms of personnel. The United States lost about 24,000 troops, which is the most painful loss of all. In addition, the construction cost of the warships bombed and sunk totaled 626 million yuan. The enemy's deceptive propaganda was shattered by this analysis.

Looking first at the loss of personnel, the number of crew members on ships that were sunk was 80% to 100%, on ships that were heavily damaged was 30% to 40%, and on ships that were destroyed was 10%. The estimated number of crew members is 2,000 for battleships and large aircraft carriers, 900 for heavy cruisers and medium aircraft carriers, 400 for cruisers, 200 to 250 for destroyers, 1,000 for large transport ships (including troops and crew), 550 for medium transport ships, and 400 for small transport ships. In total, there were at least 19,500 and at most 24,450 troops, a huge number, who have already been buried at the bottom of the sea.

On the other hand, let's look at the numbers for materials: not including those destroyed, just the warships that were sunk: the average construction cost of a battleship is 60 million yuan (4 ships), a large aircraft carrier is 32 million yuan (2 ships), a medium aircraft carrier is 20 million yuan (3 ships), a heavy cruiser is 15 million yuan (6 ships), a cruiser is 10 million yuan (9 ships), a destroyer is 6 million yuan (12 ships), and an unidentified ship is 10 million yuan (1 ship). The total is a huge amount of 626 million yuan, which has sunk to the bottom of the South Pacific Ocean. (翔: Translated from the November 25th edition of the Yomiuri Asahi Shimbun)

### Anti-Axis Leaders' Cairo Conference Concludes

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – It is reported that Roosevelt and Churchill arrived in Cairo one after the other on November 20th. Chiang Kai-shek also flew to the area with his wife. The three began holding talks on the 22nd, which lasted for eight days. According to a telegram from Cairo, the Cairo Communique regarding the talks was issued on the 1st. It is reported that the purpose of the talks was primarily to find a way to placate the Chongqing regime. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has been steadily progressing. The purpose of this conference was to prevent Chongqing from breaking away from the anti-Axis camp. In particular, the anti-offensive operations in the Pacific are unexpectedly difficult. This conference is a manifestation of the anxiety of the anti-Axis camp. The Cairo Communique also admits that the war against Japan is extremely difficult and will be prolonged. Judging from this point, it can be said that they have recognized the nerve war and that it has no impact on the Japanese people.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Washington: The US government stated on the 1st regarding the Cairo Conference: Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek held a meeting in a certain location in North Africa. Participants also included Supreme Allied Commander Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, British Commander-in-Chief of Forces in China, Stilwell, and Air Force Commander Chennault. The US Air Force Commander in India, Meyer, British Chief of Staff Brooke, Army Chief of Staff Cunningham, and Air Force Commander Portal also attended. After the meeting ended, Chiang, Roosevelt, and Churchill traveled together from Cairo to a certain location.

Turkey Paying Close Attention

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Hai Tong News Agency diplomatic correspondent, Fischer: The conference held by the anti-Axis powers in Tehran will pressure Turkey to change its neutral policy. This is the unanimous opinion of Turkish authorities. The meeting between Eden and the Turkish Foreign Minister in Cairo was due to the Soviet Union insisting that Britain must pressure Turkey to declare war on the Axis powers. This is a well-known fact. Turkey's skillful diplomatic tactics are advancing along a path that is unwilling to be bound, and it points out that Turkey's transportation hub is most vulnerable to air raids. If Turkey participates in the war, the damage to transportation and all its consequences should be the responsibility of Britain. However, Britain does not seem likely to force Turkey to follow the path taken by Portugal, because Germany's attitude and Germany's military strength in the Balkans are enough to prevent Britain from doing so. Furthermore, the entrance to the Aegean Sea is currently controlled by German forces, so the dream of passing through the Dardanelles Strait cannot be realized. All of the above points have been threatened by this anti-Axis conference in Tehran. Turkish authorities are deeply concerned that since previous attempts by the anti-Axis powers to pressure Turkey to join the war have failed, this time they may jointly exert pressure on Turkey, so Turkey is paying the utmost attention to this conference.

German Observations

Berlin, (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to the Hai Tong News Agency: The German newspapers today revealed to the German public that the anti-Axis powers intend to issue a declaration drafted at the Tehran Conference to the German people. Minister Schmidt stated at the information conference yesterday that if one reads the British and American newspapers carefully, one will know that a similar declaration will be issued recently. Germany is not surprised by the Tehran Conference; on the contrary, it makes us extremely satisfied. The Tehran Conference will discuss issues not resolved at the Moscow Foreign Ministers' Conference, such as Stalin's insistence on the demand for a second front, because he urgently needs a second front since he cannot gain military advantage against Germany. However, based on the lessons Germany has learned from the events in Italy, it is well aware that Roosevelt and Churchill have no intention of opening a second front, so the Tehran Conference is full of shadows of discord. The anti-Axis powers' propaganda campaign against the German people is not worth mentioning. Although we do not hope that the enemy will continue to implement air combat tactics as they have in the past, we refuse to accept the enemy's favors.

### US Ambassador to Turkey Returns From Cairo, Papen Arrives in Rome

Ankara, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, US Ambassador Steinhardt has returned here after meeting with President Roosevelt in Cairo. News of Steinhardt's movements was blocked by the censorship authorities until today.

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a telegram from Rome: German Ambassador to Turkey, von Papen, arrived here on his way back to his post. It is reported that he intends to stay for several days before going to Ankara.

### Native Cloth and Native Yarn Exempted From Purchase: Those Meeting Specified Standards Can Apply to the Cotton Management Office

Central News Agency Report: The National Commercial Control Association has been ordered to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Regarding the question of whether native cloth should be purchased, it previously requested instructions from the Executive Yuan. It is now learned that the association has recently received an order from the Yuan stating that it has already instructed the Materials Control Deliberation Conference to respond and authorized the association to handle it. Therefore, it immediately convened a joint meeting of temporary directors and supervisors, and invited representatives from the Cotton Products Industry Association, the Cloth Factory and Cloth Shop Association, and the Miscellaneous Goods Association to attend the discussion. It was decided that all handmade wooden loom native cloth, with a width of one foot and three and a half inches, a length of one zhang (large foot) to four zhang and five chi, woven with sixteen-count or lower coarse yarn or native yarn, and hand-spun native yarn used exclusively as raw material for native cloth, will be exempted from purchase. Those meeting the above standards can have the original applicant bring their seal and the receipt for the application to sell to the Cotton Management Office of the association at 304 Ma Road to complete the procedures.

### 55th Issue of Household Flour Coupons to Be Sold Starting Tomorrow: First-Grade Flour to Sell for Eight Yuan Per Catty

The First District Public Office announced yesterday that from December 4th to the 9th of this year, the 55th issue of flour coupons will be sold for one catty of first-grade flour, with a price of eight yuan in national currency. Furthermore, all retail rice stores and the district's rice lines will be closed on December 10th. This announcement does not apply to the areas newly incorporated into this district.

Puxi (West Shanghai) Flour to Be Sold Universally Today

The 22nd issue of household flour in the Puxi district, totaling 6,256 bags of first-grade flour, has been shipped and allocated by the district's Public Grain Joint Office. It is scheduled to be sold simultaneously by more than fifty public grain offices in the district starting today (3rd). At that time, each person can purchase one catty of first-grade flour per certificate, priced at eight yuan. The deadline is December 9th.

### Adjusting Purchase Prices to Encourage Cotton Production

The Cotton Control Committee's unified purchase and distribution work is currently being promoted according to the established plan. The points currently under consideration total three: (1) Determining the purchase price of cotton; (2) Raising and utilizing purchase funds; (3) Establishing central warehouses in key cotton-producing areas. According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the Cotton Control Committee attaches great importance to the adjustment of cotton prices, because past cotton prices were set too low, so farmers have been switching cotton fields to grow miscellaneous grains, resulting in a significant decrease in cotton production. In order to avoid the recurrence of this problem, it has been decided to assess and set purchase prices according to planting costs and with a reasonable profit margin. As for raising purchase funds, in principle, purchasing merchants will handle it themselves. However, the Cotton Control Committee will determine the purchase funds based on actual needs and lend them from the Central Savings Bank. Regarding the establishment of public warehouses, in addition to Nanhui in Shanghai, there are also nine other locations, including Hangzhou, Taixian, Ningbo, Haimen, Qidong, and Nanjing, for a total of eleven locations, with the aim of facilitating the storage of cotton after the unified purchase.

### First District Reiterates Previous Order: Prohibition on Selling Pufferfish

According to an announcement issued by the First District Public Office: This office, in view of the fact that it is now winter and incidents of poisoning from eating pufferfish are frequent, cautioned fish vendors last month not to sell pufferfish, and urged citizens to pay attention to the danger of eating pufferfish and not to try it lightly, bringing disaster upon themselves. The sale of any kind of pufferfish within the jurisdiction of the First District has long been repeatedly announced as prohibited by the authorities. Those formally approved to sell are not subject to this restriction, but they must incinerate the discarded parts of the pufferfish or send them to the sanitation branch of this office for proper disposal. Do not arbitrarily throw them into the garbage cans, to prevent beggars from eating them and causing danger. Those who deliberately violate this will be severely punished.

### Tax Bureau Approves Exemption From Re-Levying Taxes on Converted Colored Wine

Jiangsu Province is implementing the registration of colored wine converted from flower wine and levying taxes on it. The Shanghai District Wine Industry Mutual Aid Association has petitioned the Tax Bureau of the Ministry of Finance to cancel this, because not only are the flower wine licensing procedures quite cumbersome, but also because the raw materials for this colored wine are converted from already-taxed Gaoliang native wine. It should not be re-levied to maintain the difficulties of merchants. The Tax Bureau has approved this, and has ordered the Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tobacco and Alcohol Tax Bureau to review and decide accordingly.

### Comprehensive Household Registration Check to Be Conducted in the Entire Nanshi District

The work of rechecking household registration in the entire Nanshi district has been completed by the district's Baojia Force Affairs Office. In order to ensure the thoroughness of household registration in its jurisdiction in the future, the office has specially requested the Municipal Baojia Association to organize a clearing team to implement the comprehensive household registration check. All the forms and other items to be used during the check are currently being carefully reviewed by the Municipal Baojia Association.

### Old Deeds Should Be Exchanged for Practice Certificates at the Land Bureau

Since this city became a major trading port in our country, land prices have been expensive, and with the flourishing of construction, the terrain has changed greatly, resulting in frequent disputes over land dimensions. Furthermore, this city was surveyed in the third year of the Xianfeng reign of the Qing Dynasty, and land deeds were issued in the fifth year of Xianfeng. These land deeds only stated the number, household name, and mu (unit of area), without maps or boundaries. Therefore, those holding land deeds had no basis. These land deeds are old, and without extremely deep knowledge and old reference books, it is difficult to distinguish the true from the false. Furthermore, there are splits or divisions, with land deeds being cut apart and becoming a corner or a strip, and the acreage being freely filled in, so abuses have arisen. The Land Administration Bureau recognized this change, and since the sixteenth year of the Republic of China, it has been surveying according to the latest methods. For each old section that has been surveyed, it has announced and exchanged land practice certificates since the nineteenth year, collecting miscellaneous documents. These land practice certificates are attached with detailed and accurate maps, so even if the actual boundaries are obliterated, the Land Administration Bureau can measure them accurately according to the map. Currently, many citizens are still using old land deeds for buying and selling, but not only is their property right unstable, but they also have no protection if they are deceived. Because the Land Administration Bureau only transfers and registers rights in the land within the area that has already been announced for certificate exchange based on the land practice certificate. Therefore, buying and selling old deeds is very dangerous. The seller should be quickly ordered to exchange the old land deeds for the land practice certificate from the Land Administration Bureau before the purchase can be accepted. As for the procedures for the exchange, first submit the land deed and matching grain skewers to the Land Administration Bureau, and after the bureau reviews and finds no errors, it will issue a map of the land to the owner, who can check it themselves. If they think it is correct, then sign and seal it and return it to the Land Administration Bureau, which will issue a land practice certificate based on the signed map. This land practice certificate has now become the only reliable property certificate for our Chinese people in this city.

Brief Commentary

### Restrictions on Electricity Use

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Bureau has stipulated measures for controlling electricity and gas, and the amount of electricity consumed by general enterprises and shops has been reduced by 30%. The reason for this is the shortage of coal in this port.

We are in principle in extreme agreement with and support the resolute implementation of the Shanghai Municipal Electricity Bureau's control of electricity consumption due to the shortage of coal. However, the authorities should fully consider the contradictions and priorities in practice beforehand and make thorough adjustments. We offer a few suggestions:

First, the hot water tanks in major public buildings and hotels are entirely for the enjoyment of the privileged, and the coal used for this kind of enjoyment can be greatly saved during this time of war. Therefore, we advocate that those who use water tanks for enjoyment should not only have their use restricted, but should be absolutely prohibited from using coal, and the coal for water tanks should be shifted to productive enterprises.

Second, the electricity used by factories in productive enterprises, as well as social welfare undertakings such as hospitals and newspapers, should only be restricted by estimating the most appropriate amount of electricity they use, and should not be universally reduced, so as not to affect production and service efficiency.

If, on the one hand, in order to save coal, the electricity for productive enterprises and social welfare undertakings is reduced, causing them to reduce production and reduce service efficiency, but on the other hand, major public buildings, hotels, restaurants, and entertainment venues are allowed to use hot water tanks, consume coal, and enjoy themselves to the fullest, then we believe that this is a contradictory and unreasonable phenomenon, and we hope that the authorities will pay special attention to it.

### Fund for the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office Temporarily Set at 10 Million Yuan, Half Collected from Both Chinese and Japanese Sides

Since its establishment, the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will soon actively commence its work regarding the unified allocation of flour and bran in this city. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters who inquired with relevant authorities, the fund for the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office has been temporarily set at 10 million yuan in national currency, to be collected from members of both the Chinese and Japanese sides, with each side contributing 5 million yuan. However, both sides may each first pay half of their share, and jointly pay the remainder when necessary. This fund will accrue interest at an annual rate of less than 1%, paid monthly based on the actual amount paid. All expenses related to the operations and allocation of the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will be collected according to the amount approved by the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. Therefore, all income and expenditure items of the Unified Allocation Office must be budgeted and audited, and submitted to the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee for approval. It is also learned that in addition to seeking to adapt to the special allocation environment of flour and bran and widely establishing flour and bran retail allocation points, the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office will, if necessary, set up branch offices in various locations within this district.

Tea and Food Guild Handles Flour Collection

Since receiving a letter from the Flour and Bran Unified Allocation Office to handle the unified allocation of raw rice for food, the Shanghai Special Municipality Tea and Food Industry Guild has created a roster of members and the quantity of flour required, and submitted it to the office for unified allocation. After passing the examination, a special flour purchase certificate will be issued and then forwarded to its members who are tea and pastry businesses, allowing them to collect flour from designated retail allocation points upon presentation of the certificate. The back of the flour collection certificate is stamped with the guild's seal. It is also heard that the flour obtained by each business is only allowed to be used for manufacturing food in its business operations, and absolutely not be resold for profit. Violators will have their allocation suspended and be subject to punishment. In addition, all members are notified that those who join various guilds and mix and collect flour under the same address, same brand, and same business for the purpose of applying for flour allocation will be severely punished.

### Resolving Fuel Panic: Implementing Purchase of Miscellaneous Firewood and Distributing it to Citizens at Fair Prices

Central News Agency report: Although the coal briquette panic in this city has been repeatedly publicized and attempts have been made by the authorities to remedy it, it has not yet been implemented, and the coal briquette black market is rampant, causing great suffering to the citizens and almost leading to a cooking fuel shortage. It is now learned that the Central Market has been approved by the authorities to resolve the fuel problem for the citizens, and the Central Market Miscellaneous Firewood and Charcoal Group will implement a comprehensive purchase of miscellaneous firewood and dredge sources to distribute it to the citizens at fair prices. It is also learned that the market is working jointly with the First District Economic Office to suppress vegetable prices. In addition to the previous registration of vegetable vendors to join the association, wooden signs are now being made to mark the price limits and set up in each vegetable market, ordering compliance. Personnel from the First District Economic Office are also monitoring to ensure that vegetable prices are effectively suppressed.

### District Procuratorate Notice: Prohibition of False Names and Swindling

Cai Rixin, the Chief Prosecutor of the Shanghai District Procuratorate, in order to effectively rectify law and discipline and strictly prohibit swindling under the name of the procuratorate's staff, yesterday issued a special notice, stating: "Criminal defendants often, after the case occurs, either ask someone for help or try to bribe, vainly hoping to avoid criminal punishment and remain at large. It must be known that intercession is forbidden in thousands of cases, and there are constant punishments for monetary maneuvers. Not only is it a waste of money, but it also leads to the legal net. Litigants should rely on the law for defense. Criminal summons, service, and bail are never charged fees. Buying written complaints and paying fines all require formal receipts to be issued, and no extra money should be collected. This should also be noted, and do not be fooled by others. If unscrupulous people engage in swindling under the name of the procuratorate's staff, or laborers demand money outside, formal accusations and reports can be made, and if investigations confirm the facts, severe punishment will be given without leniency."

### Commentary: The Coal Briquette Allocation Problem

In recent weeks, the most threatening aspect of people's daily lives has been the essential fuel coal briquettes, which are indispensable every day. Therefore, how to solve the coal briquette panic in this city has become the most concerning issue for the five million citizens of Shanghai, except for a few wealthy households who have hoarded large amounts of coal briquettes. Fortunately, coal briquettes are now planned to be allocated based on population, similar to rice, flour, sugar, oil, matches, and soap. Originally, among daily necessities, the necessity of coal briquettes is second only to rice and grain, and it should have been included in the list of population-based allocation a long time ago. Although the standard price limit previously stipulated cannot be said to have had a stabilizing effect on special prices.

At the fourth press conference convened by the City Propaganda Office the other day, the Continental News asked: "Coal briquettes are daily necessities, but they are difficult to purchase recently. I wonder if the authorities can find a way to remedy this suffering of the citizens?" The Economic Bureau replied: "The reason for the coal briquette panic in this city is due to the lack of supply, transportation, and reduced production in coal-producing areas. Now, the plan to implement population-based allocation is expected to be implemented in the near future. However, the monthly allocation of coal briquettes is 20,000 tons, and the shortage is also being discussed with the Ministry of Industry to transport non-controlled coal to remedy the situation." Based on the above answer from the Economic Bureau, we feel that the focus of solving the coal briquette panic lies in dredging the source of coal production: For example, the Su-Huai area near Central China is rich in coal production. Its bituminous coal has a lot of ash content, which is most suitable for household boilers. Moreover, the industry in the area is not developed, and farmers do not need coal. Therefore, the consumption of production areas is very small. It is urgent to take advantage of the currency adjustment period in Su-Huai to smoothly promote the export of its materials—especially coal production. Increase the amount of allocation: After the implementation of population-based allocation of coal briquettes, the average amount per person per month must be fully rationalized, so that those with strength can still take from the black market, and the black market will become rampant again, and those without strength will eventually find it difficult to continue, and fuel will become a problem again. The above two points are what we would like to contribute to the authorities in charge of the controlled economy.

### Industry Appraisal Committees Review Price Limits

The appraisal committees for goods under various industry guilds in this city have recently held separate meetings to review whether the standard price limits assessed in the past are suitable and to examine the purchase cost reports and general business conditions repeatedly submitted by industry members.

It is understood that some guilds are still strictly enforcing the price limits set in the past, but a few guilds are adapting to the current situation and making appropriate changes to the price limits assessed in the past.

These changes are listed in a table and sent to the competent authorities for approval. After the authorities approve them, they are printed and distributed to all members of the industry for compliance and sale at the limited prices. Once member merchants receive this price list, they must post it in a prominent place for people to refer to. Anyone who purchases the items listed on the table must not engage in any transgressions, otherwise anyone can file a written complaint with the industry guild or relevant authorities for investigation. If the facts are confirmed, strict penalties will be imposed to serve as a warning to others. Yesterday, it was learned that the city's enamelware industry guild has assessed price limits for various

Enamelware

and has submitted them to the Economic Office of the First District Public Office for approval. Price lists have now been printed. Notices have been issued that they can be obtained from 228 Avenue Joffre from today, but a letter with a seal must be provided, and each industry trading company is limited to one copy.

### Tea Control Organization is Being Organized

Tea has long been included by the government authorities in the scope of major commodities, but at present, tea sales have not yet been controlled. This is because the tea control organization under the National General Association of Commerce has not yet been organized.

At present, the Japanese tea industry association has been organized. The Chinese tea industry guild association will be prepared and organized by the Shanghai Tea Industry Guild as the center, uniting local industry guilds.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market was relatively firm. Although there were a large number of short sellers in the market, there were occasional hedges, so the market price did not easily fall. Yesterday, Category C opened and rose immediately, then eased back, and finally was slightly better than before. The four types A, B, D, and E were all good, and the trend may continue to rise.

Grains: Yesterday, the market was still difficult to improve. Because of the sales of rice per household, the actual sales were increasingly inferior, and the market situation was ultimately weak. The prices of thick and thin japonica rice fell again. Although the owners of oil and grain goods hoped to raise prices due to the rise in production prices, buyers were still rare, and it was still difficult to rise.

### Shanghai Special City Land Administration Bureau Notice Ding No. 38

It has been found that in this city, except for the special district and the prosperous areas of the old Shanghai County, the land certificates of each area have been announced and exchanged before the incident (the drawings of each map can be seen at the display offices of this bureau and the Central District Office). To date, many people have come to exchange them, but there are still quite a few who have not exchanged them. Now, it is reported that there are still cases of using old deeds for trade and mortgage. It must be known that the old land deeds have no topography and many deeds do not match the land, which can easily lead to disputes. Therefore, this bureau handles the registration of transfer, mortgage, land easement, and other rights in the exchanged map shares based on the land certificate. It is further announced for general knowledge that all old single lands in the publicly announced maps that have not been exchanged for certificates should be quickly exchanged by the owners with various property certificates to the Central District Office of this bureau at 66 Zhapu Road for land exchange registration to obtain a certificate to solidify property rights. Those who still engage in old single trade, mortgage, and other acts will not be protected by this bureau. Please do not delay and mislead yourself. Please be aware of this announcement. Director Fan Yongzeng, November 29, 1943

### Shanghai Special Municipality Government Notice Shanghai City Three-Character No. 14789

In accordance with the Executive Yuan's Instructions No. 3176: "The case is based on the Ministry of Industry's presentation of November 22nd, 32nd year regarding the case of investigating and dealing with the movement of materials within the regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and Nanjing and Shanghai special cities, which has been announced in the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement formulated by the National Government. In accordance with the provisions of the said regulations, except for the materials specified in Article 5, which may not be moved without the permission of the legal authority, and the materials specified in Article 6, the movement of materials into and out of the Shanghai region shall require the permission of the National General Association of Commercial Control. Apart from the special regulations, the movement of materials within the three provinces and two cities other than Shanghai shall not be restricted. The regulations then stipulate that materials other than those in Articles 5 and 6 may not be restricted within the three provinces and two cities unless there are special regulations (such as goods similar to bullion or silver products). The above regulations imply the promotion of smooth flow of goods while controlling them, and the intention is excellent. However, in recent years, the suppression of the movement of materials by local provinces and cities has been too restrictive, failing to fully comply with the original intention of the legislation. In addition to further liaison with the relevant authorities by this Ministry, the provincial and municipal governments are requested to strictly follow the above regulations to ensure that materials whose movement is not restricted by laws and regulations can circulate as freely as possible to secure people's livelihoods and comply with the intention of the law. Is this appropriate? The case is hereby submitted to the Executive Yuan for examination and implementation. It is appropriate," etc. Therefore, in addition to ordering subordinates to comply, this announcement is urgently issued for public knowledge. Mayor Chen Gongbo, December, 1943

### Commentary (Continued from First Page)

Promote female labor and ensure full employment for women.

Abolish the retirement system; the elderly should not retire either.

Government offices should abolish the half-day work system on Saturdays, and sometimes even work on Sundays. Production should implement a 24-hour non-stop system.

The allocation and utilization of labor should be further considered to ensure it is appropriate. One point that deserves our attention is that while Japan is making every effort to requisition national labor, it is also strengthening the rationing system to provide greater security and stability to the lives of ordinary people.

From this, we can glean a general understanding of the stability of Japanese people's lives from Japanese price trends and salary income.

(A) Salaries of Business and Industrial Employees

Entry-level employees: Monthly salary of 55 to 80 yuan, with an annual increase of 3 to 8 yuan. (After 2-3 years, they can be promoted to section chief)

Section Chief (Entry Level) Income: Monthly salary of 160 yuan

A medium-level writer receives 3 to 5 yuan per manuscript page, creating about 2 articles per month, totaling 60 pages, with an income of 180 to 300 yuan. Royalties for a single-volume book are 15%, with a novel selling for 2 yuan per copy, and 5,000 copies printed, resulting in royalty income of 1,500 yuan.

Overall, the above figures show that whether in business, industry, or culture, personal life is generally prosperous. Moreover, a significant proportion of personal expenditure is allocated to government bonds and savings, which further illustrates the effectiveness of the government's savings policies and the inevitable stability of the currency.

### Opinions on the New Restrictions on Water and Electricity

One

From the first day of this month, electricity consumption in the city will be subject to new restrictions, with strict penalties. Exceeding the limit will result in heavy penalties ranging from three to twenty times the original rate. Exceeding the limit twice will result in the suspension of supply.

The power company is striving to conserve consumption in response to the irregular supply of coal, which is undoubtedly justifiable and should be jointly supported. In particular, stricter restrictions should be imposed on various extravagant consumption venues and improper consumption. However, regarding the legitimate use of electricity for lighting in general households, consideration should be given to the health of the public's eyesight. A progressive approach should be taken, with restrictions based on the amount of consumption, rather than applying the same restriction rate regardless of how much electricity is used.

Currently, electricity consumption restrictions are as follows: Shanghai Power Company's service area is reduced to 60% to 70% of supply, China Central Water and Electricity Company's service area is reduced to 55% to 65%, and the French Water and Electricity Company's service area is reduced to 65%. Water consumption is also restricted, with only 60% supply.

This restriction treats large wealthy households that consume dozens or hundreds of kilowatt-hours per month the same way as small households that consume only a few kilowatt-hours. It is not too difficult for large households that consume hundreds of kilowatt-hours to save electricity by reducing their consumption by 35%. However, for small households that use only a few kilowatt-hours per month, who are already consciously conserving to reduce expenses, asking them to further reduce their already minimal electricity consumption by 35% or 45% would inevitably force them to replace ten or fifteen-watt bulbs with one or two-watt bulbs. Moreover, as winter approaches, lighting hours are longer. Wouldn't this be harmful to eyesight? As for water restrictions, they are not a problem for large wealthy households, but for small households that are already trying to save water, it will inevitably lead to reduced washing, directly affecting general cleanliness, and indirectly affecting general health.

Public utilities are fundamentally established for the public good. Consider whether there are more wealthy households or economically struggling small households in Shanghai. The wise authorities must already be aware of this and do not need to be told.

Therefore, I have a small suggestion: I advocate that households consuming less than 20 kilowatt-hours of electricity (or water) per month should not be restricted. (Based on a three-story house) For those consuming more than 20 kilowatt-hours, a reduction of several tens of percent should be imposed for every ten kilowatt-hours exceeded. This would be fair and easy to implement, and would greatly benefit the public. I hope the municipal authorities will not neglect this matter just because it seems trivial! (Bai Hong)

Two

Yesterday, I saw a notice from the French Water and Electricity Company restricting the use of water and electricity. In these extraordinary times, fuel transport is disrupted, and supplies are dwindling daily. Restrictions are inevitable. All residents should understand the hardship of the authorities' emergency measures. However, the method of restriction is very unfair. Those who have always been wasteful do not feel much hardship from careful reduction, while those who have already economized to the point of being unable to economize further are being forced to reduce consumption by such a large discount, which clearly leads them to be fined or unable to use water and electricity. There are also landlords who include water in the rent. If there are several households in an alley, how can one distinguish which household is wasteful and which is economical? Moreover, in recent years, how can landlords control their tenants?

If landlords are fined, they may resort to cutting off the supply. Imagine dozens of households in an alley without water, what a scene it would be, inevitably leading to numerous disputes.

Water and electricity are indispensable for residents. Restrictions are appropriate, but I hope the municipal authorities will reconsider the method, or base the restriction on the number of rooms in a house, or on the number of people, according to the household registration books, so that it is uniformly equal, simple, and less disruptive.

### Rocks Found in Rice Sold in Dumi Ne, Each "Dou" Lacking As Much As Four or Five Jin

Recently, some unscrupulous individuals have formed gangs to sell rice in Xujiahui. They use skillful means and false scales to deceive those who do not bring their own scales. Because there are many accomplices, it is difficult to detect. Each "dou" of rice (weighing sixteen jin) is short by as much as four or five jin. They also sometimes switch bags of rice. They also mix stones into the rice. Various fraudulent tactics easily deceive people. Even when bystanders notice, they dare not speak out, fearing retaliation from the gang. The other day, I went to buy two "dou" of rice and borrowed someone else's scale. Unexpectedly, the nearby rice sellers were all accomplices. When weighing the rice, the weight seemed sufficient, but after returning home, I discovered that the two "dou" of rice were short by ten jin, and there were two stones in the rice. Many people have suffered from this. I advise those who buy rice in that area in the future to bring their own scales to avoid being victimized. (Xia Bingheng)

### Various Educational and Welfare Organizations Face Difficulties

According to the China Child Welfare Association, there are 39 educational and welfare organizations in the city, accommodating a total of over 5,000 children. Recently, due to rising prices, expenses have increased several times, while donations have decreased sharply compared to before, making it difficult to maintain operations. The most difficult issue is the food problem. Although the authorities allocate rice monthly, it is far from sufficient, so coarse grains such as wheat, sweet potatoes, and red beans are used to supplement the supply. We deeply hope that the authorities will provide timely assistance and allocate special rations of rice to help them maintain operations. According to current prices, each child requires at least 300 yuan per month for food expenses. The association is currently conducting a survey of the feeding conditions of various educational and welfare organizations.

### New Reading Materials for Self-Cultivation

Literary Life: The new literary magazine "Literary Life" is about to be published. Its content includes literary theory, novels, reports, poetry, prose, essays, newly compiled stories, scripts, reviews, and translations from classical and modern works directly translated from Japanese, French, German, and Russian. There is also a life recording section that reflects reports on the lives of various classes. The publication will be the richest spiritual food for literature lovers, students, and working youth.

Illustrated Stories: True Happiness contains historical stories and pictures that can be read as novels or as textbooks. It is beneficial to the mind and body for families and leisure time. All bookstores have it for sale.
