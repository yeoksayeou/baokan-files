### What Happens After the Cotton Cloth is Purchased?

The government's purchase of cotton cloth and supplementary registration this time stipulates that there will be absolutely no extension of the deadline. At the same time, holders of cotton cloth have all completed the procedures within the time limit without waiting and seeing. The government's resolute attitude and the public's spirit of cooperation with the government are both worthy of praise. Now, although the deadline for applications and registration has only passed for a little over ten days, the people have long been hoping for the implementation of cotton cloth distribution methods like a great drought hoping for rain clouds. First, from the perspective of consumers, the autumn wind has risen, and everyone is precisely at the time of adding winter clothing, but the materials for adding winter clothing cannot be purchased anywhere in the city. Especially for families with weddings and funerals and pregnant women, the need is even more urgent. Second, from the perspective of small cloth shops, all cloth shops have stopped operating before the application deadline. To this day, more than half a month has passed, with no income and expenses remaining the same. This situation is naturally very difficult to maintain. Third, from the perspective of factories, production may have to stop due to the lack of raw materials. However, after production stops, all expenses still cannot be saved, and the difficult situation is the same as that of retail stores. We understand very well that the work of sorting out applications and registrations is extraordinarily heavy, and we also know that creating a new distribution method must go through many thorough considerations. However, on the other hand, we cannot help but hope that the authorities will also consider the widespread difficulties in society and strive to correct the common problem of slow handling of affairs by general agencies in the past. The sooner it is announced, the sooner the widespread difficulties will be relieved. We also hope that before the announcement, all procedures can be prepared completely, so that the announcement is one thing, and the implementation is another. The situation when the rice and grain joint venture took over the distribution of household rice was a very bad precedent. We hope that this time we will not repeat the same mistake.

Before the cotton cloth distribution method is announced, we summarize the opinions of all parties and offer several principles:

Thrift and frugality are the natural principles of wartime, and the people have already understood this. Moreover, the purchasing power of the general public in wartime is also implicitly equivalent to a natural restriction. However, the minimum needs are absolutely unavoidable. To make the distribution method thorough, the distribution quantity must first be reasonable. Otherwise, on the one hand, to meet the needs of life, and on the other hand, to supply this need, the black market still cannot be eliminated. Taking the rice distribution situation as an example, the implementation of the method of rationing grain according to the number of people is not intended to eliminate the black market? However, the existence of black market rice has now become an open secret. Who among the millions of citizens in Shanghai (including all levels of civil servants in various agencies) is not a customer of black market rice? Hundreds and hundreds of rice vendors on the road are constantly coming and going, and food agencies can certainly see them. The reason is that the amount of rations is too far from the actual amount needed. From the perspective of human relations, we have to adopt a laissez-faire approach, but the meaning of distributing food has been fundamentally lost, and the government's prestige cannot be unaffected. Clothing and food are equally important to people's lives. Since there has been a bad phenomenon in food distribution before, it should be taken as a warning when formulating cotton cloth distribution methods. Therefore, the quantity of cotton cloth distributed is even more worthy of careful consideration.

The purpose of the government's purchase of cotton cloth is to curb hoarding, stabilize prices, and stabilize democracy. In this case, the distribution price of cotton cloth should not be too far from the purchase price. Most importantly, the government should not contain any financial effects in handling this matter. In other words, it should not be done for profit.

The use of cotton cloth, whether it belongs to manufacturing and processing or consumption, the number of levels through which it passes in the distribution process should be as few as possible. The more levels, the more complicated the procedures, the longer the time, and the greater the cost. Finally, the recipient of the distribution will inevitably suffer from both time and economic losses. The distribution procedure in our ideal is as follows:

Commercial Control Commission——Federation——Various Trade Associations　Manufacturers and Processors　Retailers——Consumers

The above hypothetical procedure still inevitably accommodates the current organizational system of the Commercial Control Commission. If the federation level can be omitted, the handling of affairs can be more agile. In the distribution system, wholesalers are superfluous and profit-seeking, and there is no need for their existence. Therefore, we advocate resolutely canceling it, which is quite worthy of research when formulating distribution methods in order to reduce the burden on consumers.

The government's purchase of cotton cloth this time, the payment method is half gold and half deposit slips, but both must be paid in batches after a considerable period of time. If it is stipulated that goods will be delivered in cash after the implementation of the distribution method, then merchants will inevitably have to raise another sum of funds, and the difficulties that can be imagined are that loans are not easy to obtain and interest rates are too high. The former is just a problem for the merchants themselves, and the latter will inevitably increase the burden on consumers. We suggest that the government can instruct merchants to also provide a corresponding guarantee to distribute cotton cloth on a "goods first, payment later" basis. In this way, the interest item can be reduced in the stipulated profit of merchants, which will greatly benefit the people.

The distribution of cotton cloth for consumption must be handled in the same way as household rice, and the rationing coupon system must be adopted to prevent retailers from manipulating it.

The opinions we want to offer regarding the cotton cloth distribution method are as above. In addition, there are still a few opinions on the procurement aspect:

The payment of a portion of the purchase price in gold has already been seen in the government's explicit order, and it is naturally unlikely to change. However, in wartime, gold and silver are generally owned by the state. The authorities in the former "concessions" would also prohibit bidding and sales of gold, and they are still seeking public decontrol. Now that the government has stipulated that gold should be the price for the purchase of cotton cloth, in fact, it has already recognized that people can freely hold, carry, buy, and sell. However, the people have not yet fully understood this point, and it is appropriate to issue another order to clearly declare it.

After cotton cloth is purchased by the government, it becomes the property of the state. Special attention should be paid to storage. The nature of cotton cloth is that once it is exposed to moisture and evaporates, it will become corrupt, and even completely useless. At this time of difficult wartime production and material resources, all materials must be especially cherished and cared for, not to mention that cotton cloth is a daily necessity for people's livelihood. In the past, various agencies did not pay much attention to storing public goods, and major losses often occurred. In view of the various situations in the past, we specifically propose this, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.

The total value of the cotton cloth purchased this time, even calculated at the purchase price, is more than 600,000 million national currency. In addition to paying special attention to storage, supervision should not be ignored. In order to show faith to the people, the government should organize an inspection committee, hire fair people from all walks of life, serve as inspectors, conduct inspections on a regular basis, and report publicly.

The problem of people's food in Shanghai is becoming increasingly serious. This year, there has been a bumper harvest of rice in various parts of Central China, and in theory, this phenomenon should not exist. The key to the problem should be that farmers value physical objects and are unwilling to sell as much surplus grain as possible. We should guide the situation and export a large amount of cotton cloth in exchange for rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains to solve the people's food problem in the cities.

### Japanese Residents in China Obey Chinese Tax Laws - Implementation Begins on October 1

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - China and Japan concluded a treaty on the taxation of Japanese subjects in China on July 31 of last year. This is the first step in abolishing extraterritoriality. Based on the supplementary agreement of the treaty, the National Government notified Ambassador Tani on the 10th of this month that Japanese citizens should obey the laws of the Republic of China and the applicable methods. After careful consultation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the results have been published in the official gazettes of the two governments on September 20. Japanese subjects in China must obey Chinese tax laws from October 1. The smooth implementation of this important measure can fully demonstrate the firm determination of China and Japan to cooperate in building a new order in East Asia. The taxes listed in this first notification, in addition to income tax, include salt tax, consolidated tax, liquor tax, stamp tax, mining tax, temporary special tax on silkworms, passage tax, commodity tax, etc., all central taxes and part of local taxes.

Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government previously notified the Japanese Embassy that Japanese residents in China should obey the scope of taxation laws and the applicable forms of the Republic of China. The Japanese Embassy authorities issued a statement on this at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, the main points of which are as follows: China and Japan concluded a treaty on the taxation of Japanese subjects in the Republic of China on July 31 of this year, and stated that Japanese subjects must obey all Chinese taxation laws from August 1. According to the provisions of Article 1 of the supplementary agreement, regarding the scope and applicable forms of Chinese taxation laws that Japanese residents in China should obey, the Chinese side should first notify the Japanese side step by step, and the Japanese side will formally pay taxes based on the tax items listed in the notification in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. This has already been seen in the statement issued by the embassy authorities on July 31. Since the beginning of this treaty, in order to ensure its smooth implementation, the Chinese side has carefully studied the scope of laws and applicable forms that should be notified to the Japanese side. After the review was completed, the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government notified the Japanese Embassy in China on September 10. In the very short period of time after the conclusion of this treaty, it will be put into concrete implementation, which is truly a cause for celebration for China and Japan's cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War. The purpose and content of this treaty can be clearly understood from the explanations given by the embassy authorities in the past regarding this treaty. The tax laws notified by the Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government this time include most of the central taxes, five types of local taxes in North China, Central China, and South China, and most of the local taxes in Mengjiang. The implementation of these tax laws will be fully implemented from October 1, except for the business tax, which still has a certain period of hesitation. The Chinese side is actively studying the draft laws that should be notified for the remaining local taxes, and will continue to issue second and third notifications after they are completed. Regarding local taxes without such formal notification, it is hoped that Japanese residents will continue to pay them in accordance with the spirit of Sino-Japanese cooperation. In addition, the exemption of taxes for soldiers, military personnel, and military supplies, as well as the reduction and exemption of taxes for items necessary for the Greater East Asia War in over-key industries and important materials exported to Japan, will still be handled as before.

In recent days, various places have expressed their willingness to form volunteer corps. Jun Ruan Xin Die, a metalworker who lives in Sangzhou, and more than 60 members of the youth group who are diligent in serving on the 16th, have submitted volunteer letters to the authorities one after another, expressing their willingness to organize a defense volunteer corps. Following this, 161 people including Diejiara Guan and workers Gahrnan Nong Bataribo from Lijiecun in the state also submitted volunteer letters to the Sangshilong state chief, hoping to join the defense volunteer corps when it is formed.

Surabaya, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army occupied this place, the Japanese military government has protected and cultivated Islam in this place based on the basic principle of respecting religion. On the 1st of this month, influential leaders of the two major Islamic organizations in Java were also elected as nominal members of the Central Senate in the name of religious groups. Since then, Indonesian Muslims have become more and more excited, and their enthusiasm for building Greater East Asia and defending their homeland has also increased. Therefore, on the 13th of this month, 50 million Muslims jointly submitted a letter to the military government, suggesting that an Islamic defense team be formed immediately.

Talk by Elder Hashim of the Islamic Association

Hashim, an elder of the Javanese Islamic Church, once said on this matter: This time, Japan has rescued Indonesian people from the oppression of the Dutch tyranny, and now they have been liberated and given various relief. After the Japanese army pacified Java, they immediately adhered to the basic principle of respecting religion and did their best to protect us Muslims. This time, they also appointed my son and many other Islamic leaders as nominal members of the Central Senate, which is truly beyond the expectations of Muslims. We can only be grateful for this. Javanese Muslims can now lead a happy religious life thanks to the power of Japan, but this can only be ensured if Japan wins this war. From the perspective of religious doctrine, engaging in holy war can lead to transcendence even in death. Japan is now fighting with all its national strength to provide us with liberation. This is to protect us Javanese Muslims, so for us, Japan's war is a holy war. Therefore, we Muslims have reached the time to take up arms to seek Japan's victory. Therefore, the righteousness of forming a fellow Muslim defense team presented on the 13th is our declared determination. Therefore, all the students of the school have made the determination to defend Java themselves in order to seek Japan's victory. For this reason, I am also willing to dedicate my old bones to this holy war. In addition, this person is now 71 years old, has made pilgrimages to Mecca several times, has been running an Islamic school for 36 years, has 80,000 disciples, and is now an elder of Islam and is highly respected by all.

### Current Status of Industry in Vietnam

Vietnam's self-sufficiency system is being actively promoted in various economic sectors. Vietnam is inherently rich in agricultural and forestry resources, and its biggest problem at present is how to rapidly achieve industrialization. Although this problem has various difficulties in reality, it can be gradually resolved and implemented with technical materials and capital assistance from Japan. Therefore, Vietnam has high expectations for Japan. The current state of industry in Vietnam is as follows:

Rice Milling Industry

The rice milling industry, centered on Ti An, already shows a considerable daily output. The problem of increasing and repairing rice milling machinery can be completely resolved soon with Japanese cooperation.

Substitute Fuel Industry

The alcohol industry for substitute petroleum is currently engaged in large-scale manufacturing. Other manufacturing industries, such as machine oil and lubricating oil, also use castor oil, peanut oil, and fish oil as raw materials for manufacturing.

Chemical Industry

Before the war, the chemical industry in Vietnam was almost non-existent. Due to the impact of the war, it is now engaged in small-scale operations. However, because raw materials must rely on imports, it has not yet escaped the experimental stage. Products include carbonized coal, black gunpowder, caustic soda, hydrochloric acid, glycerin, and stearic acid. Among them, black gunpowder is made from artillery mountain materials, so it is quite important.

Building Materials Manufacturing Industry

Cement is the only important component of the building material manufacturing industry in Vietnam. For example, the Vietnam Cement Company can produce several tons per day, which is quite large in scale. Recently, due to significant technological progress, its production performance is considered excellent. As for the production of bricks, it has also increased due to a sharp increase in demand. However, the realization of a mechanized manufacturing industry is currently the most urgent task.

Textile Industry

The recent particularly noticeable trend is the utilization of locally produced silk, cotton, and other textile fibers. It has progressed from the stage of active research to the stage of complete experimentation. A certain textile factory near a certain location has been completely modernized. If raw materials can be secured, it can be estimated as the most active position in various industries.

Paper Manufacturing Industry

The Indochina Paper Company is the only paper manufacturer in Vietnam. However, its production volume can only meet one-tenth of the demand so far. Recognizing this, the authorities have encouraged the home paper manufacturing industry. Local newspapers are generally supplied by home paper manufacturers. Now, a decision has been made to import from Japan and start direct paper making. Therefore, Vietnam's paper use problem can be resolved soon.

Leather Industry

Vietnam has abundant leather raw materials. However, due to the lack of tannins, it is difficult to manufacture leather products. Recently, in view of the importance of tannins, active production increases have been implemented. Therefore, it is expected that obstacles to leather making can be removed soon.

Rubber Industry

Although Vietnam has rubber resources with an annual output of several tons or more, the product industry is simple, limited to water pillows, tricycle tires, etc. As for automobile tires, they have never been able to be manufactured. Furthermore, because the import of this type of item has decreased sharply, the current focus of the rubber industry in Vietnam has been placed on the active research of automobile tires and other rubber products. In addition, tricycles are currently an important means of transportation in Vietnam, so active production increases are also necessary.

### German Weapons on the Eastern Front Display Astonishing Effect, Achieving Complete Victory in Defensive Battles

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: South and north of the Smolensk road to Moscow, German weapons once again achieved a complete defensive victory in Saturday's battles. Soviet forces, with fresh reserves, joined the battle along a broad front. Under the cover of powerful air forces, these reserves repeatedly attacked German positions, resulting in fierce battles with temporary advances and retreats. However, the German front line remained as solid as before. German automatic weapons displayed astonishing effectiveness, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses.

Like a Blast Furnace

The situation near the areas between the two supply roads is similar. The intensity of the fighting continued unabated. The enemy's large-scale offensives were continuously supplied with reinforcements from areas such as Yalnya, Dorogobush, and Yartzevo. The entire war zone resembled a magician's blast furnace. Although the enemy launched large-scale offensives, the German lines remained firm and unmoved. The enemy's tank losses are inestimable. Southwest of Roslavl, the Soviet army increased its troop strength by several infantry divisions and powerful tank forces. The enemy broke through deep gaps in the German positions.

Shortening the Front Line

As a result, the German forces in the area had to shorten their front line. However, the German movements were orderly, and they fought and retreated while continuously engaging the enemy. Near dusk, a powerful German air force broke the striking power of the Soviet forces occupying the stronghold, providing considerable relief to the German forces on the ground, while the Soviet forces suffered heavy losses. Although the Soviet forces broke through the German front line, they were immediately cut off by German and Hungarian infantry, neutralizing the effect of the enemy's fierce attack.

Repelling the Offensive

Apart from the Leningrad area, the situation on the northern part of the Eastern Front on Saturday remained calm, with only activity on the Ilmen front. Soviet forces, with the strength of several infantry regiments and several tank detachments, repeatedly attacked from the east wall of the German encirclement of Leningrad. The enemy's objective was to seize the German positions in the Sniavino Highlands. The German forces repelled the Soviet offensive in fierce fighting.

Continuing to Retreat Westward

Between the Donets and Dnieper rivers, German forces continued to retreat westward under the protection of a powerful rearguard. On Saturday, Soviet forces again attempted to pursue the retreating German forces to their designated positions. At that time, the German forces launched a sudden counterattack, and the Soviet forces were caught off guard, suffering heavy losses, and in some places, the Soviet forces had to retreat. The Soviet army paid a heavy price for misjudging the German retreat.

Fierce Fighting in the South

Fierce hand-to-hand combat broke out in Pavlograd. Soviet forces made several local breakthroughs, but the German forces cut off the enemy's communications to counter the effect of the breakthroughs. The position of the main German front line remained unmoved. West of Kalif, the Soviet offensive was scattered. The German rearguard inflicted considerable losses on the enemy. Northwest of Kakov, the German air force assisted the German forces on the ground very successfully. The Soviet forces, with powerful tanks and infantry units, attempted to cut off German rear communications. A fierce battle occurred in the Ubal area. The Soviet army had no success and lost many tanks. The weather situation in the Kupen bridgehead area has improved. The Soviet army repeatedly attacked the Kupen River with a large number of tanks, but ultimately failed.

### Welles to be Appointed U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union; Steinhardt Has Returned Home

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to Moscow sources, U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, has left Moscow and returned to Washington to confer with President Roosevelt. Details of the meeting have not been released by the U.S. Embassy in Moscow. At the same time, German News Agency, citing Washington sources, reported: Welles, who recently resigned from his position as Under Secretary of State, will replace Steinhardt as the new U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union.

### Soviet Envoy to Sweden Promoted

Stockholm, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Soviet envoy to Sweden, Madame Kollontai, recently confirmed to a Reuters representative that she has been promoted to the rank of ambassador. She stated that this promotion is merely a recognition by the Soviet government of her merits and an honor bestowed upon her. Although Madame Kollontai has been promoted to ambassador, the legation will remain the same and will not be upgraded to an embassy.

### Residents of Hungarian Capital Ordered to Evacuate

Bern, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to Vichy Radio, the Hungarian government has ordered the evacuation of a portion of the residents of the capital.

### German Commander Appeals to Italian Farm and Industrial Workers

Milan, 19th (Central News Agency) – The German commander-in-chief of central Italy, Field Marshal Kesselring, tonight appealed to Italian industrial and farm workers, requesting them to go to Germany as free workers to assist in the joint German-Italian war effort. The appeal was broadcast to the entire occupied area of Italy.

### Serbian Prime Minister Meets with Hitler to Discuss New Situation in Southeastern Europe

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) – According to an official announcement, Führer Hitler received Serbian Prime Minister Nedić at his headquarters yesterday. Prior to this meeting, the Serbian leader also had a long discussion with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop to discuss Serbian policy.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop had a lengthy meeting with Serbian Prime Minister Nedić at the Führer's headquarters, the Prime Minister also met with Führer Hitler. This meeting is of great significance as it relates to Germany's new policies in the Balkans. Italy's strong territorial claims on Corfu in the Balkans and southern France have been an obstacle to Germany's construction of a new European order. Now that the Italian royal family, which is demanding territory, has effectively been replaced, the German government is implementing a new policy toward the Balkan countries, emulating Japan's policy of building a new order in East Asia. A diplomatic correspondent for the German News Agency recently reported on the Serbian Prime Minister's visit to the Führer's headquarters, stating that the Serbian Prime Minister's visit is particularly noteworthy. The attitude of the Italian royal family is not only hindering the resolution of outstanding issues in southwestern Europe, but also hindering relations between those countries and Germany. Although the status of Serbia since the collapse of Yugoslavia has not yet been resolved, the German government is satisfied with the cooperative attitude of the Serbian Prime Minister, and the smooth resolution of the issue is not in doubt. Given the situation where Britain and the United States are making great concessions to the Soviet Union in southern and southwestern Europe, the Balkan countries have no choice but to cooperate with Germany. Key figures in southwestern Europe should recognize this point.

### Mussolini Remains in Germany; Commander of Militia Expresses Loyalty to Leader

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Führer's headquarters announced on the 19th that Marshal Mussolini, after being rescued, went to the Führer's headquarters in Germany to meet with Hitler, which has lasted for several days.

Rome, 20th (Central News Agency) – Rome Radio reported last night that Lieutenant General Ricci, commander of the Fascist legions, sent a telegram to Mussolini after taking office, guaranteeing loyalty and obedience.

### Analysis of German War Power (2)

— Tadataka Ikezaki

Germany is Inferior to the Soviet Union in Food Supply

Regarding the food problem, the Soviet Union's self-sufficiency cannot be considered superior to that of Germany either. I dare say that the current Soviet offensive is because the Soviet Union's food problem cannot ignore the recovery of Ukraine. Even a cold and calculating man like Stalin, although he knows that he is trapped in Germany's attrition tactics, cannot help but expend large amounts of weapons and manpower in the face of their defensive tactics of inducement.

Before the war, Germany's food self-sufficiency rate was generally above 80%. If we add food exporting countries such as Romania and Bulgaria, as well as Ukraine, the granary of Europe, then Germany's position in terms of food self-sufficiency is far superior to what ordinary people think. Moreover, three million prisoners of war have been assigned to rural areas to be used in wasteland reclamation to produce food. Therefore, from today's perspective, Germany, which has gained valuable experience in the previous war, is unlikely to repeat its mistakes.

On the other hand, the Soviet Union's food self-sufficiency was excellent at 100% before the war, but that was in the era of securing Ukraine, the granary of Europe. Since its loss, it has been in dire straits. According to Rosenberg, the governor of the eastern occupied territories, the area sown in Ukraine has been expanded beyond that under Soviet rule. It is said that Ukraine has had a particularly good harvest this year, which is making the difference between Germany and the Soviet Union in the food problem increasingly large.

Enduring Hardship and Working Hard

Fourth, when it comes to the national spiritual strength to endure the sacrifices and horrors of war, the Soviet Union will ultimately not be an enemy of Germany either. The histories of both countries give a clear answer to this point. Let us look back at the Germans during the Thirty Years' War and the Seven Years' War. In these two wars, although the Germans were in dire suffering, they proved that they have unparalleled endurance in the world, and told us that they often use their unparalleled endurance to open up their own fate.

In particular, the Germans know more clearly than anyone else the fate that Germany will face if it suffers defeat in this war. A recent Berlin dispatch from Yomiuri Hochi described the current state of mind of the German people, saying that the entire country is filled with a spirit of enduring hardship and working hard.

So how is the Soviet Union in this regard? The history of the Slavic people tells us that in the Crimean War, the fall of Sevastopol immediately thwarted Russia's will to fight. In the Russo-Japanese War, the Battle of Mukden and the Battle of Tsushima caused Russia at the time to have the idea that continuing the war was futile. Russia's strength in the Napoleonic Wars can be seen as an exception in the Slavic nation.

I do not regard the Slavic people under Stalin's rule as the same as before, but we often feel that the eternal qualities that are latent in the nationality cannot be changed overnight.

Comprehensive War Power of Britain and the United States

For the reasons mentioned above, if we simply regard the European war as a German-Soviet war, Germany has a 70% chance of winning, and the Soviet Union's position is by no means optimistic. Therefore, the most important point in predicting the future of the European war is the extent to which the comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States can supplement the fragility of the Soviet Union. If the comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States supplements the fragility of the Soviet Union and there is still room to spare, then the development of the European war will naturally be unfavorable to Germany.

The comprehensive war power of Britain and the United States is not enough to directly threaten Germany's strategic position, because it exists outside the European fortress. No matter how vast it is, it does not have the qualifications to make up for the Soviet Union's fragility. Stalin, who is familiar with the intricacies of this, has not absolutely demanded a second front from Britain and the United States since the spring of 1942, which is only natural.

In this sense, Montgomery's landing in Calabria has great significance. How the future war will develop is unpredictable, but assuming that the Axis forces fail to defend and the entire territory of Italy completely falls into the hands of the Allied forces, how will Germany cope in this worst-case scenario?

Some British and American commentators say that controlling the entire territory of Italy will certainly not kill Germany, but Germany will save troops and materials as a result, and will incorporate a powerful part of the army as its own, and will still be able to utilize a large number of laborers, so there is no reason for pessimism about Germany's position at this time.

This argument can of course be regarded as a propaganda tactic on the part of Britain and the United States and should not be easily trusted. But even if this is a propaganda tactic, there is some truth behind this argument, and it would not be wise to simply dismiss it as a propaganda tactic. Because according to current warfare theory and facts, even after losing the entire territory of Italy, Germany's strategic position is still quite solid.

From a strategic point of view, "Rather than regarding Italy as part of the European fortress, it is better to regard it as one of the prominent positions." In defending the European fortress, there is always the possibility of being cut off. Between the two, there is the natural barrier of the Alps. Due to past history, it has not only proved to be an impenetrable barrier, but the mountain warfare theorist Franz Freiherr von Kux has also explained it in detail.

Allied Forces Difficult to Break Through Natural Barrier

If the elite German forces occupy the strategic points of this mountainous area and block the Allied advance, they will be able to achieve their objective with a ratio of one to six or one to seven. If the Allied forces dare to break through this natural barrier, there is the possibility of repeating the tragedy of Aragon anywhere. The Soviet Union's placement of the Allied landing in Calabria as the primary objective, and not considering it as the formation of the so-called second front, is not without reason.

The German High Command may have already anticipated this and is slowly controlling the enemy's offensive by occupying the strategic points of the Alps in the event of an emergency. Therefore, Britain and the United States believe that if they want to realistically deliver a blow to Germany and inflict a fatal blow, they cannot be satisfied with capturing the Italian peninsula, but must go on to directly attack the European fortress. There is no other way than to carry out a large-scale landing operation on this.

Many Difficulties in European Landing

However, the Allied landing operation in Europe encountered an unsolvable problem in terms of transportation. Since the beginning of the war, Britain and the United States have already lost more than 30 million tons of ships. If we consider that they must prepare for the war in East Asia on one hand and constantly replenish the landing forces in Italy on the other, how will they raise the large number of troops needed for the European landing operation and the cargo space for transporting all the war materials?

Recalling the previous war, the United States needed about 17.5 tons of cargo space for each soldier sent to Europe. Considering the current situation, which is far more mechanized than it was then, assuming that one million soldiers are dispatched from the United States to Europe, at least 20 million tons of cargo space would be required. The content of the Quebec meeting between Britain and the United States was revealed by the Soviet newspaper, saying: Choose a place to land where there are no German troops. Therefore, their purpose is in a place that everyone is not paying attention to for a while, otherwise they are afraid they would never take this risk.

German Forces on Eastern Front Far-Sighted

The operations of the German forces on the Eastern Front have at least two objectives. On one hand, using a retreat strategy to lure the Soviet army to attack, abandoning inches of land in exchange for large sacrifices, while gradually shortening the front line in retreat, planning to conserve as much troop strength as possible to deal with the second front of Britain and the United States. It is said that the modification of the Orel salient alone has enabled the German forces to save the strength of twenty divisions. I cannot help but admire the far-sightedness of the German forces.

Therefore, the one playing the role of the 1918 Ludendorff offensive is clearly not the current German army, but the Soviet army. In Orel alone, the German army's battle results amounted to 5,514 tanks, 854 artillery pieces, and 2,119 aircraft. The result of this unexpected consumption may at any time induce the Soviet Union's demise. Before the opening of the second front of Britain and the United States, Soviet newspapers exclaimed that the Soviet Union was immediately on the verge of crisis. The situation mentioned above can be fully discerned from this argument.

The position of Britain and the United States after the Soviet Union withdraws no longer needs to be said. They deeply feel how important the Soviet Union is for their victory. The Thames calculation case said that in the plan for a frozen world, the cooperation of the Soviet Union is necessary no matter what, most euphemistically expressing this feeling. The recent statement by Hopkins has told us even more directly. From this point of view, last year's Stalin offensive was not the Sedan of the German army. Similarly, Hitler's belief in victory has not yet reached the point where it can be dismissed as superstition. What significance does this have for Britain and the United States now?

### Rice and Grain Unified Committee Establishes Procurement Guild, Sends Letters to Chambers of Commerce in Three Provinces and Cities, Requesting Representatives to Participate and Investigate Local Production Conditions and Rice Quality

According to inquiries from a Shanghai News Agency reporter yesterday from relevant sources, the Rice Unified Committee is paying close attention to rice procurement and transportation. It plans to send letters to chambers of commerce in rice-producing counties and cities in three provinces, designating local rice industry leaders to participate in the planned "Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Association." However, each location should not send more than ten people. At the same time, the committee hopes to conduct a thorough investigation into local rice production conditions and types of rice, and attach a form to the letter, requesting immediate reporting to the Rice Unified Committee for verification. The Rice and Grain Unified Committee was originally scheduled to be established on the 20th, but due to incomplete procedures, the establishment was postponed. The committee is expected to be established soon. The organization will be headed by a chairman. It has now been decided to add a vice-chairman, who will be selected from experienced members of the rice industry. As for the purpose of establishing the "Rice and Grain Procurement Trade Association," it is to connect procurement merchants in various rice-producing areas to unify procurement work. Once the nominated participants from various regions are determined, it can be formally established.

Personnel Selection for Various Positions in the Grain Unified Committee

The Rice and Grain Unified Committee is actively preparing, and most matters are nearing completion. It is expected to be formally established within days. Apart from the position of Secretary-General, which has not yet been decided, the heads of various departments have been determined. They include: Deputy Secretary-General [name omitted], Chief of General Affairs [name omitted] (concurrently), Chief of Procurement [name omitted], Chief of Storage and Distribution Chen Zi [name omitted], Chief of Finance [name omitted]. Other staff will be assigned separately to begin work. The office will be located on the first floor of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the office of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce will be relocated.

The Future of the Committee Attracts Attention from All Quarters

The Rice and Grain Unified Committee, responsible for handling rice procurement, allocation, and other unified management matters under the Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales General Management Office of the Ministry of Food, has been actively preparing since being appointed by administrative order. It is expected to be formally established in Shanghai soon. The future development of the committee is attracting attention, and all parties have high expectations. Whether the rice and grain unification policy is successfully implemented directly affects the national economy and the people's livelihood. Overall, the committee's structure has the following characteristics: The members of the committee are all leading figures in the business community, which should highly leverage the self-governance capabilities of merchants. The relationship between the committee and the General Chamber of Commerce is slightly different from that of other professional committees. Professional committees are internal organizations of the General Chamber of Commerce, while the council is an external organization of the General Chamber of Commerce, effectively an independent body. Each professional committee is composed of merchants from only one industry, while the committee is composed of leading figures in the business community. To ensure close connection and convenient coordination with the General Chamber of Commerce, the director of the Materials Department of the General Chamber of Commerce and representatives from the Central Trust of China branch have been invited to serve as committee members. No Japanese personnel participate in the selection of directors and supervisors of the General Chamber of Commerce, while there are six Japanese representatives participating in the committee, which shows the special importance that both China and Japan attach to grain administration.

### Japanese Air Defense Authorities Issue Another Notice: Pay Attention to Light Control, Appropriate Measures Will Be Taken If Neglected Again

Central News Agency: On the afternoon of the 10th of this month, the local Japanese authorities issued an air defense alert. That night, many residents still neglected light control. In view of this, the Air Defense Command of the Japanese Army and Navy issued Notice No. 19 yesterday, reminding people to pay attention again. In the future, if there are any violations or negligence, measures will be taken, such as suspending electricity or other appropriate actions. The content of the notice is as follows, hoping that all residents of Shanghai will strictly abide by it.

Notice

Regarding air defense alert light control, warnings have been issued repeatedly during past exercises. However, during this alert, many people still neglected it and were not vigilant, which is regrettable. This behavior is unacceptable in terms of air defense and public interest. Residents of Shanghai must strictly abide by the regulations, be vigilant, and neighbors should remind each other. Self-defense corps members should also actively remind nearby residents. Double efforts should be made to ensure that there are no errors in every house and room. (Attached) In the future, those with poor control will have their electricity supply suspended or other appropriate measures taken.

### Telegraph Business Extremely Busy; Price Increase for Telegraphs to Central China May Be Implemented Next Month

A reporter from the Datong News Agency has learned that the China Central Electrical Communication Company's increase in telegraph fees for the Central China region has not yet been announced, but it is rumored that it may be implemented in mid-October. As for the company's business, it has been extremely busy recently. In terms of international radio stations, the number of telegraphs to Berlin, Bangkok, and Geneva has been increasing daily. Since accepting Japanese telegrams, Hong Kong's workload has also been quite heavy. About 2,000 telegrams are exchanged with Osaka every day, with fewer to Tokyo. Domestically, wired communication in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, and other places is also extremely busy. Although Nanjing uses duplex automatic communication, telegrams often pile up, averaging around 2,000 per day, and cannot be completed until 3:00 AM. Guangzhou also has over 2,000 incoming and outgoing telegrams daily, and there have been increases in Tianjin, Hankou, Qingdao, Taipei, and other locations.

### Municipal Government Bans Military and Police from Watching Plays Without Tickets

The Shanghai Pingju (Peking Opera) Alumni Association previously operated theaters run by its members. Military and police often refused to purchase tickets to enter and watch plays, which not only affected revenue but also caused trouble. Therefore, it specially petitioned the municipal government to request a ban in order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. After receiving the petition, the municipal government, believing that the matters presented were factual, forwarded it to all military and police agencies, instructing them to strictly restrain themselves. From now on, military and police personnel should purchase tickets to enter and watch plays and not cause trouble, so as to reassure merchants and residents.

### Four Materials Control Committees

Following the establishment of the Non-Ferrous Metals, Iron and Steel, Machinery, and Timber Control Committees, the Chemical Products, Rubber, Cement, and Paper Industries Control Committees are also being organized. A reporter from Datong News Agency has learned the progress of the establishment of these four control committees as follows:

Chemical Products

The Chemical Products sector is centered on Kanebo, Iwai & Co., and Mitsui Bussan, establishing the China Central Chemical Products Control Committee. It is roughly divided into industrial chemicals, coatings, dyes, and pigments. The specific plan for all establishment procedures is nearing completion, and it is expected that the staffing will be determined at the inaugural meeting on the 25th.

Rubber Control

The China Central Rubber Control Committee must be established as soon as possible in accordance with various circumstances. In order to establish the sales agency, the inaugural meeting may be held around the end of this month.

Cement Sector

The China Central Cement (i.e., Cement) Control Committee is centered on Mitsui & Co. In order to strengthen control, the Cement item will become an independent agency and will not belong to the Chemical Products sector. The date of the committee's establishment is yet to be determined.

Paper Industry Sector

As for the establishment of the China Central Paper Industry Control Committee, the plan is roughly completed. The committee is centered on the Central China Paper Manufacturing Association and is divided into four sectors, including paper manufacturers, importers, sellers, and paper businesses. The control regulations for each sector will be completed soon. The membership qualifications and internal appointments of officers can also be determined in the near future, and the committee can be established by the end of the month at the latest.

### Grants Entrusted by All Sectors Are Selected; Zhang's Assistance for Impoverished Students Will Be Sent Immediately

The grants entrusted by all sectors for this year have been selected successively. The list of recipients of Old Knight's grant for meals and the grants from Mr. Tan Xingbo and Mr. Chen Bingyun of the Dahua Bank are listed below: Mr. Old Knight generously donated 20,000 yuan to our newspaper in the previous year, designating it to subsidize ten impoverished high school students with outstanding achievements in subjects such as physics and chemistry. Due to time constraints, it was moved to this year's management. Due to academic requirements, there are very few high school students specializing in physics and chemistry, making it impossible to select them. With the consent of the donor, it was moved to subsidize university students studying these subjects. A test was issued, and serious selection was made. The results have now been announced, and the distribution of subsidies has been decided as follows: Category A: Three university students: Yan Jiaying, Xu Shangde, [name omitted], each receiving a meal subsidy of 4,000 yuan. One high school student: Ding Meisun, receiving a meal subsidy of 3,000 yuan. Category B: Six students receiving the cost of books required for this semester, including Liu Ye, Zhang Dingcheng, Xiong Wenzhong, Luo Yichou, each receiving 700 yuan, Jiang Wenzhi and Chen Ji each receiving 500 yuan. Also, Category B: Six high school students, including Qian Qishen, Xie Guangcheng, Zheng You[character unclear], Wang Zhenyu, Lu [character unclear]jing, Shen Xin, each receiving 200 yuan for book expenses.

Mr. Chen and Mr. Tan

Mr. Tan Xingbo and Mr. Chen Bingyun, managers of Dahua Bank, spare no effort in supporting our newspaper's grant campaign. In the previous year, they sent a letter entrusting us to provide scholarships for ten outstanding impoverished high school students and four university students. The two will bear the tuition and miscellaneous fees of the students. If the academic performance of the recommended students is excellent, they will continue to provide assistance. Our newspaper will select and recommend outstanding students based on the results of the previous year's selection test. In addition to the two students who have graduated from university, one student who has dropped out due to illness, and one student who has been recommended separately, excellent students Jiang [name omitted] , Zhao Yanan, Zhang Zhaoqi, and [name omitted] Wen will be added. The remaining ten students will continue to be recommended for scholarships from the two gentlemen based on their excellent academic performance.

Zhang's Scholarship

Mr. Zhang Yuwen, manager of the Great Southeast Tobacco Company, believes that scholarship work is of great significance. Recently, he entrusted our newspaper to select five outstanding impoverished students each from high school grades two and three, and university grades one or two, to be recommended for Mr. Zhang's scholarship for tuition and book expenses. Mr. Zhang is dedicated to helping students and benefiting the impoverished, which is commendable. Our newspaper will immediately handle the recommendation matters based on the results of this year's selection test. The final selection results will be announced later.

### Another Letter to the Business Community

To the esteemed members of the business community: In view of the recent changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce, our newspaper intends to compile a "Shanghai Business Directory" for ease of reference. We have received data from various trade associations. We recently sent an open letter to the business community, requesting that you provide accurate survey data. We have received letters from various companies and factories, which we greatly appreciate. In order to further broaden the survey, we have created a form (see page 2 of this newspaper on September 20). We hope that the members of the business community will take the time to fill it out in detail according to the items and send it to us for detailed correction during compilation. Whether you are a member of a trade association or not, regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all Shanghai businesses are welcome.

Economic Review

### Prize Savings Week

In order to encourage people's savings and channel general idle funds into banks, the Central Reserve Bank is holding a Prize Savings Week from the 15th to the 22nd of this month. It has mobilized 160 member banks of the city's banking association to participate fully in order to absorb term deposits, which is of profound significance.

There are many types of savings, but they generally fall into three categories: compulsory savings, free savings, and prize savings. Compulsory savings are clearly not easy to implement in China's current state. Free savings seem to have little success in China's current state. Only prize savings seem feasible. Therefore, the Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council held in Beijing in the lower part of June this year approved the "Encourage People's Savings to Adapt to Wartime Economy" proposal. The Central Reserve Bank's supervision of all Shanghai banks to hold "Prize Savings Week" has reached the implementation stage of this case.

During wartime, people are restless, value goods over currency, and are indifferent to savings. This trend is not easy to change without pressure or rewards. Now that the government has compulsorily purchased yarn and cloth, it is using prize-bearing time deposits. With heavy rewards, popular customs can be changed. It is predicted that the increase in term deposits in banks and the contraction of idle funds on the market will become the natural result of the "Prize Savings Week".

### Shanghai Educational Association's List of Directors and Supervisors

The Shanghai Special Municipality Educational Association was formally established on the 19th. In addition to electing Mayor Chen as the Honorary Chairman and Education Director Lin as the Honorary Director, the full list of directors and supervisors of the association is as follows: (Directors) Hu Dunfu, Zhou Huarren, Liu [name unclear]shan, Li Jinghan, Gao Tangxin, Zhuang Yaode, Yu Jiangdong, Cai Liling, Yu Jingwu, Zhu Shaozeng, Zhang Zhong[name unclear], [name unclear] Sixiao, Lu Zongxun, (Alternate Directors) Wang Shibing, [name unclear] Yizhi, Shen Chao, Zhao Zhuocheng, Chen Zenan. (Supervisors) Yuan Ludeng, Hou Yizhi, Shen Sizhi, Chen Keying, Xu Songshi, Shi Youfu, Hu Yunze, (Alternate Supervisors) Wang Xiuhe, Zhang Zheng.

Senior Police Officers to Receive Training

Central News Agency: In order to cultivate police officers and increase their academic skills, the First Police Bureau of Shanghai Special Municipality has selected senior police officers in batches to go to Beijing to receive training at the Central Police Academy. The first batch was officially announced by the Bureau Order the other day, including Yang Guangying, Wang Jiahua, Zhang Shusheng from the Special Police Division, and Gan Yougui and Mai Huasheng from the Economic Division. The five are scheduled to report to Beijing within days.

### Shanghai West Residents Limited to Three Days to Receive Sugar

The distribution of household sugar for August in the Fourth District (Shanghai Fourth) of this city only began yesterday (20th), and is limited to three days to complete the purchase, with no exceptions allowed after the deadline. According to the regulations of the Municipal Grain Bureau, this period's household sugar should have been distributed by last month. The household sugar in the Nanshi, City Center, and Zhabei districts was also distributed at the beginning of the month. Therefore, the delayed distribution and shortened purchase period of this period's household sugar in Shanghai Fourth District has caused inconvenience to the general residents of the Shanghai West district. This phenomenon occurred after the issuance of sugar certificates was handled by the neighborhood offices. It is hoped that the authorities can improve this.

The Su-Huai Expedition Football Team has completed its three-match schedule in Shanghai, but due to the postponement of their return date and their unwillingness to lose to Donghua in one match, they challenged Donghua the other day. After both sides agreed, it was decided that they would meet again at Yiyuan Stadium at 5 PM today. Su-Huai has achieved excellent results in Shanghai, winning three matches and maintaining friendly relations between provinces. If they can defeat Donghua today and avenge their loss, it would be a triumphant feat. Donghua has strengthened its team with the return of Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lin, but it is a pity that Wu Binghao is still recovering from a leg injury, which will affect their attacking power. The defense is quite solid. Su-Huai's Secretary, Geng Shufu, held his wedding yesterday afternoon at the International Hotel, filled with joy. General Xia will still play, proving his courage. Tickets for today's match are still 20 yuan and 10 yuan.

### Banking Industry and Firms Support Lending to Various Industries, Increasing Monthly Since the Implementation of the New Legal Tender

In order to revive the market and support various industrial and commercial sectors, banking industries and firms have continued to provide loans to various industries in accordance with the lending restriction measures promulgated by the Ministry of Finance and the new lending methods adopted by the banking industry. The regulations stipulate that borrowers should not promote speculation and hoarding, and should adhere to the principle of normal business needs. In addition, they must be members of the relevant industry trade association and hold a license issued by the competent authorities. However, interest rates are subject to change depending on the market. According to statistics from the China Economic Research Institute, the total loans of 109 banks in Shanghai, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, including the Shanghai Bank, Zhejiang Bank, Real Continental Bank, and Siming Bank, were 1,573,192,000 yuan in March of this year, 1,237,521,000 yuan in February, 1,118,041,000 yuan in January, 1,091,572,000 yuan in December of last year, 1,050,841,000 yuan in November, 938,354,000 yuan in October, 828,510,000 yuan in September, 748,853,000 yuan in August, 656,763,000 yuan in July, and 584,525,000 yuan in June. This proves that the banking industry's lending to various industries has increased month by month since the implementation of the new legal tender and has not decreased.

Commercial and Civilian Enthusiasm for Savings Week on the Fifth Day

The Savings Week, organized by the Central Reserve Bank with the participation of more than 160 member banks in the city, has been implemented since the 5th of this month. Businessmen and residents have been very enthusiastic about participating in savings. Because the term deposit period is short, the interest rate is generous, and there is an opportunity to win prizes through lotteries, businessmen and residents are eager to save. The deadline for the Savings Week is tomorrow (22nd) at 4 PM, so banks have been very busy accepting savings accounts recently.

Special Savings Lottery to Be Drawn at the End of This Month

In order to encourage people's interest in savings and guide idle funds into productive enterprises, the Central Savings Association has issued special prize-bearing savings bonds, each worth 50 yuan, divided into five categories. Since its launch on July 1, companies and stores in this city and other locations have been actively underwriting and selling the bonds. The general public has been very enthusiastic about buying lottery tickets. The lottery for the bonds is scheduled to be drawn publicly at the Shanghai Racecourse at 3 PM on the 30th of this month.

### Hope for Raw Material Allocation for All Industries

The organizational structures of various industry associations are becoming increasingly sound. However, recently, members have expressed deep concern over the lack of necessary raw materials, which has led to operational difficulties. For example, industries such as machine-made noodles, tea pastries, and steamed bun industries have previously received approval from the Flour Food Bureau for periodic allocation of flour, oil, sugar, salt, and other raw materials. Similarly, the cotton wadding industry received approval from the Business Coordination Committee for discretionary allocation of cotton. However, months have passed without any tangible results. Therefore, various industry associations are eagerly looking forward to the timely allocation of needed raw materials to ensure the smooth operation of their members' businesses.

### Japanese Nationals to Pay Taxes Officially According to Chinese Tax Laws - Statement Released by the Japanese Consulate-General

Shanghai News Agency (Central News Agency): The National Government is preparing to implement taxation on Japanese nationals in accordance with the treaty concluded between China and Japan at the end of July regarding the taxation of Japanese subjects. On the 10th of this month, the National Government issued its first notification to Ambassador Tani, clarifying the scope and timeline for the application of Chinese tax laws to Japanese residents in China. The Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai issued a statement on the 20th, explaining the taxes to be levied and expressing hope that Japanese nationals would cooperate with the National Government's taxation efforts. According to the July

Statement

According to Article 1 of the Supplementary Agreement on the Taxation Treaty Concerning Japanese Nationals Residing in the Republic of China, concluded on July 31st, the first notification regarding the scope of Chinese laws and regulations to be followed by Japanese nationals, as well as the applicable areas, was delivered by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to the Imperial Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to China on the 10th of this month, as indicated in the announcement. It was also published in both the Chinese and Japanese Official Gazettes on the 20th. From this point forward, Japanese nationals in China will begin to officially pay taxes in accordance with Chinese tax laws.

It is unprecedented for Japanese nationals to comply with the tax laws of the Republic of China. This goes without saying, and the implementation of this measure is imminent. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that there will be some degree of inconvenience and difficulty due to unfamiliarity with tax laws and procedures. However, the Empire of Japan is withdrawing its extraterritorial rights in the Republic of China, assisting China in achieving its independent development as soon as possible, and working together to build a new order in East Asia with firm determination. This taxation measure is also aimed at realizing this policy. Therefore, its smooth implementation is of great significance for promoting Japan's policy towards China. It is hoped that all residents will deeply recognize the current situation, overcome any inconveniences and difficulties with a spirit of self-encouragement and cooperation, fully adapt to this new era, and contribute to the construction of Greater East Asia and the successful completion of the war effort.

Additionally, I would like to briefly explain some points that local residents should pay special attention to when starting to pay taxes, as follows. Please refer to the previously released treaty, supplementary agreement, explanations, and the contents of this notification to avoid misunderstandings.

Tax Items Related to the Jurisdiction of the Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai

The tax items listed in this first notification include all central taxes (excluding Mongol cases) and some local taxes, except for income tax. Tax laws that are only implemented in North China and Mengjiang are also included in the notification. Among them, for central taxes under the jurisdiction of the Consul-General, the applicable areas are indicated as "Huazhong South," "Huazhong," "Huazhong Seven Provinces," and "National." For local taxes, except for those explicitly applicable only to the Mengjiang region, the five types mentioned all apply to the consular district of this Consul-General. However, it should be noted that those that only indicate Jiangsu Province but do not include Shanghai Municipality do not apply to Shanghai.

Furthermore, all taxes except land tax will be implemented from October 1st. The details of each tax are published in the "Explanation of Tax Laws" released by the authorities in Nanjing on the 20th, and the key points should be carefully studied.

Tax Items Not Recorded in This Notification

Among the tax items not included in this notification, those with a close relationship to the general public are income tax, business tax, land tax, house tax, food and beverage tax, and entertainment tax. Some preparations should be made or special measures taken before these taxes are levied. Once a solution is reached, a second and third notification will be issued. However, the Chinese authorities fully understand the position of the residents and are carefully studying the most appropriate method of implementation. Therefore, all residents need not feel any anxiety and should wait for the official notification before taking appropriate action.

Moreover, those taxes that have not been included in this notification but have been paid in the past should continue to be paid under the original names and methods in the spirit of cooperating with the Chinese side. Furthermore, taxes similar in name but having the nature of fees are not related to this notification, and Japanese nationals should pay them, which goes without saying.

Regarding Coercive Force on the Chinese Side

According to Article 2 of the Agreed Matters, the Chinese side has stipulated not to adopt administrative dispositions of coercive force for the time being. Therefore, compulsory actions such as inspections, investigations, seizures, and auctions by Chinese officials, as well as confiscations, will not be adopted for the time being. However, attention should be paid to matters indispensable to taxation techniques, such as inspecting books and requiring taxpayers to apply or provide explanations, if required by Chinese officials.

Measures to Ensure Tax Payment by Japanese Nationals

As mentioned above, the Chinese side has stipulated not to use coercive force. Therefore, the Japanese side will take the necessary measures to ensure tax payment by Japanese nationals. This point is stipulated in Article 3 of the Agreed Matters, as a remedy for political matters. Therefore, it is expected that a ministerial ordinance prescribing penalties will be promulgated. However, as a temporary measure, if there is a violation of tax law, tax evasion, or delay in payment, this Consulate-General will take appropriate administrative actions. However, in order to maintain the reputation of Imperial subjects, each should exercise self-restraint to avoid the need for such measures.

Relationship Between the Taxes Notified This Time and the Civil Defense Tax

Among the tax items notified this time, only the liquor tax overlaps with the current Shanghai Civil Defense Tax. The liquor tax in China is quite high. Therefore, the method of adjustment is being considered, taking into account the increase in the burden on the general Japanese population after double taxation with the Civil Defense Tax, as well as the financial situation of the Civil Defense Corps. For other Civil Defense Taxes, they will continue to be implemented as they are before there is a notification and before the Chinese side levies an equivalent tax. In short, the adjustment of the Civil Defense Tax must be considered from two aspects: first, to avoid increasing the burden on the Japanese population due to double taxation, and second, to maintain the operation of the Civil Defense Corps without causing obstacles. However, the Chinese side fully understands the Civil Defense Corps' business, so it will not take methods that cause obstacles to the Civil Defense Corps' finances.

Relationship with the Former Concession Areas

Among the tax items listed in this notification, central taxes must be levied both inside and outside the former concession areas. However, for local taxes, those in the former International Settlement and its extended road areas, as well as the former French Concession area, are naturally not applicable. Regarding the tax laws applicable to the above-mentioned areas, they will be revised again before further notification. Therefore, residents living in those areas should continue to pay the assessments of the former Shanghai Municipal Council or the former French Municipal Council as donations, as instructed in the August 1st notification from this Consulate-General. Furthermore, if there are any unclear matters or questions regarding the Chinese taxation issue, please ask the relevant officials of this Consulate-General for clarification.

### The Training of Young Pilot Soldiers - Beautiful Children of God

There is infinite beauty in the world, and within that beauty lies the figure of the young pilot soldier. This beauty is wonderful in its "simplicity and plainness"... I am probably not the only one who feels this way!

The figures of the young men clothed in flight suits show no signs of affectation. Just the brown uniforms and caps suitable for flight in the sky, and the green belt-shaped parachutes. There's nothing useless about it.

For these simple and beautiful young pilot soldiers, we can only perceive their awe-inspiring presence and natural beauty.

Apart from all outward beauty, the spiritual beauty of these young men can be imagined simply from their magnificent and unparalleled battles on the southern and northern fronts.

Any mother in the world who sees their imposing and majestic appearance on the airfield, or sees their training in the sky, will have her heart moved even if she does not hear about them fighting in the heart-stopping battlefields. The son who was raised from infancy has been transformed into a valiant and high-spirited young man, and the mother will be surprised and respectful, even feeling confused, wondering if he is really her son. There is a saying called "divine soldier," and they are truly "children of God."

### Starting in the Sky Only After Thorough Ground Training

Before the little swallow flies into the sky, it must first undergo a long period of training. Before taking their first flight in a practice plane, young pilot soldiers also undergo a rigorous ground training. They climb into the aircraft model of the ground trainer and practice various techniques. This ground trainer is connected to a recorder that records the track, and the young men's driving conditions are displayed on the instructor's desk by the instrument's needle.

Nothing is neglected. If this ground driving training is not fully understood, one cannot fly in the sky. If you are careless or unskilled, flaws will occur in aerial flight. As long as the technique is excellent, nothing is as safe as an airplane. Every day, who knows how many planes are flying, and the number of accidents and sacrifices is almost one in ten thousand. It is definitely not a dangerous thing. This is what the instructors at the Kumagaya Flying School say.

### The Reporting Sound is Full of Beautiful Tension and Vitality

People call young pilot soldiers the divine soldiers of this world. The purity and freshness of the young soul is more beautiful and precious than anything else on earth. The figure of the young pilot soldier is probably the one that can fully exert this soul!

Discipline, order, courage, and all other beautiful and valiant spirits can be fully expressed in the attitude of reporting to the instructor after completing flight training. Four or five young men stand side by side a few steps away from the instructor. After saluting, they report. The brisk movements, the loud voices, the different personalities, physiques, and appearances of each person. The sincere expressions and faithful reports show that there is no hypocrisy or emptiness here.

In the sound of the report, there is a moment filled with wonderful tension and the vitality of life.

### Cultivating Technical Talents

— Qin Mu

Currently, China is universally aware of the lack of technical talent, which is of great importance to the future construction of the new China.

Young people in our country who have received higher education often adhere to vain ideas and are unwilling to start from the bottom after graduation, always trying to find shortcuts. As for low-level technical personnel, they often remain stuck in their ways, unwilling to improve, and also lack opportunities for further study. As a result, senior personnel lack the skills and experience and can only handle routine matters; junior personnel lack the knowledge and qualifications to develop their talents. Consequently, various industries lack technical talent.

A young person engaged in industry who avoids practical training in the factory and immediately jumps to a management or planning position is actually destroying his own potential for advancement, because a technical person without intimate technical knowledge and without understanding the work of those below cannot be competent in a high position. A factory manager who has not experienced the work of all departments in the factory himself cannot completely manage the factory.

On the other hand, those who are in charge of guidance in the factory must encourage their subordinates to advance and give them opportunities for training. This will definitely increase work efficiency. If people are employed without regard to talent and are only favored based on personal connections, then those with ambition and talent will inevitably be disappointed and frustrated. Not only will true talent be buried, but it will also harm the business itself and the entire country.

Education in China has been promoted for decades, and the current shortage of technical personnel must also be attributed to the lack of a proper educational system. There are few vocational secondary schools, and most secondary schools are general. This has created some "people who can do everything but do nothing well." Building more vocational schools is also the most appropriate way to cultivate technical talent.

Letter

To Whom It May Concern, I read in your publication on September 7th that someone accused my work "Evil Grievance" (original title "Home Female Teacher") of plagiarizing a section from the "American Piece" in Gong Shenzhou's National Light Society's Contemporary Novel Collection, Volume 3. After reading this, I was extremely surprised. After investigation, the article is indeed written by me and is based on real facts, not a castle in the air, and I am not paid for it. I am forced to make a statement.
Take off continuously
The aircraft taking off into the sky

In the hot summer, the sun beats down. The young men climb into the plane, causing a rumbling sound. At the sound of the takeoff command, they immediately straddle the yellow trainer and taxi forward. They fly straight into the sky. The planes traveling with them either drill into the clouds or fall like leaves, appearing and disappearing, each showing their skills. A large group of planes, with yellow bodies and rumbling engines, are like a swarm of bees flying.

At the southern sea, the fires of war are raging, and every senior is constantly fighting to the death, so we cannot hesitate or slack off for a moment. In the eyes of the young flying soldiers, there is nothing else. They only know! "Follow the seniors and destroy the British and Americans." With a resolute spirit, they are determined to go to the battlefield.
Strong body and sound spirit are indispensable

Do constant flying soldiers have special conditions? No, no special conditions are required. They only need to have a strengthened body and an incomparably sound spirit. Young people of the world! All of you must ignite the true heart of patriotism. Come and be the young flying soldiers of the infinitely beautiful and precious "children of God," and be a warrior to defend the motherland.
