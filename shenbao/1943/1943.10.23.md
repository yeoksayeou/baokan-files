### The Premise of Political Reform

The content and meaning of "politics" seem to be well-known to the general public, and they can all talk about it. However, in reality, even those in political circles may not fully understand it. Generally speaking, public officials are all within the political circle, especially high-ranking public officials with leadership responsibilities. Most of them fail to understand the laws of "politics"; even if they do understand, failing to abide by them is equivalent to not understanding. What's more, not only do they fail to understand and abide by them, but they go against them, fundamentally violating the laws of politics. Such abnormal phenomena have been readily apparent in the history of the Republic of China, and are particularly evident today. Those engaged in politics have not been able to understand the laws of politics; or even if they can understand them, they have not been able to abide by them, so it is really difficult to achieve political clarity and improve people's livelihoods.

What exactly is the content and meaning of "politics"? According to Mr. Sun Yat-sen's explanation: "Politics is the matter of the public; governance is management. Managing the affairs of the public is politics." He also said, "The power to manage the affairs of the public is political power; now, having the people manage politics is called democracy." Based on the above explanation, we know that the content and meaning of politics are extremely simple and easy to understand, and are not unfathomable matters that can be concealed. Mr. Sun Yat-sen was the creator of the Republic of China and the founder of the Kuomintang. His knowledge was profound, and his explanation probably would not make us doubt, especially the public officials of the National Government and the comrades of the Kuomintang, even less so, right?

Of course, Mr. Sun Yat-sen's explanation is only a principle-based explanation of the content and meaning of politics. The full picture of the content of politics, especially the "governance"—the management aspect—is by no means a simple matter. Therefore, there is the name "political science," which is constantly being researched and constantly progressing. Political science has become a kind of science. The scope of science is very broad, and all phenomena and things in the universe are materials for science. The topic of political science is the state—a kind of organization of people. The purpose of political science is to study the actions of people in this organized society. What is called "political" refers to all kinds of facts, forces, and phenomena related to the state, so political science is the scientific knowledge of the state and becomes an independent science.

To put it crudely, since politics is the management of the affairs of the public, some of the affairs of the public are common and some are different. How to study the nature of events? How to study methods of management? How to study events of different natures and manage them with different methods to adapt? All these kinds of research are certainly not something that can be glimpsed superficially, nor can they be quickly understood by those who are uneducated and unskilled. If it is said that politics is like winning the lottery, without gradually studying the basics, without diligently studying for years, then yesterday's rickshaw puller might as well be an engineer today, and yesterday's plasterer could be a doctor today. How can there be such easy things in the world? Taking a step back, even if political science is different from natural science and not as strict as natural science, then can today's Zhang San and Li Si, regardless of their occupation or abilities, manage the public and become officials tomorrow simply by chance? If so, there is no need to set up political science departments in universities at all, and books and writings on political science, even sociology, can be destroyed. Why talk about political science? Just simply turn back hundreds of years of history and live a life of autocratic politics!

Now is already the era of the 20th century, and science is flourishing. If you don't advance, you will fall behind. If our country wants to stand in the world, it naturally cannot break away from the times and go backward. The people are the main body of the country, and politics is the management of the people. If managed properly, the people's lives will be stable. The people's lives must be stable, therefore, management must be proper. Whether management is proper depends entirely on whether those who wield the power of management have studied the method of management. In short, only those who have studied and have experience in political science are qualified to take on political work. If we want to clarify politics and improve people's livelihoods, we must demand the establishment of expert politics and eliminate bureaucratic politics and gangster politics. In view of the current political situation, which does not conform to our requirements, we cannot help but loudly propose: "The premise of political reform is, first, to establish expert politics, and second, to establish organs of public opinion."

The examination and evaluation system is the cornerstone of establishing expert politics, and also the sieve for removing the dross and retaining the essence. If we want to talk about political reform and the establishment of expert politics, we must fully exert the effectiveness of the examination and evaluation system, and cannot let it exist in name only. The appointment and transfer of public officials must undergo strict evaluation, and if they do not meet the standards, they should be rejected in accordance with the law. If the decision of the Ministry of Personnel cannot be passed, the person in charge of personnel administration should consider it an infringement of their own responsibilities and file an effective appeal according to the law. If the authorities do not value personnel administration and consider it dispensable, then, for the sake of gaining the trust of the people, it is better to abolish it.

Because politics is the matter of the public, in principle, it can only be done well and cannot fail. Those engaged in politics must not harbor a "muddling through" mentality. We often hear some public officials say, "At this time, just muddle along." Having such a corrupt mentality, all that is manifested in reality is nothing more than perfunctory work, muddling the waters to fish for personal gain, and other decadent phenomena. These self-abandoning public officials are truly responsible for creating bad politics, and we hope that the government will exert the effectiveness of supervision and discipline to seek purification.

Secondly, although the political systems of modern countries differ, all of them attach importance to public opinion and have organs of public opinion. Looking around the world, only we do not have them. To be honest, the irrational phenomena in politics may be "muddled through" by the government, but the people are "clear bystanders." With organs of public opinion, the people can frankly point out gains and losses and correct irrational phenomena. Therefore, unless the government avoids talking about irrational phenomena in politics and is unwilling to have organs of public opinion to correct them, there is no reason not to establish organs of public opinion immediately.

In short, compelled by the urgency of the national environment and the suffering of the people's lives, we cannot help but demand to start with political reform to achieve a state of clarification. Therefore, we propose the premise of political reform to discuss it with the people of the country!

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Various Parts of New Guinea Island; Japanese Headquarters Announced Comprehensive Battle Results Yesterday

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced the following situation of the battle in New Guinea at 6:00 p.m. on the 22nd: The Japanese army near Finschhafen is currently attacking the enemy forces that have landed in the north of various places, but both sides have successively reinforced their forces. Therefore, since October 16th, the battle situation has suddenly become fierce. The Japanese army fighting near Lae and Laemoia, after heavily damaging the enemy forces, began to retreat gradually from the beginning of September. In mid-October, they had completely concentrated in the north of Lae. During this period, the damage suffered by the enemy forces is expected to exceed 12,000 people. The Japanese side's losses are currently known to be about 2,000 killed in action. In addition, the Japanese army near Madang has been fighting with the enemy forces that arrived in the upstream right bank area of the Ramu River since the beginning of October, and fierce fighting is still ongoing. The Japanese army and navy air units have been very active in recent days. In addition to fighting fiercely with the ground troops, they have also bombed enemy airfields, bombed enemy warships, or intercepted attacking enemy aircraft. From September 1st to today, the Japanese army's battle results are as follows: A. Enemy forces' losses: The Japanese army shot down 164 enemy aircraft (including 12 unconfirmed), destroyed 5 enemy aircraft, sank 4 enemy cruisers, 2 destroyers, 18 transport ships, 6 torpedo boats, 4 barges, and many other boats. Destroyed 6 enemy cruisers, 6 destroyers, 21 transport ships, 2 torpedo boats, 5 barges, and many boats. B. The Japanese side's losses were only 49 aircraft.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Japanese army near Finschhafen has turned to the offensive, and fierce fighting has broken out with the Australian army in the dense forest area. It is reported that they have advanced a considerable distance, and the meeting of the north and south troops has been successful. The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in the South Pacific issued a war bulletin stating that thousands of Japanese and Australian troops are continuing to engage in bloody battles in the dense forests near Finschhafen. The Japanese army has advanced a considerable distance in some areas. Furthermore, a spokesman for the said headquarters explained the battle situation as follows: The Japanese army launched an attack from the strong position of Sattelberg, 15 miles northwest of Finschhafen, and has achieved considerable success. Moreover, they have established contact with coastal areas and other Japanese army units, and seem to have gained a position in the slightly flatter area along the Som River, and are currently advancing towards the mouth of the Som River, which is only five miles from Finschhafen. The elite 9th Division of the Australian army is fiercely resisting this, and this battle is the fiercest in the past few days. This proves that the Japanese army has a firm determination.

### Japanese Army in Burma Launches New Offensive; Mountbatten Flies to Chongqing

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Attempting to counterattack and return to Burma. The Japanese army stationed in Burma first launched an attack and is now besieging the Chongqing army in Gaoligong Mountain and other places, launching a heroic battle. The Chongqing expeditionary force in Burma is now facing a major crisis. As for the Chongqing side's counterattack against Burma, the British Indian army is the main force in the operation, and it first began to attack the border between India and Burma. The Chongqing army is fully prepared for battle, but this time it was preempted by the Japanese army and has suffered heavy losses. Since the Japanese army began its attack, two weeks have passed, and the British Indian army on the border between India and Burma has not yet shown any positive action, which has caused internal demands within Chongqing for the British Indian army to start fighting immediately. According to a telegram from New Delhi, Lord Mountbatten, Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, has flown to Chongqing to meet Chiang Kai-shek. After Mountbatten took office, he intended to place the three group armies of the Burmese Expeditionary Force under his command, totaling about 200,000 men, but Chiang Kai-shek refused, and the relationship between the two, centered on the command, became increasingly delicate. Mountbatten then wanted to change the planned itinerary and fly to Chongqing, but because the Japanese army launched an offensive, the Burmese war situation took a sharp turn for the worse. Mountbatten then immediately flew to Chongqing. It is expected that Mountbatten will conduct a comprehensive review of the operation plan to recapture Burma with Chiang Kai-shek and senior generals such as General Stilwell, commander of the US forces stationed in Chongqing, and will also coordinate the operation plans of the Chongqing, British, and American armies, navies, and air forces on the Chinese mainland front. The issue of the Chongqing army's command, which had become a stalemate in the past, will be addressed. After the talks are concluded, the general counteroffensive operation in Burma will begin. When the Japanese army captured Burma in the past, the British Indian army retreated alone. Later, the Chongqing army's Luo Zhuoying army was annihilated by the Japanese army through sacrifices, and then there was the disastrous defeat of the British Indian army in the Arakan operation. With such a strategy of repeated defeats in battle, even if the enemy attempts to counterattack, there will be no chance of victory.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Chongqing's "Military Commission" issued a public statement on the 21st, stating that the battle between the Japanese and Chongqing forces in western Yunnan Province is still very fierce.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force in China Announces One-Week Battle Situation

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the battle situation for one week on the 22nd as follows: The Japanese army in North China's active suppression of the Communists is proceeding extremely smoothly. As a result, the Communist troops in various parts of North China have suffered a crushing blow. The Communist troops are now specifically avoiding frontal combat and wandering outside the areas cleared by the Japanese army. Since the Japanese army has been carrying out long-term clearing operations, the Communist troops' food has become difficult, and desertions of soldiers have emerged one after another. In order to destroy the Chongqing army and the New Fourth Army in the northern Jiangsu Province, the Japanese army, with the cooperation of the Chinese military police, began clearing operations on the 11th, crushing the Chongqing army everywhere and capturing a large number of prisoners. In addition, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing has suffered heavy damage due to repeated fierce bombings by the Japanese army's air units and seems to be reorganizing its air force and replenishing personnel and equipment. This trend, as well as the enemy's recent call for a counteroffensive in Burma, is worthy of attention.

### Consolidate National Strength to Win Victory; Goebbels Writes Article Reviewing the War Situation

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Huitong News Agency: German Minister of Propaganda Dr. Goebbels stated in a recent article in "National Magazine" on the current war situation: Germany is using the current defensive war to consolidate the general situation. As a result of encountering unexpected military and political events, Germany needs to conduct a detailed review of the current situation in order to consolidate the national combat power. Regarding the military developments of the past few months, he said: The extent of the danger to our final victory is only relatively speaking. If the current situation is compared with the situation in September 1939, then we admit that in a certain stage of the war, the chance of final victory was closer than it is now, but although the current situation is more unfavorable, it is by no means as dangerous as it was at the beginning of the war. Germany's military setbacks this summer were actually due to the rebellion of the Italian royal family. Our evasive movement in the east was also due to this. In order to protect Southern Europe, we had to withdraw several divisions from the front line, which created the need to shorten the eastern front. However, the danger of the situation is by no means as serious as the defection of Badoglio. This action has made the enemy's strategy encounter special training, and as a result, the enemy's attempt has only achieved part of its purpose. The large-scale evasive movement implemented by the German army on the Eastern Front in the past four months was in accordance with the original plan, so it was orderly. It is admirable that the army can still control the situation in the fifth year of the war. Goebbels continued: He did not want to use the term "successful withdrawal" as a justification, but only briefly described the achievements of the German army on the Eastern Front. The enemy forces failed to cut off the main force of the German army or encircle the German army, and even failed to seize a large number of war materials. Although Germany has given up some territories, it has not lost a large number of troops and war materials. The German people's will to fight is not affected by the external success or failure of the war. The German people's calm fighting and determination for final victory have not changed in the slightest. The people's calm in the face of the ups and downs of the war and their knowledge of how to cope with unfortunate events are the main factors in the final victory and still lie in the stability of the people's hearts. The German people, in view of the failure of 1918, deeply know that this tragedy cannot be repeated today, so their morale has not wavered. Goebbels then assured the German people: All the great wars in history are the same as this one. Whoever can endure the longest can win the greatest victory. Today, no country can maintain its full strength. If the German people are satisfied with today's defensive war, it is because Germany's failure is not enough to affect the outcome of the war. Germany's recent setbacks are not due to the difficulty of the situation, but due to the German command's adaptation to the facts. We deeply know that our position has temporary weaknesses, but we cannot ignore our strength and the opportunity to win the most. Goebbels concluded: We do not admit that we have lost part of our combat power. What the enemy has gained is only a part of what we had taken in the past. If we can muster the courage we had in September 1939 today, we will continue to use our full strength to fight to the end with our belief in victory.

### Philippine Congress Passes Two Bills

Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - On the 21st, the Philippine Special Congress passed two bills: appropriating 2 million pesos to relieve the poor and changing the Philippine fiscal year to run from January to December. They were immediately submitted to the President for approval. Furthermore, Budget Committee Chairman Malaputo, in response to the question of Representative Alanz in Congress on the 22nd, explained the financial situation of the new government. The main idea is that by the end of this year, there will be a surplus of 1.3 million pesos in revenue.

Manila, 22nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The 22nd was the fifth day of the Philippine Special Congress. After deliberation, a bill on determining the regular congressional session was passed, deciding that regular congressional sessions will be convened every year from October 20th. However, because this year's regular congressional session had already convened a special session from October 18th, it was postponed to November 25th. Furthermore, according to the constitution, the National Assembly convenes a regular session once a year. The first regular session of this year will begin on November 25th and will continue for 60 days.

### Soviet Troops in the Nieper Bend Attempt to Expand Strongholds; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Kiev Area

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Huitong News Agency: The waning of the Soviet offensive southeast of Kliementchuk and at the entrance to the Nogai Steppe is merely a thing of the past. The true weakening of the Soviet offensive north of the Sea of Azov is due to the significant losses suffered in the attack on Melitopol in recent days. As for the reduction in fighting in the northern part of the Great Nieper Bend, it is due to the Soviet command's attempt to first consolidate already gained positions, and then expand southward the strongholds they have obtained south of the Nieper River, in order to concentrate still unused reserves. It is also possible that the Soviet army intends to increase crossing points on the river, as the current Soviet river crossing points are too far apart and are frequently subjected to attacks by the German Air Force. It would be a great mistake to say that the struggle for the Nieper Bend and the entrance to Crimea has reached its peak, as the enemy is striving to expand its victories. The German command is devising plans to thwart the enemy's success. Regarding the situation elsewhere on the battlefront, fierce fighting continues in the Kiev area. German troops, attacking the Soviet bridgehead south of the city, have achieved local objectives, and fighting north of Kiev has also intensified. The situation north of Gomel in the central sector of the Eastern Front remains unchanged, with only localized fighting in that area.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced the Eastern Front situation on the 21st, stating: After Soviet troops broke through the German lines southeast of Kliementchuk, they launched a local offensive on the 20th to expand the breakthrough area, but were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet troops, in an attempt to break through the German lines between Kiev and Chernihiv, launched fierce attacks with several divisions. The Soviet offensive north of Kiev failed, and fierce fighting continues northwest of Chernihiv. Fighting has also broken out in the Melitopol and Gomel areas, and southwest of Velikiye Luki.

Southern Breakthrough Battle Will Reach Climax

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: The breakthrough operations between Kliementchuk and Dnipropetrovsk are still continuing. Although the intensity of fighting in the aforementioned locations has slightly decreased, this cannot be said to be a slackening of Soviet combat efforts. On the contrary, the fighting here will reach another new climax. On Wednesday, the Soviet army's actions were limited to using a small number of troops to consolidate the positions occupied by its tank convoys, while simultaneously seeking to expand the gap created in the south. This so-called combat assistance seems extremely inconsistent, leading to the inference that under effective German counter-attacks, their combat operations are sufficient to cope with German pressure in order to consolidate their gains. Soviet offensives in other sectors of the front also continue, but fail to indicate important locations. The Soviet attack on Kiev, the capital of Ukraine, even with attacks by several newly formed divisions, was ultimately thwarted by the German army and ended in failure. At the same time, the German advance in this area has been extremely successful, with the German army completing its designated objectives after intense combat. Due to improved weather conditions, aerial activity on both sides has been extremely active. The German Air Force is taking advantage of these favorable conditions, launching attacks day and night on Soviet supply lines. In the south, the German Air Force is greatly assisting in the Kliementchuk battle, assisting ground troops and inflicting significant losses on enemy manpower and material.

### Strong German Resistance in the Mountains of Southern Italy; Allied Offensive Obstructed

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: On Wednesday afternoon, British and American forces, with only small forces, launched attacks on Field Marshal Kesselring's troops in the central and eastern areas of the Apennine Mountains, in order to continue their offensive operations. In this area, near the front lines, and along the western coastal area, British and American forces are mostly engaged in reorganizing their troops, as the enemy has undoubtedly suffered significant losses in its attempts to break through and encircle. These enemy actions are all carried out at night, and they are using the darkness to replenish their troops and transfer reinforcements. German forces are putting up strong resistance in both defense and counter-attack. The difficulties in the mountain areas have made the Allied command realize that special preparations are needed before launching large-scale military operations. During the fighting south of Baranello on Wednesday, British and Canadian forces attempted to advance south along the road from Vinchiaturo. Another enemy detachment, about one company strong, simultaneously launched an attack on a mountain range several kilometers to the south. However, German forces launched concentrated defensive artillery fire from both sides of the Volturno River, from Jalligliari and Giarelli, causing the enemy's fierce attacks in both of these locations to collapse within a short period of time, with heavy military losses. German grenadiers immediately launched a counter-attack, capturing numerous prisoners of war. A British company that had received reinforcements in Castelpetroso also met a similar fate on the eastern slope of the Apennine Mountains. The enemy troops here were also driven back to their original positions, leaving behind many dead and wounded soldiers on the battlefield.

### Germany Invents New Weapon: Rocket Bomb with Astonishing Power

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - British Prime Minister Winston Churchill announced in the House of Commons on September 21 that the German army is currently researching new types of gliders and new types of rocket bombs, among other new weapons. Upon learning of this, world military experts were deeply shocked. The German "Intervention Report" published two photos on its cover on the 20th, showing German Minister of Armaments Albert Speer and Field Marshal Erhard Milch hiding behind an iron shield, testing the power of a new type of bomb. This has confirmed that the British Prime Minister's words were not false. The newspaper added an explanation beside the photos, stating that German Air Force Commander Hermann Göring and Minister of Armaments Albert Speer recently convened several key figures from the armaments industry and experimented with new weapons at a certain airfield on the Eastern Front. The results were good, and it is planned to use them on the front lines soon. The power of the bomb was not described, only that it could destroy fortresses, and that it was a special bomb. The German authorities are unwilling to elaborate on this, so the actual situation is unknown. In addition, sources from the Allied side claim that the new bomb is about one meter long and is a rocket-type bomb. It has wings on both sides, like those of a glider, so once launched, it can glide forward in level flight, at a speed of 500 or 600 miles per hour. Churchill said that the launch of the new bomb may be controlled by radio. However, British and American military experts believe that its shape is extremely small. In addition to being loaded with multiple explosives, it is difficult to equip it with a radio control device, so what Churchill said may not be reliable. It is said that the bomb can be launched from a distance of about one mile from the target, so it can be said to be a type of aerial torpedo. It is also understood that the machine guns and anti-aircraft guns installed on German aircraft also use rocket-type ammunition. Therefore, it is generally believed that it is quite possible that bombs will be converted to rocket-type in the future. Currently, German citizens are hoping that Germany can mass-produce this new weapon and start bombing Britain as soon as possible in retaliation, as Hitler had previously predicted that German aircraft would retaliate against Britain with bombing raids.

### Japan Strengthens Domestic Situation

Reform of the Education System

As an important part of thoroughly strengthening national mobilization, many measures for the comprehensive transformation of the education system are naturally the result of a determination to cope with the current critical situation. In view of the trend of Japan's cultural and educational policies since the Meiji Restoration, and the movement of public opinion in the education sector, this is a necessary outcome.

The current measures are an emergency measure to redistribute the total strength of students to important sectors of the country. One of the concerns of the Japanese education sector, namely, breaking the unplanned nature of universities and higher education, will be resolved at once. With the goal of reforming culture and education and growing and developing, in expecting the permeation of the national plan for education, Japan's education is undergoing a rapid transformation in order to cope with this unprecedented war.

Due to the urgency of the war situation, the previous establishment of the outline of the student wartime mobilization system has placed classrooms in the broad and realistic national life, in order to prepare for the administrative stance of adapting to decisive battles while studying in practice. To make Japanese education more effectively ensure strong planning and implementation in terms of readiness. It is now rapidly unfolding, marking a new era in Japan's educational stance, which is worthy of admiration. The following will examine the specific meaning of the main measures of this time.

First, what most people pay attention to is the cessation of postponement of military service. In the past, postponement of conscription was regarded as a kind of privilege, which could not be without drawbacks, but this misconception has been eliminated in the fundamental idea of the reform of the school system that is currently underway. Moreover, the wrongness of it has been concretely clarified by the current measures.

Military Service and Students

The relationship between military service and student life is regulated based on the national education plan. How many people are needed in terms of military service, and how many students with what level of education are needed in terms of education, this is the result of setting the goal of the national personnel training plan. Therefore, those who go to war and those who remain in school are equally regulated according to the needs of the country.

Therefore, the immediate urgency of the liberal arts and law students to respond to the needs of the military is to meet the supreme demand for an increase in the number of soldiers required by the national army. On the one hand, from the perspective of education, majoring in liberal arts and law, which is the so-called study of cultivating oneself and harmonizing with others, at this time, temporarily interrupting student life and making them take up arms and go to the battlefield, is perhaps a true way to cultivate leadership talents.

Based on this national personnel training plan, the second measure following the cessation of the postponement of conscription is the preparation for the expansion of science and engineering schools and the cessation of university education in law and liberal arts. Furthermore, it developed into the third measure of reorganizing and unifying law and liberal arts universities and vocational schools. The biggest shortcoming in the current formal school system in Japan is the lack of a clear national plan for education. That is, the effort to establish an education plan suitable for the needs of the country was not paid attention to in previous education policies. As a result, what about the leadership talents being trained? Universities and higher vocational schools cannot fully adapt to the realistic demands of the country. The drawbacks are most prominent in the education of private universities.

According to a recent survey by the Ministry of Education, in Showa 17 (1942), there were 21 public universities and 27 private universities. There were 40 public vocational schools and 117 private vocational schools. Private schools also have a larger number of students, and from a statistical point of view, they occupy a dominant position. The majority of those many private schools were originally in the era of law schools, and up until the time of the free economy in past years, the state centered on law and liberal arts, expanded, and continues to exist to this day. Now that the country urgently requires the training of science and engineering students, in terms of management, private schools naturally cannot be as easy to implement as public schools. According to a survey by the Ministry of Education of the number of students entering in Showa 17 (1942), public universities in law and liberal arts were 44%, higher vocational schools were 28%, science and engineering universities were 56%, higher vocational schools were 72%, while in private schools, law and liberal arts universities were 85%, higher vocational schools were 77%, science and engineering universities were 15%, higher vocational schools were 23%.

Educational Waste

The Ministry of Education often declares that the current ideal plan is a ratio of 3 for law and liberal arts and 7 for science and engineering, but the current situation is obviously far from this ideal. This is a major waste in education. The country's expectations for every young student are extremely high, and under a planned economy, in order to establish a plan to train national personnel, it is not only necessary to drastically reorganize these schools as soon as possible, but the expenses of the lecturers and other teachers of these private schools mostly rely on government agencies, so from the perspective of management, they cannot solve the problem of concentrating in cities themselves. Currently, out of the 27 private universities, 19 are in Tokyo, 7 are in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe. Out of the 117 vocational schools, 69 are in Tokyo, 26 are in Kyoto, Osaka, and Kobe, almost all concentrated in cities. From the perspective of defending the country, this fact must also be taken into consideration.

Regarding the reorganization of schools, the first thing to pay attention to is the correction of the overemphasis on liberal arts and the rational dispersal of school buildings in terms of air defense measures. At the same time, each school is required to examine its own content at this time and eliminate the drawbacks of the school system and the excessive number of schools.

In addition to the above, what is noteworthy about the current measures is the postponement of the eight-year compulsory education system. At first glance, this move seems to have a negative meaning in education, but the current higher course of the national school continues only because it has not implemented a compulsory system. In the regular course, it leaves the national school, and men have the obligation to enter the ordinary course of all youth schools. If combined with the reform of youth school education, the educational effect will not become a problem. (Xiang: Taken from the Western Asahi Shimbun on September 28)

### U.S. House of Representatives Holds Closed Meeting; Military Officials Report on the War Situation; Warn Americans Not to Be Overly Optimistic

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall and others attended a closed meeting of the House of Representatives on the 21st and strongly stated to about 400 members of Congress that the course of the war should not be viewed with optimism. The Associated Press Washington telegram reported on the content of this closed meeting as follows: Chief of Staff General Marshall gave a general strategic report for about 40 minutes, followed by Brigadier General Adlesteen's report on bombing operations on German soil. Secretary of the Army Stimson also expressed his views. He strongly emphasized the severity of the evolution of the war situation since Pearl Harbor, and hoped that the actual situation of the war would be conveyed to the people to warn them against excessive optimism. In addition, the Associated Press cited five points of the military authorities' report as follows:

Japanese Strength Should Not Be Underestimated

Although the U.S. Pacific front has obtained air force bases for operations against the Japanese army, the Allied forces are still unable to defend these bases because the Japanese army has very powerful troops stationed in nearby locations. It is a misconception to say that the German Air Force has weakened because the German Air Force has recently made large-scale movements. The current state of the German Air Force is actually to cultivate its air force strength for future operations. Japanese war industry aircraft production more than makes up for its air force losses. The problem of insufficient manpower only exists in the United States. Japan is still mobilizing young men aged 17 to 20, so Japan has almost no problem of insufficient manpower. British and American merchant fleets have suffered heavy losses due to the activity of Axis submarines, and even more fleets have been lost in landing operations, so the transportation problem is indeed an important problem for the Allies. Aircraft have not yet reached the level where they can replace ships for transportation.

The Soviet Union Does Not Understand Two-Front Tactics

Lisbon, 22nd

(Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch: U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall said in a closed meeting of Congress that the Soviet Union's repeated requests to open a second front in Europe clearly show that they do not understand the technical problems of two-front strategy. The Soviet Union underestimates the difficulties of such military actions, while British and American soldiers have gained difficult experience in the battles of North Africa, Sicily, Italy, and the Pacific.

Marshall to Be Transferred to New Post

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Washington dispatch, Roosevelt held a long discussion at the White House on the 21st with Chief of Staff General Marshall and his personal Chief of Staff Admiral Leahy. The Washington Associated Press reported on the content of the report by the U.S. military representatives at the closed meeting of the House of Representatives, stating: In general, many criticized the past U.S. government for not reporting the true situation of the war to the people, resulting in an overly optimistic atmosphere in the country. This time, the U.S. military representatives reported the true situation of the war at the closed meeting, and members of the House of Representatives have realized that they must be determined to launch more intense battles in the future. Roosevelt held discussions with Marshall and others after the start of the Moscow Conference. This may be the result of the Soviet Union making major demands on Allied strategy. It is also rumored that Roosevelt may recently appoint Marshall as the Supreme Commander of the Allied forces in Europe, hence this discussion.

### Americans Believe the War Will Be Protracted

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The British "New Leader Weekly" published a statement by Vice Admiral Horne, Acting Secretary of Naval Operations of the U.S. Navy, stating that people in both Britain and the United States have the question of how long the war will last. Horne's opinion is that even with efforts to increase the production of military supplies and ships, the war will last until at least 1949. The weekly also stated that it is useful to carefully read the economic newspapers in New York, as they want the war to be prolonged. A U.S. newspaper ran a headline saying "The legend of peace has been destroyed," leading to a drop in cotton textile stocks. Cotton textile merchants even wrote a poem to satirize it.

### Churchill and Smuts Dine with the King

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to news from London: King George VI dined at 10 Downing Street on Wednesday evening with Prime Minister Churchill and South African Prime Minister Smuts.

### Veteran British Admiral Pound Passes Away

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London dispatch: Admiral of the Fleet Sir Dudley Pound, former First Sea Lord, passed away on the 21st due to illness, at the age of sixty-six. Admiral Pound was the most experienced figure in the British Navy. He served as First Sea Lord for five years, and only resigned last August, replaced by Cunningham.

### Allied Ships Lost in the Middle of the Month Total Forty-Nine

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German military authorities announced the following on the 21st regarding the battle results of German submarines and the air force: Since October 1st, German submarines have sunk 33 Allied ships, totaling 227,000 tons, of which about half were sunk in the Mediterranean Sea. The others were sunk in the Atlantic Ocean. In early October, German air force squadrons attacked Allied convoys off the coast of North Africa, sinking 16 ships, totaling 130,000 tons.

### Stalin Receives British Foreign Secretary Eden; Hull and Molotov Hold Earnest Talks

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Moscow dispatch: Chairman Stalin received British Foreign Secretary Eden on the 21st, and People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov held talks with U.S. Secretary of State Hull.

Situation on the Third Day of the Moscow Conference

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a London report: British and American journalists stationed in Moscow said that the third day of the Moscow Tripartite Conference had made satisfactory progress in the eyes of British and American representatives, but the reporters did not indicate whether the Soviet Union also felt satisfied with the results of the third day of the conference. Many military experts also participated in the discussions at the conference on this day, and the meeting adjourned early because U.S. Secretary of State Hull felt deeply fatigued and unable to continue the discussion. Reuters correspondent in Moscow, Mr. King, reported that the Soviet side insisted that the discussion of military issues should be listed as the first priority on the agenda, and the British and American delegations seemed to have put pressure on the Soviet side on this point. What's more, upon hearing the discussion that South African Prime Minister Smuts said that the Second Front could not be established this year, Moscow was greatly disappointed. Although British and American reporters in Moscow hinted that there were differences between the Soviet Union and the British and American delegations on military issues, they repeatedly stated that this conference could take a coordinated approach and hoped to obtain concrete results. However, the reports from the British and American sides never mentioned the planned meeting of the three - Churchill, Roosevelt, and Stalin.

Stockholm, 22nd (Huitong News Agency) - The London Daily Herald reported that the Moscow Conference can be compared to a futuristic painting. We can place some hope in Eden, who declared that the Tripartite Conference will end the war earlier.

Lisbon, 22nd (Huitong News Agency) - The Washington Post reported that the main task of the Moscow Conference is not to reach a consensus on any specific issues, but to adjust the future relations between the three countries. Once an understanding is reached, individual issues will be resolved by Stalin, Churchill, and Roosevelt. If no agreement is reached in principle, there is no need to raise other issues. The success or failure of this conference can be determined by whether the three leaders hold a meeting thereafter.

### British and American Air Forces Attack Serbia, and Aircraft Drop Bombs on Bulgaria

Belgrade, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - On Wednesday at noon, British and American air forces bombed the town of Nis in southern Serbia, causing great damage to private residential areas, with heavy civilian casualties. Two hundred bodies have now been found in the rubble, and hundreds of Serbs have been injured. When a bomb directly hit an air-raid shelter, all the people who were taking refuge there were killed. British and American airmen also subjected civilians to cruel machine-gun fire. Immediately after the air raid, civil authorities patrolled and provided appropriate assistance to the victims.

Sofia, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Bulgarian Army General Staff announced that enemy aircraft flew over Bulgarian territory yesterday and dropped several bombs on Skopje, causing slight damage there.

Failed Attack on Germany Results in Losses

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency report: British bombers that entered central and northern Germany on the night before Thursday failed to carry out a concentrated attack due to the counterattack of German air defense forces. At that time, the weather in Germany was bad, and most of the enemy aircraft were forced to fly at high altitude. German night fighter squadrons and anti-aircraft guns broke up the British aircraft into small groups, and then shot down eighteen of their four-engine aircraft. In addition, eight U.S. bombers were shot down within German borders on Wednesday afternoon, so the total number of four-engine Allied aircraft lost in German territory has reached twenty-six. This number may increase after a detailed report is obtained.

Unprecedented Devastation of Churches in Italy

Rome, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to an initial estimate by technical experts from Vatican City: As a result of British and American air raids, the total value of church property losses in Italy is 10,000,000,000,000 lire. In addition to churches, monasteries, and other religious buildings being destroyed, the loss of art treasures stolen and damaged by the British and Americans in Sicily and southern Italy is still difficult to estimate.

### Javanese Vigilance Corps Cadets Enlist

Jakarta, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The enlistment ceremony for the officer cadets of the Javanese Vigilance Corps was held grandly at the unit training ground at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th, under the supervision of the Japanese Supreme Commander and military administration. Some of the enlisted cadets were outstanding young men selected from 100,000 volunteers from the entire island. The Supreme Commander instructed the students on the spot, saying: At this time when the war is in full swing, the responsibilities of you young men who intend to defend your homeland are extremely important.

### Construction of a Trans-Thailand-Vietnam Railway Line

Hanoi, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - Japanese railway technicians are currently surveying existing routes and preparing to lay new lines in various locations for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Transverse Railway, which will run directly from Tokyo to Syonan or Rangoon. Some construction work has already begun on the new lines. Recently, the most active survey team in Vietnam has been meticulously surveying a 2,700-kilometer route from Rangoon, through Hanoi, to Saigon, working in forested areas. A concrete plan has been formulated and submitted to the central authorities. According to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere Transverse Railway construction plan, the route will run from Korea through North China, traverse the Chinese mainland, and continue south through Hanoi to Bangkok. Currently, railway connections in Vietnam are limited, as the Vietnamese Transverse Railway terminates in Saigon, and the connection between Saigon and Bangkok is by automobile. Therefore, the purpose of laying the new line is to connect this section. After surveying various routes, it was determined that a line from Tapou, 300 kilometers south of Hanoi, through the Lao border at Kek, and south to Bangkok, would be about 100 kilometers shorter than the previous route. The opinion to lay this line has become almost unanimous. This Trans-Thailand-Vietnam line, with a length of 400 kilometers between Hanoi and Bangkok, is half the distance of the 3,500-kilometer route from Hanoi through Saigon to Bangkok. The construction is also easier than the Saigon-Bangkok line. In the future, once opened, goods can be transported between Vietnam, Burma, and Malaya without the need for ships, which is of great military value. Therefore, the public is greatly anticipating the start of the project.

### Evidence in Prosecuted Cases Must be Submitted with Case Files

The Shanghai Local Prosecutor's Office, noting that important evidence in prosecuted cases, such as injury reports, autopsy reports, and other evidence necessary for trials, were not being submitted to the Shanghai Local Court along with the prosecution files, was causing delays in case hearings. Judges were having to issue orders to retrieve the files, which was cumbersome and delayed the proceedings. Therefore, the Prosecutor's Office has ordered all its subordinate officials to pay close attention to this matter in the future and avoid negligence.

### Materials Investigation Committee Holds Meeting, Passes Award Measures for Confiscated Hoarded Materials

It is reported that the committee will expand its scope to investigate the hoarding of all essential goods and military supplies.

### Grain Control Committee District Offices to be Established by Deadline, Commence Work by 25th

(Central News Agency dispatch) The Rice and Grain Control Committee, in order to actively promote and implement the collection and unified distribution of rice and grain in accordance with the established guidelines, convened a discussion meeting with the heads of local district offices. The meeting continued yesterday (22nd) at 3:00 PM. Attending were committee members Yuan Hongdeng, Guangye Junyi, and Chen Guoquan, as well as Secretary-General Zhou Shenyu, the heads of the investigative offices and finance departments, and the heads of the local offices. Director Yuan instructed the local district offices on how to proceed with the work and set a deadline of the 25th for the establishment of the offices and the commencement of rice and grain procurement work.

District Office Organization Law

The Rice and Grain Control Committee, under the chairmanship of Director Yuan, continued to convene a joint meeting of the heads of local district offices. The matters discussed the previous day were further debated. Regarding the organization of the local district offices, in addition to the heads, there will be three sections: General Affairs, Operations, and Finance.

General Affairs Section

This section is responsible for drafting, receiving, dispatching, translating, and storing documents; maintaining the official seal; signing and reporting contracts for the purchase and sale of rice and grain; purchasing and recording rice and grain; investigating, coordinating, and reporting on the transportation of rice and grain; planning for increased rice and grain production; and registering and investigating rice merchants. Investigating the qualifications of rice procurement merchants also falls within the scope of this section's responsibilities.

Operations Section

This section is responsible for issuing rice and grain procurement permits and applying for transportation permits; evaluating the price of rice and grain purchased and applying for and approving loans; inspecting and protecting rice and grain; inspecting and weighing rice and grain; processing and storing rice and grain; packaging and transporting rice and grain; collecting and gathering rice and grain; directing and supervising the rice and grain procurement trade association; reporting on the daily transportation, storage, distribution, and price adjustments of rice and grain; inspecting the distribution of rice and grain; and storing rice bags and insuring rice warehouses.

Finance Section

This section is responsible for the receipt and payment of funds for the purchase and sale of rice and grain, as well as the management of these funds; reviewing and approving loan applications from rice procurement merchants; storing and allocating funds for the purchase of rice and grain; compiling and reporting on receipts, payments, and statistics; and preparing budgets and final accounts, as well as approving and reimbursing various expenses. The heads of the above three sections are appointed by the director to manage their respective affairs. However, the responsibilities of the Finance Section are independent, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee should directly supervise them. The local district offices should be formally established immediately after the heads assume their positions and begin procurement work.

### Application for Brown Sugar by Pregnant Women Under Consideration

The Shanghai Bay Merchant Cooperative, due to its own sugar reserves being exhausted and its responsibility to allocate sugar in the city, has repeatedly requested the allocation from the sugar distribution association to meet the needs. According to the person in charge of the Cooperative, the 8th-term household sugar has been requested from the military distribution authorities and will be released soon. Once the procedures are completed, the sale will be scheduled. It was also mentioned that pregnant women have requested brown sugar from the Cooperative. Out of consideration, the Cooperative intended to issue sugar coupons to them. However, to prevent overcrowding and potential incidents caused by non-pregnant women hearing the news, an announcement was made to suspend the issuance. As for applying by letter, it is difficult to verify and prone to abuse, so a proper method is being considered. Therefore, the matter is under consideration. Yesterday's report stating that applications could be submitted by special letter is not accurate.

### Soap and Matches Allowed to Supplement Registration, Justify Legitimate Reasons

The registration for soap and matches, along with other daily necessities, closed on the 19th. Failure to register by the deadline will result in confiscation without leniency. However, if a valid reason is provided, such as the holder returning to their hometown, continued registration will be allowed.

Sales Permitted After Registration

After registration, sales and transfers are still permitted. However, the quantity sold and the transfer details must be reported in writing to the original registration office weekly in order to clarify the quantity of goods in stock. According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, soap and matches will continue to be supplied and allocated by the manufacturers in the future. The raw materials for matches and soap are currently abundant, and the supply is steady, so there is no shortage. After the implementation of allocation, the selling price will inevitably decrease.

Retail Shops Sign Contracts

(Central News Agency dispatch) The plan for the distribution of soap and matches based on household registration in the first and eighth districts of the city has been finalized and is being actively implemented. Sales are expected to begin in early November. 397 retail shops have been designated, divided into two categories: A and B. Category A shops must pay a security deposit of 15,000 yuan, while Category B shops must pay a security deposit of 10,000 yuan. Over 200 shops are in Category A, and over 100 are in Category B. The district offices have issued notification slips instructing them to pay the deposits by a specific date and sign the contracts yesterday. The provisions of the contracts are quite strict. Retail shops may only sell allocated soap and matches and may not sell other soap and matches to prevent abuses. The contracts are generally the same as those for household rice retailers.

City Primary School Teachers Petition the Finance Bureau, Director Yuan Responds Sincerely

Teachers from public primary schools in this city, having previously petitioned the city government and the Education Bureau to increase living expenses due to their excessively low salaries, yesterday submitted a petition to the Finance Bureau. Director Yuan received them and listened to the requests for inclusion of family stipends, increased office expenses and other issues. He responded that the exact amount of the increase could not be given because a precise calculation was still being jointly performed by the Education Bureau, but it could be assured that the treatment of the primary school staff would definitely be higher than the average salary of private schools, in order to be reasonable. The representatives, satisfied with Director Yuan's urgent response, expressed their satisfaction and will revisit the Finance Bureau next Wednesday (27th) to inquire about the increased amount, in order to bring the petition to a conclusion.

### Charity Carnival, Donations Collected Yesterday

The charity carnival collected donations through this newspaper yesterday. The list is as follows: Wang Yuanchun 5,000 yuan, Zhang Deyou 3,000 yuan, Shen Tongji 2,200 yuan, Bank of China, Wing On Textile Company, Tongji Printing and Dyeing Company, and Zaifu Bao 1,000 yuan each, Wu Li Hou, Huang Yongqing, Chen Zanmin, Yao Mulian, Hong Jiaying, Xu Zhenshu, Chen Qize, Han Zhiming, and Zheng Xuegao 800 yuan each, China Enterprise Bank, Zhu Mintang, Xi Han, He Yu, Wang Ziguan, and Lin Zhuzhi 500 yuan each, Zhang Weirou, Shen Changshi, Rao Shaoshu, Zhai Jigang, Mrs. Xi Sha Jiu, Zheng Zhi Yuan, Sun Fuji, Wu Delin, Xu Tuhao, Xinxue Printing and Dyeing Factory, Shu Zhaoxian, Yue Jingcheng, Yong An Insurance Company, Sun Bojun, Zhou Jingchu, Wang Baoquan, You Jusun, He Zhongliu, Wang Yiqing, Wang Miandai, Xu Wenxiong, Chen Derong, Zheng Jiji, Mrs. Rong, Shao Shuzhong, Wu Bozeng, and Lao Jingyou 400 yuan each, Zhang Boxiang, Xi Sha Bu, Wang Yisun, Zhou Kangheng, Liu Jiangang, Wu Yulin, Cha Tingfang, Wu Bonian, Shen Yanmou, Xu Jingren, Chen Zhanchun, Pan Shuangshi, Chen Peidong, Chen Junyi, Tong Shishi, Tang Xingzai, Yong Qing Insurance Branch, Huang Siying, Chen Huihuai, Hu Fengzi, Bao Jiezhou, Sheng Jianfu, Jia Youkun, Shi Jiumao, Zhou Xinian, Zhu Hebi, Xu Yunru, China Milk Powder Factory, Xu Shichang, Liu Tongjia, Xu Shizhang, Xu Zhensheng, Tong Kuixuan, Cheng Nianshu, Hu Boying, Hu Kequan, Wan Jiaqing, Yang Yuanlong, Wang Zihou, Lin Baosheng, Lin Zhenbin, Pu Zhisheng, Cha Songfu, Zhu Mintang, Wu Wende, Shi Naichi, and Yao Qingde 200 yuan each, Qin Shaoxian, Bian Runqing, and Hua Weiqi 100 yuan each, and Zhang Rucheng 50 yuan. The total received was 44,950 yuan, which, combined with the 356,670 yuan received on the previous day, totals 401,620 yuan in Reserve Certificates.

### Coal Briquette Merchants' Illegal Attempts Rejected by Authorities, Price Limits to be Maintained

According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the authorities are still actively investigating coal briquettes. Retailers found to be violating the set prices will not be shown any leniency and will be strictly investigated according to the law. However, according to a spokesperson for the Coal Briquette Association, the daily supply of coal briquettes from the various manufacturing plants belonging to the association is sufficient to meet the daily market demand. However, small vendors claimed yesterday that the daily supply of coal briquettes from the mechanized coal briquette factories is at most one ton and at least several dan, which is far from meeting the demand. At the same time, according to another source, manufacturers and small vendors have recently made illegal attempts, which the authorities have rejected. Given that the control system has shown some effect and prices of many goods are gradually declining, and that coal briquettes are an indispensable daily necessity for both rich and poor residents, the standard price should be maintained persistently. Officials from the Coal Briquette Association are guiding members to increase production and find ways to adjust market conditions or assist in investigating the inside story. Relevant authorities have earnestly advised coal briquette merchants not to engage in black market transactions in order to protect people's livelihoods. They have also urged the strengthening and adjustment of coal industry organizations to prevent the allocation of coal from being manipulated or monopolized. The Small Vendor Association has drafted a petition based on the resolutions of the previous members' representative meeting and will submit it to the authorities for approval in the coming days.

### Eighth District Hotels Ordered to Report Guests Daily

The Eighth District Hotel Trade Association office received an order from the Special Police Division of the Third Police Bureau instructing all members to submit daily guest reports, which will be compiled by the Hotel Trade Association office and submitted to the Special High Section for review. Over 100 hotels are complying with the order, but there are still 80 hotels that have not. The director of the Hotel Trade Association office, Ding Sheng, concerned that members would be penalized, plans to investigate the matter through the offices of each Baojia district.

### First Police Bureau Baojia Department Reorganizes Personnel, Announces List of Senior Officials

Rice Merchants Adulterating and Distributing Inferior Flour, Powder Wheat Special Committee Investigates and Punishes Hefeng Yong Rice Shop for Swapping and Selling Flour

(Central News Agency dispatch) The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, in order to meet the needs of the people's food supply, has allocated top-grade white flour for the 50th period of household rations in the first and eighth districts. However, the Committee, aware that the household flour purchased by the people is sometimes adulterated, has announced that if any retail rice shop adulterates and distributes inferior flour, the household head who purchased it can report to the Committee at No. 2 Beijing Road, 3rd floor, so that the matter can be investigated and punished. It is reported that the Committee received a report yesterday from a citizen that the household flour distributed by Hefeng Yong Rice Shop (ration number 311) at No. 311-313 Ai'erjin Road, North Shanxi Road, was all second-grade flour. After receiving the report, the Committee immediately dispatched personnel to investigate the reported rice shop with the citizen who provided the flour sample. The investigation confirmed the report, and it was discovered that the rice shop had more than 20 bags of second-grade flour in stock. In this situation, the rice shop is not only harming the people's livelihood but also violating the government's ration system policy. In addition to reporting the matter to the Economic Affairs Division of the First District Office to dispatch personnel to thoroughly investigate the matter, cancel the business license, and not grant ration rights, the Committee will continue to conduct secret investigations. If similar situations are discovered, they will be severely punished in order to deter unscrupulous merchants.

### Mr. Zhang Peishen's Mother's Birthday Celebration Funds of 10,000 Yuan Donated to Scholarship Fund

Today is the 70th birthday of Mr. Zhang Peishen's mother. Mr. Zhang, following his mother's instructions, donated 10,000 yuan from the celebration funds to this newspaper's reader scholarship fund.

### Rationed Grain Distribution in Nanshi Readjusted

The Shanghai Grain Bureau has drastically increased the population in the Nanshi District and reorganized the allocation of rationed grain households and public grain offices. It has also finalized methods for filling out and distributing household ration certificates.

A public notice has been issued. The number of households for each public grain office has been reallocated, and the issuance of rice purchase certificates has been set to be completed within five days.

### Reporter's Cup Soccer Game, Overseas Chinese Win over Friendship, 3-2, 3-0 in First Half

The soccer game held yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM at the Yifu Stadium by the Shanghai News Reporters Association to raise welfare funds was a grand event. Mayor Chen specially sent Propaganda Director Liang Xiuyu to preside over the opening ceremony. The director of the City Chamber of Commerce, Yuan Hongdeng, specially sent Secretary Cheng Zhiliang to preside over the awards ceremony. No less than several thousand spectators attended, and the atmosphere was unprecedentedly warm and lively. The right to purchase the first two balls was purchased by the daughter of the owner of Yuqing, and the daughter of Mr. Xie Jialin, the owner of Dingda Ironworks, each spending 50,000 yuan. Their enthusiasm for this association's welfare work is admirable. As a result of the soccer match, Overseas Chinese won over Friendship by one goal, 3-2. Overseas Chinese led 3-0 in the first half.

Overseas Chinese Cut Through Three Defenses

After the Director of General Affairs presided over the closing ball ceremony, Overseas Chinese began to attack. At the five-minute mark, Fu En of the Foreign Affairs Bureau shot fiercely from the penalty spot. Xian Han could not save it in time, and the ball landed in the goal, making it 1-0. Overseas Chinese gave Friendship a warning. Friendship counterattacked, but the ball was unlucky and did not succeed. At the twenty-five-minute mark, Ru Lian of the Foreign Affairs Bureau broke through and shot powerfully again. Liu Xian Han was caught off guard and conceded another goal. 2-0. Friendship attempted to help others in need, but all was unsuccessful by tiny margins. At the thirty-five-minute mark, two people: Yipo Lihote and Pan Tuosun. flew left and right. At the 20-yard point in front of the Friendship goal, Pan Tuosun hooked and sent the ball to Sa Zhaijiang, who shot obliquely and scored again, 3-0. Overseas Chinese had a three-goal lead. At this point, Ping Yichen of Friendship used all his strength to break through single-handedly but failed. A'kui also made several wonderful aerial shots, but the ball was unlucky. Overseas Chinese led 3-0 in the first half.

Friendship Recaptures Two Cities

After the second half, the army was at war again. Friendship wanted to wash away the previous humiliation, made great changes in military appearance, and strengthened the forward offensive. Wu Qixiang took the post of left winger, A'kui changed to left forward, Zhao Peng retreated to left midfielder, Yongfu was transferred to the right, and Yingquan filled the right back. The military appearance was greatly enhanced, and Overseas Chinese also adjusted their general positions, with Nafuke replacing Huoli Huote and Xue Erfo replacing Yishao Shan. Both teams were in high spirits. Friendship attacked, the momentum was amazing, but the ball was still unlucky. Yi Chen's powerful shot went out to the right post, and A' Kui's wonderful temporary hook was caught squarely by Zhili Manhou. At around the 20-minute mark, Xiao Feibianjiang went straight in, and when he was near the goal, Overseas Chinese Xu Erz grabbed the ball anxiously, touching the game ball. A penalty of 12 yards was awarded, and Song Lingsheng took the penalty and went straight into the lower left corner. Friendship opened the record. Overseas Chinese had an atmosphere of revitalization. Minutes later, Xiao Gao raised his foot to hit the ball hard. Xu Erz arrived in time, and Pan Li Man rushed out at the same time and was blocked. Li Yichen came flying from the sky and added a kick, hitting the empty goal. 3-2, Friendship's situation improved. Afterwards, Man Tan tried to create another record, but time waited for no one, and in the end, they lost by one goal, 3-2.

### Japanese Army Spokesman Talks About Burma Counter-Offensive Operations

Central News Agency Dispatch: The spokesman for the Japanese Army Press Department, at yesterday's regular press conference, made a statement on the Allied counter-offensive operations in Burma against the Axis forces, saying: Currently, the Allied forces seem eager to attempt a counter-offensive in Burma. In early summer this year, the Allied forces attempted to retake Nichi-kei (likely referring to a battle), launching a counter-offensive operation, but ultimately failed. This had a particularly profound impact on the Allied nations, especially the Chongqing side. The Indian people's contempt for the British has also deepened as a result, and the Indian independence movement has become increasingly prominent.

Mountbatten Arrives in India

Capturing Burma and reopening the Burma Road is a must, both for reasons of prestige and for the continuation of anti-Japanese counter-offensive operations in the future. Since Lieutenant General Mountbatten, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Forces in Southeast Asia, arrived in New Delhi on the 7th of this month, the tone of Chongqing's discussion of a counter-offensive in Burma has become lively, and they have frequently expressed their desire to devote themselves to it. It is said that Mountbatten arrived in Chongqing on the 16th with political advisor Sir Gaiswick and others, and has repeatedly met with Chiang Kai-shek at the Chiang Kai-shek Villa since the 18th, until he left Chongqing and returned to his post on the 21st. At that time, he explained to Chiang the Asian counter-offensive operation plan decided at the New Delhi conference, and strongly demanded that the Chongqing army make the greatest sacrifices, which goes without saying. Whether the Chongqing side's dissatisfaction with the command authority and operational policies of the Southeast Asia Command has been eased in this meeting remains unknown.

Chongqing Newspaper Commentary

According to the Chongqing Ta Kung Pao on the 18th, "Learning from the lessons of the previous Nichi-kei battle, the operation to retake Burma cannot rely solely on land operations, but must launch a landing operation on the Kra Isthmus and the Malay Peninsula at the same time." In addition, the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission's official newspaper, the Saodang Pao, stated on the 19th that "to comprehensively adjust the East Asian counter-offensive operations, it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road first. The reason is that attacking Singapore is difficult. In order to comprehensively adjust the Southeast Asian operations, it is necessary to restrain the Japanese army in China, so it is necessary to reopen the Burma Road first to ensure the supply of the Chongqing army." The Ta Kung Pao strongly advocates a multifaceted operation, while the Saodang Pao consistently emphasizes Burma Firstism. This difference in opinion was already fully exposed at the Beivenquan Conference held in early September.

Internal Opinions

The divergence of opinions within Chongqing provides clear evidence of this. The highest military authorities in Chongqing are now organizing the Burma Expeditionary Force, with the commander of the Sixth War Area, Chen Cheng, serving as the commander, looking for opportunities to counter-attack Burma. It is said that the Expeditionary Force consists of Du Xiaoming's Fifth Army Group, Song Xilian's Eleventh Army Group, and the Ninth Army Group formed later. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Burma, aware of the Chongqing army's intentions, suddenly launched an offensive from Mangshi, Longling, and Tengchong in Yunnan province in early October, immediately surrounding the 15,000 troops of Song Wuyue's 36th Division, who were entrenched in fortified positions in the northern mountainous area at the eastern end of the Yunnan-Burma Road, attempting to put up a stubborn resistance, and launching a fierce battle.

Break into the Nujiang River

On the 17th, they suddenly broke into the Nujiang River and crossed the Suichaiba. The Japanese troops quickly pursued the fleeing Chongqing army and continued to advance northward into the Zhichuan River Valley. Liang Jiacao, the Minister of Propaganda for Chongqing, expressed extremely pessimistic remarks when he met with reporters on the 20th, stating that the Japanese side had "strengthened the Japanese army's forces stationed in Burma and western Yunnan, attempting to attack China or India, but as of now, the Japanese army has not yet reached the easternmost part of the Nujiang River." The Allied forces attempted to launch operations on the Indian-Burmese border and simultaneously launch operations in Yunnan to disperse the Japanese forces, but before the war had even unfolded, the Chongqing army had already lost a key position, casting a major shadow over their future operations. The embarrassment of the Chongqing side is all the more imaginable.

### Minister Hirota Talks About the Indian Question

Central News Agency Dispatch: At a joint reception held by the Japanese Propaganda Bureau, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Japanese Embassy, yesterday (22nd) made the following statement to our Chinese press corps (regarding the Indian question): "Yesterday, October 21st, Jiang Tela Boss took office as the head of the Provisional Government of India in Showan. From the perspective of a Japanese person, I consider this a respectable and gratifying event."

Indian Culture

For hundreds of years, India has been invaded by the Mughal, Portuguese, and British empires, and has continued to live under constant oppression. For thousands of years, it has possessed a high level of culture in philosophy, religion, and art. Even now, the Indian people still have a high level of understanding of this culture. As for those who do not understand modern Indian culture, it must be the result of British propaganda, which completely prevents them from understanding the essence of Indian culture. In the last three hundred years, although India has been under the rule of various countries, it has emerged with its own cultural awareness as the basis, seeking its own independence, restoring its political power, and fulfilling the long-cherished wishes of the 350 million people of India. Regarding the establishment of a unified Provisional Government of India, from the perspective of the revival of East Asian nations, it is a very great force, and in terms of the development of East Asian nations and the cultural exchange of East Asia, it is a great opportunity.

Special Significance

Regarding the establishment of the Provisional Government of India, based on my speculation, it contains several special meanings, which are described as follows: First, the establishment of this Indian government is the first unified government in Indian history. Second, the independence lost four hundred years ago has been restored today, four hundred years later. Third, this independence is a fact that the East Asian nations themselves can achieve through their own efforts. The work of Jiang Tela Boss has been specially assisted by various parties, which is a fact that we should not forget. After India's independence, counting the independent countries in East Asia, the countries that have become independent since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War include Burma, the Philippines, and India. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there were already four countries: China, Japan, Manchukuo, and Thailand. If these seven countries unite in the future, they will be able to defeat the Allied forces. Regarding the Provisional Government of India, using its own army composed of unified Indians to participate in the war, I think it has special significance in the independence of India. Therefore, it goes without saying that we should make every effort to assist in the independence of the Indian nation, which is our responsibility.

Economic Circle Comments

### Encouraging National Savings

The economist's theory of abstinence is an extremely valuable theory in economic thought. It is believed that abstinence has a close relationship with the formation of capital. The formation of capital must be partly due to capitalists restraining their present enjoyment and partly due to citizens abstaining from other uses of unproductive things. This principle is the same as the sacrifice of labor for the enjoyment and unproductive consumption. All are obstacles to the source of restraint. Therefore, we feel that the current campaign to encourage national selection is in line with the economist's theory of abstinence.

Encouraging national preparation can realize the currency returned by the government’s position, and the people’s position is enough to save costs. It cannot be said that it is the most meaningful movement under the wartime system. Therefore, since the issuance of special savings bonds in early July this year and the regular prize-winning savings held at the end of September have been a test to encourage national savings, from the latter, there has been a National Savings Week held in Beijing recently; All the firms in Beijing are currently busy collecting money, and according to general speculation, the savings results should not be less than those mentioned above. In addition, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu will also promote them separately. From this point of view, encouraging national savings has formed a common movement that is consistent with the country.

Originally, saving is thrift, and thrift can save. Now, the two movements of encouraging savings and promoting thrift are running side by side without contradicting each other, and they are echoing each other. Isn’t the true meaning of this still to persuade wartime people to restrain personal desires, save part of their consumption, and contribute to the increase of production? The comprehension of this meaning has gradually spread to all strata of society. Therefore, the café and dance hall industries, which have always advocated non-thrift, actually held a seminar yesterday to discuss the issue of thrift!

### Sugar Industry Special Committee Prepares to Form a Joint Association Will Be Announced in the Short Term

Regarding the transportation, distribution, and supply of sugar, Shanghai has been fully responsible for this matter since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War through the "Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office." Up to now, the stock of sugar in the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is 200,000 bags, which will be distributed. After the Business Coordination Committee set up a Sugar Industry Professional Committee, the existing sugar industry organizations should be reformed. Now, the Sugar Industry Professional Committee of the Business Coordination Committee is considering preparing to form the "Shanghai Sugar Wholesale Joint Association." This joint association will be announced and established in the short term. As for the lower-level organizations of the joint association in the future, they will be members of the Shanghai Sugar Industry Association, and members of the sugar industry associations in various inland areas will also organize similar organizations.

### General Situation of Miscellaneous Grain Production in Central China This Year

Recently, according to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired with officials in charge of miscellaneous grains, a summary report on the production situation of various account crops in the Central China region this year is as follows:

Soybean

Soybean production is centered in Bengbu. Last year, 200,000 bags (100 kg per bag) were transported. This year's harvest may reach this number. However, due to the recent rise in the Huai River, many embankments have been breached, which has had a significant impact on soybean exports, and the prospects are not optimistic.

Barley

The Huai River area is also an important barley production area. The harvest has also been affected by the Huai River disaster, similar to soybeans. However, generally speaking, the situation in Central China is good, and it is possible to harvest between 40,000 and 50,000 tons.

Sorghum

This year's production in the triangular area is expected to be around 150,000 dan, Yangzhou and Taizhou about 50,000 dan, northern Anhui 50,000 dan, and other areas 50,000 dan.

### Chinese and Foreign Grocery Stores Resume Organization of Association

### Rice, Coal, and Smoke: Eradication of Impurities

Currently, every dan (unit of weight) of household rice contains a lot of sand and fine debris, especially in broken rice. It is reasonable for people to sell what they have after purchasing rice at the ticket price. However, the economic situation of the middle and lower-class residents is not affluent. They lack extra money to buy fine rice and also lack the leisure to carefully pick out the impurities in the rice. Most of them eat the rice with these impurities mixed in. I often think, does this practice of adding impurities harm the health of citizens?

A few days ago, in the "Social Services" section of this newspaper, I saw two reports about illness caused by eating sand. Therefore, it is already clear from the facts that impurities in household rice harm health. I heard that these impurities can not only cause inflammation of the tongue but also lead to various gastrointestinal diseases, hindering the body's digestive functions and causing great damage to health.

Since impurities in household rice are so harmful, it is of course best to find a way to remove them. Now, let's trace the origin and first explore the source of impurities in rice.

Rice originally has no impurities. Even if there are some occasionally in the market, there should not be so many. Undoubtedly, the impurities are not naturally mixed in the rice, but added by people. Household rice is allocated by the Changju Bureau. We think that the authorities, with the people as their foundation, would certainly not add such impurities to harm the people for the benefit of a few. Therefore, some people say that perhaps it is the rice merchants who add them. Generally, unscrupulous merchants often see profit and forget morality, disregarding others.

However, whether it is added by rice merchants or there are other reasons, since this substance is harmful to health, we must not ignore it any longer.

For the happiness of tens of millions of citizens in Shanghai, the author hopes with utmost sincerity that the authorities will promptly investigate the source of impurities in the rice and strictly eradicate them. I believe that the authorities care about the people and will not dismiss this suggestion lightly. (Jiang Yue)

Rice Grain Coupons

The previous report mentioned that rice grain coupons would be issued when the Rice Grain Bureau collects rice. The author humbly wishes to offer a few words, believing that those in charge of the Changju Bureau...

This time, the authorities have their own difficulties in preparing to issue rice grain coupons. However, in order to prevent rumors about the monetary system and for the sake of the farmers themselves, it seems that there are areas that should be paid attention to. No one ignores the rural economy; its motive power is very limited. In ancient times, people could barter, but now that currency is prevalent, how can farmers be expected to exchange their goods for those unfamiliar coupons? If so, currency in the countryside is just as fragmented as in the city. If rice grain coupons are used as the price for rice, then we must try our best to enhance its paralyzed nature, that is, rice grain coupons should lose their circulation. Then, rice grains will be hindered, and it is an unsurmountable hindrance. Because if rice grain coupons cannot circulate, or their circulation is weaker than currency, then even the poorest farmers will not give up the edible rice for non-circulating coupons (think about rice). Rice is the farmer's product, and it is the lifeline of the people. How can they easily throw it away and exchange it for a piece of paper coupon? If farmers refuse to sell rice, isn't that a major blow to the grain policy? May the Changju Bureau consider this. (Mang)

The Black Market for Coal Balls

Recently, the most difficult item to obtain in the market is coal balls. It is difficult to buy them even on the black market. If available, they must be pre-ordered, and you must wait two or three days. Moreover, the coal balls obtained are not really coal balls but like mud and stones, with no "fuel" value at all. If this continues, the citizens of the city will have a day of being unable to cook. Therefore, this matter has become urgent and brooks no delay.

However, the creation of this situation has a process. To the general public, it seems that the factory and retailers are the culprits, deliberately taking advantage of the situation to raise prices on the black market. Everyone knows the law, but they are not afraid to violate it. The formation of this mystery is not clear to ordinary people. Therefore, I would like to thoroughly analyze the rumors.

The main raw material of the manufacturing factory is smokeless coal dust, allocated by the authorities, with a price of about 300 yuan per ton. The mixed mud and debris purchased by themselves are also worth dozens of yuan. Adding the manufacturing cost of 200 yuan, the total cost is 500 yuan. The authorities allow a profit of 50 yuan, so the ex-factory price is 550 yuan per ton. This price has been the official manufacturing price set by the authorities for the first half of the year to date. The price of the main raw material allocation has also never been increased by the authorities. Unexpectedly, recently the factory's expenses have become huge due to the difficulty of purchasing things, especially the daily machine wear and tear costs are particularly high, but the profits have not increased. Therefore, income cannot cover expenses, and it is difficult to maintain operations. Later, the factory once asked the authorities to raise the price limit, but it was rejected because the reasons were not sufficient. The factory then wanted to increase the retailers' cartage fees, from 20 yuan per ton to 60 yuan, but was rejected by the authorities. The factory became angry and retaliated, reducing production, using the excuse of maintenance shutdowns, and increasing debris, etc., as indirect resistance. They also secretly engaged in black market transactions, reaching more than 800 yuan per ton, thus creating the current black market.

Secondly, let's discuss the situation of retailers. Retailers' coal balls are of course purchased from the factory. The wholesale price has always been 550 yuan per ton, plus 20 yuan for cartage. The price limit set by the authorities is 32.5 yuan per dan (unit), which is 650 yuan per ton. If one ton can be sold per day, the gross profit is 80 yuan, and after deducting the loss of coal dust, the net profit is only 60 yuan. May I ask if this meager profit can maintain the expenses of a store? Moreover, how many stores can sell more than one or two tons? From this, we can see that their daily life is extraordinary. Unexpectedly, recently the factory has changed the way to increase the cartage fee to 60 yuan, invisibly reducing the retailer's profit by 40 yuan. In addition, the factory has recently taken actions such as suspending production and reducing production volume, causing retailers to receive only a quarter or none of the coal balls per day. Otherwise, they can only search for coal balls from the factory's black market to maintain expenses. May I ask if this situation can avoid the creation of a black market? Where can the retailers seek redress for the injustice they have suffered?

The above situation is the cause of the black market and panic for coal balls. There is no need to argue for either side. Because I am in the industry and have experienced it myself, I know it very well. I deeply hope that the authorities should quickly thoroughly investigate the root cause of the black market and re-consider the minimum profits of both parties. On the other hand, the authorities should deal with the factory's illegal actions, such as using excuses to suspend production, reducing production volume, and smuggling for profit (as reported in the newspaper about the smuggling of a large company). Then, the black market and panic for coal balls will disappear by themselves. Finally, I believe that if you want to stabilize one thing, you must start from the root and prescribe the right medicine. You can't just suppress the surface to succeed. For example, when a flood occurs, instead of trying to open up tributaries, you build high levees. The consequences will be unimaginable. (Petty Official) (Moving to help students)

Improvement of Cigarette Rationing

There are many articles and discussions about improving the rationing method, but most of them focus on superficial measures, such as strict investigations and asking citizens to report, etc. Although the authorities are so vigorous, merchants still secretly sell batches of rationed goods through the back door, transport them to street vendors or other places, turning them into black market goods and making a fortune. Citizens have no evidence to report, and investigations have become empty words. Although that is the case, I do not object to this method, but I think that a considerable root method should be used in conjunction with it, so that the results can be better.

Now let's take cigarettes as an example: A batch of cigarettes is allocated by the rationing agency, but the number of people who get cigarettes is very small. In terms of the overall amount of rationing, it cannot be said to be small. But why do so few people get cigarettes? As far as I know, there are roughly the following two reasons:

When merchants are rationing, they claim to allocate only 20% to the public, and the remaining 80% are secretly sold on the black market.

The 20% of the rationed amount is still bought by people who are usually familiar with each other, and some people may buy one or two packs.

Based on the above reasons, the rationing system has been destroyed by these unscrupulous merchants who seek personal gain. The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association has noticed this and proposed to remove and return the tin foil and paper packaging of the rationed cigarettes to prevent abuses. However, imagine if a street vendor or store sells you a bundle of loose cigarettes at a black market price, what evidence do you have to report them! Moreover, in the past, a large number of cigarettes, tin foil and paper packaging were circulating outside, causing various abuses, so it is still not a good method.

It is best to print the words "rationed" on the cigarettes and paper packaging, and force the registration of inventory, and limit the time to print the words "rationed" on the inventory, otherwise it will not be sold. Then, with the addition of investigation and reporting work, the abuses can be eradicated. In this way, whether in towns or cities, if a black market is found, anyone can report it, and it is also convenient for the authorities to investigate. During the tense period of wartime material control, the control and rationing of other materials can also refer to this method and handle it with discretion. This is just my humble opinion, I don't know if the authorities will accept it? (Jifei)

### The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Orphanage Appeals for Homeless Orphans

The Daughters of Mary Help of Christians Orphanage in Shanghai has been established for many years and has greatly benefited society. Unfortunately, it was suddenly destroyed by artillery fire, causing a group of helpless children to be abandoned. Fortunately, the female priests in charge of the association, with their loving and compassionate hearts and sacrificial spirit, vowed not to let them decrease and ran around various ports in Southeast Asia. In order to solicit donations, they received sponsorship from various parties and continuous assistance, so that the orphanage continued to exist. For five or six years, it has been supported by the hard work of the female priests. Now, the sea routes are cut off, and external donations have stopped, while local living expenses have skyrocketed, and the number of homeless children is increasing daily. The female priests, true to their original intentions, still plan to accommodate them as much as possible, but they are unable to do so, and the expenses are difficult. They specifically gathered colleagues to discuss, and all believed that it was an established cause, how can it be allowed to wither, causing society to suffer even more losses. Therefore, with the intention of accumulating small contributions, they respectfully inform the benevolent people of all circles, generously donate and enthusiastically contribute to jointly maintain the orphanage, so that it can continue to exist, which is immeasurable merit.

(Donations can be sent to Shanghai Dahua Bank at 289 Jiujiang Road)

### Vocational Guidance Center Runs Training Classes

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau Vocational Guidance Center has not only been actively engaged in job placement but has also recently focused on guidance work. During the summer vacation, it has been vigorously promoting guidance for further education. Recently, it has been entrusted by various parties to run employee training classes. Employee training is an important policy for major factories and institutions today. Recognizing this, the center has specially formulated regulations for employee training classes and compiled a syllabus of employee training courses, divided into two types: common sense training and technical training. The materials are relevant to reality, and both literates and illiterates can understand them. The center has invited famous people in the education field to teach. It is reported that the training will begin within this month for the employees of various institutions in the Chamber of Commerce Building and will last for four weeks. It is also planned to promote it to various contracted factories and major tricycle companies. Recognizing that citizens often encounter legal problems and are forced to seek help but have no way to do so, the center has specially established a legal guidance center, hiring famous lawyers in Shanghai to provide free guidance. Anyone who encounters such problems can seek guidance from the center (inside the Chamber of Commerce or 200 Remi Road, District 8). The legal mentors of the center can provide free guidance on everything.

### Yanggou Siltation Affects Health

All the residents of the Nanli alleys on Hado Road are poor people. Since the road was built in the first half of the year, many Yanggou ditches have been silted up, and foul odors are overflowing, which affects hygiene. Previously, we sent letters to the Hado Foreign Company and the health authorities, but they ignored them. This accumulated water has been there for two or three months. If it is not drained quickly, I am afraid that infectious diseases will spread. We urgently hope that the authorities will send workers to dredge them as soon as possible to restore residents' health.

### Looking for Cremation Site

A friend of mine is seriously ill and is terminally ill. He says that there is no hope of recovery and that he will die soon. His family is very poor and cannot afford the funeral expenses. I remember that there used to be a cremation site in the city (reportedly on Haig Road). I don't know if it is true. I implore benevolent people to indicate its location and all the expenses so that my friend can have a proper burial. (Jiang Zhiyi)
