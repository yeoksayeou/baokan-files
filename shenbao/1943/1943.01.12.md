### Developing Wartime Production Enterprises

Yesterday, I offered my humble suggestions regarding economic policies after joining the war. However, considering the responsibility our country bears in the current Greater East Asia War, the primary focus in the economic sphere should be the replenishment and supply of materials. Given our vast territory and large population, it is only natural for us to fulfill the urgent needs of our allies. But to accomplish this task, the first step is to develop production enterprises. I would like to present several key points that should be emphasized when developing wartime production enterprises to the authorities and entrepreneurs.

The wartime production we are talking about naturally includes both industrial and agricultural production. Most of the production enterprises in the previously peaceful areas have been suspended due to the war. Although the Japanese authorities have, out of consideration for the people's difficulties, successively returned various factories, there are several reasons why these enterprises have not taken off. Firstly, the psychological clouds of doubt have not been dispelled for most entrepreneurs, who lack confidence in the future of their businesses and are unwilling to take risks. Secondly, the difficulty in sourcing, purchasing, and transporting raw materials, as well as the lack of labor, especially technical talent, has made entrepreneurs hesitant to move forward. Thirdly, the narrow sales markets for products, the difficulty of transportation, and the difficulty in grasping market prices, among other reasons, have made people regard production enterprises as a dangerous path, and they dare not engage in them rashly. Fourthly, there are concerns about production controls, and most importantly, a small number of powerful people, taking advantage of various opportunities and relying on Japanese influence, are engaged in manipulating monopolies and hoarding for speculation in order to pursue exorbitant profits. No one is willing to engage in production enterprises that require heavy investment, yield meager profits, and have a bleak future. Therefore, today, we should either not talk about wartime economy and the development of wartime production, or, if we do, the authorities must provide clear demonstrations in practice to dispel the doubts in the minds of large and small entrepreneurs, workers, farmers, and producers in various industries. On the one hand, we must passively and thoroughly eliminate the exorbitant profits from wartime speculation and monopolies. In particular, we must thoroughly investigate and strictly prohibit those who obtain preferential rights by relying on Japanese influence, so that the production community can be refreshed and Chinese and Japanese people can engage in production on an equal footing. On the other hand, we must actively promote and support Chinese entrepreneurs and workers and farmers, so that they do not have baseless worries about a bleak future, and we must provide a guarantee of the minimum level of profit (such as implementing a guaranteed interest system). We must provide convenience in terms of raw materials, workers, technology, and transportation, so that everyone is happy to engage in production, and the future efficiency will inevitably be immeasurable.

Secondly, the limited production enterprises in the previously peaceful areas also have many shortcomings, the main ones being: (1) Lack of universalization. Most people do not care about production that is necessary for the country, and only focus on certain more profitable and risk-free businesses. (2) Lack of rationalization. Whether in the types of production, the distribution of factories, the nature and quantity of products, the allocation of transportation and markets, or production technology, division of labor, and management, everything is in an irrational state. As a result, the entire production enterprise is on the verge of death. Therefore, in the future, if we want to develop wartime production, the most important thing is to pay attention to the following points:

First, for the needs of wartime, it is certainly necessary to promote large-scale production. However, given the actual situation in the peaceful areas, the conditions for state-owned industrial and agricultural enterprises are not yet fully available, and the possibilities for large-scale private industrial and agricultural enterprises are not many either. Here, on the one hand, we certainly hope that Japan will assist in terms of capital and technology, and on the other hand, we must also pay attention to the assistance of small and medium-sized production. In order to protect small capital, we must pay attention to preventing the monopoly of large capital and strengthen protection, so that the sales prices of products from small capital and products from large capital can be reasonably regulated. The government should designate certain locations as sales areas for new-style products and certain locations as sales areas for handicrafts, so that they can have markets with each other, so as to avoid large capital swallowing small capital and large factories plundering handicrafts, which would hinder wartime production. The authorities should also stipulate reasonable values, so that handicrafts and machine-made industrial products can be sold equally under different values. In this way, we can avoid the monopoly and profiteering of large capital and its obstructive effect on all wartime production, and encourage the thousands and tens of thousands of small industrial and agricultural producers who account for the majority of the labor force to increase the total amount of wartime production, supply the needs of the war, meet the daily needs of the people, and stabilize price fluctuations, which will help stabilize wartime society. This is the way to universalize wartime production.

Second, in addition to paying attention to economic and political issues, we must also pay attention to technical issues. The saying "technology determines everything" is not an exaggerated platitude. Especially in this new era, those with superior technology will win, and those with inferior technology will lose. This is inevitable. However, so-called technology is definitely not simply copying the best and most advanced technology of capitalist countries regardless of its suitability. That would not only be useless, but on the contrary, the more we talk about technology in this way, the more it will hinder production. What we mean by emphasizing technology is to address the real situation of Chinese industry and agriculture and strive to improve the level of technology in order to increase production efficiency. That is what is called production rationalization. Whether in industry or agriculture, or in various sectors of each industry, we must determine rational allocations based on the raw materials, power, labor, technology, transportation, and the needs of the wartime government and the people in each province and region. Here, the government should call on experts and entrepreneurs to form production committees and the like to assist the government in promoting the movement for production rationalization.

Most importantly, we must not rely solely on the power of the government and abuse wartime slogans, nor can we rely solely on methods such as control, management, and allocation. The actual situation in China cannot be ignored, and the minimum interests of small and medium-sized industrial and agricultural enterprises cannot be disregarded. As the saying goes, "The commander of an army can be captured, but the will of a commoner cannot be taken away." It is also said, "Only virtue is威威, can it subdue people." I hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will repeatedly consider these words when developing wartime production.

### Foreign Minister Chu's Broadcast Speech: Abolishing All British and American Treaties; Five-Nation Ambassadors' Congratulatory Broadcast

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – Foreign Minister Chu's broadcast address is as follows: The National Government has declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States. From now on, our country will stand on the front line with our ally, Japan, and fight alongside them against the United Kingdom and the United States, becoming a combatant in the Greater East Asia War. In the past, when our country participated in foreign wars, it did not make equal efforts from an independent and autonomous standpoint. Now we are beginning to participate in the war on our own initiative, with an independent status and an autonomous field, working together with our allies to achieve world justice and peace. We will use our own blood to wash away the humiliation and subjugation we have suffered for a hundred years. This is something that all our compatriots are deeply excited about. A hundred years ago, the United States and the United Kingdom's aggression against our country caused nothing but pain. Fortunately, our ally Japan served as a pillar of support and a shield for East Asia, and the United States and the United Kingdom had to be cautious in their oppression. However, since then, in order to satisfy their greed, the United States and the United Kingdom have provoked and slandered China and Japan, creating divisions and discord among the countries of East Asia. It is heartbreaking to speak of. Recently, they have intensified their efforts, forcibly supporting the rebels in Chongqing and constantly harassing our peaceful development. Moreover, they have allowed their own air force, under the guise of Chongqing, to indiscriminately bomb and harm civilians, which is truly outrageous. If our country continues to endure this pain and seek temporary peace, we will not only fail to live up to the people of our country who value righteousness and know shame, but also fail to live up to our allies who are fighting bravely. Therefore, starting at 10:00 a.m. on January 9, we have declared to the world that we are in a state of war with the United States and the United Kingdom. All treaties, agreements, contracts, and international treaties previously concluded between our country and the United States and the United Kingdom, which pertain to the relationship between China and the United States and between China and the United Kingdom, should be abolished at the same time in accordance with public law and customary practice. However, the 1907 Hague Convention on Land Warfare and all subsequent treaties on wartime matters shall continue to be observed without change. This war is a war for our country to strive for independence and autonomy, a war to revive China and defend East Asia. All of us, from top to bottom, should be inspired and work hard, engage in the same heroic struggle as our allies, and eliminate the enemies of East Asia to achieve the great goal of the war. This is the first point that we should recognize clearly. One hour after our participation in the war, our ally Japan immediately signed a joint declaration with our country to complete the war together. At the same time, they also signed an agreement to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, enabling us to achieve the independence of our sovereignty. Now we have joined the war from an independent and autonomous standpoint, which is the second point that we should recognize clearly. We and our ally Japan are in the same destiny, sharing life and death. We have decided to align our steps, move forward hand in hand, and strive for our common victory. Although there are still many difficulties in the future of the war, we are deeply convinced that with our full efforts, we will be able to overcome all kinds of difficulties, and the final victory will surely belong to us.

The Japanese Ambassador's Broadcast Speech

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – Ambassador Shigemitsu delivered a broadcast speech in Nanjing at 8:00 p.m. on the 11th. The key points are as follows: (1) More than a year has passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The remaining forces of the United Kingdom and the United States have been driven out of East Asia. Japan now controls all the key points of combat in East Asia and the Pacific, enabling it to mobilize materials and resources from various regions to conduct the war. No matter what forces the enemy uses to attack, the Japanese army has established an absolutely invincible position. This is not only a factor in determining the overall trend of the world war, but it can also be said to have established the foundation for the revival of Asia. The history of the Anglo-Saxons' invasion of Asia is very long. The various ethnic groups of Asia have been successively conquered or invaded, and China has also suffered the same fate. In particular, during the Opium War, its sovereignty was restricted by treaties, leading to it groaning under the yoke of British and American forces in recent times. East Asia and all of Asia were thus in a difficult and bitter situation due to these evil forces, leading to domestic disturbances or causing conflicts between East Asian nations. If these evil forces are not eliminated, there will be no hope for the liberation or restoration of East Asia. The significance of the Greater East Asia War lies in driving out these evil forces and restoring East Asia to East Asians in order to seek its revival and construction. This is why the Greater East Asia War is our common holy war. (2) China has long understood this significance and has decided to share weal and woe with Japan, which is promoting the holy war. This time, it has further decided to live and die with Japan, and has resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States in order to meet the needs of the people and realize the Chinese independence and Pan-Asianism that the people desire. This great policy is a major decision by the Chinese government. Since the Opium War, there has been a major shift in Chinese history. I would like to express my full respect for this. (3) Based on its own experience and as one of the countries in Asia, Japan has always fully assisted China in restoring its sovereignty. Twenty years ago, at the Beijing Customs Conference, Japan was the first to advocate the restoration of China's customs autonomy. Recently, it also returned the British concessions in Tianjin and Guangzhou to China. This time, when China joined the war, Japan, in view of the significance and spirit of the holy war, and standing on the common front with China, first sought to realize its legitimate demands. This is the way of comrades-in-arms, and it is also the friendship of Japan towards all the Chinese people who have sworn to live and die together. Here, Japan not only has no demands, but also automatically takes concrete and practical measures to realize the abolition of unequal treaties. This is why it has expressed its concrete will to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights this time. This move is completely different from the empty checks issued by the United Kingdom and the United States recently, which are engaged in propaganda. (4) Based on the above, this war is a common war between the two countries of East Asia. After China's participation in the war, its meaning is becoming increasingly clear. Our camp is now becoming stronger. With the addition of our allies Manchuria and Thailand, we have formed a solid axis of East Asia, echoing the axis countries such as Germany and Italy in Europe, and moving together towards the construction of a new world order. In this way, Asia will change its destiny, and world history will change its direction. This is not only something to celebrate for China and Japan, but also for Greater East Asia and all of Asia. Here, I only hope for the development of the National Government of China and the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

The German Ambassador's Broadcast Speech

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – The key points of the German Ambassador's broadcast speech are as follows: This time, China has resolutely declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States based on its own will. I was very pleased to hear this news. The authorities of the National Government of the Republic of China have decided not to be playthings of British and American politicians and financial groups any longer, but to participate in the construction of Greater East Asia. The United Kingdom and the United States have tried to incite European countries to fight each other, causing both sides to suffer heavy losses, and taking advantage of this opportunity to reap the benefits of hegemonic economics. What the United Kingdom and the United States need are slave nations without rights or courage. We Germans have suffered greatly from this. Now we have awakened. We are fighting. The Chinese nation has also suffered such an experience. Whose fault is it that China has been at civil war and has been at odds with its neighbors for many years? Who is the one who benefits from the fisherman's profit? Of course, it is the United Kingdom and the United States. The enemy that China is confronting today is also the enemy that is oppressing Germany. Therefore, this development is a natural trend. Germany and China have the same goal and are courageously moving forward towards the path of final victory. Therefore, the war in Europe and the war in Asia are a whole and inseparable war. The future of the struggle for our Axis countries and their allies is certainly not easy. But one thing is certain and beyond doubt: the final victory will be on our side. A just peace will lead to a new era. In the future, all mankind will be able to achieve sound progress.

The Italian Ambassador's Broadcast Speech

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – The key points of the Italian Ambassador's broadcast speech are as follows: The Italian government expresses its warm sympathy for China's participation in the war this time and wishes for our common victory in the future. The friendship between China and Italy began in ancient Roman times. In recent years, the far-sighted political vision of our Prime Minister Mussolini and the work carried out by Foreign Minister Ciano have all been focused on eliminating communism and being the pioneers of the world. After China joined the anti-communist front, the relationship between the two countries has moved from mutual trust and understanding to common cooperation. Communism and Anglo-American capitalism have the same aggressive plans and harm China, which has now been recognized by the Chinese people. In order to seek the political revival of China, China should rise up and engage in a war to strive for freedom and independence. As a result, the relationship between China and Italy has become even closer. The real enemies of China are also the common enemies of Germany, Italy, and Japan. Now that China has joined the war, it is a manifestation of the merging of the forces of the East Asian countries into one furnace. It greatly benefits the plan of Japan, Germany, and Italy to eliminate the common enemy. In this war, Germany, Italy, and Japan have vowed to share life and death. It is especially gratifying that the new China has risen up to participate. In the future, we will surely be able to achieve final victory and realize justice and peace throughout the world.

The Manchukuo Ambassador's Broadcast Speech

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) – Lü Ronghuan, the Manchukuo Ambassador to China, broadcast a speech in Nanjing at 7:00 p.m. on the 11th, entitled "Thoughts on the National Government's Declaration of War on the United Kingdom and the United States." The key points are as follows: "The National Government's resolute declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States this time, vowing to share weal and woe with our ally Japan, and expressing its determination to provide absolute cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, whether in military, political, or economic terms, has a very far-reaching and significant meaning at the current stage when the Greater East Asia War has entered its final decisive battle. The significance of China's participation in the war this time is to restore the original face of Greater East Asia, defeat the United Kingdom and the United States, and build a new Greater East Asia in order to contribute to world peace. Therefore, China's participation in the war this time is also strengthening our East Asian nations and striking down the common front of the United Kingdom and the United States, and further developing the Greater East Asia War. In the past hundred years, China, which was bound by unequal treaties, has made repeated efforts over several decades to abolish various unequal treaties, but it has ultimately been blocked by the United Kingdom and the United States and has been unable to realize its goals. Today, thanks to Japan's friendship, the concessions have been returned and extraterritorial rights have been abolished. This is indeed something to be proud of and to have confidence in for the countries of East Asia that are based on righteousness. At the time when the Greater East Asia War broke out, His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo issued a great edict and declared that we would share life and death with Japan. Our government also issued a statement vowing to fully assist our ally in achieving its noble mission. In short, the relationship between China and Japan and the relationship between Japan and Manchukuo have transcended the concept of interests and are moving towards the same path with the same belief. The foundation of the great cause of East Asia is already as solid as a rock. This self-confidence of our East Asian nations is indeed the strongest barrier and the greatest driving force for building Greater East Asia. Therefore, I express my infinite admiration and infinite joy for the great determination of President Wang Jingwei and the officials of the National Government."

### Southwest of Velikiye Luki: German Reinforcements Launch a Major Counteroffensive, Establishing Impenetrable Hedgehog Defenses; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Don and Caucasus Regions

Stockholm, Sweden, 10th (Havas) – According to news from the Eastern Front, a major battle has broken out near Moscow. German forces are fiercely attacking Red Army defenses southwest of Velikiye Luki and plan to recapture one of the hedgehog defense positions near the Latvian border, approximately 90 miles away. German hedgehog defenses are armed on all sides, solid and impenetrable. None of them were captured by the Red Army last winter. The Red Army only attempted to slip past or appear around them. Moscow news also acknowledges that the hedgehog defense position southwest of Velikiye Luki is the first one captured by the Red Army.

Note: The city of Velikiye Luki is west of Rzhev and north of Smolensk.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong) – Responsible sources reveal that the Soviet side, with 11 infantry divisions, 5 brigades, and 8 tank brigades, fiercely attacked the German base in Velikiye Luki, but has so far failed to capture it. The death toll of soldiers has reached 50% to 80%. Of the 400 tanks deployed, no fewer than 300 have been destroyed. After a German unit broke through the Soviet lines, the German forces in Velikiye Luki have received reinforcements. (115)

Berlin, 11th (Haitong) – Well-informed military sources here state that German forces have penetrated deep into Soviet positions in the Toropets area. The German forces in Velikiye Luki have received reinforcements, and the German advance continues, with fierce fighting underway. The Soviet army has repeatedly claimed to have occupied Luki, but for six weeks, German forces have firmly held the stronghold, remaining unshaken. Fierce fighting is also taking place in other war zones on the Eastern Front, with German forces being very successful. The Soviet offensive between the Volga and Don rivers has been repelled. The Axis forces in the Don Bend are still holding the newly occupied positions.

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas) – Various reports from the Soviet side state that the Red Army is making good progress in the mid-Don and Caucasus fronts. The German side announced yesterday that a large number of tanks and aircraft have arrived in the Velikiye Luki area for reinforcements, where fierce fighting is ongoing. Investigations reveal that the city has been conducting defensive warfare for six weeks, and the entire city is still in German hands. Various Red Army counter-propaganda efforts are unfounded. German forces continue to conduct defensive or offensive warfare in other areas of the Eastern Front. Soviet troops that penetrated deep between the Don and Volga rivers have been cleared by German counteroffensives, and German forces have recaptured several strongholds in the process.

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Allied) – According to news from the Eastern Front, the situation in northern Caucasus and the lower Don River region has become increasingly fierce. German forces have concentrated 30 divisions on a front of approximately 200 kilometers, from the Svyatogorsk-to-Likhaya railway line to the Datsinsky station and the Salsk-to-Krasnodar railway line to the Sazk, and are pushing westward day and night, engaging in fierce fighting with the Soviet forces. To prevent the Soviet forces from seizing the key point of Zhana, they have concentrated 25 divisions at various key points in the northern Caucasus and are conducting counterattacks everywhere. Soviet troops who broke through German lines in the central Don-Volga region and the Don bend have been successively encircled by German forces, and small-scale annihilation operations are being carried out in various places. Several key areas in the mid-Don region have been recaptured, securing the Moscow-to-Rostov railway line.

Fierce Aerial Battle in the Far North

Berlin, 11th (Haitong) – Military sources say that there was a fierce aerial battle over the Gulf of Kandalaksha on Saturday. Four German aircraft shot down eight of the 25 Soviet fighters, suffering no losses themselves. The Soviet aircraft's aim was to intercept German bomber squadrons bombing the Murmansk railway. The fierce battle lasted only eight minutes, and the German aircraft ultimately destroyed 20 freight cars and several sections of track.

### North African Front: Only Localized Fighting; Allied Forces Announce the Formation of a Special Committee to Arm French Forces and Oversee Reorganization

The Führer's Headquarters, 11th (Haitong) – Today's German military report states that there has only been localized fighting in North Africa. German and Italian aircraft bombed enemy positions, troop columns, and air bases, shooting down five enemy aircraft.

Berlin, 11th (Allied) – According to front-line news received here, in southern Tunisia, German combined units, under the cover of mechanized forces, launched a fierce attack on French rebel forces located in the area leading to the western plains of Tunisia, and occupied an important hilltop, capturing many French soldiers and seizing countless weapons. In addition, German air force fighter squadrons strafed enemy tank and motor vehicle units gathering in the southern Atlas Mountains with machine guns and bombed American anti-aircraft artillery positions. It is also reported that anti-Axis forces are concentrating their forces in the vicinity of Medjez el Bab and Pont du Fahs, 200 kilometers west of Tunis, in an attempt to launch a counterattack.

Bern, Switzerland, 11th (Havas) – The air force was extremely active on the Tunisian front yesterday. Axis aircraft continuously bombed Allied air bases in Algeria, while Allied aircraft attacked the cities and ports of Tunis, Sousse, Herzel, Sfax, and Krouan.

Tangier, 11th (Haitong) – News from Algiers states that the Allied headquarters in North Africa has announced that it will form a special committee to arm the French forces in North Africa. The committee will be composed of British, American, and French officers and will be responsible for reorganizing the French land, sea, and air forces in North Africa.

### British Anxiety About the Situation in North Africa

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas) – According to news from London, the military correspondent of Reuters published semi-official British news yesterday, stating that developments in North Africa are extremely disappointing. There is no doubt that the Allied advance in Tunisia has not been as rapid as expected, resulting in a missed opportunity. German forces and their allies are taking advantage of this unexpected opportunity to complete their defenses. Extremely solid fortifications are now being built in southern Europe and the Mediterranean islands. A month ago, there was a possibility of successfully attacking the coasts of France or Italy. At this point, the Allied forces must contend with fortifications similar to those built along the English Channel. It is generally believed that this statement is further proof of London's dissatisfaction. Some newspapers have even called for the replacement of the Allied commander-in-chief in North Africa, citing the extreme difficulty of communication between Algiers and London. In addition, the London "Observer" also published a commentary yesterday, reiterating that the American support for General Giraud in North Africa is tantamount to endorsing anti-democratic political trends. The Allied countries are not only fighting against Fascism, but also against dictatorships. A parliament should be formed in North Africa by the two or thirty former French parliamentarians who are currently in Morocco and Algeria.

### German Troops on the Eastern Front - Winter Gear

Berlin, November 11th, Huitong News Agency - Soldiers of the German army on the Eastern Front are specially equipped with winter clothing, impervious to wind and water, and allowing for easy movement. These uniforms can also be used as camouflage. The uniforms have been tested at temperatures as low as minus 46 degrees Celsius and winds of 20 kilometers per second. They also come equipped with masks, helmets, gloves, snow boots, underpants, and undershirts, all complete.

### Soviet Female Aviator Rasgova Killed in Action

Bern, Switzerland, November 10th, Havas Agency - According to TASS, Soviet female aviator Rasgova has been killed in action somewhere on the front lines. It is noted that Ms. Rasgova was famous for flying from Moscow to Vladivostok in 1938, a long-distance flight. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, she led an air force squadron into battle and was known as a "Soviet female hero." The Soviet government has reportedly decided to give her a state funeral and provide support to her family.

### Waste Utilization - Old Clothes Refurbished - New Movement Promoted in France

Paris, November 10th, Havas Agency - Waste utilization is a new movement arising from the current war. In view of the shortage of textiles, the French government has ordered that anyone wishing to buy new clothes must hand in two pieces of old clothing. After this measure was adopted, more than 65 tons of old clothes were collected in Vichy in 1942. After being washed, these old clothes are remade. Men's trousers can be turned into skirts or children's clothing, hats can be turned into slippers, and stiff collars can be washed to remove starch and sweat and turned into handkerchiefs or baby diapers. These refurbished clothes are distributed to refugees by refugee relief associations.

### Thirteen Oil Tankers Sunk Off the Coast of North Africa - German Submarine Commander Announces Raid Details

Berlin, November 11th, Huitong News Agency - German military spokesman, Submarine Commander Dönitz, announced yesterday that during the recent attack on an Allied convoy of oil tankers, the Allies lost thirteen oil tankers, containing a total of 174,000 tons of oil, enough to keep 500 four-engine bombers flying in the air for 44 days. This was the first time German submarines encountered a convoy consisting purely of oil tankers, and the convoy's defenses were not tight, indicating the urgency of North Africa's need for oil. The spokesman then described the details of the German submarine attack on the convoy, stating that on the afternoon of January 8, a German submarine discovered sixteen oil tankers full of gasoline, sailing from Trinidad to North Africa, 1,000 miles off the coast of Africa. The submarine not only immediately launched a raid, but also reported to the German submarine command, requesting a squadron of submarines to assist in the battle. "That night, transport ships sank one by one, and by morning, the German submarine crew saw that the enemy convoy was in a state of panic. Although the enemy escort ships tried their best to defend, the German submarines continued to attack. By Sunday morning, the German submarines confirmed that thirteen oil tankers, totaling 124,000 tons, had been sunk, and those crew members who did not die in the fire were buried in the sea."

Impact on the War Situation

Berlin, November 11th, Huitong News Agency - German newspapers commented this morning on the sinking of thirteen Allied oil tankers by German submarines between Trinidad and Gibraltar, recognizing that the Allies' losses were extremely serious. The "Monday Post" stated that the German High Command's special war report explained why the Allied forces in North Africa had failed to achieve the expected results. Today, the Allies lost 174,000 tons of gasoline in one go, which will have a significant impact on the Allied operations in North Africa. The "Monday Post" stated that the news of the sinking of thirteen oil tankers was a bolt from the blue for Britain and the United States, because the arrival or non-arrival of the convoy was closely related to the future of the Allied forces on the North African battlefield.

British Feeling Threatened

Bern, Switzerland, November 10th, Havas Agency - According to reports from London, British Member of Parliament Owen declared in the House of Commons that the loss of British merchant ships this year had reached a "serious" state, and the general public was not aware of this situation. The authorities also lack effective measures to deal with the submarine threat, and the situation is becoming more serious.

Lisbon, November 10th, Allied News Agency - According to a London dispatch, British commentator Garvey issued a warning essay on the serious threat posed by submarines on the 9th, stating that British merchant ships sunk by German submarines have reached 17 million tons, which is equal to the total tonnage of the British merchant fleet before the war. The activity of German submarines is now becoming increasingly intense. As for the rate at which the Allied Nations are building merchant ships, it is far behind the rate at which they are being sunk. If effective defenses against the submarine threat are not taken now, the Allied victory in 1944 will inevitably become a dream.

### Japanese Ambassador Sato Visits Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister

Kuybyshev, November 10th, Allied News Agency - Japanese Ambassador to Moscow, Sato, visited Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Vyacheslav on the 9th, and spoke for half an hour.

### Australia's First Envoy Arrives in Soviet Union to Take Office

Moscow, November 11th, Allied News Agency - Australia's first envoy to the Soviet Union, Slater, has arrived here via Washington and the Soviet capital of Kuybyshev, flying 26,000 miles from Australia. He is scheduled to present his credentials today.

### Xing Hua Lou - Authentic Cantonese Preserved Meats

Cantonese preserved meats, considered top-grade food items, have a long history of being sold at Xing Hua Lou. In recent years, transportation has been difficult, so renowned chefs have been specially hired from Guangdong province to come to Shanghai to meticulously prepare and display a full array of products in the windows, making them fresh and appealing. There are many varieties. I have tried them, and now I write about them for buyers to choose from: Duck liver sausage and soy sauce sausage are the best of the sausages. Waxed duck intestines and fatty waxed duck are the kings of their kind. Kwan Tao meat (cured pork belly) and streaky waxed pork have unique flavors. Gold and silver duck livers and gold and silver pork livers are both excellent. The various flavors are sweet, fragrant, and palatable. They truly make people want to eat them with every meal and never tire of them. They are beneficial to the body and mind, good for the appetite and stomach, increase the amount of rice consumed, and these are not empty words. Using them as gifts is also elegant and valuable because the preparation methods are extremely clean and hygienic. (Advertisement)

### Increased Burden on the People - Huge U.S. Budget - Expenditures Reach 100 Billion Yuan - Only Tax Increases Can Compensate

Buenos Aires, November 11th, Allied News Agency - According to a dispatch from Washington, Roosevelt's budget message to Congress will be released today. The Washington political circles are speculating about its contents, but there is no consensus. However, it is almost certain that the expenditures will reach $100 billion. Therefore, it is expected that the government will propose a large tax increase to plan for this huge expenditure. However, the previous tax collection methods have already been implemented to the maximum extent in this year due to the large increases implemented one after another. Therefore, it is rumored that Roosevelt is considering increasing revenue in some new way. It is believed that this new method may adopt tax increases and compulsory savings, that is, the private funds absorbed by the tax increase will be repaid after the war. In fact, it is a policy of compulsory sales of public bonds. Financial experts also believe that in view of the current state of federal finances and the threat of inflation in the United States, the US government has no other choice but to take extraordinary measures such as compulsory savings or promoting public bonds.

### Pan Youxin Returns to Chongqing

Guangzhou, November 11th, Central News Agency - According to news from Chongqing, Soviet Ambassador to Chongqing, Pan Youxin, had previously returned to Chongqing on official business. It is generally believed that during his return to the country, he had important agreements with his government on the Northwest Highway and Soviet-Chongqing relations.

### Soviet Union and Egypt Establish Diplomatic Relations - Under Negotiation in London

Ankara, November 11th, Huitong News Agency - It has been learned from diplomatic circles in Cairo, Egypt that Egypt and the Soviet Union will soon establish diplomatic relations. It is reported that these negotiations are being conducted in London by the Egyptian and Soviet ambassadors to the United Kingdom.

### General Okamura Discusses the Issue of the National Government's Participation in the War - Mr. Hori Discusses Japan's Return of Concessions in China - Fundamentally Different from the Anglo-American Policy Towards China

Beijing, November 11th, Central News Agency - General Okamura, the supreme commander of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army, gave a special speech today on the National Government's participation in the war, stating that the National Government's participation in the war had completely lost the pretense of resistance of the Chongqing side, and was a heavy blow to the six years of blind resistance, willingly serving as the jackal of the British and Americans, and the culprit for disrupting East Asian peace. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, North China has taken on the task of cooperation. Under the situation where the military, government, officials, and people are united and prepared to participate in the war, we have ensured public security and developed important resources, and have already made great contributions to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The National Government has now resolutely participated in the war, and the actual responsibilities of North China will become even more important. Our North China Expeditionary Army will take this opportunity to further exert its courageous spirit to wipe out the Chongqing army, the rebels of East Asia. At the same time, we must closely cooperate with the brave Chinese soldiers to eradicate the Communist army that obstructs the construction of the new China.

Nanjing, November 11th, Allied News Agency - Mr. Hori, Deputy Spokesman of the Cabinet Information Bureau, stated today that Japan's return of concessions in China and abolition of extraterritorial rights has shown that Japan's policy towards China is fundamentally different from that of Britain and the United States. Therefore, Japan has taken the lead in recognizing China's just wishes, which shows that Japan is striving to respect Chinese sovereignty and strengthen cooperation between the two countries, working together to carry out the Greater East Asia War and build a new order. For the future of China and Greater East Asia, the solution of the two issues of concessions and extraterritorial rights is worth celebrating. In the past, Japan fought hard to abolish the unequal treaties with Britain and the United States. The Anglo-American proposal to abolish extraterritorial rights in China is superficially similar to Japan's decision this time, but in reality, they are very different. Britain and the United States are planning for themselves and want to eliminate the dissatisfaction of the Chongqing government. Moreover, their proposal is empty and lacks specificity. Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights directly affects 600,000 Japanese expatriates in China. Mr. Hori stated at the end that if the United States and Britain sincerely advocate national equality and freedom, why does the United States not amend its "Chinese Exclusion Act," and why does the United Kingdom imprison and kill men, women, old, and young who are fighting for independence? So far, there has been no satisfactory answer from the United States and Britain to this question.

### Major Foodstuffs Banned from Being Transported to Shanghai from Cleared Areas - Private Trafficking and Hoarding Strictly Prohibited - Abnormal Black Markets Resolutely Eliminated

In order to regulate people's food, eliminate black markets, and coordinate the distribution of food, a new method of food control will be implemented from the 13th of this month. It is hoped that citizens will abide by the regulations and not break the law themselves. The municipal government has issued a special proclamation saying: "Regarding the matter of issuing proclamations in the city, the people's food is a matter of great importance. Since the implementation of regulation, the distribution of food by headcount has been convenient for the citizens. However, recently, it has been discovered that unscrupulous people are undermining the food policy, secretly selling private rice, and raising prices, obtaining huge profits, resulting in the price of the black market increasing day by day, and legitimate needs are insufficient, causing great hardship to our people, which is extremely regrettable. In view of this, and in order to rectify the root causes and coordinate distribution, the municipal government has consulted with relevant parties and decided that from the 13th of this month, all food items such as rice, wheat, beans, sorghum, corn, and millet in the city, regardless of the quantity, are not allowed to be moved out of the cleared areas, nor are they allowed to be transported into the city's blockade. At the same time, in order to take care of the people's food, in addition to the quantity that has been moderately increased for December 1942, the distribution of food by headcount will be further increased, and this will be implemented soon, so that the people's food will be abundant, the black market will be eliminated, and the stability of life will be the foundation for recovery. All citizens should share the difficulties of the times, understand this intention, and implement it conscientiously. Those who deliberately violate it will be severely punished without leniency. This is a proclamation."

Proclamation by the Japanese Army and Navy Authorities

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Information Departments announced at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 11th) that the highest commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai issued a proclamation on the adjustment of food movement, stating: "Regarding the matter of issuing proclamations, the Imperial Japanese Army and Navy, in order to ensure the stability of food and the lives of the citizens of Shanghai, have specially stipulated the following methods for adjusting and moving important food items from January 13th. Those who violate the following regulations will have their contraband confiscated and will be severely punished in accordance with military law without leniency. It is earnestly hoped that everyone will comply without violation. This is a proclamation."

### Methods for Moving Important Food Items

(1) The term "important food items" in this proclamation refers to food items such as rice, wheat, beans, sorghum, corn, millet, and products made from the above food items. (2) It is prohibited to move important food items out of the cleared areas or into the Shanghai area, unless with formal permission. (3) In the intermediate area between the cleared areas and the Shanghai area, those who have not obtained formal permission are prohibited from transporting important food items by transportation vehicles such as boats, cars, and horses. (4) In the intermediate area between the cleared areas and the Shanghai area, as well as in the Shanghai area, it is prohibited to hoard, purchase, store, and trade important food items on the black market. (Supplementary Provisions) When this proclamation is implemented, the important food items hoarded in the intermediate area between the cleared areas and the Shanghai area, which are considered to have been smuggled to the Shanghai area, will be forcibly purchased by the Japanese Army and Navy.

Statement by Mr. Okazaki, Director-General

Mr. Okazaki Katsuo, Director-General of the Public Works Bureau, issued a statement to the newspapers yesterday on the black market trade of food. The translation is as follows: The issue of people's food during wartime is regarded as the most important in any country. Therefore, efforts are currently being made to stabilize the food supply. The situation in Shanghai today is no exception. This bureau has done its best to seek smooth distribution of food and to maintain the closest contact with the Japanese and Chinese authorities. Under the current situation, most of the food needed by residents relies on the supply from central China. However, for various reasons, the tendency of hoarding by farmers in the interior and speculation and purchasing of stocks by monopolists is becoming increasingly prominent. The biggest reason for this situation is the abnormally high price of food on the black market in Shanghai. If this situation is allowed to exist, the above-mentioned tendency of hoarding and speculative purchasing will spread, and as a result, this bureau will feel difficulties in obtaining rice for distribution.

The Bureau Will Immediately Begin Investigation

Now, this bureau is pleased to hear that the Japanese authorities, in view of this situation, have taken appropriate measures and issued a proclamation to eliminate the smuggling and black market trading of rice, various beans and wheat, sorghum, corn, millet, and their products. Therefore, this bureau, in full cooperation with the authorities, will take corresponding measures to carry out investigations based on past investigations to promote the smooth distribution of food in the Public Concession, to crack down on secret rice trading, and to manage the proper consumption of food. The smooth promotion of the long-term food supply in the Concession will be announced at any time in formal proclamations. At that time, it is earnestly hoped that citizens will fully cooperate in the implementation of these measures, abandon egoism, and fully understand the intentions of the authorities who are most concerned about the interests of the citizens. Those who resist and fail to comply with the regulations that will be announced at any time will be regarded as opposing the welfare of good residents and will be severely punished without leniency.

Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy

Allied News Agency, This Port - The Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office recently issued a statement on the control of food, stating briefly that since last spring, although some people in the Shanghai district have had some doubts and worries about the food situation, thanks to the active efforts of the Chinese-Japanese relations authorities and the sympathy and cooperation of all citizens, the food situation has not been disturbed, which is extremely gratifying. However, recently, some lawless elements have taken advantage of the lenient handling of the Japanese Army, Navy, and other authorities to disrupt the control of food, or hoard and sell food privately, or even raise black market prices several times higher than official prices, which is regrettable. This kind of lawlessness has caused the lives of good people to fall into anxiety, and the authorities cannot ignore this.

Black Market Rice Prices Affect People's Livelihoods

According to our investigation, the food that is smuggled into Shanghai and sold at high prices only meets the special needs of a limited class and merchants, and does not contribute at all to supplying the general public. On the contrary, it has a serious and harmful impact on people's lives because it increases prices, endangers people's livelihoods, and hinders the purchase of food from the interior, directly hindering the future supply of important food. Therefore, the Japanese Army and Navy have now expressed their determination to cooperate with the National Government and take effective measures to crack down on those who disrupt food control, regardless of their nationality, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods, which is timely. The Chinese and Japanese authorities responsible for food will do their best to realize the wishes of the Japanese Army and Navy. The rice and flour have already been distributed to all the people of Shanghai by ration cards. Moreover, the so-called important classes, such as government and municipal officials, or public utility companies and employees of important industries, have special rice rations. Furthermore, it has been decided to increase the amount of rice rationed per capita after mid-January. At the same time, flour will continue to be rationed as before. All of this can show the intention of the relevant authorities to protect the lives of good people.

Hoping that Citizens Will Avoid Waste

The supply of food is being implemented by the People's Livelihood Anhai Food Adjustment and Distribution Committee with the wholehearted assistance of various related groups, and various measures are being taken to solve this basic problem. If the people fully believe in the authorities and follow their instructions, there is no need to worry about the food supply. However, at the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, some inconveniences may be unavoidable. It is hoped that all citizens will understand their obligations under the current situation and encourage each other to avoid wasting food in order to facilitate the solution of the food problem. We take this opportunity of the Japanese Army and Navy to announce a joint proclamation, clarifying the determination of the authorities to crack down on those who disrupt the control measures, and expressing their sincerity in stabilizing the supply of important food. We hope that all people will cooperate fully.

### Shen Bao Fourth Scholarship Application to Begin Soon: Past Achievements Reflect Humanity's Highest Compassion, Deeply Hopeful All Sectors Will Uphold Original Intention and Jointly Undertake the Philanthropic Act

Since the Shen Bao Reader Scholarship began on July 11th of the 30th year, three sessions have quickly passed. Thanks to the assistance of enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life, who have either generously contributed or provided timely guidance, the past scholarship sessions have been able to proceed smoothly. In addition to admiring and appreciating the benefits to impoverished students, the colleagues of this newspaper will naturally hold the weight of the readers' entrustment and strive to improve ourselves. The fourth scholarship session is approaching in the blink of an eye, and the application registration date has also been decided to begin on the 15th of this month. The colleagues of this newspaper are willing to exert all efforts and provide diligent service, hoping that the readers of this newspaper will maintain their past enthusiasm for sponsorship and provide more assistance. The details are recorded as follows:

One More Person Donating Means One Less Person Drops Out

The cost of living in this city is rising day by day, and the burden on impoverished students is even greater than in the past. However, considering that these young people are the useful talents of the country and society in the future, the readers of this newspaper share this sentiment. Therefore, donations have gradually increased in past sessions. The funds needed for this scholarship session will be several times greater than the previous session, and the students receiving scholarships from the readers of this newspaper have not yet completed their studies, so we are even more unwilling to let them drop out midway. Since the readers of this newspaper have made a great vow to cultivate impoverished youth, we firmly believe that they will all have the enthusiasm to persevere to the end. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will continue to contribute. One more person donating means one less person drops out of school. Regardless of the amount, a collection of small donations can eventually form a great contribution. All donations will be given formal receipts by this newspaper and published in this newspaper the next day to demonstrate credibility and promote benevolence. It is further declared that the scholarship fund of this newspaper will never solicit donations externally under any name.

Donors in Past Sessions Span All Levels

Over the past three sessions, the enthusiastic donors to the scholarship fund have almost spanned all levels. Business leaders and social organizations sending large sums of money are, of course, one thing. Shop apprentices, book vendors, newspaper boys, servants, and maids have also saved their hard-earned money, taking this as one of the greatest pleasures in doing good. In addition, innocent children also save their candy money, which is particularly touching. In recent years, all sectors have been advocating for frugality, or transferring feast funds and birthday gifts to assist in cultivating talents and benefiting the people. This kind of righteous act is particularly sufficient to express the noblest compassion of mankind. All the enthusiastic donors in the past sessions will not only be forever remembered by the colleagues of this newspaper, but also by the benefited students, who will never forget it in their lives.

Applicants Must Ensure Impoverished Family Conditions

Regarding the application date for the fourth scholarship session, it has been decided to begin on the 15th. The application registration form has been printed and can be obtained from the business department of this newspaper on the 15th. This newspaper, in view of the past experience in handling application procedures in previous sessions, although striving for meticulousness, believes that the main purpose of the scholarship is purely to assist impoverished students. Every year, the number of people coming to apply often reaches three or four thousand. Among them, there are indeed many impoverished and excellent students, but there must also be those who hope to get lucky and falsely claim to be impoverished. Even after personally investigating and providing various proofs of their family situation, it has taken a lot of time and energy. Starting from this session, a "guarantor" column has been specially added to the application form to prove that the applicant's family is indeed impoverished. Those with relatively wealthy families are requested not to apply, because one more application from someone who does not need assistance means one less opportunity for someone who truly needs assistance. If you think about it, how can you bear to do this? We hope you will pay special attention to this.

Application Conditions for Industrial and Commercial Employees

The scholarship committee of this newspaper will still be served by educational leaders such as Mr. Shen Siliang. The various departments are divided into administrative affairs, registration, investigation, screening, review, accounting, and economic groups. This session has specially increased the number of people in order to make the work more complete and meticulous. A screening group has also been added to handle the examination affairs of applying students. As for those who apply for scholarships as industrial and commercial employees, (1) those who have been approved for scholarships in the past and have qualified grades should fill out the application form according to the procedures and will be given the opportunity to complete their studies as much as possible. (2) Those who are already studying in vocational schools and have excellent grades and impoverished family conditions, and who hold a certificate of proof from the person in charge of the service business or factory, are allowed to apply, but those whose subjects are not to assist their service or the needs of their place of work will not be approved.

### Cake and Steamed Bread Industry Submits to the Municipal Council, Requesting Normal Flour Allocation, Restrictions on Retail Sales Affect the Poor

The Cake and Steamed Bread Industry Association submitted a document to the Municipal Council yesterday, stating, "We have read the Municipal Council's Notice No. 6222 of December 31st of last year. Regarding the allocation of flour for flour-based foods such as flatbread and fried dough sticks, it has been gradually cancelled starting from the 1st of this month and directly distributed to Chinese residents in the concession to implement the exchange purchase method. This association is responsible for representing more than 5,000 households of the entire Shanghai industry. We cannot remain silent on this matter. We deeply believe that the target of the flatbread and fried dough stick industry is the poor and coolies. If this method is implemented, these people will have no way to buy the most economical food. Moreover, after the citizens obtain the flour, whether they will exchange it for flatbread and fried dough sticks is doubtful. Then the flatbread and fried dough stick industry will be virtually stagnant, and the livelihood of these people will be unimaginable. We pray that you will consider our sincerity and grant relief, restore the flour allocation to the flatbread and fried dough stick industry to benefit the poor and maintain the livelihood of the industry."

### All Sectors Support the National Policy of Participating in the War

The Global Overseas Chinese Federation believes that the government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States this time is to relieve the suffering of overseas Chinese in our country who have been oppressed by Britain and the United States for centuries. Therefore, it is determined to unanimously support and obtain the support of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission of the National Government stationed in Shanghai. It has been specifically scheduled to hold a conference at 4:00 PM on Wednesday, the 13th of this month, on the 14th floor of the International Hotel on Jing'an Temple Road to support the National Government's participation in the war and liberate overseas Chinese everywhere, and has invited all parties to participate.

The Shanghai Special City Education Association, in order to respond to the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, lead the education sector, and jointly cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, held a symposium in the auditorium of the association at 2:00 PM yesterday (the 11th), which produced many concrete opinions and made a great contribution to the education sector's assistance in participating in the war.

The Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League China General Assembly, in order to support the national policy of participating in the war, in addition to pasting new slogans and hanging large bamboo cloth banners on main roads, and participating in the demonstration meeting of all citizens, in order to enable the national policy to penetrate among all members, specifically convened a meeting of member representatives at the meeting place at 3:00 PM yesterday. More than 500 member representatives attended and unanimously passed a telegram to the government supporting participation in the war.

All colleagues in the Shanghai news industry and the Journalists Association convened a journalist symposium to discuss the mission that journalists should assume after participating in the war, and unanimously passed a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government, vowing to sincerely support participation in the war.

The Shanghai Special City Executive Committee of the Chinese Kuomintang telegraphed respect to the chairman and sent telegrams to the whole country to support participation in the war.

### Bank of Communications and Other Banks Resume Commercial Drafts

In order to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the peace zone, the Bank of Communications and other banks will resume the commercial draft system. Commercial drafts are the simplest and most convenient way to channel funds between Shanghai and the mainland. Merchants also use this as a tool for transaction settlement. However, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, this draft has been suspended. Most general transactions are settled in cash. Cash settlement has a higher risk. Now that the Bank of Communications and other banks can restore this system, it is also a way to promote the circulation of materials.

### Group A Retail Oil Stores to Sell Oil Tomorrow; Plans for Oil Distribution by Head Count Still Under Detailed Discussion

Group B of the retail edible oil stores in the Two Concessions and the urban area have stopped selling. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter yesterday, Group A retail oil stores paid yesterday and released oil today. They will continue to sell edible oil for four days starting from the 13th. As for the entire plan for oil distribution by head count, the authorities are still discussing it in detail.

### Enemy Films

After the National Government's participation in the war, the film industry, in order to express its sincere support for the National Government's national policy of participating in the war, establish a cultural battle line, and eliminate the remaining toxic thoughts of Britain and the United States, under the leadership of the China Film Company, issued a general order to all theaters across the country to stop showing British and American enemy films, and to complete the goal of building a Greater East Asia film culture. From now on, all theaters will show domestic and friendly films. It is reported that the China United Film Company, in view of the greatness of the new mission, in addition to actively increasing the production of domestic films, is also increasing the production of excellent scripts, specially hiring famous writers from the domestic literary, drama, and film circles to serve as special screenwriters, and expanding public solicitation, hoping that writers will enthusiastically contribute.

### Fare Adjustment for Trolleys Not Yet Decided

Regarding the report in yesterday's newspaper that "Trolley Fares Have Been Readjusted Again," the company has not yet stipulated any regulations for fare adjustment.

The enterprise center on the Japanese side is roughly as follows: Xingya Rubber Company manufactures automobile tires, Japan Rubber Company manufactures ordinary tires and rubber shoes, and Minghua Company manufactures bicycle tires, rubber belts, and other industrial products. On the Chinese side, a comprehensive merger will also be implemented with Da Zhonghua, Zhengtai XInji, Minsheng, Yonghe, Shuanglong, and other companies as the center.

### Silver Union Association and Money Shops Agree on Methods for Interbank Lending and Transferring Funds; Money Shops Can Re-lend from Silver Union Association; Term for Interbank Lending is Ten Days

In order to cooperate in regulating interbank funds and stabilizing finance, the Bank Joint Reserve Committee and the Money Industry Joint Reserve agreed on methods for cooperating in handling interbank lending and transferring funds for member banks and shops.

Money Shops Relay and Handle According to Regulations

From now on, each money shop will provide property and apply for lending, and the Silver Union Association will transfer it to the money shop for handling. However, if the money shop does not have enough funds, it may re-lend from the Silver Union Association. All lending methods will be handled in accordance with the Silver Union Association's "Provisional Measures for Handling Lending Matters for Various Banks and Shops." In addition to notifying member money shops to comply, the Money Shop has also stipulated the following three methods:

All Prospective Deposits Must Be Closed

1.  All bills and funds of each money shop should be paid and received exclusively from the current account of each shop in the Money Industry Reserve.
2.  All cash deposits and transfer deposits in the current account of each money shop originally deposited in the Reserve Association should be cleared and closed. From now on, the Reserve Association will stop receiving deposits from money shops.
3.  When each money shop needs to borrow transfer funds due to business needs, each shop will borrow exclusively from the Money Industry Reserve. From now on, the Reserve Association will stop directly lending transfer funds to money shops. As for those who have transfer loans in the Reserve Association, they should be paid off. Interbank loans from each bank will still be handled by the Bank Joint Reserve Committee. It is reported that the Silver Union Association and the Money Shop, in view of the tighter monetary base during the general closing period of each industry, are trying their best to handle interbank lending, but it is limited to transfer funds, and the lending period should not exceed ten days at most.

### Two Price Control Agencies Cooperate and Establish a Unified Control Mechanism to Evaluate Prices of Economic Core Items and Promote the Circulation of Materials for Production

The Shanghai Municipal Price Control Mechanism currently has two parallel agencies: the Price Countermeasures Committee and the Price Administration Bureau. The former focuses on deliberation, and the latter specializes in implementation. Both are determined to take economic core materials as the basis and stipulate appropriate prices. In order to expand production as much as possible and collect materials from all over, efforts are made to obtain raw materials from North China, Mengjiang, Manchuria, and the South, so as not to allow materials from various regions to accumulate and stagnate. At the same time, they will try their best to absorb idle funds and use them for legitimate production. In order to fully realize this, the Price Countermeasures Committee will be the center, and the relevant agencies will assist in the implementation.

Matters to Be Deliberated by the Countermeasures Committee

The Price Countermeasures Committee is organized by the Director of the Price Administration Bureau, the Grain Administration Officer, the Salt Administration Officer, the Construction or Social Administration Officer, and the Police Administration Officer. The Director of the Price Administration Bureau is the Chairman. The jurisdiction of the Countermeasures Committee is the jurisdiction of the Price Administration Bureau, and the matters for its deliberation are: (1) Matters related to the implementation of the central materials and price laws that should be coordinated; (2) Matters that must be added in accordance with the situation in this city within the scope permitted by the central materials and price laws; (3) Submitting petitions to the central government based on the situation in this city.

Organization and Functions of the Management Agency

The Price Administration Bureau is directly under the Ministry of Industry and is also supervised by the highest local administrative authority in this city to handle price management administrative affairs within its jurisdiction. There is one Director of the Bureau, and under it are three sections: General Affairs, Management, and Investigation. The General Affairs Section is in charge of general affairs, and the Management Section is in charge of (1) matters related to the allocation of materials, statistics of reference quantities, and applications; (2) matters related to the review and submission of material movement; (3) matters related to the allocation and supervision of materials; (4) matters related to the evaluation and review of prices; (5) matters related to the design of material and price management; (6) matters related to the regulation and management of materials; (7) matters related to the statistics and reporting of material production, sales, inventory, and accumulation.

### Retail Donations Underreported Will Be Severely Fined

The Public Concession Municipal Council issued a notice in July last year to collect a 2% retail donation, which was to be collected and remitted by companies and businesses in various industries. It is reported that various industries have spared no effort in collecting the retail donation. However, there are occasional cases of underreporting in order to obtain extra profits. The authorities have decided to severely crack down on this illegal situation. If the above situation is discovered in the future, a severe fine will be imposed in accordance with the law.

Six districts were established: Central, Mailan, Xiafei, Betang, Fuxu, and Xiaodongmen. Each district was divided into Baojia committees, with prominent figures in the district serving as members. Each district used the Lianbao as a unit as the basic-level organization. It is learned that since January of this year, the Baojia system in the French Concession has also adopted the guidance committee system. The previous Baojia Preparatory General Assembly and district committees have been abolished, and the candidates for the guidance committee and district chiefs have also been selected by the French Consul General.

### Absorption Already Occurring at Low Prices, Chinese Stocks Show a Glimmer of Hope

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market situation ended the fatigue of the past 13 days (excluding Sundays and holidays) and turned into a trend of rising from low levels. The rise in gold prices stimulated new and old investors to absorb at low prices. Stock traders also stopped selling and resumed buying, pulling up the prices vigorously. The cultural industry and department store stocks rose first. China Bookstore knocked on the 160 yuan mark, up 2.5 yuan. World Bookstore had news of returning the factory at the end of the month, rising to 145 yuan, a sudden increase of 3 yuan, and the buying momentum continued to increase. Commerce transactions were sparse and the price was flat, between 430 and 440 yuan. Wing On Company fell to 121.5 yuan and immediately rose to 127.5 yuan. Sincere rose to around 137 yuan. National Goods Company was bid up from 71.5 yuan to 73.5 yuan, each rising 1 or 2 yuan. Buying households in the public utility industry also rose in response. Zhabei Water and Electricity Company knocked on the 60 yuan mark. Chinese Electric was around 39 yuan, a rise of about 1 yuan. Nanyang Tobacco 118 yuan, rose to 122.5 yuan, then 120 yuan, a rise of 1 yuan. Great China Match's ex-dividend price fell again by 5 yuan, reaching 325 yuan. The new pharmaceutical industry first fell and then rose, still seeing a small squeeze. New Asia rose from 22 yuan to 23.5 yuan, still lower by 7 jiao and 5 fen. Minyi alone fell without recovering, falling to around 60 yuan, down 1 yuan. Zhongfa first fell to 25 yuan, then recovered to 26.5 yuan, a flat squeeze. Wuzhou fell by 5 yuan to 675 yuan. Xinyi alone rose to 255 yuan. Sino-Western traded at 440 yuan, a flat squeeze. The textile industry finally squeezed a little. Wing On Textile Factory was around 335 yuan, down another 5 yuan. Meiya Silk Factory was between 66 and 7 yuan. Kaili Silk and Satin did 14 yuan. Small-denomination textile industries were also flat. Among the financial stocks, Huai Bank rose again to 150 yuan, Shanghai Bank 625 yuan, and Zhejiang Xing 700 yuan, all had buying households. Chinese Securities flew up again to 130 yuan, a huge increase of 20 yuan. Kangyuan Canned Food traded quite a lot at around 50 yuan and 5 jiao. Pudong Electric was 110 yuan. According to all parties, people's hearts have turned to prosperity, and the future of the stock market is optimistic. The Public Industry Association will resume business in the middle of next month, mainly operating Chinese stocks. The appearance and trading of old stocks is no longer a problem, which is also a reason for the turnaround. Trading suddenly became strong. The record is shown below:

### Government Bonds Fluctuate, Sellers Relatively Advantageous

Yesterday's government bond trading was still quite chaotic. Due to the situation and the shock of people's hearts, the buyers and sellers had different views. However, the sellers were still relatively advantageous. This is still due to the tight money supply and the cause of the end of the year, and has absolutely nothing to do with the situation. Yesterday, Type C first traded at over 9 yuan, and the price gradually decreased. The smallest trade was 7 yuan and 8 jiao, and finally recovered to the 9 yuan range. The chaos of people's hearts can be seen here. Type D was only 6 yuan and several jiao, which was the lowest price for various government bonds. There were not many other transactions.

### Gold Prices Rise Again

Yesterday, the Shanghai Silver Industry Association's Daxin Tonghang jewelry gold retail price was not changed on the storefront listing, still 3,050 yuan per tael (250 yuan less for purchases). The interbank trading price first rose sharply and then recovered slightly. It was because a certain gang was responding to the retail purchase and exchange force. Later, because it was close to the listed price, the buying stopped. Since the morning, it rose by 140 yuan in the buying trend. 2,950 yuan was the first transaction price. Russia continued to be bought by buyers, rising to 3,045 yuan. It began to gradually decline at noon. There were sellers at 3,000 yuan at noon, an increase of 190 yuan, with a difference of 95 yuan. The trading was clear and sparse. The price of jewelry patterned silver was still listed at 16 yuan per tael, and the interbank trading price was 17 yuan and 7 yuan and 2 jiao.

The money industry association's interbank lending rate was still 1 jiao and 7 fen, unchanged.

### Military Tickets Rise and Fall Very Little

Yesterday's military tickets were slightly tired. The interbank trading price was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen, 1 or 2 li. The purchase and sale price of small money shops and silver shops was 5 yuan, 5 jiao, 5 fen and a half, and 4 fen and a half. In addition to the slight recovery of the United Bank notes, the operators sold them for 3 yuan, 7 jiao and a half, and bought them for 7 jiao.

### Another Batch of Jinshan Branches Arrives

Recently, another batch of Guangdong Jinshan branches has arrived. There are both round and flat patterns. The asking price is 650 yuan. However, because the sales are stagnant and the money is tight, it is difficult to get your hands on them.

### Grains and Cereals Show a Dull Trend

The new grain market was quite sluggish yesterday. Due to the severe cold weather, sales were slow, resulting in low supply and demand and extremely rare transactions. The market showed little vitality. Only twenty packages of Chongming red sand rice were opened for sale at a price of thirty-five yuan, Changji bean cakes five hundred pieces, priced at ninety yuan and five jiao, and Yuanlong bean cakes one cart, priced at ninety-one yuan and a half.

### Wood Fuel Sources to Decrease

The main sources of wood fuel for this port are Hangzhou and Jiaxing, etc. Last summer, the Ji Xiang relationship began in the countryside. The authorities ordered farmers to cut down trees to prevent them from being occupied by guerrillas. Therefore, the price of firewood in both places was low, and it was quite profitable to transport it to Shanghai for sale. However, recently, during the rural pacification in Zhejiang Province, the authorities, seeing that wood fuel from Hangzhou, Jiaxing and other places was being continuously transported to Shanghai by merchants, feared that there would be a shortage of local fuel. Therefore, they have issued an order that no wood fuel from the pacified areas shall be transported out. It is now the middle of winter, and the demand for wood fuel in this port is higher than usual. The restrictions on the source will certainly have an impact.

### Fine Woolen Fabrics Are a Rare Commodity

Fine woolen fabrics woven from fine wool are difficult to obtain even at high prices due to the limited raw materials. Production by large and small Japanese and Chinese factories will naturally continue to decrease. A survey of the old stock of finished products in internal and external warehouses and stores shows that they are already depleted. People in the same industry are all optimistic and regard them as rare commodities. Those who have goods in hand are unwilling to sell them, preferring to keep them until spring and summer for their own social needs. As a result, the market for light and thin woolen fabrics and serge, which are popular items in the summer, is very tight, and prices are rising abnormally. Most are not yet offering prices.

### Cigarette Popularity Remains Strong

The cigarette market continues to rise. Because the allocation procedures of the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association have not been completely determined, the delivery of goods has also been suspended. However, actual sales are still brisk, leading to a positive outlook. Therefore, prices continue to rise. For example, Grandee cigarettes are priced at nine thousand eight hundred and fifty yuan, Old Gold cigarettes are priced at eight thousand eight hundred yuan, Pin Hai cigarettes are priced at seven thousand four hundred yuan, Fairy cigarettes are priced at seven thousand six hundred and fifty yuan, and Wu Hua cigarettes are priced at six thousand two hundred and fifty yuan, which is an increase of one or two hundred yuan compared to the weekend. Japanese Golden Bat cigarettes are priced at three thousand yuan, Golden Mansion cigarettes are priced at three thousand seven hundred yuan, Red Rose cigarettes are priced at two thousand seven hundred and fifty yuan, All Six cigarettes are priced at three thousand yuan, Guide cigarettes are priced at two thousand seven hundred yuan, National Golden Pagoda cigarettes are priced at six thousand three hundred yuan, Beautiful cigarettes are priced at five thousand six hundred yuan, Golden Mouse cigarettes are priced at four thousand yuan, and White Gold Dragon cigarettes are priced at three thousand nine hundred yuan, which are also on the rise.

### Gambier Sales Are Scattered

There is no shortage of gambier in the market, but sales are mostly scattered. Currently, medium-sized grains are priced at five thousand one hundred and two hundred yuan, and the trend is stable. Yantai goods are quoted at four thousand yuan, but transactions are rare.

### Qingdao's Economic Construction Trends - Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 4th -

At the end of last year, there were two main trends in Qingdao's construction: one was the establishment of the "North China Industrial Group Association" in Qingdao on the 18th, which launched a fierce attack on the industrial cities of North China. The other was the establishment of the "North China Shipping and Private Ship Joint Venture" in Qingdao on the 23rd, which is a powerful regulatory body for the shipping industry in North China. The former was the result of a proposal by the "Qingdao Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry." Through this, industrial groups in Tianjin, Jinan, Qingdao, Beijing, etc., were linked together to rapidly enhance the industrial strength of the entire North China region. In particular, the rational operation of the association will greatly promote the planned reorganization of industrial sectors in various regions, which was a pending issue. At present, the urgent task of the North China economy is to establish a self-sufficient system in the region, and the industrial sector is the foundation of its productivity. This unity indicates North China's determination to move forward with the third year of the war as its goal.

The latter is composed of the massive maritime transport capacity of steamships and private ships existing throughout North China. With Qingdao Port as its center, it aims to perfect the exchange of materials and transportation along the coast of North China, and represents the wartime system of North China's shipping industry. Both of these place their functional hubs in Qingdao, which is of great significance.

Last year's construction goal for Qingdao was to comprehensively develop Shandong's resources and maximize the value of Qingdao Port, which is known as the best in North China. Qingdao, which was known as a "light industrial city," has been transformed into a "heavy chemical industrial city" in the heart of North China. At present, Shandong Province's new industrial policy, with Qingdao Port as its center, shows its rapid development, which is a noteworthy trend. (Talent Translation)

### The Literature We Need

— E Sheng

Everyone admits that literature is a reflection of the times and society, and the different natures of literature are divided according to the different characteristics of the times and society. The era before us—an era called the twentieth century—where exactly does its "greatness" lie? As usual, it can be reflected in general literary works.

Yes, the mid-twentieth century is such a great era; the environment is changing rapidly, history is constantly unfolding, and countless changes occur in an instant, changes that are as fast as lightning. Yesterday, even an hour ago, is considered a thing of the past. Only today's, within the current minute, can be called new! Getting rid of the old and bringing forth the new is the characteristic of this era.

Look, isn't the whole earth in a state of intense turmoil right now? The few nations that have always considered themselves the big brother and looked down on everything are approaching the end of their rope. The entire world, along with other creators, is transforming into another new situation, a new order, one step after another, one step faster after another, marching towards a brand-new path of light.

In this era, what we need is revolutionary literature, and only it can calmly and promptly meet and absorb the rapid changes of the times, just like a camera uses a nimble light-sensitive speed to capture a speeding train. We also need popular, mass-based literature, popular enough for every level of society to understand and comprehend, because we know deeply that literature is not originally a pastime for "literati and scholars" in their leisure time; on the contrary, we want to take the consciousness of the masses as our consciousness, and the progress of society as our progress.

We do not need "low taste," "praising the wind and moon," "me and you," and "talking about nothing but the past," "examining nothing without proof" kind of literature. In particular, in order to save resources and maintain morality, we need to use a "quick knife to cut through tangled hemp" to thoroughly clear out general pornographic literature that kills without bloodshed.

### Border of India and Tibet (Part 2)

— Jiayuan

There are 2,000 overseas Chinese living here. It is said that during the war in Myanmar, Calcutta was once tense, and more than 3,000 overseas Chinese moved here at that time. Now they have returned to Calcutta.

The city has a population of 20,000, apart from a few British and Chinese, most of whom are people of various races.

Although the city is not large, there are all kinds of shops, but it is not lively. There are only two larger foreign goods stores, and there are also very few hotels and restaurants. The better inns are built on quiet hilltops, specially for tourists to stay in. The most famous of these is the Himalaya Hotel, which was established by Europeans.

The police station is located at the entrance. It is not large, and there are not many police officers in uniform. Because its political division belongs to the Darjeeling district, this place may be a branch bureau. When I went to report, there were only a few people in the entire office.

A Record of "China Elementary School"

The next day, I visited Principal Shen Fumin of the "China Elementary School" in Kalimpong. The school site is also located on the main road. The school buildings are several rented thatched houses, with two classrooms and sixty or seventy students. There were originally three teachers, but due to financial reasons, they all left one after another. It has not been officially established for even a year. According to Shen Fumin, in the current situation, the school has no room for development. Because the power of the school is completely in the hands of the school board, which is hired by the Consul General stationed in Calcutta. They are all local businessmen who are ignorant of education. They originally hoped that they would donate to the school. In fact, they believed that the school's expenses should be borne by the government, and they were only appointed managers! All financial power is completely in the hands of the chairman of the board, and it is very difficult to use even a penny. It is said that when it was first established, it was planned to make forty desks and benches, but they all thought it was too much, which resulted in too many students later and no way to accommodate them.

The government subsidy is issued every six months. When the funds have not arrived, the school has no way to raise funds. The school board is also not responsible, so that currently only the principal is left in the school, shuttling between the two classrooms. The school board rarely convenes, and even if it does, there are no results. The school board originally had a lot of funds for building a school building, but it is not allowed to be used for other items. The fund is neither deposited in the bank to earn interest, nor is it used to purchase materials. Originally, the cost of building a school building was only a limited difference, but now, due to frequent price increases, the difference is even greater.

The school was originally a compulsory system and did not charge tuition fees, so the school itself had no income, which was very difficult. Most of the students at the school are children from poor families, and the children of the wealthy school board members are sent to schools founded by the British. They do not hesitate to spend huge sums of two or three hundred rupees per student per year to send them to British schools as tuition. The textbooks of the British schools mostly teach students (how to be a good shoemaker, a good tailor in the future). It is not like our schools teach students "how to be a good citizen, a good aviator in the future." Many Tibetans, Bhutanese, and Nepalese people praise the excellence of our school's textbooks and hope to send their children to our school. However, the school itself is limited by financial resources and manpower, so it is difficult to fulfill their wishes. Especially the simplicity of the equipment and the shabbiness of the buildings, compared with British schools, are really dwarfed. Unfortunately, the current school board members do not understand the relationship between Kalimpong and China, nor do they understand the importance of the school, and regard the school as unimportant. It is really a pity.

First Sight of the Himalayas

Principal Shen is good at painting and graduated from the Beijing Academy of Fine Arts. Since taking on this position, he has been in a beautiful scenic area and has worked even harder on his painting. To admire the beauty of the Himalayas, he specifically lives in the home of a wealthy overseas Chinese merchant on the mountain foot outside the city. Every morning at sunrise, when the peaks of the Himalayas reveal their true face, he uses his brush to paint them. At the invitation of Principal Shen, I went to his residence with the moon that night. After walking one or two miles, there was a beautiful foreign building on the hillside on the side of the road. The owner, Mr. Li, was from Guangdong. He came to India thirty years ago. He was originally a carpenter, but later moved here due to successful business operations. He has two sons. The elder son received a degree in architectural engineering from the UK and is now specializing in contracting engineering affairs. Principal Shen lives in another hut next to the foreign building.

### The Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yijin

(4)

One day, he was climbing Great Goble, he saw a girl waving excitedly on a precarious cliff. He thought she was in trouble, so he rushed towards her, but in doing so, he slipped and twisted his ankle. In fact, she was not in any trouble. She was just greeting a friend far below the mountain; she was a mountaineering expert, far better than Chips, who could only climb a little. That's how he knew that he was supposed to be the rescuer, but now he had become the rescued; however, he didn't have much interest in playing either role. Because he had said that he didn't pay attention to women; he had never felt at ease with them; the "new women" after 1890 had begun to be talked about, and this monster simply terrified him. He was a quiet, conservative man, and the world, as seen from the world of Brookfield, seemed to be filled with hateful innovations; there was a fellow named Bernard Shaw, whose views were the most bizarre and unforgivable; there was also Ibsen: writing seductive plays: and now there was this new cycling maniac, cycling was originally a child's affair, but now even women were doing it. Chips did not understand any of this modern novelty and freedom. His ideas were somewhat vague, and to be specific, he always thought that beautiful women were delicate and gentle, and that beautiful men should be courteous but inevitably distant when dealing with them. Therefore, he did not expect to meet a woman on the top of Great Goble; however, what was even more terrible was that the woman he met seemed to need a man's help at first, but the result was the opposite, she helped him. Because she did it after all. She and her friends had to do that. He could hardly move, and it was indeed not an easy task to get him down from the steep mountain path to Wasterdale. (9)

Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association Subsidizes Funds to Wuhu to Purchase Rice

At first, I seemed indifferent to the name of the factory, and after a long time, I had forgotten about it. Recently, I learned that it is still continuing. At this time of extreme food shortage and soaring prices, being able to maintain it for five months must have something worth studying. Therefore, I went to Guandi Temple in Laoximen to take a look. I was led in by the monks of the temple and suddenly saw poor people with pigeon-like faces, supporting the old and carrying the young, gathered between the two corridors and courtyards to eat porridge, bustling with activity, numbering more than 6,000 people. (In fact, only 3,500 porridge certificates were received. Since one serving of porridge can feed two people, hence this number.) The main food of the factory is corn flour, broken rice, and sweet potatoes. From 8:00 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every morning, the time is rushed, but the order is orderly. Enter from the east, verify the certificates, issue tokens, and stamp them to receive the porridge. The porridge is forty-two taels. Except for the disabled and sick, who can entrust someone to collect it on their behalf after verification, they are only allowed to eat in the factory and are not allowed to take it outside to prevent the abuse of reselling the porridge. After eating, they leave from the west gate. There are several monks at the verification office who knock on bells and chimes and loudly lead them to recite Buddhist scriptures. The reason for leading people to recite Buddhist scriptures is nothing more than to eliminate disasters and plant blessings. Buddhism emphasizes causality. The bitter fruit we are suffering now all comes from the evil causes we planted in the past. Bodhisattvas fear causes, and sentient beings fear consequences, so it cannot be viewed with superstition. The target of the factory's porridge distribution is limited to good people and hidden poor in Nanshi. First, the porridge certificates are entrusted to the five ward chiefs to investigate door to door. Those who are verified to be true are given them. Beggars and vagrants are not included. The economic source originally depended on donations from all walks of life, but the income received in recent months has not been abundant. Adding the factory directors' advances, it can only support for another month. Fortunately, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association subsidized 120,000 yuan to purchase broken rice in Wuhu. If it can be transported to Shanghai, it can continue for several months. The reporter cannot help but burn incense and pray for the poor to get what they want. In addition, the factory's attached clothing distribution center has produced 13,800 sets of cotton clothes and trousers, costing 380,000 yuan. In addition to the 200,000 yuan assisted by the Poor and Sick Relief Association, the rest is being raised. It has been distributed locally in this port, and there are still more than 1,000 sets waiting to be transported to the Suzhou and Hangzhou areas for distribution. That day happened to be the meeting of the standing directors of the factory. I learned that the people who bear the actual responsibility are the four standing directors, Rong Shouhou, Shan Zhongfan, Master Kuan Dao, and Zhu Zhongda. The chairman of the board is Shi Shengzhi, and the vice-chairmen are foreign monks Fujii Shizui and Master Fan Cheng. The economic directors are Nie Yuntai and Wu Yun. The rest of the directors are all gentry, merchants, and scholars who are responsible for current affairs. As for the staff, they are half monks and half laymen. Although the treatment is very meager, they serve diligently. This kind of altruistic spirit is very commendable. When asked about the motivation and purpose of the founding, Master Kuan Dao said: Buddhism emphasizes compassion, Confucianism advocates loyalty and forgiveness, and Christianity values ​​love. Although the schools are different, the purpose of benefiting people is the same. Recently, Confucianism and Taoism have declined, and Christianity occupies an advantage because it can guide people in a popular and beneficial way and is pragmatic. My Buddhism teaches the universal benefit of people and heaven, and the matter and principles are perfectly integrated. Originally, it can be followed by people from all over the world without being promoted. The reason why it is not valued by society is that many monks avoid the world, enjoy cultivating the vehicle, and lack the spirit of serving the public, teaching people the incurable diseases that are out of touch with the times. For the sake of today, the only way is to focus on reality, do more social work, and show the spirit of Mahayana salvation. Distributing porridge and clothes may be the beginning! What I have seen and heard is as follows, so I am happy to write it down.

### Shifting Congratulatory Gifts to Poverty Relief

Yesterday, the north wind was blowing tightly, and the water was freezing into ice. Every time I think of the displaced compatriots who have no clothes and no food, compassion and sympathy arise spontaneously. Received a letter from Mr. Gan Dounan: "My friend, Mr. Dong Zhenfu, is enthusiastic about public welfare and charitable. Today, he has the joy of holding his grandchildren. He will donate all the congratulatory gifts of 1,000 yuan from relatives and friends to poverty relief to benefit the displaced compatriots who are suffering from hunger and cold. He entrusted me to forward it, so please check and collect it." Shifting congratulatory gifts to poverty relief, the giver and the receiver, plant good causes with each other, and achieve good results together. I hope that all sectors of society will follow suit. How fortunate! How fortunate!

### Ren Shoujun Responds to the YWCA's Winter Clothing Donation

(A letter from Ren Shoujun) The news of the YWCA's distribution of winter clothes was published in your newspaper on the 8th. The relief is timely, and it is really good news for our poor compatriots. Considering that the association is still short of more than 8,000 yuan for donations due to the increase in the number of clothes made this time, I hereby donate 3,000 yuan within my ability and ask you to forward it to the association. I also hope that people from all walks of life who are capable will donate generously, so that the association can distribute one more winter coat, which means saving one more life. It is really immeasurable merit. (Editor's note: The donation of 3,000 yuan will be forwarded to the YWCA immediately.)
