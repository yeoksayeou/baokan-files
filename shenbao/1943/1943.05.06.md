### Unfolding the Scientific Movement

Science is a sharp weapon for the progress of human civilization. Countries with advanced science are bound to be prosperous and strong; conversely, countries with backward science will inevitably remain poor and weak. Especially in the current warring nations, there are highly developed science and technology. From war institutions to production lines, all are based on scientific methods and utilize scientific achievements to compete with each other and establish the nation in a safe domain. Therefore, some say that modern warfare is a war of science, which is by no means unfounded.

Taking some obvious examples in this World War, countries with scientific progress are certain to grasp the victory of the war. As pointed out by Japanese Army Affairs Bureau Chief Sato in his speech at the Army Technology Research Association on April 14: "In the North African war last summer," the German and Italian armies conquered the fortress of Tobruk overnight, drove straight into Egypt, and Alexandria was in sight. The great success of this campaign was due to the German army's invention of war weapons and the new improvement of the air-conditioning device in tanks. The reason why the Red Army's winter offensive this winter had unexpected power was due to the Red Army's war equipment and the preparation of anti-tank weapons, and the thorough training in the use of these mechanized units, which were powerful main reasons. "Similarly, Japan's victory in the Pacific, in addition to the combat spirit of the soldiers and the strategic superiority of the generals, is also attributed to the result of Japan's decades of dedicated research and development of science.

This newspaper has published the achievements of Japanese scientific research for several days in a row. From here, we can see the strength of a country and its invincibility in combat, causing the British and Americans, who have always boasted of being the world's most powerful industrial countries, to repeatedly lose, which is by no means a fluke. However, the development of Japan's heavy industry sector was originally relatively backward, so production science can undoubtedly be said to be quite slow. It was only since the war, especially recently, that there has been an astonishing leap, but Japanese authorities and scientists still do not consider it sufficient and are still working hard to research greater achievements in order to seek to surpass Britain and the United States in both quality and quantity and establish the necessary state of a scientific war.

China in modern times is a country with backward culture and a naive industry. Although the scientific movement began during the Reform Movement of 1898, due to years of natural and man-made disasters, both internal and external troubles, the government has no time to advocate scientific undertakings, and people with lofty ideals have no way to study with peace of mind. Compared with the scientific progress of the world powers, it is impossible not to sigh with admiration. Today's era is no longer the ancient times of "working at sunrise, resting at sunset, hearing the sounds of chickens and dogs, and people not visiting each other until old age and death." The metaphysical philosophy of the ancient sages and the so-called "spiritual strategy" can never be applied to the current environment and save our country and nation. More positively, we have now declared war on scientifically developed countries such as Britain and the United States. Considering our current backward scientific situation, we should catch up quickly and launch a scientific movement as soon as possible.

In order to launch a scientific movement, we first hope that the government authorities will take the fact that Japan has caught up with Britain and the United States in a short period of time as a basis, accept the experience of the arduous struggle of the Japanese scientific community, and establish a national policy for developing the scientific movement. First, the central and local governments should designate a considerable amount of funds, on the one hand, to improve the subjects of universities and specialized schools and increase the hours of scientific research; on the other hand, to encourage all scientific inventions and research by the people and provide material assistance to those who are committed to science.

Secondly, we hope that the public and private scientific research institutions that have been established should be unified and linked in a planned way under the guidance of the government to complete the wartime scientific mobilization system. At the same time, we should jointly seek close connection and coordination between science and technology and industry, eliminate all estrangement and contradictions between each other, and enable science and technology to exert their greatest functions in increasing production.

Thirdly, we hope even more that, as Japanese public opinion hopes, we will establish a reward system for diligent labor and invention and give spiritual preferential treatment to scientific and technical personnel. Japan has long had rules such as the "Technical Achievement Medal" and the "Diligent Labor Achievement Medal." Germany also has a method of awarding the "Medal of Honor" to scientific inventors. At a time when China lacks scientific talents, this kind of superior reward is even more indispensable.

Finally, we hope even more that the Japanese scientific and technological community will provide great assistance to the development of China's scientific movement, especially in the cultivation of talents and the guidance of technology. Recently, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo said that the current war is a "daily competition of science and science, technology and technology" (quoted from the editorial of the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on April 16). We deeply hope that the authorities and scientists will know how to strive!

Starting at 9:00 a.m. today, it was grandly held at the gymnasium of the National Central University. Five hundred male and female students from large, medium, and small schools in Nanjing participated as representatives of the youth league athletes. At the opening ceremony, Chairman Wang, wearing the marshal's dress, personally delivered a speech. The speech stated that on the occasion of Youth Day, students across the country should not only understand the spirit of the New National Movement, but also achieve the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia with a lively spirit and a healthy body. The words were earnest, and all listeners were moved.

### Ye Peng Speaks in Japan Elaborating on the Impressions of the Inspection Japanese Soldiers are of Excellent Quality and Military Equipment is Sophisticated China's Military Building Must be Assisted by Japan

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in Tokyo on April 27, the Chinese Military Inspection Group to Japan inspected various aspects of the Japanese Army in order to contribute to China's military building work. The head of the delegation, General Ye Peng, Minister of the Army of the National Government, and the deputy head of the delegation, Sun Liangcheng, Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army, Lieutenant General Xiang Zhizhuang, Chief of Staff of the Military Commission, and Lieutenant General Shao Wenkai, Commander of the Gendarmerie of the North China Pacification Army, and other senior Chinese army generals, spoke on the 3rd at the Imperial Hotel here about their impressions of this visit to Japan and the warm belief in Sino-Japanese cooperation after the completion of military building in the future. General Ye Peng, head of the delegation, said: "When participating in the Tencho-setsu (Emperor's Birthday) parade on April 29, the most admirable thing was the perfection of the mechanized equipment of the Japanese Army and the excellence of the soldiers' skills. The exercise of the Japanese Air Force in the sky over the parade ground on that day was especially admirable. I firmly believe that the Japanese Army is the most excellent army in the world, which is due to the unique spirit of the Japanese soldiers understanding the center of the imperial family, and at the same time, they have received strict education and training, so they have today's achievements. Secondly, with regard to military production, judging only from the factories I saw in a short time, for example, the tanks made with Japan's unique technology are superior to those made in Germany. I now recognize that this is also a manifestation of the Japanese national spirit. The Chinese army is currently only cooperating with the Japanese army in restoring治安 (public order), and in the future, it should improve education, improve quality, cultivate strength, and engage in the Greater East Asia War, and establish an army like the Japanese army. This is the unanimous and ardent hope of the Chinese army cadres. However, modern equipment cannot be started without Japan's close assistance. Recently, the decline in the strength of the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing is a very obvious fact. The reason for this is nothing more than that Japan respects China's independent and autonomous stand and provides sincere assistance, so the Yu (Chongqing) side has lost the significance of the anti-Japanese war. Japan has continued to fight for six years, and its national strength has become more and more abundant, and after directly fighting with Britain and the United States, it has re-secured an immovable strategic advantage in East Asia. Chongqing's blood transfusion route has been blocked, and only the Northwest Highway remains. Because the United States' assistance is useless, it is also impossible to continue the anti-Japanese war independently. It is natural for the people under Chongqing's rule to realize that Britain is not reliable and that the anti-Japanese war is useless. After China participated in the war, the country gradually decided to unite, and all hoped to cooperate with friendly Japan to jointly build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### The Japanese Army in Central Hebei Expands its Battle Results The Longhai Railway Also Achieves Victory

Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the front line of the Japanese Army in Central Hebei on the 5th, after the Japanese Army surrounded the dispersed Yu (Chongqing) Army in Central Hebei, it cut off their mutual contact and implemented individual annihilation. Since the 3rd, the battle results have become greater and greater, and the Yu Army there is about to be completely annihilated. At dawn on the 3rd, the Japanese Army first defeated the Yu Army near the north of Ding County and destroyed its grain and grass warehouse, and is now continuing to mop up. In addition, a certain unit of the Japanese Army cleared the Yu Army in the east of the division and continued to pursue them, and intercepted a large batch of white rice hidden by the Yu Army on the way, and threatened its transportation line. Another unit of the Japanese Army, when searching the Tonglong Mountain in the west of the division and the caves behind the northern mountain, found two mortars, six rifles, landmines, bedding, and other military supplies abandoned by the Yu Army. On the 4th, they attacked the remnants of the Yu Army in the mountains southeast of Chicheng in the northwest of Tang County and defeated them in one fell swoop.

Xuzhou, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Army recently launched a fierce attack on 2,000 people of Li Xianzhu's 93rd Army of the Yu Army near 25 kilometers southeast of Dangshan on the Longhai Railway and is continuing to expand the battle results.

### Japanese Dispatch Army Studies the Prevalence of Kala-Azar

Beijing, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese China Dispatch Army troops often study various medical buildings during the spare time of combat in order to eradicate infectious diseases prevalent in China. For example, recently, preventive medicines for eradicating kala-azar and preventing dysentery and cholera bacteria have been discovered, which have greatly benefited the Chinese people. Among them, kala-azar is a unique endemic disease in northern China, which has spread to various places along the Yellow River for many years and has caused great harm. The Japanese Army's rural troops, in order to eradicate this evil epidemic, began to study it two and a half years ago, went to various parts of northern China to conduct field surveys, and visited hospitals in 13 countries including China, Japan, Germany, Italy, France, Belgium, and Switzerland, and carefully investigated its source. After a year and a half, they finally reached a conclusion that the most rampant areas of kala-azar are Xuzhou, Huai'an, and Haizhou in the north of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces. After the middle of the 19th century, a major epidemic was brewed near Suining, Lingxian, and Sixian, and the current state of its spread was detected, dividing it into four routes: one went north along the Jinpu Railway to Jinan and then east along the Jiaoji Railway; from near Haizhou via sea to Zhifu and Weihaiwei; three went north along the Pinghan Railway to Beijing; and four spread to Xi'an along the Longhai Railway. In addition, the infection period of kala-azar is mostly between May and July, and it occurs in August and September in plains with lower sea levels and is prevalent in rural areas with limestone alluvial strata and more stagnant water lakes and marshes. In addition, the results of another Japanese Army unit's research on cholera bacteria in mainland China confirmed that this bacterium came from overseas and was spread from southern China and Southeast Asia. It is firmly believed that the immune efficacy of using epidemic bacteria as a preventive cholera inoculation vaccine can be said to be the greatest.

### Li Shiqun Talks about the Qingxiang Problem in Guangdong The Implementation Date Has Not Yet Been Decided Preparations Have Already Begun

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) - Li Shiqun, Secretary-General of the Qingxiang Committee, was ordered to go to Guangdong some time ago to guide the Guangdong Province in preparing for the Qingxiang affairs, and flew back to the capital on the 2nd. The reporter specially visited Mr. Li at his official residence on the morning of the 5th, and was given the following speech: "I was ordered by the Chairman and concurrently the Chairman of the Committee to go to Guangdong to discuss the preparations for the Qingxiang affairs, and I started my journey on the 29th of last month. According to my previous position as the Minister of Police Affairs, I went to Guangdong to inspect the police affairs of Guangdong Province. Now, I am revisiting the old place, although only a few days have passed, the progress of the government of Guangdong Province, taking Guangzhou City as an example, has a population of more than 720,000, which shows that the治安 (public order) is solid, the economy is prosperous, and there is a leap in education. The precision and rigor of the organization and training of youth and adolescents is the crown of the country, which is probably due to the leadership of Governor Chen and the efforts of the authorities. As for the Qingxiang affairs in Guangdong Province, Governor Chen will be the center, and it will be vigorously launched under the leadership of the Qingxiang Committee. I arrived in Guangdong on the 29th and convened a Qingxiang symposium on the 30th to jointly discuss the progress. Governor Chen and the local liaison minister of friendly countries attended the meeting and discussed it. As a result of the agreement, the opinions were extremely consistent, so after returning to Beijing, I have already reported to the Chairman and asked for instructions. At present, there are roughly two major problems in the Guangdong Qingxiang: (1) the preparatory work for manpower, such as the training of party, government, military, police, blockade, and propaganda personnel; (2) the financial problem. In view of the current situation in Guangdong Province, if it is to bear the Qingxiang expenses alone, it may feel difficult, and the central government is slightly richer in subsidies. The formal start date of the Qingxiang has not yet been determined, but the preparations have already begun. In the future, the situation will be considered, or the precedents of Qingxiang in various places will be followed. The Guangdong Provincial Branch of the Committee should be concurrently held by Governor Chen in order to achieve the integration of the party, government, military, and police. Once the Qingxiang work begins, we will see the strengthening of the治安 (public order) and the improvement of people's livelihood, which will not only expand the political power of Guangdong Province, but also expand the political power of the National Government.』

### German Newspaper Comments on Major General Tanihagi's Speech Saying Japan Will Launch Another Major Offensive

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The Deutsche Volkszeitung here published on the 4th a message and commentary on the speech by Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Press Department, in Nagoya on April 30 regarding the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, predicting that the Japanese army will launch another large-scale offensive. The message said that the Japanese army today is much stronger than it was at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. As Major General Tanihagi said, the Japanese army is ready to launch a large-scale new offensive at any time and anywhere. In the four months after the start of the war, the Japanese army obtained an infinite amount of stored resources and obtained a position sufficient to continue the war independently. The Japanese navy has increased eightfold compared to the start of the war. If the British and American armies think that the Japanese army is standing idly by while confronting the German army in the European theater, they will suffer the consequences. Regarding this point, Major General Tanihagi said that Japan must carry out preparatory slogans in order to launch a large-scale offensive, which has a profound meaning. Although the military experts of the anti-Axis powers have not predicted when the Japanese army will launch the offensive, they are in complete agreement that the Japanese army's wait-and-see attitude in the Pacific will soon end.

### Japan's National Savings are Stimulated

### After the Great Defeat in the Air Battle of Darwin, Australians Were Extremely Frustrated. Japanese Air Force's Long-Range Intense Bombing May Be a Prelude to an Offensive Against Australia

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) – Following the Japanese air force's air raid on Darwin Port on the 2nd, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command only announced that the losses in the air battle were very heavy. In addition, no accurate figures were released, which suggests that the Japanese air force's attack this time seems to have dealt a significant blow to Australia. Australian military headquarters authorities stated on the 4th that the Japanese military may continue to bomb Australia in the future to scout out Australian military strength. It can be seen from this battle that the Japanese air force does have the strength to carry out long-range large-scale bombings. At the same time, there is much discussion in Australia, and the fact that the British-made Spitfire fighters, which are touted by the anti-Axis camp as the best in the world, did not exert their power in this air battle has become a point of silent criticism. The Australian Broadcasting Corporation even had a humorous broadcast saying, "The reason why the Spitfire squadrons suffered such great losses was due to the bad weather. The Spitfire squadrons were forced to fly over the distant ocean as a result of the air battle with enemy aircraft. When they returned after the end of the air battle, they encountered headwinds on the way, so many accidents occurred. Previously, we believed that the Spitfire pilots could deal with the Japanese air force, so if they were on an equal footing, they would not be defeated. Therefore, our previous confidence has no reason to be frustrated." In addition, the anti-Axis command also stated, "The losses were extremely large due to the bad weather." A British correspondent also said that some pilots who were shot down in combat with the Japanese air force survived by using parachutes. However, this is not enough to give Australians comfort.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency)

Gedde, the former Associated Press correspondent in Hong Kong, sent a message today from an air force base in northwestern Australia, saying that the air raid on Darwin Port on Sunday showed the Japanese air force's ability to carry out long-range intense bombing, which may be a prelude to an offensive against Australia. Australian aviation experts believe that the main purpose of the Japanese air raid this time was to test the anti-Axis air defense forces. According to reports received here, it is unanimously stated that the Japanese are now strengthening existing airfields and building new ones to enhance their position. This bombing has shown that the Japanese air force can launch powerful attacks from remote bases. Spitfire fighters stationed at Darwin Port took off on Sunday to intercept Japanese aircraft, but suffered considerable losses while fighting in the Arafura Sea near the port. The Australian communiqué has acknowledged this fact.

### New Weapon in Japanese Wartime Science

A New Method of Hangar Construction: "Of course, because the basic research does not yet have sufficient confidence, we will continue to work hard in the future." This is the statement of Mr. Kaoru Takayama, a construction technology captain of the Army Aviation Headquarters.

Captain Takayama has completed a method of creating large buildings by joining wood together using only nails. Large hangars with a span of forty-two meters can be built very strongly without using steel materials, and the construction time is greatly shortened. This is truly a major revolution in wooden construction in the future. It can be seen in the state of craftsmen building houses that the connection of wood to wood is to build the skeleton of a spliced building. There are various complex mortise and tenon joints connected together, and if you want to build a large building, you need various steel materials such as iron bolts and iron pins to tighten the joints. When building the skeleton, nails are not used at all. Nails are only used when installing the ridge beam. This is the standard way of wooden construction. Manufacturing mortise and tenon joints in wood takes a long time, and using iron bolts requires a lot of steel materials. Nailing it together is very economical and quick.

Captain Takayama, in the spring of the year following the outbreak of the China Incident, namely Showa 13 (1938), devoted himself to the study of nails during his spare time for half a year. As a result, it became possible to build large buildings using so-called "three-inch nails" that are four inches long, and it also became possible to build hangars in a short period of time. From the perspective of construction conventions, this is an extremely dangerous method, and those involved are very worried, so no one asks for advice. If this method can be realized, then the iron bones used in hangars before can be saved to make cannons, tanks, and bullets. No matter what, it must be realized, so there is the above-mentioned "continue to work hard" statement. His enthusiasm finally moved the hearts of those involved, and construction began in the autumn of Showa 13 (1938).

Even using steel bones, it is not easy to build a skeleton with a span of forty meters. If wood is only joined together with nails, then during the construction process, there is always the worry that it may collapse. This is why most people are not at ease. Captain Takayama was full of confidence and urged the construction of a huge skeleton according to his instructions. In March of the following year, Showa 14 (1939), he completed a magnificent large hangar. People's surprise naturally changed. Since its beginning, after four years, Japan's first large building nailed together with nails has been completed. At the same time, this method continues to be used to build barracks, lecture halls, etc., and it has been very successfully done. In the army, forty such buildings have been built, saving 8,500 tons of steel and reducing costs by 1.5 million yen, while the construction time only accounts for 70% of the previous time. Therefore, it has made a great contribution to the future of wooden construction.

"An ordinary sixteen-millimeter iron bolt can be made into thirty-five four-inch nails. And the endurance of this iron bolt is only within ten nails. This cannot be said to be a special discovery or invention, but simply re-studying and utilizing nails that have not been fully utilized. Using Japanese pine and cedar wood for construction actually shows that nails are already enough. After using this method, there is no need to carve mortise and tenon joints in the wood anymore, and there is no need for other difficult techniques. Houses can also be built very simply. In the field of technology, there is generally a conservative tendency. Many people think that my method is very dangerous. After four years of research, we finally completed the construction of a large hangar. The academic community has also begun to pay attention to the study of nails since this spring, and the private sector will be able to implement it soon!"

In Showa 10 (1935), Captain Takayama graduated from the Department of Architecture at the Faculty of Engineering of the University of Tokyo. After graduating, he continued his research, believing that he could make the impossible possible. This points out a great path of "wartime research" for all scientists engaged in research.

### Western Tunisian Front: British and Algerian New Offensives Repelled; Tunisian Border Warfare Enters a New Stage After the Axis Forces Retreat from Mateur

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) The Italian military headquarters issued a war report today as follows: (1) On the western Tunisian front, the Anti-Axis forces, in cooperation with artillery and tank forces, launched a new offensive, but were repelled by the Axis forces. The Third Unit of the 27th Infantry Regiment of the Italian Army fought the most bravely in this campaign. (2) German fighter squadrons shot down three enemy aircraft in aerial combat. (3) Axis bomber squadrons repeatedly bombed the port facilities of the Anti-Axis forces in Bône. (4) Anti-Axis bomber squadrons attacked the Taranto and Reggio areas of the Italian mainland, with minimal damage.

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency) According to military sources, the defense of Bizerte has entered a new stage after the Axis forces withdrew from Mateur. The area is well-protected by both Lake Bizerte and the surrounding mountains. As for the fact that the Anti-Axis forces are using Moroccan troops to attack the front lines of Bizerte, there are only two major reasons: (1) The Anti-Axis High Command believes that the battle in the Bizerte area will be the fiercest in the entire Tunisian campaign, so to avoid excessive sacrifices by white troops, Moroccans are being used as cannon fodder. (2) The British, Americans, and French rebels in Bizerte all want to seize the land for themselves. If they were to attack, conflicts would inevitably arise. To avoid this conflict, General Eisenhower has ordered Moroccan troops to attack.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency) According to the Swedish correspondent in London, the London financial community believes that the Axis withdrawal from Mateur marks a turning point in the final stage of the Tunisian war. Cautious observers warn the public to beware of traps set by the Germans, as a fierce German counterattack is highly likely. The correspondent solemnly stated that even the optimistic British believe that although the war situation seems to be favorable to the Anti-Axis powers, it is too early to think that the Axis powers are about to collapse. At the same time, the fortress of Bizerte has not been seriously threatened, as its outer perimeter has not been damaged. This kind of stone defense project built by the French gives the German and Italian troops a considerable advantage.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) A military correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency stated that General Anderson unexpectedly withdrew a large number of fresh troops, especially artillery units, over the weekend to reinforce the left wing of the First Army at the Djebel Abiod pass in the Sedjenane area. As a result, the pressure from the American forces in that area on the Axis positions has increased. For several days, the city of Mateur has been under intense long-range artillery bombardment from British and American forces. In view of this situation, the Axis forces have decided to systematically withdraw from the northern side of the Tunisian front. The city of Mateur is also included in the withdrawal, but the American infantry is slow to follow, so the German and Italian forces have not engaged in encounter battles with them. In theory, the Anti-Axis forces have two possible courses of action: (1) The American forces may continue to advance westward along the coast of the Gulf of Tunis, so as to cut off the connection between the German and Italian forces stationed in Bizerte and General Arnim's main force. (2) The American forces may turn south and southeast. If this movement is successful, it will seriously threaten the German and Italian positions in Djebel and open a passage to Tunis for the central force of the British First Army. However, the German and Italian leaders may have made the necessary preparations to resist this. There are currently no changes in the central and southern sections of the Tunisian front. As of late Monday, the Anti-Axis activities in this area were limited to artillery fire and reconnaissance. There is no doubt that the Anti-Axis forces will redevelop their activities, especially in the area east of Medjez el Bab and west of Pont du Fahs. The only purpose is to contain the German forces, preventing them from withdrawing reserve troops to resist the American forces facing north. Judging from the situation of both sides, a large-scale offensive by the Anti-Axis forces in the central and northern sections at the same time is very possible and has already approached. Furthermore, judging from the general situation, the large number of British and American troops concentrated in Algeria may have other uses besides the Tunisian war. But in any case, it can be asserted that the Anti-Axis command has used these reserves to reinforce the troops fighting in Tunisia. Therefore, in future battles, the number of Anti-Axis troops will still be greater than that of the German and Italian troops, but the area currently held by the Axis forces will be further reduced after the completion of the withdrawal movement.

### Fierce Battles Still Underway in Krymskaya, Soviet Territory; German Troops Shift Their Position to the West of the Town

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) A military correspondent for the Hai Tong News Agency stated that the Soviet army has been constantly attacking the Kuban bridgehead held by the Germans for a week. Although the losses in manpower and material resources suffered by the Soviet army are also very serious, the pressure from the Soviet army has not only not decreased but has increased. During the attack, the Soviet army repeatedly decided to shift the focus of its offensive to the mountainous area on the eastern flank, between the saltwater lake area at the mouth of the Kuban River. Since noon on Monday, the fighting southeast of Krymskaya has been the most intense, and the battle is still underway, with no signs of weakening. According to military experts in Berlin, it is worth noting that the Soviet Union is fighting with powerful infantry and artillery units, and only occasionally using tanks. The Soviet army is concentrating a large number of elite troops in a small area, so it can break through the German lines, but the Soviet troops who enter the German positions are immediately cut off and isolated from their main force. The German army is now fighting fiercely to try to retake the land broken into by the Soviet army, and the Soviet army has deployed new troops, which shows that the Red Army command still intends to continue the attack. The current situation also shows that the Soviet side attaches great importance to the Kuban bridgehead, believing it to be the German base for threatening the Caucasus and the starting point for a possible large-scale German offensive.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) Qualified German military sources announced last night that after four consecutive days of Soviet attacks on the German positions east of the town of Krymskaya in the German Kuban bridgehead area, the German troops have now withdrawn from the town and moved to stronger positions prepared in advance to the west of the town. When the Soviet army attacked the old German positions there again on Monday morning with the help of heavy artillery and aircraft, only rear-guard units resisted. Before the withdrawal, the German troops had taken away all supplies and military supplies and completely destroyed important military facilities.

### The US Will Send Davies to the Soviet Union Again; Kerr Visits Molotov

Amsterdam, 4th (Central News Agency) The German News Agency reports that according to a telegram from London, the British Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Kerr, visited the Soviet Foreign Commissar Molotov to convey the British government's views on the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland. Kerr may hold further talks on this matter in Scotland, England.

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch today, the Washington authorities are now considering sending Davies to Moscow again to invite Stalin, President Roosevelt, and Prime Minister Churchill to hold a special meeting. It is reported that Davies recently discussed this matter with President Roosevelt.

### Eden Hopes That the Soviet Union and Poland Will Quickly Resolve Their Dispute

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons on the 4th that he hoped that the governments of the Soviet Union and Poland would resolve the current dispute between the two countries with "political insight." However, the Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile, Sikorski, still showed a tough attitude in a broadcast on the London Central Broadcasting Station on the night of the 4th, so the conflict is intensifying. The theory that the Soviet Union will establish a Red Polish government in Moscow is also becoming more powerful. A correspondent from the New York Times in London bluntly stated in a report that the situation has become serious, meaning that although the current dispute between the Soviet Union and Poland was facilitated by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, if more flaws in the Anti-Axis camp are discovered, it will lead to an unprecedented split. The position of the current Polish government-in-exile can be described as a dilemma. Poland refused President Hitler's request for the Free City of Danzig, and as a result, lost most of its territory. It is difficult to explain the Soviet government's view that it is necessary to delineate new borders to protect its country and strive to develop its power in Eastern Europe. The Soviet government's policy is to seek more territory and to establish a second front by the Anti-Axis countries before close cooperation between the Soviet Union, Britain, and the United States can be realized. The public believes that Roosevelt's dispatch of his confidant Davies to Moscow is an attempt to resolve the major crisis in the Anti-Axis camp, but according to reports from the New York Times, the mutual disagreements have been fully exposed, and the situation is becoming increasingly apparent.

### Australian Foreign Minister Meets with US Leaders in the US

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a Washington dispatch, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt met with US Lend-Lease Administrator Hopkins on the 3rd. On the 4th, he met with Roosevelt again, emphasizing the seriousness of the war in the Southwest Pacific and requesting reinforcements. Since arriving in Washington, Evatt has repeatedly met with US government officials and the heads of the Anti-Axis Allied Command. The main purpose of the talks is to request reinforcements. However, according to a report from the Australian Radio Washington correspondent, Evatt's talks with US government officials are now facing a crisis.

### French Commissioner of Martinique Protests to the US

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) Yesterday, US Secretary of State Hull announced that the State Department had received a diplomatic note from Robert, the senior French commissioner of Martinique, protesting the US withdrawal of its consul and the termination of food supplies to the island. Hull said: "The French commissioner's attitude is incomprehensible because the points on which it is based have all been abolished." When asked whether the US government would take further action on this protest, Hull replied that he could not make any announcements at this time, but the US Navy is currently patrolling the Caribbean Sea, and any new situation that may arise in the future will be mainly based on the Navy's judgment.

### The US Establishes Naval and Air Bases on Easter Island

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Stefanini News Agency in Santiago, the US military has established naval and air bases on Easter Island to protect Chile.

### A Great Tragedy in World History

— Tokutomi Iichiro

(1) The Consequences of Utter Piracy

If there is a great tragedy in modern times, it is the fact that the British Empire is heading towards collapse. People of the world, whether friends or foes, are so bewildered by the many disturbances of the present war that they have hardly noticed this great tragedy unfolding before their eyes. This is just like the late Tokugawa shogunate period, when eight or nine out of ten Japanese people still regarded the then-shogunate, which had lost its soul and only had a body left, in the same way as the shogunate of the third shogun, Iemitsu, or the eighth shogun, Yoshimune, were regarded. Katsu Kaishu once wrote:

"The anchor line of a thousand fathoms cannot be held, drifting with the waves, who knows where it will reach!"

I wonder if Churchill, who is now wearing the signboard of the British Prime Minister, really has such an awareness?

In ancient times, the Roman general Scipio Africanus Major conquered Carthage and set its capital on fire. He watched as this once luxurious metropolis on the southern shore of the Mediterranean gradually turned into scorched earth, and suddenly recalled the verses of the poet Homer about the destruction of Troy and sighed. I wonder if there is anyone who sheds a tear of sympathy for England, which is now playing the role of modern Carthage? If Shakespeare, a great playwright of England, were to be resurrected today, he would probably throw down his pen and sigh at his powerlessness!

The so-called British Empire, until now, has been the richest and strongest country in the world, and also a top-notch cultural country. However, this country, its lifespan as a nation, has been close to two thousand years; however, its lifespan as the British Empire is only a quarter of that, no more than four or five hundred years. To be specific, it should be after Queen Elizabeth I. The author of "The Expansion of England" (1883), Sir J. R. Seeley, said:

"In the late years of Queen Elizabeth I, England had no colonies outside of Europe at all, and the British Empire did not yet exist. Scotland was still a separate country, and the British power in Ireland was only a small colony among foreign peoples."

Like this, the development of the British Empire is extremely modern. However, how did England, which was more backward than Portugal, Spain, the Netherlands, and even France, manage to build such a great empire and develop to the point where "the sun never sets on the lands of the British Queen Victoria"? Needless to say, it was entirely from the actions of pirates, relying on the lucky star of thieves, and being invincible everywhere. Now, let me give an example. England in the time of Cromwell was originally a so-called extreme Protestant country, achieving its revolution according to the essence of free people's rights. However, William Cowper at the time said:

"The Netherlands, whether in the ocean or in the New World, is a major commercial competitor of our country. Therefore, even if it is a Protestant force, it must be destroyed; even if we have to borrow the aid of a Catholic country to destroy it, it is worth it." They had such a heart, using violence entirely, to harm the competitors who were their opponents.

That is to say, the wars of England were not simply wars for hegemony; deep down, they always concealed commercial calculations of profit and loss. The war between England and France, for example, was caused by France taking the lead in North America, which England later wanted to seize; the same was true in India. In short, the wars of England were wars based on commerce, and from the beginning, the only question was whether the interests were worth the calculations. That is, they were not temporary pirates or occasional pirates, but permanent, planned, and large-scale continuous, common acts of piracy.

If there was a grasp of being able to win and gain something from winning, then they would immediately start doing it. As for who the opponent was, that was completely irrelevant, and they would not give up until the goal was achieved. In this way, they even built a great empire in the New World; unfortunately, however, they lost it due to the War of Independence; but a part of it—Canada—is still preserved to this day. India was first targeted by the French, who first invented how to take India. This method was: first, Indian troops were ultimately no match for European troops: second, if Indian chariots were trained, the result could be to conquer India with India. However, the British completely copied the method, using it to conquer India and drive the French out of India. Australia was formerly called New Holland, which England also seized from the Dutch; finally, South Africa was also snatched from the Dutch. The so-called Union of South Africa was actually established during the late years of Queen Victoria and the reign of Edward VII. The English, who were so thorough in their piratical nature, seized every opportunity to exert their nature, and sometimes even created opportunities for themselves, finally eating up the corners of the world like silkworms devouring mulberry leaves.

However, extreme joy begets sorrow. England began to decline during the Victorian era and the reign of Edward VII, and plunged sharply during the reign of George V. Regarding the decline of England, there were people who hinted at it and those who satirized it during its most prosperous Victorian era. Words such as "the tired Titan—the giant in mythology" and "the aging lion" gradually became synonymous with England.

Among those very few insightful Englishmen, there were even those who held deep anxieties about the future. An Englishman named Charles Pierson wrote a book in January 1893 entitled "National Life and Character," revealing extremely pessimistic predictions for the white race. The white race mentioned here, judging from the content, clearly refers to the Anglo-Saxons of England and America. After reading that book, I saw the signs of self-collapse in this great world empire, larger than three Roman empires, and could not help but recognize the dawn of the revival of my Great East Asia and felt unspeakable joy. The book was copied and translated by our company (Mainichi Shimbun) at the time and published under the title "The Future of the White Race," which I am sure some young people in the mid-Meiji era still remember.

Also, in 1906, the year after Japan defeated Russia, the "Adin" publishing house in Oxford, England, published a book entitled "The Decline of England," which was a fictional history of England, which had perished ten years earlier (i.e., 1995), published in Tokyo, Japan, in 2005 of the Western calendar, and used as a textbook in Japanese elementary schools. The author's pen name was Vivian Gray, and the real name was Eliot. E. Mills. In short, the intent of the book was nothing more than for the British to use the textbook of a Japanese elementary school to make their own people aware of the decline of their own country.

The book lists nine reasons for the decline: first, urban life oppresses rural life, harming the health and beliefs of the British people. Second, the British people of the twentieth century only knew about health resorts and no longer cared about the ocean. Third, becoming extremely weak and extravagant. Fourth, the taste for literature and drama tended to be decadent. Fifth, the physique and health of the British people gradually declined. Sixth, knowledge and moral life declined among the British people. Seventh, taxes were levied greedily and endlessly, and municipal expenses were used excessively. Eighth, educational falsehoods prevailed in England. Ninth, the British people's self-defense and national defense capabilities became increasingly weak. (According to the translation by Mr. Shohtaro Kimura)

In recent times, there is also the book "The Decline and Fall of the British Empire," published in 1940. The author of this book, Robert Briffault, excerpted, prefaced, and added annotations and reviews, describing it quite harshly and quite pleasantly. We will only mention its title now, and for the time being, avoid the trouble of describing its contents. In short, the so-called decline of England has been growing thicker and thicker day by day in the last fifty years, and a touch of sorrow, like a nightmare, has naturally enveloped the British Empire.

I wonder if England is already aware of this situation or has already acknowledged it? In short, after the middle age of the British Queen, she revealed the so-called imperial righteousness, this treasure, and tried to use blood transfusion methods. The then Prime Minister Disraeli forcing the crown of the Emperor of India on the head of the British Queen was also that method. The theories of Seeley, Rosebery, Dilke, and even Joseph Chamberlain's imperialism, were the most prominent, and the one who was a trumpeter in the capacity of a literary man was Rudyard Kipling.

However, these special blood transfusion methods did not have the effectiveness that those people had hoped for, and in the end, they promoted the decline of England.

The First World War really put England at the crossroads of life and death. On the surface, England won this war and Germany was defeated. If England could make good use of this victory and seek ways to self-renewal, then England might have been able to be reborn through this opportunity. Who knew that she would misuse this victory, spending the next twenty years in temporary peace, and finally reaching today's state. On the contrary, Germany, like a convalescing typhoid patient, had changed the structure of its body and was reborn. And the relationship between England and Germany has completely reversed the position of twenty years ago in today's twenty years later.

In 1896, England once relied on the book "Made in Germany" to make people aware of the fact that everything was made in Germany in any store on the streets of London, so that old habits could be renewed and ways to return to rationalism could be sought. Rosebery was one of the main figures. However, that situation ended there, and finally the First World War passed. Afterwards, there was almost no concern for the state of Germany. Apart from today's Prime Minister Churchill, only a very few people have issued warnings about this.

Therefore, today, it has already been brought to a point where there is no way out. However, upon further examination, the reason why England has reached today's state cannot but be said to be the result of accumulated evils. England is thoroughly piratical; its prosperity and development, even to the creation of a world-scale empire, is due to piracy, and its gradual collapse is also due to piracy. There is a saying, "Take by force, keep by virtue," but England is completely taking by force and keeping by force from beginning to end. England cannot even take Ireland, which is close at hand, as its wings, let alone the nearly 400 million Indians? However, on the other hand, England's enemy is not Japan, nor Germany, Italy, France, and certainly not the Soviet Union; England's enemy is its colonies Canada and Australia, and the biggest is India.

However, they are still enduring England for now, and today they are about to swallow England in one gulp, and the one that has already swallowed half of it, is the United States, which surpasses its teacher. However, it is England itself that has made the United States show its wolfish heart towards England. Now England is moving forward day by day towards the realm of so-called self-inflicted and self-destruction. If this is not called a tragedy, then what in human history is a tragedy? Moreover, the tragedy is entirely a tragedy of fratricide. The son of a pirate and the son of a pirate compete for the spoils, and eventually devour each other, which is the ultimate tragedy.

### Yesterday Was the May Fourth Youth Day—A Celebration Was Held—The New Movement Association and the Youth Corps Telegraph Their Respects

Yesterday was the national May Fourth Youth Day. The Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Association and the Shanghai Municipal Headquarters of the Chinese Youth Corps held a celebration in the city government auditorium. Three banners were hung in front of the city government gate, with large red characters, "Obey the Leader, Implement the Doctrine," "Be Brave and Diligent, Endure Hardship," and "Revive China, Defend East Asia," which were very eye-catching. National flags were hung high in front of the gate and in the auditorium, creating a solemn and respectful atmosphere. Secretary Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, Section Chief Ling of the city government, all staff of the New Movement Association and the Municipal Corps, and representatives of youth groups from more than 30 public and private primary and secondary schools in the city, a total of 700 students, dressed neatly and in high spirits, attended. The ceremony began at 10:00 am, presided over by Chief Secretary Xi of the Shanghai Branch of the New Movement Association, who led the ceremony and delivered the opening remarks. Secretary Zhao then delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen. Finally, the telegram of respect was read and slogans were shouted before the meeting adjourned.

The text of the tribute telegram to Chairman Wang Jingwei of the Nanjing National Government: "We humbly believe that in the three years since the return to the capital, we are fortunate to have your leadership of the masses, laying the foundation of the country on a solid rock, building with difficulty, and planning for the prosperity of East Asia. Now, on the occasion of the first May Fourth Youth Day, this branch has convened a celebration in the Shanghai Municipal Government Auditorium on this day, gathering representatives of youth groups from all over the city. In a warm and solemn mood, we all rejoice that the day after the leader's magnificent descent is also the festival of polishing youth. Since the events are coincidental, the meaning is even deeper. We should follow the instructions, promote the New Movement, review past work, recognize current responsibilities, work hard day and night, strive together with one heart and one mind to build China and protect East Asia, and send our respects by telegram, hoping for your wise attention. Respectfully, the Shanghai Special City Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee, the Shanghai Special City Corps of the Chinese Youth Corps, humbly bow."

Secretary Zhao's speech briefly stated that China's 5,000-year history has been accumulated by countless youths of past generations. From this, we can imagine the responsibility of our youth, who bear the mission of "building on the past and opening up the future." We should value ourselves, review our work, and train ourselves in concrete ways. In terms of "mind," we should use wisdom and thought to seek rich knowledge. In terms of "strength," we should use labor to serve society and seek action. In this way, using both mind and strength to lay the foundation for youth undertakings, because it is too late to regret when one is old if one does not study when one is young, the ancients have clear teachings, and we should put these words into practice and carry forward our spirit to gradually do so. What is the central task of building on the past and opening up the future, the common goal? It is to revive China and defend East Asia. At the same time, we must recognize that to revive China, we must first invigorate ourselves, and to invigorate ourselves, we must start with the youth. Today's youth are the backbone of China in the future, and they are also the driving force for the revival of China.

### No Champion Produced in the Western League Football Division A—Russian Team Wins Division B, An Wah Wins Division C

The Western League football tournament for this season (1942-1943) could not be fully completed due to venue issues. However, the Division B champion has been produced. The Russian team won Division B, St. John's was the runner-up, and Yousheng was third, followed by the Overseas Chinese. After that were the Japanese Association, the Pede Association, the Rowens, and the Russian Emigrants Gilyem at the bottom. An Wah Association won the Division C championship, while Hequn sadly ranked second, and the Junior Association was the third. Several games in Divisions B and C have not yet been completed, but they are irrelevant to the championship. However, the Division A championship has become difficult to produce due to the stalemate between the Italian Army and the Lianyi team. According to a notice from the Western League Secretariat yesterday, the Executive Committee of the League decided that no champion would be produced in Division A, because according to the results of the first round, the Italian Army ranked first, and the current situation is that Lianyi has two more points, but the Italian Army has one less game than Lianyi, and the two are difficult to distinguish.

### Lianyi Cup Inaugural Performance—St. John's vs. Xuhui United—This Sunday at Xuhui

Economic Circles—Comments

### Small Industry Loan Syndicate

In the future, the normal business of the financial world will be to support production, and the main tool for supporting production will be loan syndicates. In the past two weeks, news about agricultural loans and industrial loans has been spreading very enthusiastically, which shows the shift in the direction and targets of lending in the financial world in the future: the new direction and targets are: to help legitimate production and stabilize the lives of the people.

Recently, some people in the financial community, in view of the position of handicrafts and small industries in the stage of China's industrial development, have actively advocated the organization of a "Small Industry Loan Syndicate", and have specifically put forward concrete opinions on the use of loans, the amount of loans, loan guarantees, loan interest, and loan methods. Undoubtedly, this is a good way to improve financial activities and increase production power.

Speaking of this issue, this column published an article on March 2 entitled "Production Problems of Small Factories," in which there were the following words: "China is a country with an agricultural economic form, and industrial development is still very immature; from the perspective of productivity, the transformation from manual to mechanical production is still in progress. Therefore, small industries still occupy an important position in the overall production volume... Many banks and money shops do not regard these small factories as lending targets. Although public opinion advocates lending more to industry, in reality, they still maintain the policy of those who seek being rejected and those who reject being supplied. This policy has harmed the growth of many production institutions."

Now, such an unreasonable policy has changed. Our further expectation is that, regarding the lending method, in addition to investigating the production status of each factory at any time and whether the loan is used for improper purposes, we must also constantly provide technical guidance. Assuming that it is known that the loan is used for legitimate purposes, but after the loan is granted, we are still only concerned about issues such as loan guarantees and loan interest, and we turn a blind eye to the management and guidance of small industries, then the meaning of supporting production may not be fully realized. Therefore, we specifically put this forward for the consideration of the "Small Industry Loan Syndicate."

### Joint Organization of Chinese, Japanese, and Third-Country Warehouses Decided: Unified Control of Warehouses Can Be Centralized in the Future

Since the government authorities sent personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate hoarding, the relevant parties have felt that the trend of hoarding in this port cannot be eradicated because comprehensive control over Chinese, Japanese, and third-country warehouses cannot be implemented. Therefore, in order to assist the authorities in preventing hoarding, the Chinese and Japanese warehouse operators in this port have decided to organize a "Warehouse Industry Federation" by the warehouse operators of China, Japan, and third countries to facilitate the supervision of the dynamics of materials in each warehouse. It is learned that the Chinese and Japanese warehouse operators in this port recently held the first joint meeting, with the "Shanghai Special City Warehouse Industry Guild" representing the Chinese side and the "Japanese Association Warehouse" representing the Japanese side. As a result of the agreement between the two parties, it was decided that the Chinese warehouse industry would unite with the bank warehouses, and the Japanese warehouse association would unite with the warehouses of East Asia Shipping, China Shipping, inland river shipping, and other transportation organizations. The third-country side will be a union of warehouses from Germany, Italy, and Spain. In mid-next month, individual organizations will be established separately, and then the three organizations will form the "Shanghai Warehouse Industry Federation" to complete the unified control of Shanghai warehouses.

The "Sino-Japanese Cotton Product Agreement Council" under the National Commercial Control Association held its first meeting on the 30th of last month. The Chinese side was represented by the "China Cotton Product Industry Association," and the Japanese side was represented by the "Central China Cotton Product Industry Association." It is learned that the work of the Council is as follows: (1) Production, distribution, and other related matters of cotton products. (2) Determining the quantity and price of cotton product distribution. (3) Connecting the relationship between the Chinese and Japanese cotton product associations. (4) Necessary investigation and research matters. (5) Arbitrating and mediating disputes between Chinese and Japanese counterparts. The list of Chinese and Japanese members of the Council is as follows: Chairman Jiang Shangda, Vice Chairman Ling Tian Yi Ci, Managing Director Nie Lusheng, San Ze Tu Zhi, Director Cheng Jingtang, Tong Runfu, Ding Fangyuan, Tian Cao, Gu Wo Chen Ji Tsukamoto Suketaro. Supervisors Tang Zhiliang, Guo Dihao, Kimura Sakon, Honda Daisaku.

### Deceptive Embellishment

— Zhen Diaoge

People have a common problem, which is deceptive embellishment.

A young student makes a heterosexual friend. Even though they are secretly calling each other "sister," "love," and "darling," if you advise them, "It's best not to be in love while studying," then they will act as if they have been wronged and say, "Who's in love? We're just ordinary friends!"; they might even say you're a "relic of the 18th century." When they get married, even if the ceremony and banquet are held at a fancy hotel or dance hall, with money being thrown around like dirt, their announcement still says, "In these extraordinary times, everything will be kept simple." When their parents die, the brothers might be fighting like cats and dogs over the inheritance, but the obituary still says, "The unfilial sons, etc., have committed grave sins," and then there's, "The orphaned son XXX weeps blood and touches his forehead to the ground."

There are too many examples of this sort of thing to list. The reason for it is that they want to maintain their superficial "reputation" on the one hand, while satisfying their own "interests" and "desires" on the other. Since "you can't have both," deceptive embellishment arises as a "last resort."

Because of deceptive embellishment, we have suffered countless wounds. People who have no strength insist on calling themselves strongmen; people who have no money insist on acting like big shots. They are all just trying to look imposing by slapping their faces until they swell! But friends, even if you can look imposing by slapping your face until it swells, the pain of a visible sore is still yours! How will you cope when today's deceptive embellishment is exposed tomorrow?

How does being exposed for deceptive embellishment compare to not having embellished in the first place?

### Shanghai Miscellany (2)

— Hashimoto Kansetsu

Liu Haisu, the president of the Shanghai Art School, and Wang Jiyuan, who has been to Japan several times, have gone to present-day Shonan because of the incident and have not yet returned. Both of them are Western-style painters.

Liu Haisu has both courage and managerial talent, and I admire him especially. He has contributed a lot to the cultural cooperation between China and Japan. Once I talked to him about this issue and asked for his opinion. At that time, the Shanghai Art School had 300 students in the Western-style painting department. Most of the students studying Western-style painting were children of the bourgeoisie and the poor, and there were no middle-class students. Among the poor students, some had communist ideas. I said to him, "Why don't we just disband it! What do you think?" He shook his head and said that disbanding it seemed too early, and it would be better to ask the bad elements to withdraw. "What! If they are exiled, it will be more troublesome, and there will be meritorious deeds from outside," I said. He said that it would not take ten days to recruit 300 students, but he finally went to Paris to study. After arriving in Paris, I received two or three letters from him, and then we never met again. When he went to Shonan, I thought, if only I knew their residence, it would be great if I could find them and meet everyone. Yu Jifan and Jiang Xiaojian, who graduated from Tokyo Art School, spoke fluent Japanese and served in the Nanjing government. I heard that Mr. Jiang, who was a sculptor, died after the incident. There are very few new sculptors in China now, so Mr. Jiang's death is really a pity. His works still remain in West Lake or other places.

A few years ago, I wrote an article in this newspaper's New Year's special issue entitled "The Spirit of Oriental Painting and War Paintings." The article said: Mi Nan Gong was from West Asia and believed in Islam, which Japanese scholars have affirmed. It is even said that Su Dongpo was a migrant. As for Guan Yu and Zhang Fei, who are familiar to everyone in the history of the Three Kingdoms, judging from their demeanor and appearance, they may also be people of the migrant tribe. Especially Guan Yu, like the Tenmangu Shrine in Japan, is worshipped and sacrificed everywhere in China. If we study it, we may have unexpected and interesting new discoveries. Ten years ago, someone in the Chinese press said that Li Taibai was not Chinese, but a migrant, a Turk, and many people spent a lot of effort to study this matter.

For example, in the Taibai Collection, a poem "To a Distant Friend" says: "Lu Gao is like jade frost, and the pen is inscribed with the Yuezhi script," and there is also "I once comforted the exile in the West Sea. Because of the many lines, every word is wronged." From the words Yuezhi script and West Sea, it can be known that he knew foreign languages. Also, in the "Ode to the Great Horse," there is a line "The Heavenly Horse comes from the Yuezhi cave." The Ode to the Heavenly Horse is a poem he wrote in his old age after resigning from office, comparing himself to a Heavenly Horse, implying that he came from a foreign country as a youth. The Wei Zhi described his appearance as: "His eyes were bright and fierce, like those of a hungry tiger," and Cui Zongzhi's poem said that he "shone brightly with his double eyes." Furthermore, his fondness for martial arts and fighting in his youth is cited as evidence. He once held an important position in the Tang Dynasty like the modern Minister of Foreign Affairs, adopting the so-called method of controlling barbarians with barbarians. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 22)

### Trickles and Confluence

— Prisoner

There are often some "quotations" or "cultivation quotes" in the newspapers, which we call "trickles." Of course, there is truth in every sentence, telling us the "direction" of how to be a person. But if we can only achieve one or two drops of these so-called "trickles," it will not be very successful for the whole life. Therefore, we must "merge" these fragmented "trickles." In a small way, personal cultivation must be like this. In a big way, the success of a career is not like this?

For example, take the water dripping from a tap. If it can eternally drip to one point, then over time, even cement will be dripped into a small hole! Yes, this is the power of trickles, but this power relies on being able to converge on one point. If each drop of water is scattered here and there, then the cement will never be dripped into a hole. Even a torrential rain will not be able to move the cement at all!

From this, we can know that the power of trickles is amazing, but it must be merged, "planned", and "purposeful". Usually, we should not only pay attention to being polite and pleasing, but also pay attention to learning how to be a person everywhere. In terms of career, it is not enough to just solve a few difficulties. We must have a plan and a purpose to connect and link them together, have unified consideration and arrangement, and merge all the strength to deal with it, without losing any small drop of power. If we do this, the hope of success can be realized.

It is not easy to merge trickles, as difficult as merging every drop of water, because there is air resistance and wind pressure, and it is inevitable that it will be scattered here and there. Therefore, the trickles themselves must be strong and powerful, heavy and urgent, have a fixed direction, and have perseverance to keep dripping towards the correct goal. Can you say that its power is not great?

### On the Toxic Reactions of Vitamin B1

— Yong

Recently, the medical community has discovered the phenomenon of reactions when vitamin B1 is injected into certain patients. This type of reaction has also been discovered several times by the foreign medical community.

Since vitamin B1 was discovered to have a very important relationship with our health, its application in treatment has become increasingly frequent. The dosage of vitamin B1 has never been fixed, but it is generally believed that it has little or no toxicity. Therefore, in order to achieve rapid results, it is often given to patients in amounts several times or even dozens of times higher than the daily needs, but no significant effects or significant adverse effects are seen. Recently, Professor C.A. Mills of the Oineiooate Medical School in the United States discovered that a woman who took 10 mg of vitamin B1 daily experienced headache, insomnia, sensitivity, increased pulse, weakness, and tremors for one and a half weeks, which were similar to the toxic effects of taking too much thyroxine. This reaction completely disappeared within two days after stopping taking vitamin B1. After a week of rest, the patient took vitamin B1 again at a dose reduced to 5 mg, but after four weeks, the same toxic reaction occurred again and disappeared after stopping taking it.

Professor Mills also observed the toxic reactions of vitamin B1 in the tropical regions of Panama. When the human body is in a hot environment, it needs more vitamin B1 than in temperate regions. It is easy for foreigners living in this area to develop vitamin deficiency. When doctors encounter this type of patient, they must use a very high dose (20-40 mg) of vitamin B1. As a result, the occurrence of toxic reactions is also common, and the situations are similar. This reaction also disappears after stopping taking it. Therefore, this type of reaction may be caused by patients taking or injecting excessive doses of vitamin B1.

The toxic reactions of vitamin B1 are also related to the deficiency of other vitamins. Professor Morgan of the University of California conducted an experiment on animals and saw that supplementing only one or two types of vitamin B often did more harm than good if they lacked many of the B vitamins. Because the vitamin B group now includes at least twelve nutritional elements, the situation of deficiency is extremely complex, and simply supplementing with one type of B1 often does not help. Therefore, this type of toxic reaction can also be said to be caused by an unbalanced effect. The medical community in this port is now making every effort to study the detailed reasons, and it is expected that it will be announced soon.

### Perspective

— Zhang Xin

Painting has a point of view of perspective, simply perspective; there is also a point of view of perspective on the road of life:

On the road of life, the distance seems small and the near seems large. However, the distance shows us the direction and is also the destination we want to reach. We must advance, and our eyes must be on the distance at all times. Otherwise, if we only greedily look at the wildflowers by the roadside and linger on the beautiful scenery in front of us, ignoring the distance, we will inevitably lose the direction of the road ahead or forget the task of our journey. As a result, we will either go astray or be unable to move forward. The frog in the well, because it is content in a narrow circle and cannot see the distance, its knowledge is also childishly pathetic. Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the distance, we are laggards on the road of life.

As for the near, it cannot be ignored either, because although there are smooth roads in the near, there are also thorns and ditches; sometimes we have to face abysses, and sometimes we have to walk on thin ice. For thorns, we must eliminate them; for ditches, we must cross them; for abysses and thin ice, we must be even more careful, so that we can move forward continuously and safely reach our destination. Otherwise, if we only stare at the starlight in the distance and ignore the near, we will have already been tripped by thorns, and then we will fall into ditches, or fall into abysses, or fall under the ice. How can we reach the place indicated by the starlight? Therefore, if we do not pay attention to the near, we are also laggards on the road of life.

In painting, it takes both distance and proximity to be a master painter; on the road of life, it takes both distance and proximity to be a master traveler.

### A Truth

— Xu Zhengyang

In a certain registration office, the clerks are busy working.

A very presentable gentleman walks in, wearing leather shoes. He first leans his cane against the table, and then casually takes off his felt hat and puts it on the table:

"Hey, register!"

One of the clerks puts down his pen, looks up, and puts on a very awkward smile:

"Yes, yes... Mr., what's your name?"

"Huang."

"How do you write it?"

"Huang, the Huang with the leader character (黃)!" He seems very impatient.

"Oh, it's the Huang (黃) from Huang Yanpei! Ah, Mr. Huang, it's an honor to meet you!"

The gentleman snorts through his nose.

All the procedures are completed, and the clerk gives a piece of paper to the gentleman, and puts on an ugly face that is both smiling and not smiling.

The gentleman takes the paper, his cane, and his felt hat, walks away with a swagger, wearing leather shoes.

After a while, a very ragged old man walks in:

"Sir, register?"

"Hmph, what's your name?"

"Huang."

"How do you write it?" He seems very impatient.

"Huang, the Huang (黃) with the grass head (艹)." He smiles obsequiously.

"Oh, it's the Huang (黃) from Huang Gou (黃狗, yellow dog)!"

The poor old man takes the paper, frowns, and leaves.

So, I understood a "truth" in today's society: with money, you can be a saint; without money, you only deserve to be livestock.

### Regarding Gambling Dens

— Shen Zhong

If someone says that establishing gambling dens can revive the market, then everything related to corrupting erotic secret dramas can be called "sex education." Therefore, I will be blunt, the person who says this is either out of their mind or has "ulterior motives."

Because of "gambling dens," newspapers have increased a lot of "material" in the social news section: absconding, fraud, embezzlement, robbery, suicide, ... and so on. Therefore, some people say that "gambling dens" are "human destroyers."

Although we say that gamblers are "courting death" themselves, as "clear-headed bystanders," how can we bear to sit and watch these batches of "fellow humans" go to "their deaths?"

Today's ruling authorities are concerned about people's livelihoods and national wealth everywhere. Speculation should be investigated and punished, and gambling dens should be investigated and banned with special punishments. Fortunately, the authorities have already expressed their stern determination.

Here, we look forward to making these so-called "teahouses" and "restaurants" into "human destroyers" that become a name in "history" in the shortest possible time. (Reward for assisting in the suppression of gambling)

### Shanghai Native Place Associations Organize Scholarships and Small Loans

The Ningbo and Zhenjiang Shanghai Native Place Associations have successively established scholarships and small loans for poor children. All matters related to investigation, review, consultation, and disbursement are personally handled by the committee members. The Anhui and Taizhou Shanghai Native Place Associations followed suit. The Zhenjiang Native Place Association has recently launched a campaign to expand the fundraising for the small loan fund (see yesterday's column), which is a good example for other native place associations. The origin of the campaign states: "We have heard that mutual assistance among human beings is the highest virtue, and helping the poor and relieving the needy is a righteous act passed down through generations. Most of our fellow townsmen in Shanghai are engaged in lower and middle-class industrial and commercial businesses. Since the incident, due to the contraction of shops and the dissolution of factories, many people have lost their jobs and should be rescued. Although there are many ways to provide relief, the easiest and most convenient is small loans. Small loans are not donations. The borrowers can use the funds obtained as a tool for making a living, and the lending institutions can continue to recover the loans in installments during the relief efforts, while encouraging them to earn a living on their own."
