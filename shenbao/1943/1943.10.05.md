### Congratulating the Reorganization and Establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association

The reorganization of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been completed, and the inaugural meeting was held yesterday afternoon. Recalling the first inaugural meeting on January 29th, 1930, its declaration proclaimed two points: first, to seek the integration and understanding of the cultures of the two countries; and second, to aspire to the creation of Eastern culture. It further explained that concerning the integration and understanding of the cultures of the two countries, each should take the other's strengths and weaknesses as the basis for selection and rejection, borrowing from each other's advantages to make up for their own deficiencies, extracting the essence and discarding the dross, completing what is incomplete, innovating what is outdated, and promoting and developing the inherent culture, which is an urgent task, while integrating and absorbing foreign cultures is also an important plan. If so, the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese cultures can help each other and complement each other. Concerning the aspiration to create Eastern culture, the Chinese nation has a history of five thousand years, dating back to the times of Emperors Yao and Shun, with remarkable cultural artifacts and institutions. Japan has been established for three thousand years, and although it was nurtured by Chinese culture in its early stages, it has made significant achievements in both spiritual and material aspects since accepting Western science in modern times. Since China and Japan have established close ties in culture, each contributing its strengths, it is not difficult to establish a system of Eastern culture.

The declaration of this reorganization and establishment of the association also proclaims two points: one is to establish an East Asian-centered cultural system, and the other is to implement the government's wartime cultural policies. Looking at the main points of the two declarations, one might say that they both focus on cultural exchange, and only through cultural exchange between the two countries can an East Asian-centered cultural system be established.

From the first establishment of the association to the present, more than two and a half years have passed. In this not-too-short process, a practical review of the association's work achievements shows that, in terms of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, frankly speaking, it has not achieved the ideal results. It is hoped that after this organizational refreshment, it can catch up and realize the purpose stipulated in the charter: "To communicate the cultures of China and Japan; to harmonize the feelings of people from all walks of life in both countries, and to promote Eastern civilization, in order to achieve the goal of good neighborliness and friendship."

As for practical matters, Article 3 of the association's charter has specific provisions, stipulating fourteen items for the promotion of Sino-Japanese cultural undertakings. Of course, these undertakings are all very important, and it is desirable to carry them out as much as possible. However, given the environment and funding, it may not be possible to do everything. In that case, it is necessary to consider the urgency and importance, select a few, concentrate efforts on carrying them out first, and gradually extend them to other undertakings after achieving results, so as to complete them universally. For example, the second item, "Publication of various translated works," since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, what Japanese culture has been introduced to Chinese people given the bleak state of Shanghai publications? What Chinese culture has been contributed to Japanese people? If this is used as a measure of the achievements of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, then it is too weak to make people believe that Sino-Japanese cultural exchange is possible! Because the publishing industry as a whole has fallen into a state of stagnation, and cultural figures and writers are living in poverty, with fewer than ten books published each month, even if the publications are all related to Sino-Japanese cultural exchange, there is no question of them having an effect, let alone the fact that the publications are mostly soft. Therefore, we believe that the association's future work should focus on publishing periodicals, arousing the interest of the publishing industry and writers, working together for the publishing industry, creating a vigorous and prosperous atmosphere, and thereby establishing the foundation of cultural exchange. In addition, it should be supplemented by other cultural undertakings to comprehensively promote the mission entrusted to the association.

To achieve the success of the undertaking, funding and talent are indispensable. Talent cannot be obtained urgently, and cultivation and training must take a considerable amount of time. However, among the cultural figures currently residing in Shanghai, there is certainly no lack of those who can be competent and can be cultivated. If the treatment of cultural figures can be improved so that they are not threatened by life, the efficiency of cultural work will certainly be increased. Therefore, the talent problem can be solved by taking the lives of cultural figures as a prerequisite, which should lead to it. As for funding, it is difficult to do without a sufficient amount. Because of the high prices, labor costs increase accordingly, and paper and printing require a lot of money. Moreover, a great and far-reaching publishing plan requires the storage of materials to adapt to the plan, so that it can be continuously supplied without being exhausted. Therefore, with regard to funding, in any case, one should take a long-term view and try to raise enough money. Since both China and Japan recognize the importance of cultural exchange, the funds needed to achieve the task should not be a problem; otherwise, empty talk of exchange will never have any real effect.

Finally, we know that Shanghai is the center of Chinese culture and the region that is most accessible to Japan in terms of culture. It is of course most appropriate to take the lead in promoting Sino-Japanese cultural exchange from Shanghai and establish a foundation. And what is fortunate is that the chairman of the association, who is also the highest responsible person of the association, is Mayor Chen, and the responsible cadres are all well-known figures in the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles. As the association's chairman Chen said in his opening speech: "In the past, most of the members were from the economic or public service sectors, and there were fewer people who were actually in charge of specific responsibilities, which made it quite difficult to promote the work of this branch." Therefore, we further hope that Chairman Chen and other leaders will actively assume specific responsibilities in the future and eliminate the difficulties of the past. After a considerable period of time, we are willing to wait and see the achievements of the association's work, which are the achievements of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange and the achievements of close relations between Chinese and Japanese officials and people.

Expressing Gratitude to Farmers on Behalf

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels delivered a speech at a mass rally in the Berlin Sports Palace on Sunday on the occasion of the Autumn Thanksgiving Festival. He reiterated the unwavering unity of the German nation and its strong determination to strive for ultimate victory, and expressed gratitude to all German farmers on behalf of the German Führer. Goebbels declared: The German Führer is currently leading the war for the survival and future of the German nation, and is unable to attend in person as he normally would. Goebbels pointed out, "At the beginning of the fifth year of this war, Germany has been able to increase its bread ration, which is almost a miracle, and is largely due to the diligence and efficiency of German farmers." Goebbels solemnly declared, "Bread and weapons are the prerequisites for waging war. The German armaments industry, after being expanded and reformed by Armaments Minister Speer, has greatly increased its production." Goebbels then expressed gratitude on behalf of the Führer and the German nation to the millions of German men and women armaments workers. Goebbels solemnly declared, "The German people, especially in areas subject to enemy terror bombings, have suffered greatly, which the Führer knows best. It would be a great mistake for the enemy to regard the cowardice of a few individuals as a demonstration against the war in Germany. In National Socialist Germany, anti-war sentiment is absolutely non-existent. If London and Washington dream that the story of the Italian Badoglio government of July 25 can happen in Germany, it is a ridiculous hope. This hope is based entirely on an absolutely erroneous understanding of the internal situation and the will and determination of the German people." Goebbels stated: First, the leader of Germany is the German Führer, not a rebellious king. Germany is a republic, not an authoritarian state. Second, in the German armed forces, there is not a single soldier who fears death and clings to life. Third, after the painful experience of November 1918, the German people will never again be deceived by the enemy."

Discussing the Acute Problems of the War Situation

In his speech, Goebbels also discussed several acute problems of the current war situation. Regarding the air war, he declared: Although the enemy's terror bombings have been slightly relaxed in the past few weeks, we must expect them to return in the future. Some air raids have not been carried out due to weather conditions, as the weather does not allow large-scale flights by air force units, and also hinders German defenses. On the other hand, there is no doubt that Germany's military defenses have recently been greatly strengthened and improved. Therefore, the enemy has been paying a heavy price for this. The Allied newspapers have publicly admitted this without hesitation. The enemy's losses are increasing day by day, and will continue to increase in the future." Goebbels continued, "The air war is in many ways a scientific war between Germany and the Allied powers. German science is currently making rapid progress. In the future, the enemy will suffer great losses in both manpower and material resources. The enemy's success will no longer be directly proportional to the manpower and resources they use. At that time, the enemy's so-called 'flying fortresses' will become 'flying coffins'." Goebbels added, "There is no doubt that the air war has caused Germany many difficulties, but the areas where the air war has occurred are completely different from what the enemy hoped for. In any case, Germany's arms production will not be harmed by the enemy's attacks. The smooth progress of the war will not be seriously affected by the enemy's air raids." Regarding the measures taken against enemy terror bombings, Goebbels solemnly declared: German civil air defense has been greatly strengthened, and it is expected that the people will be better able to control the situation from now on. Goebbels mentioned the measures taken to relocate people from major German cities, and pointed out that as a result of these steps, only two children were killed in the recent British air raid on Berlin. Regarding retaliation, Goebbels declared: "It would be a serious mistake for the British to think that German retaliation is merely empty talk without any factual manifestation. There will come a day when Britain will encounter practical experience. German inventors, technicians, engineers, and workers will pay attention to ensuring that British and American trees cannot grow in the sky." Goebbels boldly stated, "It would also be a mistake for Britain and the United States to think that the danger of German submarines has been overcome. German engineering has not abandoned submarine warfare."

Capable of Controlling the Eastern Front Situation

Regarding the war on the Eastern Front, Goebbels stated: "The German army has sufficient strength to keep the war-mongering Bolsheviks far away from German borders. The German army has been conducting detachment operations in recent weeks. The enemy will soon understand the meaning of these operations. The vast area occupied by the German army on the Eastern Front in the past two years allows the German army to conduct mobile warfare without harming the chances of German victory. The German people can calmly observe the development of the Eastern Front. If the east of Europe is not given a clear solution, it will always be a danger to Germany. As for the problem of Bolshevism, there is no need to waste words. Although the danger of Bolshevism is not publicly acknowledged everywhere, it is fully understood. We hope that the neutral countries and the enemies in the West will observe these problems more clearly and realistically than they did when the German army was fighting on the Volga." Regarding this point, Goebbels stated: He made these remarks not to ask for anyone's understanding or help. The Germans feel capable of controlling the situation themselves, but the smaller neutral countries should show understanding to Germany and not criticize the actions of its troops.

Surrender Midway Will Inevitably Fail

Regarding the situation in Italy, Goebbels stated: "The situation in Italy has suffered serious difficulties due to the rebellion of Badoglio and the Italian King. This group of rebels willingly handed over the German troops fighting in southern Italy to the enemy as the price of entering the enemy camp. This shameful intention has been overcome by our political and military measures. The rescue of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has politically become a symbol of the establishment of a Republican Fascist Italy. Militarily, the German divisions quickly resolved Badoglio's troops." Goebbels mentioned the thirteen conditions of Badoglio's surrender to Britain and the United States, stating: "The fate of Italy proves that no one can avoid war by deceptive means. This war is like a high-speed express train. Anyone who tries to jump off will break their neck. Anyone who lays down their weapons midway will inevitably fail. This war is not a war for concepts or regimes, nor is it a war for individuals or opinions, but a war for the nation and its rights to its future life and the possibility of survival. There is no choice between war and peace. All there is is either victory or elimination." After briefly describing the various phases of the Italian events, Goebbels added: "The British and American advance towards Rome and Munich has not been realized. The enemy is still on the southern Italian mainland and is complaining about the strong German defenses. After the battles of Bigny and Dunkirk, it is the first time that the British and American forces have felt the strong German resistance on European territory. The British and American forces will have many more opportunities to recognize the defensive power of the German army."

This Great War Is a Historical Drama

Regarding the intention of Britain and the United States to invade Europe from the west, Goebbels declared: "Germany and the Soviet Union have been waiting for the British and American invasion of Europe, but have not seen it realized. The enemy obviously thought that the Italian method was easier. But the British and American forces have only been fighting on the periphery of Europe so far, and have not yet touched the core of the German defenses. The German army has prepared many surprises to await the arrival of the British and American forces. This war is the greatest drama in the history of our country or even the history of the world. The possibility of a definite solution to the European problem has now begun to emerge. National Socialist Germany will know how to take advantage of this opportunity, and the German Führer is the model for this."

### Introduction: The European War and the Balkan Countries (Part 1)

The withdrawal of the Axis forces from Tunisia, the landing of the Allied forces in Sicily, and the surrender of the Badoglio regime in Italy - due to these three leaps in the Mediterranean situation, the Balkan countries have once again attracted worldwide attention. The German-Soviet alliance, the deadly battle between Germany and Britain, the Italian-Greek war, the German troops stationed in the Balkans, the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, and the current withdrawal of Italy, in these four years of European turmoil, except for Turkey, the other Balkan countries have all gathered under the sphere of German influence until today.

Since Britain and the United States occupied Sicily, they have temporarily regained naval control of the Mediterranean. Under this operational stance, and in the face of unexpected setbacks in relations with the Soviet Union in this political situation, the conference held by Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec only issued a very low-key joint statement, saying that they were discussing operations in East Asia, and closed without a sound.

But the whole world cannot be deceived by this kind of propaganda. The real agenda of the Quebec talks was the attitude of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union, and the discussion of a second European front, which is not difficult to imagine. At this time, the whole world also knows that the so-called second front will be opened by Britain and the United States. In the current situation where they have won in Sicily, it is by no means easy to achieve in terms of operations, let alone adding the Soviet Union problem, which adds another layer of difficulty in political terms.

Before a "second front" that can truly break through this difficulty is successfully opened, not to mention the desire to open up relations with the Soviet Union, even the opportunity to achieve victory in Europe is hopeless for Britain and the United States.

The Situation in the Balkans

Before the surrender of the Badoglio regime, neutral sources said that the British and Americans would land in the Balkans, some said they would land in southern France, and some said they would land on the Italian peninsula, and some even said they would land in northern Europe. The rumors are mixed and there is no consensus. In short, they are all centered on this second front. Therefore, if we examine why Britain and the United States attacked Tunisia and why they landed in Sicily, this is nothing more than Britain and the United States exploring the entrance to the second front. And the most likely possibility seems to be to depart from Sicily and land in southern Italy, which is separated by a narrow strip of water, or in part of Albania, to invade the Balkans. Or, using naval control of the Mediterranean, recapture Crete Island and invade the Dodecanese Islands to establish a bridgehead for attacking the Balkans in Greece.

The value of the Romanian oil fields and the Iron Gate of the Danube River has made Britain and the United States covet Germany's hegemony. They believe that this can only be done after reaching a temporary compromise with the Soviet Union and agreeing on it.

In this sense, Badoglio's declaration of a ceasefire not only to Britain and the United States, but also to the Soviet Union, has a profound meaning. Before the announcement of the surrender, the Soviet Union openly expressed its participation in the Mediterranean operations. In fact, the surrender of Italy is by no means only the power of Britain and the United States, but also the pressure of the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front. Therefore, this shows that the Soviet Union is as concerned about the Mediterranean as Britain and the United States. The Moscow broadcast on the night of the 4th said: As the Soviet Union is at war with Germany and Italy, it will naturally participate in the North Italian operations, and as a major European power, it cannot be indifferent to the Mediterranean problems. The Soviet Union sent representatives to the Free French Committee in North Africa and began diplomatic relations with Egypt. The anti-Axis Mediterranean Committee organized by representatives of the United States and Britain recognized the participation of Soviet representatives. These matters are the result of the above-mentioned compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. At the Quebec talks, it can also be seen that the two giants of Britain and the United States decided on this kind of concession to the Soviet Union.

This advance of the Soviet Union into the Mediterranean naturally also means the increase of the Soviet Union's influence over the Balkan Peninsula. Regarding the Balkan operations, some degree of compromise may have been reached between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union.

If Britain and the United States reach this compromise with the Soviet Union, then the most troublesome thing is probably Turkey! Recently, the efforts of Britain and the United States to pull Turkey over have become increasingly blatant. Because of the recent statement by Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu: "The Turkish government does not believe that its relationship with Britain and the United States is purely neutral," the anti-Axis front has been propagating that Turkey is approaching Britain and the United States, but even if this is indeed a sign that Turkey is changing its traditional neutral policy to a non-belligerent policy, it has not been very smooth in practice when looking back at its relationship with the Soviet Union.

Turkey's approach to Britain and the United States has indeed become more obvious recently, but on the other hand, the shadow of Soviet-Turkish relations, which cannot be ignored, is also deepening day by day. This inconsistency between Britain and the United States has preserved Turkey's neutrality. Now, if Britain and the United States make concessions to the Soviet Union, Turkey is breaking out in a cold sweat!

Britain and the United States' Psychological Warfare

Leaving aside the military offensive against the Balkans for the time being, the psychological warfare of Britain and the United States is currently reaching its climax in the Balkans. Providing aid to anti-German terrorist groups in the former Yugoslavia area, propaganda to the Greek people centered on the withdrawal of the Italian garrison to their home country, etc., all kinds of propaganda techniques are being used, and the so-called "diplomatic offensive" of Britain and the United States is probably being carried out most intensely in Bulgaria!

Although there is no wavering in the policy of cooperation with Germany in Bulgaria, the Bulgarian people feel very close to the Soviet Union in terms of nationality. This is the reason why Bulgaria is the only country in Europe and the Balkans that has maintained neutrality in the German-Soviet war. Britain and the United States are using exiled Bulgarians to broadcast propaganda three times a day, and although the late King Boris's return from a visit to Germany was on August 15, two weeks before his death, they are also maliciously propagating that the king was murdered.

Moreover, it is rumored that British aircraft have recently been appearing frequently in Bulgarian airspace, dropping leaflets. It cannot be hastily determined whether Britain and the United States will indeed land in the Balkans. But their psychological warfare against the Balkans is indeed becoming more and more intense as the European war deepens.

### Buddhist Monks’ North China Disaster Relief Completed

Since the Buddhist Association and groups in this city responded to the call to provide disaster relief to North China and collect donations, the matters have progressed quite smoothly. This time, the heads of various temples have made individual donations amounting to a considerable sum, which is said to be close to the set target. In order to handle the closing, the Buddhist Association held a regular meeting yesterday and resolved to promptly settle the donations and announce them in the near future to demonstrate credibility. It is also heard that all the expenses required for soliciting donations this time will be borne by the Buddhist Association, and the donated funds will be used entirely for disaster relief.

It was resolved that vegetables are more important than meat, so the vegetable issue would be handled first. The prices of vegetables in various vegetable markets will be determined according to the appropriate prices determined within the scope of prices evaluated by the Central Market, and will be published on a daily basis in the vegetable markets. Vegetable vendors must not arbitrarily raise prices in order to avoid illegal extra profits. The measures are being drafted, and once they are ready, they can be implemented.

### The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Held a Reorganization and Inauguration Ceremony Yesterday, Attended by Mayor Chen and Minister Lin

Central News Agency dispatch: The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to regroup various cultural organizations in Shanghai, launch more vigorous cultural activities, realize the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, and form the core of Sino-Japanese cultural cooperation, held a reorganization and inauguration meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday on the eighth floor of a hotel. Mayor Chen, in his capacity as chairman of the preparatory committee, personally presided over the meeting. Minister Lin and Minister's Envoy attended to provide guidance. Minister Chu, Director-General of the Nanjing General Association of the Association, specially sent Envoy Zhang Chao as a representative. More than 500 guests, including heads of Sino-Japanese institutions and celebrities from all walks of life, as well as all members of the association, gathered together in an unprecedentedly grand occasion. The ceremony was simple and solemn. Upon hearing the music, the city government music team played the national anthems of China and Japan. After the salutation, Mayor Chen, as chairman, delivered a speech:

Chairman's Speech

Ladies and gentlemen, the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has been established for two years. In the past two years, thanks to the joint efforts of China and Japan, it has achieved good results. However, the term of the previous board of directors has expired and should be reorganized according to regulations. This is one reason for the reorganization of this branch. Secondly, when this branch was established, people from all walks of life enthusiastically joined, but most of the members were from the economic and public sectors, and there were fewer people actually responsible for specific tasks, making it difficult to promote the cause of this branch. This is the second reason for the reorganization of this association. Furthermore, after the unification of the Shanghai municipal administration, the term "concession" has disappeared, but the Anglo-American ideas nurtured in the concessions still exist. To transform this kind of thinking, we must start from the cultural aspect. This is the third reason for the reorganization of this branch. Since the National Government entered the war and Japan implemented a new policy towards China, various aspects of Sino-Japanese cooperation have been actively launched. Shanghai is the center of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and this need is even more urgent. Not only in politics and economy, but especially in culture, how to eliminate the poison of Anglo-American thought, promote the friendship between the Chinese and Japanese people, and unite and cooperate in the war is a very important theme. This branch also needs to be adapted to the needs of this new environment.

For the above reasons, the General Association decided to reorganize this branch and appointed me to be responsible for the chairman of the reorganization preparatory committee. At the same time, several committee members were appointed, including Chinese scholars Lin Jiongan and Liang Xiu Zi, and Japanese committee members Nakata Toyochiyo, Ueno Taichu, and Hayashi Hirokichi, to assist in the preparation. After several preparatory meetings, we carefully studied and decided on the reorganization policy, and sought the participation of cultural and artistic colleagues from both sides to jointly take responsibility. Until today, various preparations have been completed, and this reorganization and inauguration meeting has been convened. During the preparatory period of this reorganization, we were deeply grateful for the concern of the media and cultural circles of China and Japan. Today, we are honored and grateful to have the heads of various agencies and guests from friendly countries come to guide us. We are also deeply grateful for the congratulatory messages and telegrams sent by various organizations. After the reorganization of this branch, it will gather the cultural forces of China and Japan to jointly promote the development of Shanghai's culture and Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, in order to launch a new East Asian cultural movement. We still ask for your guidance.

Minister Chu's Speech

Then, Minister Chu, Director-General of the Association, delivered a speech on behalf of the ministry: The Shanghai branch was established shortly after the Nanjing ministry was established. Thanks to the efforts of the late Director Li and colleagues, the past achievements have been evident. Now, due to the recovery of the Shanghai concessions and changes in the environment, a reorganization is being implemented. I sincerely hope that under the leadership of Director Chen, the Shanghai branch will continue to promote the spirit and policies of this reorganization, meet the mission of the times, and further develop its cause, so as to achieve the true goal of cultural exchange between China and Japan as soon as possible. In the future, the association's affairs will flourish, develop and exchange the old cultures of China and Japan, and create a new East Asian culture, becoming a model for the innovation of national cultural undertakings. We can surely hold the winning ticket and wait and see. Today, as the reorganization and inauguration meeting is held, I would like to offer a few words as a congratulatory message, and wish Director Chen and all colleagues health and hard work. Chu Minyi, Director-General of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Nanjing General Association. This was followed by speeches from guests,

Envoy Tajiri's Speech

"Today, the reorganization and establishment of the Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association marks a new beginning, which is a happy and joyful event. Especially under the guidance of Mayor Chen, it will definitely greatly assist the future exchange of Sino-Japanese culture. Today has this dual significance, so we are happy and joyful. The people of China and Japan originally have many similarities in thought and culture. If China and Japan seriously study and understand each other, then the misunderstandings of the past two countries would not have occurred. Looking back on the past history is very painful, but since the reorganization of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, we will eliminate and study the misunderstandings and prejudices between China and Japan. Then the future of China and Japan will definitely have great hope. At a time when the tragic events of the past continue to unfold, the reorganization of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is expected to prevent such events from ever happening again. The Cultural Association is originally a cultural group, not a political or economic group, but whether it can develop has a great impact on politics and economy. If culture can achieve good results, then politics and economy can also enter a good state, which is what I deeply believe. It seems that the mission of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association is heavy and great. I hope that the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association will be restored under the leadership of Mayor Chen after the reorganization. This is what I hope for. I offer my congratulations." Then Lin Jiongan read

Congratulatory Telegrams from Various Parties

A congratulatory telegram from the North China New People's Association said, "We are very happy to learn that your association is holding a reorganization and inauguration meeting. In the future, Sino-Japanese culture will be further developed. We send this telegram to express our congratulations. Wang Kemin, Chairman, and Yu Xijie, Vice Chairman, of the New People's Association of the Republic of China." The Zhejiang, Anhui, Guangdong, and Wuhan branches of the Cultural Association also sent telegrams to express their congratulations.

Declaration of the General Meeting

Since the establishment of this branch in Shanghai in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China, two years have passed in an instant. During these two years, this association has been fortunate to have been under the leadership of the government and the supervision of the General Association in promoting cultural exchanges and ideological integration between the two major countries of China and Japan, and in contributing to the lasting peace and happiness of East Asia. We believe that thought is the root of all political ideals, and culture is the driving force for the development of various undertakings. If we want the people of China and Japan to sincerely understand, be friendly, and cooperate, we must first devote ourselves to culture, so as to firmly establish the will of the people of the two countries, harmonize the feelings of the people of the two countries, and work together to advance the struggle for the East Asian national liberation movement. On January 9th of this year, the National Government joined the war. Politically, the two major countries have already closely cooperated, sharing life and death. Culturally, we should also take this as an opportunity to seek deeper cooperation and communication. As this branch is reorganized, in order to establish future goals and directions for our work, we hereby announce to the cultural figures:

First, to establish an East Asian-based cultural system. Culture is an organic body that grows and develops. With the passage of time, it changes and evolves day by day. There is no shortage of metabolism and transformation. Regional transportation, taking the best from each other, also has a constant influence. Therefore, culture has no distinction between East and West. We should be inclusive and choose the good and follow it, but we should mainly adapt to national conditions and the spirit of the times. Our country has a long history and a profound culture, forming an independent system in thought. Since the late Qing Dynasty, due to external forces and changes in the situation, we have absorbed Western civilization and formed the times. We were shocked by the strength of strong soldiers and cannons, and dazzled by the difference between freedom and enjoyment. Without careful insight, we only copied the superficial. The abuses have led to the destruction of the existing social morality and system, and developed into an unprecedented upheaval in the ideological circles of the past 30 years. The dregs of individualism and communism have further led the country and society to confusion and disorder. We have also been subjected to the evil forces of Anglo-American aggression and alienation, and have fallen into the past tragedies of mutual残 and mutual害 between the people of China and Japan. Shanghai is the cultural center of the country. After the incident, the educational undertakings have been severely damaged, the youth have been displaced, and the cultural and publishing aspects have also suffered a setback due to material difficulties and lack of talent. We are determined to learn from the spirit of the Meiji Restoration in friendly Japan, and we will not hesitate to re-establish the East Asian-based cultural system, reorganize the cultural undertakings in the ruins, and make it our responsibility to practice Sino-Japanese cooperation and contribute to the realization of East Asia's goals. The East Asian-based culture promoted by the people does not deny that the culture of all parties should have its established and unchangeable particularity, nor does it deny the existence of Western culture. However, we should carefully study it, and according to the spirit of the times, extract its essence, so that it can form a new organism of our culture with our inherent cultural governance, and be in harmony with the spirit of Eastern morality and the ideals of loyalty, filial piety, benevolence, love, faith, righteousness, and peace advocated and practiced by the past saints and sages. This will contribute to the lasting happiness of the world and mankind. Based on this belief, in addition to establishing the East Asian-based cultural system, we should also cooperate in the Greater East Asia War to liberate the East Asian nations, eliminate the bad influence of Anglo-American ideas lurking in the psychology of the state, society, and the people, and strive to promote the fundamental belief and determination of the Eastern moral spirit.

Second, to implement the government's wartime cultural policy. Since the National Government joined the war and friendly Japan implemented a new policy towards China, our cultural comrades have thoroughly realized the need to unite closely and vowed to work actively under the leadership of the government to formulate a cultural policy that is based on the interests of the country. In June of this year, the Supreme National Defense Council approved the wartime cultural propaganda program, which not only unified the wartime cultural undertakings and strived to develop and revive them, but also greatly urged and motivated the cultural figures themselves. The intention is to promote national policies, which are rooted in the top-down approach. To cooperate in this once-in-a-lifetime war for the self-liberation of the East Asian nations, we must also work hard to realize our determination to participate in the war, and cooperate effectively with friendly Japan and other East Asian allies in all aspects, in order to promote the effectiveness of the ideological and cultural wars. Culture is the core of all social undertakings, and all important departments of culture, such as academics, publishing, art, literature, music, drama, and film, are indispensable weapons for wartime propaganda. As this association is reorganized and established in Shanghai, the cultural center of the country, on this day when friendly countries have returned the concessions and everything is waiting to be done, it is our unshirkable responsibility to unite cultural comrades from both countries, implement the government's wartime cultural policy, and devote our intelligence to actively contribute to the war and strive for victory through cultural activities. The people are also determined to uphold this proposition, reorganize the ranks, and strive to cooperate and promote progress, so that Shanghai's cultural circles can become a model for national culture with the efforts of this association. The government's painstaking efforts and the belief in the victory of the East Asian War can be deeply rooted in the society and the people, so that the brilliant future of Sino-Japanese cooperation can be established on a solid foundation.

At the beginning of the reorganization of this association, the promotion of association affairs is still waiting to be done. Although the responsibility is arduous, we dare not fail to live up to this moment. We deeply hope that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, so that we can encourage each other and complete the mission. This is our declaration.

Tribute Telegram

Zhou Huarren respectfully read the tribute telegram to President Wang of the Nanjing National Government Executive Yuan, "Harmony is established, and the people are liberated. We look forward to the development of the country and establish the great plan of the country. We work diligently and are dedicated to the country. We admire you as the high pillar of the state and the heavy Mount Tai. Your divine plans are deeply admired. Since Shanghai recovered the concessions, its sovereignty has been firmly ensured, and the cultural thoughts have gradually been brought back to the right track. In the future, under your leadership, we will continue to encourage and strive to promote the communication of Sino-Japanese culture, so as to complete the mission of the wartime cultural system. The branch was reorganized and established on the 4th of this month. We respectfully pay our respects and wish you well. Respectfully, The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Reorganization and Inauguration Meeting. Seal." To His Excellency Prime Minister Tojo of the Imperial Government of Japan, Tokyo, "Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the East Asian nations have been liberated, and the Shanghai concessions have been returned. China's sovereignty has been firmly ensured, and we are deeply grateful for your leadership. After the military victory, we must continue to work hard to complete the mission of the holy war, to eliminate American thoughts and build a new East Asian culture. The branch was reorganized and established on the 4th of this month. We respectfully send this telegram to express our respect and wish you well. Respectfully, The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Reorganization and Inauguration Meeting. Seal."

### Coal Ration of Shutdown Factories Transferred to Legitimate Users

Coal Briquette Supply Situation Expected to Improve

Some factories in this city are currently shut down due to material problems. Yesterday, people from the coal industry told a commercial reporter that the authorities have stopped the coal ration for shutdown factories starting this month. When the factories resume operation, they can reapply for coal. The number of shutdown factories in this city is not small, so the amount of coal rations stopped each month is considerable. It is now heard that the authorities have allocated these coal rations to other legitimate users. It is now late autumn, and winter is not far away. The demand for coal will increase. Some hotels, bathhouses, and restaurants will ask the authorities to increase the amount of coal allocated. To prevent coal panic, the relevant authorities have ordered a large amount of coal from the producing areas. Some of it has already been shipped to Shanghai, and the rest is still being transported. The coal briquette supply situation in this city once showed a panic phenomenon, and various retail stores raised prices and refused to sell. The current coal briquette situation has also changed. The city has more spot goods.

Sugar Merchants Cooperative Purchases Huge Amount of Sugar, Total Sugar Price Reaches 40 Million Yuan

The citywide sugar supply faced a serious threat after the war, but this threat has been largely resolved since the implementation of the sugar rationing system. Currently, all Chinese merchants are shipping large quantities of sugar from Taiwan to continue the supply and maintain the rationing system. According to a Central News Agency report, the military allocation department has purchased a large quantity of sugar, with a total value of 40 million yuan. As a result, sugar warehouses have ample reserves, and there is no concern about sugar rationing and supply.

Half a piece of soap and one small package of matches per month

A rationing system will be implemented for various daily necessities. The rationing of matches and soap has been decided and will be piloted in the First and Eighth Districts. If the results are good, it will be extended to the entire city. The First and Eighth Districts were originally scheduled to implement the system on the 4th, but due to the printing of purchase certificates and other procedures, implementation could not proceed as scheduled and must be postponed for a few days. It is expected to be announced and implemented within a few days. According to reliable sources, each person will receive one piece of soap (half a block) and one small package of matches per month, rationed once a month and sold at a limited price. Citizens can purchase these items at designated retail stores by presenting their purchase certificates, following the same procedure as buying rice.

Chen Bingjun, the chief prosecutor of the prosecutor's office, in order to conserve resources during wartime, yesterday informed his staff that the practice of using public vehicles or transfers to pick up and drop off public officials for daily commutes was acceptable in peacetime.

All staff members should understand the current difficulties and no longer use cars for transportation to and from work.

Economic Circles' Review

### Since Strengthening the Control System

Since the beginning of the war, the country that has implemented the most effective economic controls among the participating nations is undoubtedly our ally, Japan. As an island nation, Japan's ability to control the vast Pacific War economically is undoubtedly due to its strict control policies. Germany, Italy, the Soviet Union, and the United States and Britain have also implemented strict control systems. The stronger and more thorough the control system, the more balanced wartime prices and the more stable people's livelihoods, which is a direct proportion.

Observing the recent improvement in Shanghai's economic situation – the disappearance of speculators, the liquidation of hoarders, the trend of price stabilization, the gradual relaxation of tensions, and the gradual resettlement of itinerant traders – allows us to feel the effects that have been achieved since strengthening the control system. Current facts such as the sealing up of forty-one gauze factories with non-compliant registrations, the Grain Control Association's implementation of rice procurement this week, the imminent rationing of soap and matches, the consideration of salt rationing, and the reasonable rectification of prices in various industries all show that the authorities' determination to strengthen the control system is growing day by day.

The key to strengthening the control system lies in the awareness that the people should have under a controlled economy, which can be summarized as follows: Absolutely obey national control laws, Defeat actions that hinder the control system, Participate in various movements to increase production, Eliminate the idea of satisfying one's own desires, Everyone should embrace the idea of "everyone has food to eat," especially the executors of control should be careful not to abuse their power for personal gain, and those subject to control should be careful not to take risks. Only in this way will the executors and those subject to control not be subject to national legal sanctions.

### Weaving Factory Workers Request Relief for Livelihood

Since the government implemented the policy of purchasing yarn, more than 280 weaving factories in the city have suspended operations due to the interruption of raw materials. The livelihood of the workers in each factory has become a problem. Therefore, the cloth factory trade association to which the industry belongs has prepared a document requesting the National Commercial Control Association to provide relief, and stated that they should provide raw materials earlier to maintain production. It is known that the Commercial Control Association is quite sympathetic to this. However, because the allocation issue must await the approval of the government authorities, the Commercial Control Association has no decision-making power. Therefore, it has replied to the association, promising to forward the application for relief to the government after it distributes materials.

### Increasing Cotton Production Requires Adjusting Purchase Prices; Control Authorities Will Use This as a Guideline

In order to re-handle the unified cotton procurement work, the National Commercial Control Association decided to dissolve the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and establish a Cotton Department to take charge of the matter. It is now the harvest season for new cotton this year, and if the climate is normal in the next one or two months, the future can be expected to be optimistic.

However, according to the opinions expressed by authoritative figures in the cotton industry, the main area for raw cotton production is the area north of the Yangtze River. Last year, because the price of raw cotton was restricted too low by the military, farmers were unwilling to cultivate it, and even changed cotton fields to plant miscellaneous grains with higher profits, so the cotton field area decreased. This phenomenon has not improved until this year, so the cotton field area is still smaller than in the past. To achieve the same or greater harvest than in the past on a smaller area, special technical improvements are necessary. The control authorities, aware of this, have been working to improve cotton technology this year. At the same time, in order to break the established fact of reduced cotton fields, there is a strong intention to appropriately adjust the purchase prices set in the past so that farmers are happy to plant cotton and are happy to sell the cotton they produce. It can be seen that adjusting cotton purchase prices is a good way to encourage farmers to plant cotton and expand cotton fields. If this plan is implemented smoothly, then an increase in cotton production can be expected, and the current year's work of control can achieve satisfactory results. The Commercial Control Association's cotton procurement work will use this principle as a guideline.

### Oil Specialty Committee Establishes Office to Purchase Miscellaneous Grains

The Miscellaneous Grains Specialty Committee, in view of the imminent arrival of various grains from different places, has made complete preparations for the necessary steps such as procurement, distribution, and transportation. The Specialty Committee has also established offices in eleven regions, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suhu, Anqing, Huai Bei, Tonghai, Taidong, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Wuxi, and Suzhou, to improve the purchasing organization. The classification of purchases is approximately as follows: miscellaneous grains, beans (soybeans, red beans, etc.), corn, sorghum, oil fertilizers, vegetable seeds, cotton, peanuts, sesame, etc.

### Chinese Stock Trends

Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation was mostly waiting for the resumption of the stock market. However, small amounts of profits were sold off, and under the general downward trend, there was no shortage of late absorption, so although the prices of various stocks fell, they were mostly stable. Some stocks, such as those in the financial and cultural industries, were held by investors, and prices rose. Other stocks, such as Dachunghua Matches and Jingfu Shirts, rose due to news of capital increases. Public utilities fell the most, while other stocks such as department stores and new businesses experienced small declines. Trading was not dull. The movements of stocks in various industries are recorded below.

Financial: There were no sellers. Continental Bank rose slightly, and Xinye and Jincheng Salt Industry also rose. Shanghai China South, China First, and Zhongyi Trust remained stable, while Xinye Bank saw a slight decrease.

Cultural: World Book Bureau traded in a narrow range and then remained stable. The Commercial Press and Zhonghua Book Company rose due to limited supply. Yongxiang Printing, Standard Paper, Qingong, and Jinfeng Paper all had transactions, with prices similar to last weekend.

Department Stores: Wing On Company traded in a small range, and remained weak in the afternoon, eventually recovering slightly. Guo Huo and China Underwear fell slightly. Sincere Company also fell. The price of Sincere Department Store after the dividend remained stable, with balanced supply and demand. Guanghua Department Store was weak and lacked energy.

Textiles: The fluctuations of Wing On Textile were even smaller, and it was weaker in the afternoon. Da Sheng Factory No. 1 suddenly saw an increase, while Factory No. 3 remained stable. Dafeng and Qinyi both rose to their former levels. Rongfeng Weaving saw a slight decline, due to the sharp rise in the past few days. Zhongfang Xinhe also saw a decline. The trading of Mayar Silk entered the market, and the prices of Lunhua, Meilun, Tianlun Silk Weaving, and Dagong Dyeing were stable. Zhentai Wool Weaving was strong, while Hong Yi, Wuhe, Hongxing, and Dachunghua Weaving were stable. The buying interest in Jingfu Shirts was firm, and the trading price of Jinglun was close to its par value.

Industry: Dachunghua Matches initially saw a slight decline in the morning, but the demand suddenly increased in the afternoon, causing it to rise sharply by half a grade, with very few sellers. Nanyang Tobacco Company remained at its original price, while Huacheng remained stable. Jiuan Industry and United Industry saw more gains in the afternoon, while China Industry, excluding dividends, was still favored by investors. Guohua and China Investment remained stable as before. New Asia Jianrong fluctuated slightly lower. The price of Zhonghua Cinema, excluding dividends, was still being absorbed. Standard MSG and Fumin Dairy were stable. Kangyuan Weaving, Guan Sheng Yuan, and Meilin Canned Food all showed weakness. Sanyou Industry was the only one that stood firm.

Pharmaceuticals: New Asia saw fluctuations inside and outside the customs area, but eventually remained stable. China France and China Four, and China England Three pharmacies all saw a small decline. The prices of Wuzhou Pharmacy and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factory were stable.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity fell by more than one grade, and China Electric also fell by one grade. Public Electric and Xiangsheng Tricycle also fell. Hanyeping was the only one that rose outside the customs area. China Coal remained stable.

Real Estate: Lianhua declined slightly following the trend, while Wing Hing Property remained stable.

### Business Summary

Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds was unusually quiet yesterday, with very little trading. Prices continued to struggle to rise, and confidence was weak. Other transactions were not carried out at all. Category C bonds were also weak and unable to do anything. However, because there was too little trading, it dissipated around 11:00, so the final levels were no different from last weekend.

Rice and Grain: Yesterday's grain market saw a moderation in sentiment due to news that the Rice Association was actively engaged in procurement, leading to a decrease in buyers. Prices therefore fell. Oil grains were cold due to free circulation and ample supply, and also showed a weakening trend.

Rayon: Trading was quiet. Investors were very aggressive in acquiring, and sellers took the opportunity to push up prices, so prices were frequently called higher.

Opinions on the Food Problem - Special Compilation Four -

### Regarding Hopes for Grain

— Zhang Jingbai

During wartime, it is a good method for the government to implement unified control and rationing of daily necessities such as food and clothing for the people, and to prohibit merchants from freely monopolizing supplies. However, the unified control and rationing in our country often fails to satisfy the people, especially concerning the grain issue, which is often criticized by the general public. This isn't a problem with the theory of unified control and rationing itself, but rather because the technical mechanisms for managing grain administration are not yet perfect and comprehensive. Here are a few points that I personally feel, which I offer to the grain administration authorities.

Firstly, grain transportation specialists cannot be effectively handled by outsiders to the grain industry. The grain administration authorities should hire trustworthy personnel from within the grain industry to manage it. For other administrative documents and cashier personnel, it is best to openly recruit new people. This demonstrates open operations and avoids suspicion of monopoly. It also has the effect of mutual supervision, reducing opportunities for collusion and fraud. The grain administration should create and publicize a list of the names, positions, and work situations of all levels of staff who are sincere and employed, so that the public can know who are truly serving the public with integrity and enthusiasm. If there are further instances of fraud, the true names of the perpetrators and those involved should also be publicized. Do not handle matters vaguely, lest it encourage future imitators. In workplaces dealing with the public, it is best to imitate window service methods used by postal administrations and railways. The names of those on duty should be clearly marked. If those on duty do anything out of line, everyone can report them by name for public investigation. I think if the grain administration authorities can truly implement this, those who come to serve will definitely not dare to commit fraud.

Regarding financial matters, the expenses of the grain administration can be roughly divided into three types: salary and allowance costs, administrative costs, and transportation costs. I believe that for salaries and allowances, it is necessary to ensure that the staff can live stably in order to work hard. Do not allow staff to feel threatened by their living conditions, which may lead to corruption and neglect of work. It is hoped that the grain administration authorities will always guarantee the lives of the staff, eliminating the initial idea of such misconduct in advance, which would be a wise measure. As for administrative and transportation costs, efforts must be made to reduce them as much as possible. Save where possible, and do not waste a single cent.

Regarding grain prices, there is currently a large discrepancy between the official grain prices and market prices, especially in cities, where the difference can even be about three times. People generally say that the official price is indeed too low and too far from the market price, which makes it particularly difficult to collect grain. This reason is actually not sufficient. The original intention of the unified control and rationing system for materials is to prevent prices from rising. The current situation is that the general prices of goods are higher than the official grain price. The proper thinking is that grain prices should not be raised further, as this will stimulate commodity prices, creating a causal cycle. The general commodity prices should be lowered, which would be reasonable. Regarding lowering general commodity prices, the grain administration does not have this power, so we will not discuss it for now. Before the general commodity prices are lowered, in order to facilitate the purchase of grain, the government may designate the continued materials that have been purchased and confiscated by related industries to be handed over to the grain administration in food-scarce areas. According to the situation of the obtained grain, exchange and ration them at low prices. This would not only allow farmers to obtain cheap necessities but also quickly lower general commodity prices, which would be a win-win situation.

Regarding procurement and transportation, in the past, many places used a system of proportional allocation based on acreage to purchase grain at official prices. The county, district, towns, townships, and then the baojia system would order farmers to hand over grain and receive payment based on the acreage they cultivated. As a result, poor farmers with many mouths to feed but little land had to hand over the grain they had barely set aside for their own use. The wealthy, who owned hundreds of acres of fertile land, could sell the remaining grain at high prices because they still had excess grain after the allocation. This method is obviously unreasonable. It is hoped that the grain administration will not use the allocation system in the future. Otherwise, they should calculate the acreage of the farmer's land and deduct the grain reserved for their own use based on the number of people in the household. If there is any surplus grain, then purchase it. In that case, the wealthy may as well sell their surplus, and those who do not have enough can naturally be exempt. Regarding transportation, of course, seek speed, low cost, and convenience. In addition, a separate procurement and transportation certificate should be created, with an original and a duplicate, clearly stating the type of grain, the quantity procured, the quantity shipped, the packaging marks, the shipping location, and the destination, etc. The issuing agency should provide certification at the shipping location. The original should be carried by the escort for verification, while the duplicate should be mailed by the certifying agency to the public office or grain administration at the destination for comparison. Then, there will be no more fraud on the road during transportation.

Regarding quantity, the grain procured and transported by the grain administration, except for military use, is used to ration urban residents and people who do not have grain income. In the past, due to the type of grain, the amount rationed was really too small. Residents had to seek it on the black market due to their urgent needs. As a result, the black market went wild, and the goal of unified control and rationing almost had no position. It is hoped that the amount rationed can be gradually increased in the future, roughly at the rate of one and a half liters per person per month, otherwise the black market will not be reduced.

Regarding, currently, the method for the public to purchase rationed grain is that, except for a small number of large food canteens and institutions that purchase original packages from the grain administration, the majority of the public purchases from specially contracted retail outlets. Because the number of specially contracted retail outlets is extremely large and scattered, the grain administration cannot supervise them everywhere, which often leads to short weighing, swapping inferior grain, and mixing in miscellaneous things. It is hoped that the grain administration will find a way to abolish specially contracted retail outlets and set up its own retail outlets, with one outlet set up in each baojia district in the city. Then supervision can be thorough. Or reduce the number of specially contracted retail outlets, setting up one outlet for every two or three Lianbao as a standard, which can also reduce expenses and facilitate supervision. Regarding weights and measures, it is necessary to ensure that the scales are level and the dipper is full, and not allow slanting views of the bottom. Small dippers with shallow sides and small liters, caused by pressing the thumb on the surface, make it even easier to cheat, so they should not be used often. If setting up your own retail outlets, then the surplus or shortage of grain that occurs due to retail weighing should be certified by the supervisor and reported to the grain administration. In this way, short weighing can be reduced. When the grain is rationed with several types of grain each time, the specific type, quality, and quantity should be clearly specified. Do not vaguely say "either this or that". If there is substandard grain this time, and it is not sold uniformly everywhere, then you can designate a group of retail outlets from number X to number Y to sell the lower-quality grain, and rotate the exchange in the next period. Then the word "or" can no longer be needed. The drawbacks of swapping and mixing can definitely be reduced.

The ancients said: "The state is based on the people, and the people take food as their heaven." The grain issue, especially the grain issue during wartime, is indeed an important policy that must be handled well and cannot be easily handled. Its difficulty lies in the magnitude of its impact on the national economy and people's livelihood and the ease with which corruption can occur. Wise grain administration authorities, for the sake of the country and the people, will surely strive hard, be unyielding, and overcome this difficulty.

### The Benefits of Red Rice

— Lu Renren

In the past two months, the household rice received every period has been brown rice? Brown rice is red in color, and people call it red rice because of its color. It is quite hard. If cooked improperly, it often results in uneven, hard grains, making the cooked rice difficult to swallow. Thus, people complain. In fact, red rice is very good. Each liter can cook two more bowls of rice than white rice. When cooking rice, just add more water, let it boil thoroughly, soak it longer, and steam it enough, and you will succeed in making delicious red rice. Moreover, red rice contains more vitamin B, which can cure beriberi, because its embryo has not been removed. White rice is delicious, but its effects are far inferior. In this era of scarcity, everything should know that material resources are scarce! The authorities have put in a lot of effort to maintain the rationing of household rice! We are fortunate to be able to eat red rice, why complain?

Chinese Church Daoyi Council raises funds for the orphanage

The Chinese Church Daoyi Council, in order to rescue orphans, established an orphanage in Dongyaotaoyuan, Wuxi, which has been completed and has begun to accept children. The planned quota is 100 people, and the temporary care fee for each person is 300 yuan per month, requiring 3,600 yuan per year. Yesterday, a meeting of directors was held at the council's office, presided over by Bishop Qian. More than 30 people attended, including Lin Kanghou and Huang Liang. After Chairman Shen Shenshun of the Council reported, a discussion was held on raising regular expenses for the orphanage. The directors each took responsibility for their respective tasks and hoped that philanthropists from all walks of life would adopt orphans.
