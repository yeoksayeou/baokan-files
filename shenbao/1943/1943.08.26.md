### Wartime Responsibilities of Chinese Women

In the modern world, all countries have moved beyond traditional views of women's power and now value it. Especially in wartime, when young and strong men are on the front lines serving the country, or undertaking important production to assist the war effort, the maintenance of social order in the rear, anti-air raid and anti-espionage work, the protection of transportation, and participation in general production have all been entrusted to women. Whether women are loyal or not has a very close relationship with the war and the country's fate. If you read today's "Wartime Women of the World" symposium published in this newspaper, you will see that women in both Axis and anti-Axis countries have been directly and indirectly mobilized and are participating in the war. Their main task today, especially for women in Axis countries, is first to follow the government's population policy, encourage childbirth, and do their best to raise children. For example, the Italian government explicitly stipulates that husbands under the age of twenty-six with an annual income of less than 12,000 lira are eligible for a loan of 1,000 to 3,000 lira upon marriage, with interest starting six months after marriage. If pregnancy occurs within five months of marriage, repayment can be postponed until a year and a half later. If there is no childbirth four years after marriage, the interest rate will be 2%. The full amount will be reduced by 10% after the birth of the first child, and reduced for each subsequent child, until all repayments are waived after the birth of the fourth child. There are also special preferential treatments for families with many children. Germany also has a similar population policy. Women who produce many children are regarded as an honor for contributing to the country. Second, they are to undertake various jobs for the country. For example, in Germany, according to the General Mobilization of Labor Law, all women between the ages of seventeen and forty-five must participate in labor service teams, performing compulsory labor from farms to factories. In Italy, all women between the ages of fourteen and sixty must be mobilized, so 50% are serving the country. In Britain, women aged eighteen to forty-two, even if married, are liable for conscription if they have no young children. The women's army, just in the army, navy, and air force support units, numbers 500,000. Women are also widely recruited into the US Army, Navy, and Air Force. As for the Soviet Union, according to the Stalin Constitution, the boundaries between men and women have long been eliminated, and women participate in national affairs in the same way, spreading throughout all economic and military sectors. Seeing these records of women serving their countries, and then looking back at Chinese women, one cannot help but sigh at the vast difference.

Chinese history is full of female heroes such as Qin Liangyu, Hua Mulan, and Liang Hongyu who were loyal to the country, but as far as the current situation is concerned, the vast number of uneducated women struggle on the line of subsistence. Although they work hard, what responsibility do they have to the nation and the country? No one knows. Even some people who have received some modern education, after leaving school and marrying, think about how to enjoy themselves every day, playing cards at home and watching movies outside. Who cares about their responsibility to the nation and the country? Of course, in schools, in government agencies, and in legitimate industrial and commercial circles, there are still some women who work hard and solemnly, but compared to the whole, they are a very small portion.

What we want to say today about the responsibilities of Chinese women in wartime is not to expect them to join the army and engage in armed combat like the women of modern powers, nor do we hope that they will have more children for the nation and the country. The greatest responsibility of Chinese women today is first, "frugality," which means thrift. Although the blame for the general extravagance and waste in today's society cannot be entirely placed on women, if women cannot uphold frugality, especially the vanity of some women, it is often the driving force for men to live an extravagant life. What's more, it is inevitable that this will lead to men's embezzlement, bribery, speculation, gambling, risky crimes, and other situations. Therefore, we hope that women in our country will especially promote the ancient Chinese virtue of thrift during this wartime and work together to eliminate the atmosphere of extravagance and waste. The second is "diligence," which means participating in production and social services. We do not necessarily have to take on important jobs in military factories or heavy industry sectors like the women of powerful countries, but which of the large and small industries, agriculture, animal husbandry, and handicrafts and cottage industries are not suitable for Chinese women to participate in? Furthermore, charitable undertakings, baojia affairs, air defense work, and popular education can all be participated in according to one's ability. If everyone takes pride in production, work, and social service, then Chinese women's contribution to the country and society will definitely be great!

The responsibilities of Chinese women in wartime that we want to point out are nothing more than the two words, "diligence" and "frugality," that the ancient sages taught women. There is nothing particularly difficult or onerous, but it is not easy to ask all women in the country to fully practice them. For example, take frugality. Every Chinese woman understands this, especially the vast majority of poor women who have reached a state of poverty where they cannot save any further. However, many people misunderstand the concept of thrift, often limiting it to saving only what they own privately, but not saving public property or what others own, and even considering not seeking medical treatment when sick as saving money, or evading public welfare donations as saving money. As a result, it contradicts the meaning of wartime thrift. Another example is diligence and production, which also do not need to be promoted, but are only for private production, regardless of the interests of the country and society. Like the women on the train who are engaged in "dan bang" (independent small business), and the women on the street carrying rice, if their ingenuity, bravery, adventurousness, and spirit of sacrifice were transferred to work that is beneficial to the country and society, what great achievements would they reap! Therefore, if we want Chinese women to fulfill their wartime responsibilities today, we must pay attention to the following points.

In order for Chinese women to fulfill their wartime responsibilities, first, all national and social undertakings and institutions must truly open up to women, allowing women with talent to participate in responsible work. Second, it is necessary to effectively promote the wartime women's movement, organize women from all walks of life, and vigorously launch savings and production work. Third, it is necessary to popularize women's education and popular education for children, so that ordinary housewives and poor women can read, understand the overall situation and their own responsibilities. Fourth, it is necessary to do our best to cultivate the cadres of the women's movement, so that they can take on the work of leading women. In addition, there are still many women with lofty ideals who, due to family burdens and children, sacrifice the efforts of the country's many years of cultivation and are bound by trivial family matters. This is a loss to the country. Therefore, matters such as salary increases for civil servants and the establishment of nurseries, so that educated women can come out to participate in the cause of the country and society, are also urgent matters today. This remains for wise authorities to consider.

### Solomon Islands: Intense Fighting on Munda Coast; Japanese Planes Repeatedly Attack Enemy Transportation Lines

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 25th: The battle situation in the South Pacific, centered on New Georgia Island and Vella Lavella Island, is becoming increasingly fierce due to the enemy's fierce offensive and our side's fierce counterattack. The Imperial Army and Navy garrison on New Georgia Island has been fighting fiercely against tens of thousands of enemy troops who landed since June 30, inflicting great damage everywhere. They are currently engaged in fierce fighting in the northern coastal area of Munda and the Baibai Ke area. Enemy casualties in land battles are no less than 10,000. The enemy, who previously attempted to land on Vella Lavella Island, has lost many of its transportation routes due to repeated attacks by the Imperial Navy Air Force. Only a portion of the force successfully landed at Biloa. Subsequently, efforts were made to reinforce the troops. The Imperial Army and Navy garrison fought valiantly while the Navy Air Force worked hard to prevent the enemy from reinforcing their troops. Aerial battles were fought day and night in the skies and seas near the two islands, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. However, the enemy's momentum for a counteroffensive should not be underestimated.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - On the 23rd, a Japanese seaplane squadron discovered four enemy fast torpedo boats sailing in the Solomon Sea, in the sea area between Vella Lavella Island and Kise Island. They immediately carried out air sweeps, instantly sinking two of them, and the rest fled in panic.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The battle between Japanese and American forces in the central Solomon Islands is reportedly becoming increasingly fierce. Japanese army and navy soldiers are repelling the enemy's counterattacks and have repeatedly achieved astonishing results. According to the Japanese General Headquarters, the Japanese military's achievements since August 14 are as follows: On the night of the 14th, an enemy transport fleet departed from the Guadalcanal Island area and sailed to Vella Lavella Island under the escort of powerful warships. On the morning of the 15th, the navy and air force repeatedly attacked the enemy's transport fleet and warships five times, definitely sinking three cruisers, three destroyers, and five transport ships. On the night of the 17th, a Japanese navy destroyer fleet ambushed a powerful enemy fleet at the entrance of Vella Bay, severely damaging two enemy ships. On the 18th, the Japanese air force again bombed Biloa, the enemy's landing site on Vella Lavella Island, five times in a row. One enemy large destroyer was hit and caught fire, suffering heavy damage, and four enemy planes were shot down. On the midnight of the 19th, the Japanese seaplane squadron advanced to Vella Bay again and strafed four enemy destroyers with machine guns, repelling them. On the 21st, a joint squadron of Japanese fighter-bombers strongly attacked the enemy fleet in Biloa, shot down 14 enemy fighters, and sank and destroyed five enemy transport ships, achieving great results. The above is a summary of the confirmed results since mid-August, totaling the sinking of three enemy cruisers, eight destroyers, and twelve transport ships, for a total of 23 ships.

### Japanese Air Force Attacks Chongqing and Wanxian

Mori, Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 25th that the Japanese Air Force in China attacked Chongqing and Wanxian on August 23.

In addition to bombing the factory area there and causing it to catch fire, they also engaged with more than ten Chongqing fighter planes, shooting down eight of them (three of which were unconfirmed). One Japanese plane did not return. At 12:27, Wanxian was attacked. Bombing the docks and military facilities there caused them to catch fire, destroyed one large ship, and sank several small ships. All Japanese planes returned safely to base.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Air Force in China, for two years since September 1, 1941, has not attacked Chongqing. This time, suddenly at 12:30 on the 23rd, a joint squadron of powerful fighter-bombers attacked the military supply factory area in western Chongqing. All places were hit and caught fire. At that time, more than ten Chongqing fighter planes had already detected the Japanese planes were attacking, so they took off to meet them. As a result, the Japanese planes shot down eight Chongqing planes, including two (PF) planes, another two planes, and another plane whose type is unknown. In addition, three P/40 planes were confirmed to have been destroyed. One Japanese plane did not return in this battle. At the same time, another team of Japanese planes attacked the docks and military facilities in the Wanxian area along the Yangtze River northeast of Chongqing, causing them to be hit and catch fire, destroying large ships and sinking several small ships. Another team of Japanese planes searched for enemy planes far into Lingling, but the Chongqing army had already fled. All Japanese planes returned safely. Also, the planes that the Japanese planes attacked Chongqing and Wanxian this time were all Chongqing fighter planes. American planes did not participate and only took a bystander attitude.

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese military used dive bomber squadrons to search the Yangtze River near Shanghai for Chongqing military ships on the 24th. Two ships of 500 tons class were discovered sailing about ten kilometers upstream of Sandouping. An accurate attack was immediately launched on them, sinking one ship and severely damaging two. After severely damaging a 400-ton Chongqing military ship about 100 kilometers west of Badong Yichang, all Japanese planes safely returned to base.

According to the results of my inspection this time, the implementation in central China is already progressing well, and cooperation between China and Japan in North China is becoming increasingly close. The relationship between the North China Political Affairs Commission and the National Government is becoming increasingly close in political terms. In economic terms, the development of important resources and the strengthening of production are making great contributions to the prosecution of the Greater East Asia War. In the future, I hope that the gentlemen in North China will gather their strength and move forward to complete the common war."

### Second Writers' Congress Opens in Tokyo Yesterday: Declaration Expresses Determination

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Second Greater East Asia Writers' Congress grandly opened at 9:00 AM on the 25th at the Imperial Theater here. Representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, and other countries were present, as were members of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association, Chinese Ambassador to Japan Cai Pei, Manchurian Ambassador to Japan Wang Yunqing, Director General of the Japanese Information Bureau Eiji Amau, chief of the army news department Tanihagi Naohua, chief of the navy news department Yano, Director General of the Taisei Yokusankai (Imperial Rule Assistance Association) Koa Sobu (Asia Development Department), and representatives from the Ministry of Greater East Asia Affairs, as well as more than 2,000 people involved in the conference. After the opening ceremony, Kume Masao, the representative of China and Japan, gave an opening speech. Then, Shimo Gouchi was elected as the chairman of the conference. The chairman gave a speech, followed by congratulatory speeches by General Director Amau of the Information Bureau, Chief Tanihagi, Chief Yano, and representatives from the Ministry of Greater East Asia Affairs. After that, representatives of China Ji Yue Ran, Japan Yokomitsu Riichi, Manchuria Kobo, and Mongolia Bao Chong made speeches to express their determination in the spirit of literary patriotism. After each representative's speech, the conference temporarily proposed and passed a vote to thank the army and navy soldiers on the front lines, and then announced the oath, expressing a very intense spirit of unity and a determination to destroy the British and Americans. The conference adjourned at 11:00 AM, and there was entertainment in the afternoon.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Second Greater East Asia Writers' Congress opened here today. The main point of the oath sworn by the attending representatives was that the Greater East Asia War has now reached a decisive stage, and the rise and fall of East Asia is at stake today. We must be invigorated with great ambition and make the final blow to destroy Anglo-American culture. May God protect us, maintain the great glory of East Asia. No matter what difficulties we encounter, we will fight with an unyielding determination to win victory. We have become comrades-in-arms and blood brothers. For the rebirth of Greater East Asia, we will share life and death, love and help each other, to complete the mission of this conference.

General Director Amau's Address

Main points of the speech Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau General Director Amau gave a speech at the conference on the 25th. The main points are as follows: Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has occupied vast territories of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, and is actively engaged in construction in both material and spiritual aspects. This great war achievement and leap in construction are unifying and combining the politics, economy, thought, and culture of the entire Greater East Asia region, and are leading to prosperity, and from this will emerge great Greater East Asia literature. The history of Greater East Asia is also a history of American greed and aggression, so unless these East Asian aggressors are eliminated, the East Asian peoples will never be liberated. Although Britain and the United States falsely claim to be fighting for "democracy," they are using this as a slogan to attract sympathy and lure neutral countries into the war. Moreover, their so-called democracy is just the democracy of white people, and they are hypocritically using words for their own benefit. Speaking of the attitude of Britain and the United States towards China, they instigated the Chongqing side to fight against Japan, hoping that the East Asian nations would suffer mutual losses. Fortunately, under the leadership of Chairman [Wang], the National Government of Chongqing returned to the south and cooperated with Japan. The Japanese side will also completely return all special rights and interests in China, and sincerely cooperate with the Chinese people to build China. At the same time, most Chinese people have already realized the conspiracy of Britain and the United States and are jointly advancing towards the establishment of Greater East Asia with Japan. However, the Chongqing side is still dreaming of relying on Britain and the United States and has not yet awakened. However, Britain and the United States regard Chongqing only as an emergency tool and have no sincerity towards China. Moreover, there are countless contradictions in the Atlantic Charter. Among them, it is said that Britain and the United States have no ambition to expand their territories through this war, but on February 13 of this year, US Secretary of the Navy Knox actually clarified that the United States will occupy various islands in the Pacific after the war, and the so-called national self-determination spirit in the charter also exposed its true face due to the India question. The Greater East Asia Writers' Congress that we are holding now will be attended by representatives of the newly independent country of Burma and representatives of the soon-to-be independent Philippines. The time is not far off when India, after independence, will send representatives to attend this conference. This conference bears many important missions, but what we must especially remember is the joint construction of Asia. Once the Greater East Asia War breaks out, the power of Britain and the United States will be expelled from Greater East Asia. Not only in the political and economic fields, but also in the ideological and cultural fields, the original face of Asia has been restored. The construction of East Asia is tied to the creation of Greater East Asia literature. The creation of Greater East Asia literature will promote the unity of the Greater East Asia nations. The construction of Greater East Asia and the creation of Greater East Asia literature are actually in a cause-and-effect relationship. The characteristics of each country's literature should be fully developed, and it is expected that humanists with grand ideas and excellent skills who unite Greater East Asia will emerge.

### North China Personnel Trained in Summer Visit Chairman to Pay Respects

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - A group of 64 public servants and youths from North China who participated in the second summer training camp arrived in Nanjing on the 24th. At 9:00 AM yesterday, the team, accompanied by members of the China Youth Model Corps, went to the mausoleum of the national father to pay their respects. After the ceremony, they had a picnic outside the mausoleum.

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Sixty-four students from North China who participated in the summer training camp of the New National Movement Youth League arrived in Nanjing on the 24th. At 4:00 PM on the 25th, they were led by Mr. Xu Xiqing, the director of the camp management office, to Chairman's official residence to respectfully pay their respects to the chairman. The chairman kindly received them and inquired in great detail about the situation of the youth movement in North China. Then, he greatly encouraged the students for their efforts in this training and for promoting the new movement in North China in the future. After listening to the instructions, the students were extremely inspired.

(Another dispatch) The group of students is scheduled to visit the Ministry of Education, the Ministry of Propaganda, and the Central Military Academy at 9:00 AM on the 26th, and pay their respects to Minister of Education Li and Minister of Propaganda Lin.

### Himmler Transferred to German Interior Minister

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Dentsu News Agency reports: Himmler has been appointed to the position of German Interior Minister. This is a political development that has been rumored for a long time. Since the National Socialist Party came to power, Herr Himmler has served as the leader of the German Stormtroopers and the Chief of Reconnaissance. He is also well-known in anti-Axis countries, known for not appearing in public places or giving speeches. He was a participant in the Munich March and has been responsible for protecting the party from the beginning. Therefore, he will undoubtedly fulfill his responsibility for the work of building the new National Socialist Party. The reorganization of the National Socialist Party has always had a great impact on the Stormtroopers, and now the leader of the Stormtroopers has been given the responsibility of directing internal affairs, which should facilitate the reorganization of Germany after the war.

### Britain and the United States Exert Diplomatic Pressure on Spain: Forcing it to Abandon its Neutral Policy

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Spanish government has been trying its best to keep Spain out of the war, but according to news from London, the anti-Axis powers have begun to take a more resolute attitude towards the Spanish government. Although the anti-Axis powers have always adopted a policy of reconciliation towards Spain, it is believed that they are now exerting diplomatic pressure on the Spanish government. One theory is that Spain needs economic assistance, and if the Spanish government is unwilling to abandon its non-intervention policy, the anti-Axis powers will no longer supply Spain's needs.

Madrid, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency, British Ambassador to Spain Hall has left Spain and returned to London.

### Italian Government Notifies Britain and the United States that Rome has been Demilitarized

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani News Agency, in order to implement the official announcement of August 14 that Rome is a demilitarized city, the Italian government has requested the Vatican and the Swiss government to notify the British and American governments that the Italian government has taken the following measures and decided on the plan: All defense facilities in the city of Rome have ceased activities and high-altitude teams have stopped firing. Italian fighter planes have also been ordered not to fly over Rome. The headquarters of the German and Italian armies and their local troops have been actively evacuated, leaving only a garrison to maintain order. The Rome railway center will no longer be used for military transport. If loading and unloading crowds set fire or stop military vehicles, etc., there will only be one direct route within the vicinity of Rome. Finally, it has been started to move companies and military factories of military importance outside the residential areas of Rome.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Issue Joint Statement, Quebec Conference Declares End

Argentine Capital, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the British and American representatives began their talks in Quebec on the 11th of this month, they have reached various important agreements on the anti-Axis political and military strategies. The talks concluded on the 23rd, and the representatives of each country began their return trips from Quebec on the morning of the 24th. U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson left Quebec on the 23rd. U.S. Secretary of State Hull, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing, and other representatives are scheduled to return to Washington one after another on the 24th. It is rumored that British Foreign Secretary Eden has gone to Moscow with U.S. Secretary of State Hull. British Prime Minister Churchill met with a group of reporters after the end of the talks, but his subsequent whereabouts are unknown. Some say he will go to Washington, while others say he will return to London on the weekend, but there is no consensus. In addition, Churchill and Roosevelt issued a joint statement after the end of the talks, as follows: With the friendly hosting of the Canadian government, a war conference was held between the United Kingdom and the United States in Quebec from the 11th of this month, and it has now come to a successful conclusion. This conference reviewed the operational situation on all fronts of the world, referring to various events published after the meeting between the British Prime Minister and the U.S. President in Washington in May of last year. At the same time, the actions of the British and American combined forces and the army and air force, as well as various military decisions, have been agreed upon.

Three-Nation Conference May Be Convened

Regarding the complex operational actions of these army, navy, and air force forces in all parts of the world, it is believed that it is absolutely necessary to have a unified operational objective and method to guide the war in its entirety. In the future, the United Kingdom and the United States will intensify their efforts to fight against the Axis powers and will hold talks in a shorter period of time than in the past. Regarding the various matters decided during the talks, if they are easily published, it will be detrimental to the fighting forces, because the decisions are specifically designed to materialize strategies for winning the war. However, it can be stated that the theme of this meeting was to wage war against Japan and provide effective assistance to Chongqing. In addition, the unanimous recommendation of the Joint Chiefs of Staff to emphasize both the East Asian and European war theaters was also accepted and recognized. In addition, opinions on the political issues behind the war and the political issues arising from the war operations were also consistent. The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to convene other meetings before the end of this year. If possible, contact with the Soviet Union will be made, and a three-nation conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held. In addition, a detailed report on the various matters decided at the conference regarding the war against Germany and Italy will be submitted to the Soviet government. The relationship with the French Committee of National Liberation was also discussed at this meeting. The governments of the countries concerned will also issue statements within this week.

Remarks to the Press Corps

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Reuters reports from Quebec that the remarks made by Roosevelt and Churchill to 200 journalists at the close of the Quebec Conference yesterday are considered far more important than the final communiqué issued by the Quebec Conference on the scope of discussion among the political giants of the United Kingdom and the United States. When the British Prime Minister mentioned a "fixed resolution," he hoped that these decisions could be expressed as "large-scale actions." However, the communiqué, which was carefully constructed, did not mention this.

However, Churchill was more tight-lipped about the planned war in the Pacific. He declared that all preparations had been made for a long-term war, which is contrary to the quick-war plan foreshadowed in the communiqué. President Roosevelt said in his speech that the primary theme of the conference was the Pacific War plan, and that there was no need to invite the Soviet Union to participate in the conference because the Soviet Union had not engaged in war with Japan. From this perspective, the U.S. President clearly took the political importance of the Pacific War plan as a prerequisite, which has long been recognized by the general public. However, Quebec political figures know that the Pacific War plan is only one of the key issues on the Quebec Conference's agenda, and not the most important one, and that Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing was not invited to participate in the discussion until the day before the end of the conference, which shows that the Pacific War plan was originally of secondary importance.

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to news from Quebec, British Foreign Secretary Eden held a meeting with U.S. Secretary of State Hull in Quebec yesterday. Another official announcement stated that British Prime Minister Churchill is scheduled to broadcast on Saturday afternoon.

### Britain and the United States Press Towards the Gateway to the Mainland, Germany Reinforces Troops on Italian Soil

The importance of the Eastern Front is, of course, already known to everyone. However, the importance of the Southern Front, which broke through Sicily and pressed towards the gateway to the continent, cannot be ignored. The American troops who landed in Messina have begun to bombard Italian soil across five kilometers of sea. In Catania, Bizerte, and other enemy naval bases in the rear, some landing craft have already completed their assembly, closely following the retreating Axis forces, without wasting any time, and planning to land on the Italian mainland. What kind of countermeasures will Germany take in the future? This is what the whole world is watching. Germany's countermeasures for the Southern Front in the future have already been decided in the first, second, and third stages at the previous Hitler's headquarters meeting.

The Last Line of Defense on the Continent

In the foreign ministers' talks between Germany and Italy a few days ago, the steps of the first stage have been greatly promoted. The atmosphere in the German leadership is calmer than the last time the enemy landed in North Africa. Although there have been major events such as Mussolini's downfall and the abandonment of Sicily, there is no sign of embarrassment, and everything is within expectations, so they are extremely calm. Where does this calmness come from? The German General Staff's strategy for defending Europe has long been properly formulated. "Where does Germany decide on the last line of defense on the European continent?" This is the highest secret in Germany at present, and it is the center of its countermeasures. Whether it is more advantageous for the war front to move to the interior of Italy cannot be judged today. It cannot be judged solely from a purely military point of view, because since the anti-fascist revolution and major internal changes in Italy, Italy's pain has not yet fully recovered. The declaration of Rome as an unarmed city, the sensitive measures of the Badoglio government, and other major political factors are likely to have a significant impact on the war centered on Italy in the future.

Various Attempts by Britain and the United States

If the enemy recognizes Rome as an unarmed city and the military operations in the Roman city cease, the military defense of southern Italy will inevitably be greatly affected. From this point of view, Britain and the United States will inevitably carry out military and political operations in Italy in the future. The central theme of the current talks between Britain and the United States in Quebec is probably also this.

In this situation, the key to the Italian war situation depends on the fighting power and fighting consciousness of the Soviet soldiers, and the strength of the German forces stationed in important parts of the Italian mainland. Regarding this point, under the premise of joint operations and joint defense with the Italian army, Germany will naturally greatly strengthen its forces in order to defend the Italian mainland.

As for how the German forces stationed in Italy will act in southern and northern Italy, it cannot be easily predicted. If the German side still uses the previous tactics, the British and American forces, which have an absolute advantage in naval and air power, will inevitably put pressure on the Axis forces from the four miles of sea around Sicily. In the Mediterranean, where the sea is the stage, the enemy with offensive power, if they set foot on the continent, the German side has full confidence and strength to defeat them in one fell swoop. At present, the chances of Germany winning the war are probably in the following three situations.

Germany is Fully Prepared

First, in the Eastern Front, the main force of the Soviet field army is nearly powerless and is annihilated; second, the bombing of the British mainland is successful and affects the lives of 40 million British people; third, the troops landed by Britain and the United States on the European continent are annihilated by at least one million troops. According to foreign reports, Germany's military strength today is quite low compared to the first major attack on the Soviet Union. However, Germany's strength now possesses everything of the three major powers in central Europe, and it cannot be measured so simply. Germany's operations seem to have always focused on the Eastern Front, and it has thoroughly implemented its policy of prioritizing the Soviet Union. In the two years of confrontation on the Eastern Front, the German army has gained valuable experience, and the fundamental war policy of the German army today is not necessarily limited to prioritizing the Eastern Front. Therefore, Germany is now making various necessary preparations for the most likely of the above three situations, and as soon as the opportunity arrives, it will launch from all aspects to prevent escape.

The effects of the thorough national mobilization that Germany has carried out since February of this year will be seen in future facts. The fundamental changes and reorganization of cooperation can be expected to have a future development in the European war situation. From this point of view, some people advocate that Britain and the United States landing in Europe should be welcomed by Germany.

However, if this continental strategy fails, there is an unwarranted danger. Germany has long been fully prepared for the landing war across the English Channel. In addition, comprehensive countermeasures have also been taken in the Balkans.

But in the current situation, the front end of this peninsula, from an operational and geographical point of view, has almost the same characteristics as an island. Whether it is appropriate to take southern Italy as a battlefield for this kind of war of attrition should be judged by the German staff headquarters. We have no way of knowing. However, from the fact that the German army on Sicily was able to withstand all difficulties and adverse conditions and resist the British and American forces for more than five weeks, we believe that the British and American landing war on Italian soil will not proceed as smoothly as before.

To occupy the Italian mainland, at least 50 divisions of troops are required, and their logistical supply requires at least one million tons of ships per month. Previously, we have seen the special bomber aviation unit of the Axis powers launch a surprise attack on the enemy's escort convoy in the western Mediterranean, achieving the result of sinking 700,000 tons, and then on the 18th, attacking the large convoy waiting in the port of Bizerte in North Africa in preparation for the landing war, sinking 22 ships, 128,000 tons, and inflicting a destructive blow. The activity of the German air force in the Mediterranean will become more intense in the future. The tense situation on the Southern Front, not to mention the pain of the coup, is that Germany, with Italy, resisting the military forces of Britain and the United States, is about to break into the climax.

### Food Items Will Be Under Rationing System - Okazaki Talks About Stabilizing Prices and Currency Policies

Since the National Government implemented the wartime economic policy program, it has been rapidly studying and solving the problem of regulating prices and stabilizing people's livelihood. On the one hand, it is actively promoting the work of material control, and on the other hand, it is thoroughly investigating hoarding and speculation, cracking down on speculation, and curbing the rise in prices. Recently, the National Government has implemented the purchase of gauze and investigated the reasons for the rise in food prices, which has dealt a major blow to general hoarders and speculators. In addition to the current rationing of rice, flour, sugar, and oil, gauze will soon be rationed. In addition, matches, soap, etc. will be rationed at the beginning of next month. Therefore, the prices of various food items have slightly decreased in recent days. According to the forecast of a financial research institution, the price index for this month may fall compared to July.

Okazaki's Speech

At the information conference of the Japanese Embassy yesterday, Chief of General Affairs Okazaki made a very earnest speech on stabilizing prices and stabilizing the currency. Mr. Okazaki said: Regarding stabilizing prices and stabilizing the currency, the first is to promote the circulation of materials. To make materials circulate, it is hoped that merchants can automatically clear out hoarding, and citizens should no longer hoard daily necessities. In this way, materials will naturally circulate, prices will also fall, and the currency can also be stabilized. As for the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by the Chinese and Japanese authorities this time, it has received special attention from the general public. Therefore, the Chinese and Japanese authorities are also particularly cautious about this and are currently studying perfect and precise methods. Because in the past, materials in Shanghai had a tendency to not be smoothly distributed to all farmers, special attention is paid to this point this time, and research is being done on how to directly distribute them to farmers. If this method is successful, farmers, because they have obtained low-priced cotton cloth, will naturally sell their crops at low prices, and the purpose of material exchange will be achieved. As for the method of purchasing gauze, there is no law in Japan to forcibly purchase private property, so a recommendation method is used. However, if Japanese merchants violate the situation, they will be punished by Japanese criminal law, so its effect is exactly the same as compulsory purchase.

Stores Sealed Up

Six stores, including Shengsifu Hat Shop and [missing information] on Nanjing Road, were punished by the First District Office for violating the economic regulations of the district, and were ordered to suspend business for several days. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter specially visited the person in charge of the Economic Department of the First District Office, and he said: "This city's Shengsifu Hat Shop, Guanxin Ni Mao Shop, Dalai Shirt and Socks Factory, Shili Company, Gao Sanyi Paper Shop, and Shanghai Accounting Company were all found to have raised prices without prior approval, and after investigation by this department, were approved to be suspended from business for two to four days to show a slight warning. It is hoped that merchants and citizens will restrain themselves and sell goods in accordance with the regulations, and especially hope that citizens will assist in paying attention to stores that raise prices and report them at any time, so as to stabilize prices and stabilize people's livelihood.

### Second Police Bureau Holds Police Recruitment Examination

The Second Police Bureau of this city, in order to increase the local security forces, will recruit all vacant police officers within its jurisdiction to fill the vacancies and enrich the police force in the urban area. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter, the police examination has been scheduled by the bureau to be implemented at the Police Hospital on Qiaojia Road in the South City starting on the 9th of next month. Yesterday, a special order was issued to all subordinate sub-bureaus, etc., to strictly comply with it.

### 45th Period Household Rice Sales Certificates Awaiting Issuance - Citizens Look Forward to Speedy Rationing of Oil and Sugar

The 45th period household rice certificates may be issued today to the rice shops in the 182 districts. After the rice shops receive the certificates, they will pay the rice flour preparation section to exchange them for warehouse certificates and pick up rice from the designated warehouses. However, the quantity of household rice in this period is still awaiting formal announcement.

Oil and Sugar Sale Prices

The sale of the fifth period of household oil and the sixth period of household sugar has been eagerly awaited by residents for a long time, but the prices have not yet been determined. However, the general public believes that as prices are gradually falling, the prices of household oil and sugar should not be changed. Moreover, the raw materials for edible oil, the water year, can be said to be a good harvest, and there are continuous shipments from other ports, so its inventory can be said to be abundant, so there is no need to increase prices. For this reason, it is believed that the Changju will not approve any requests that may affect the rise of other prices.

Nanshi Household Sugar

According to Shangtong [missing information] news, the Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office originally allocated the fifth period of household sugar in Nanshi according to the population of the fourth period in the district. Later, the Buliang Food Bureau believed that the original sugar allocation was insufficient due to the increase in population in the two cities and the city center area, and requested to make up for the shortage, but because it did not first send a letter to the Shangtong Association, it was transferred to the Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office to pre-coordinate the distribution within the prescribed quantity, resulting in no sugar available for replenishment for a while. The Food Bureau had to postpone the issuance of the fifth period sugar certificates again and again because the request for replenishment had not been resolved. Now, the retail merchants who sell household sugar in the Nanshi District believe that sugar is a daily necessity for citizens, and the district has been unable to purchase it for no reason, and the sugar quality is melting due to the hot weather, resulting in losses. Therefore, they specially requested the Shangtong Association to handle it. It is heard that the association has transferred the request to the City Food Bureau to issue the fifth period citizen purchase certificates in the Nanshi District as soon as possible to meet the needs of the people. It is also heard that there is a solution to the replenishment of sugar.

Flour Rationing News

The Shanghai Special City Machine-Made Cut Noodle Industry Association has sent responsible representatives to the City Food Bureau to request permission to allocate flour on a monthly basis. The bureau has verbally agreed to allocate 170,000 bags of flour from September of this year, that is, to supply 80% of the industry's total monthly consumption of 215,700 bags, with a selling price of about 300 yuan per bag as the standard. Once the industry is allocated flour, it will be distributed to members of the four grades of A, B, C, and D. Each family will receive an average of about 100 bags at that time.

### Lianbao Injection Stations Close

The second epidemic prevention injection in this city this summer has almost been completed as of yesterday. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's inquiry to the health authorities, it is not planned to conduct another general injection within the water year after this injection. However, the authorities still hope that residents will take care of themselves and prevent cholera from occurring this year. Currently, each district's Lianbao Injection Station is scheduled to be closed after the injection date.

Nanshi Epidemic Prevention Ends Next Month

Since all citizens in the Nanshi District have been forced to undergo injections, there has been no epidemic outbreak even though the autumn sun is approaching, which shows that this year's epidemic prevention measures have achieved significant results. According to a report from a Central News Agency reporter, the district's epidemic prevention campaign is scheduled to end at the end of next month.

Seventy-Six People Died of Typhoid Fever

According to a report from the Japanese Consulate, 76 people died of typhoid fever last month, and 142 people suffered from dysentery, but there was no cholera outbreak, which is very satisfactory. Among the 142 dysentery patients, a total of 31 people died.

National Forum

### My Views on Establishing a Civil Servants' Cooperative in This City

- Guan Zhuohuan

At present, we, the middle and lower-level civil servants, are in a state of financial straits due to the relationship between prices, and we cannot plan for the evening. This is an undeniable fact. Just imagine that the meager salaries of civil servants are even less than those of ordinary salaried classes. Not to mention maintaining a family, it is simply a problem to maintain one's personal life. Fortunately, the government authorities are extremely concerned about our lives and are trying their best to improve our treatment. However, the increase in salaries is limited, while the rise in prices is endless. Our situation can be described as extremely difficult. However, when we think of the great responsibility we bear to the country and the nation, we have to take a step back and seek a way out through hard struggle. The establishment of a civil servants' cooperative can be said to be a positive and effective way to solve the living difficulties of civil servants at present.

Of course, the need for austerity in the national life during wartime is unavoidable, especially in the transitional period when the policy of economic control has not yet been fully implemented. The meaning of consumer cooperation is to gather the strength of the masses to jointly operate and seek daily necessities. If it is handled properly, it may not be possible to solve a part of our current living problems. Looking around the city, there is only one such organization, the newly established Citizens' Consumer Cooperative, which in fact seems insufficient to cope with the current environment. In addition, there are many institutions in the city, and the number of civil servants should not be small. If we can work together and jointly establish a cooperative of considerable scale, I believe that it will definitely have a great effect on improving the lives of civil servants.

Regarding the organization of the civil servants' cooperative, I would like to put forward the following principles for discussion based on my humble opinions: (1) Scope: All civil servants of any government agency within the jurisdiction of Shanghai Special City must join as members. The name is tentatively set as Shanghai Special City Civil Servants' Limited Cooperative (or Consumer Credit Cooperative). (2) Shares: The full amount of each share is set at 20 yuan. Each member must subscribe for at least one share, and no more than ten shares. If necessary, the share payment may be paid by the agency to which the subscriber belongs for convenience. (3) The internal structure should be simple in principle. Within the possible economy, appropriate personnel may be selected from civil servants of various agencies to serve concurrently in important positions within the cooperative. (4) The office location should be attached to any agency that is considered to meet the conditions, in order to reduce expenses and comply with the principle of frugality. (5) Management: The cooperative is supervised and guided by the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Social Welfare Bureau. Personnel designated by the bureau will be responsible for handling the matter. In order to obtain close contact with all parties, relevant supervisors or specialists may be invited to serve as nominal consultants or directors to seek advice. (6) Business: The main focus is on consumer cooperation business. Within the possible, credit cooperation and other welfare undertakings related to members should be gradually carried out.

Secondly, the establishment of a civil servants' cooperative has a very optimistic prospect under good conditions. A brief description is as follows: (1) The civil servants' cooperative is a comprehensive organization of various agencies in the city and has close ties with all parties. As long as the authorities actively provide various conveniences and powerful assistance in the allocation of material supplies, the results will be satisfactory and can be expected in advance. (2) After civil servants obtain fair-priced materials, the threat of prices is reduced, their lives gradually become stable, their work efficiency is invisibly improved, and the wind of corruption and profiteering is gradually eliminated, which is conducive to clarifying officialdom, which is by no means insignificant. (3) Due to the traditional thinking and habits of China, civil servants usually lack contact with each other and do not conspire with each other, like a plate of loose sand. The organization of the cooperative promotes the unity of civil servants, works together, and becomes a powerful and organized group. In addition to economic life, it can also simultaneously improve the community life and cohesion ability of civil servants.

In summary, the establishment of a civil servants' cooperative is of great significance and is urgently needed. There is no doubt that it is hoped that the civil servants of this city will rise up together and promote its early realization. It is even hoped that the central authorities and the municipal authorities will pay close attention and sympathy and take on the responsibility of advocating it. In the future, the organization of the cooperative will gradually be extended from this city to various places. Not only will our civil servants receive real benefits, but it is feared that it will also make a great contribution to the improvement of the entire national life!

### Building a Greater Shanghai - Road Administration Will Be Reformed

Since the recovery of the concessions, the authorities have a comprehensive plan for construction work, and strive to make Shanghai a good city. Regarding construction, the authorities will start with rectifying the road administration. According to the city's roads, many have been in disrepair for a long time, which not only hinders the appearance, but also has disadvantages for traffic. The public works authorities have begun to repair the broken road surfaces, and the damaged sidewalks are also being repaired.

Thoroughly Improve Drainage Engineering

Due to the excessive number of tall buildings in the city, the pressure on the road surface is very high. Over time, it gradually sinks, so that whenever there is heavy rain and the Pujiang tide is high, the roads are often flooded into ditches, traffic is blocked, and citizens suffer inconvenience. In order to remedy this, the authorities will thoroughly improve the drainage engineering, dredge the city's sewers, or rebuild them, so that rainwater can be quickly drained away.

Old Houses Ordered to Be Rebuilt

There are many houses in the city that have been in disrepair for a long time, which is very dangerous. The authorities believe that this kind of house directly endangers the lives and property of citizens, and should be repaired or rebuilt as soon as possible. The authorities have begun to investigate. If the old house is too old, the owner will be warned to rebuild it. In addition, the signs, advertisements, neon lights, etc. of the store must also be inspected at any time to see if they are firm, so as not to fall and injure pedestrians.

### Personnel of the First Police Bureau Continue to Learn Japanese

During the former Shanghai Municipal Council Police Headquarters, all police officers were required to learn Japanese. There was a spy class to teach them. Now that the bureau has been established, the police officers are still required to continue to study Japanese.

### Labor Insurance: Penalties for Overdue Enrollment; Business Offices Established in Nanshi

It is understood that while many factories have applied for labor insurance, there are still quite a few that have not registered. If factories continue to delay and remain hesitant, the bureau will impose penalties according to Article 10 of the regulations for factories that fail to register within the deadline. The bureau has also established business offices in key areas of the city to actively promote its business, so that insured persons can handle insurance procedures nearby.

### Eighth Labor Clinic Opens

It has seven branch clinics. Now, due to the concentration of factories in the Xujiahui district, an eighth branch clinic has been added at 1050 Wenlin Road, Beidang District, Xujiahui. The clinic will still be presided over by Dr. Lin. Clinic hours are from 9:00 to 11:00 AM. All laborers are exempt from consultation fees and general medication costs.

### Cotton Miscellaneous Goods Can Move Freely in This City

It has been found that there are no restrictions on the movement of cotton miscellaneous goods in this city.

### Soliciting Citizens' Opinions on Facilities in Greater Shanghai

August 1st is the day when Shanghai's municipal administration is unified. The new construction of Greater Shanghai thereafter is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the direction of municipal administration deserves the attention of citizens. And the quality of facilities, before the establishment of a civil representative body, should also be expressed with sincerity by the citizens. This newspaper is willing to fulfill its responsibility as the mouthpiece of the citizens. A dedicated space will be opened to disclose citizens' suggestions and reflect public opinion. It is planned to be published monthly, with the 1st of each month as the publication date.

Economic Commentary

### Rationing Plan

"It is not poverty that we fear, but inequality," is a famous economic saying from ancient China. The noble principle of rationing is to enable a portion of materials, especially those needed for daily life, to be supplied to everyone in society. Therefore, the most important element in any rationing plan is "equality." Secondly, efforts should be made to avoid "scarcity" as much as possible. Whether it is the rationing of rice, oil, salt, sugar, or even matches, all should be based on this principle, making plans that strive for both equality and the avoidance of scarcity. In addition, all actions that could undermine the rationing system, such as fraudulent claims and reporting, must be thoroughly prevented in the planning stage. Under these basic conditions, a perfect rationing plan can be achieved.

As the rationing plan for gauze and cloth after the purchase is currently being jointly studied and drafted by relevant parties, it is felt that the smooth implementation of the rationing method depends on whether the rationing plan can be carefully determined. If the future gauze and cloth rationing plan is truly comprehensive and considerate in all aspects, then all material rationing plans can "infer the other three corners from one corner."

### After the Arrival of Production Materials, All Factories Will Commence Operation to Increase Spot Supply and Suppress Prices

Factories in this city, such as textile, flour, oil, match, silk reeling factories, and other chemical and finished industrial product factories, will soon generally return to normal, starting production day and night to increase the supply of spot goods, suppress prices. If there is a surplus in consumption, it can be used to exchange goods with other places. The relevant departments are trying to facilitate the flow of raw materials.

Textiles

In the textile industry, a total of 67 factories managed by the military have been returned to Chinese management. After the military management is lifted, efforts are actively made to start operations as usual. Cotton, the raw material required, is being planned and prepared for extensive collection by the relevant parties such as the Cotton Industry Special Committee and the Cotton Industry Association. In order to encourage farmers to increase cotton production and sell cotton as much as possible, it is planned to moderately increase the purchase price of raw cotton so that farmers are happy to sell cotton, and the government agencies should also try their best to provide the textile factories with a sufficient supply of raw materials.

Flour

Wheat needed for flour milling is monopolized and purchased by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, which formulates a unified plan to supervise and manage wheat merchants, purchasing from producing areas at officially set prices. The purchase work has now come to an end. The purchased wheat is centrally collected and transported to flour mills in various regions to start manufacturing. The distribution and sale of finished products have now begun in various regions. The total distribution quantity, including the three provinces, is more than 30,000 per day. The distributed manufacturers purchase legally at a market price of 2%.

Oil

The raw materials required by the oil industry are soybeans, rapeseed, and peanuts. The current main persons in charge are the Oil and Grain Special Committee, the Poultry Oil Industry Association, and the Oil Industry Association, especially the Special Committee is the institution that has the overall responsibility. Soybeans are the main abundant produce of Manchuria, and in the past they were transported to Shanghai continuously. Now, due to transportation issues, there are many difficulties. What the authorities are currently considering is how to exchange the surplus materials of Central China with Manchuria for soybeans. The rapeseed issue is relatively simple. Peanuts are also mostly produced in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, and can be harvested next month. It is estimated that the output of Jiangsu and Anhui provinces can reach 16.5 million in volume, and the highest in Zhejiang province is 22.3 million in volume. After harvesting and transporting to Shanghai, it can be distributed to oil mills for oil extraction.

Matches

The matter of match rationing per capita is currently being submitted to the authorities for instructions on how to proceed and will be implemented soon. If rationing per day becomes a reality, the production volume of the factory can be appropriately controlled, and obtaining raw materials can also be further simplified. This matter is handled jointly by the Match Industry Association and the Japanese Match Control Agency. As for silk reeling factories, the silk cocoon purchasing work is progressing smoothly. When purchasing spring cocoons this year, loans were provided by banks, and the results were very satisfactory.

Flour mills have all received a considerable amount of wheat. Regarding the rationing plan, the flour bran rationing plan has been drafted and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and maintenance. Flour bran in various parts of Shanghai will also be available in the near future.

### Commercial Control Association Specifies Regulations for Transportation of Pigments and Dyes

Merchants in the pigment and dye industry are somewhat unclear about the movement of pigments and dyes, and they have been asking the Commercial Control Association for information. According to the association:

Pigments

It is not necessary to apply for a permit for transportation from the Shanghai area to within the three provinces and two cities, but transportation from the three provinces and two cities to South China and North China must follow the prescribed procedures. First, obtain a permit from the competent authorities of the destination, and then apply to the association for the issuance of a shipping approval before transportation can be started.

Dyes

The situation is slightly different. In addition to following the same procedures as pigments for transportation from the three provinces and two cities to South China and North China, permission must also be obtained for transportation from the Shanghai area to within the three provinces and two cities before transportation can be carried out.

Activities of Various Industry Associations

### Statements from Teachers' Consumer Cooperatives and Students' Parents

— Qian Pahhan

The teaching profession has always been humble, and in recent years, the cost of living has risen. Teachers in this city are under layers of exploitation, lacking adequate clothing and food. Those who are parents blame the decline in the quality of teachers in schools for the lack of progress of their children, which is neither a benevolent nor a fundamental solution. Now, fortunately, teachers in this city have risen up to organize consumer cooperatives to defend their livelihoods. I was once a teacher for many years, and I deeply tasted the pain in it. Now, as a parent of students, I am especially concerned about the academic performance of my children. I deeply feel that education is bankrupt, and everything needs to be restored. The stability of teachers' lives is essential today, so I feel that the establishment of the cooperative is a long-awaited thing. I would like to venture to contribute my personal opinions and expectations as follows:

It is hoped that all teachers in the city can join forces quickly, gather their strength, and achieve success easily. If they stay out of it and sit and watch success or failure, they will only harm themselves and others. In general, the intellectual class is most calculating about the weight of interests, the ease and difficulty of labor, and where to go and stay. Now, in this extraordinary period, for the sake of their own interests, they should see righteousness and act bravely, and break the habits of intellectuals.

Teachers should organize a close-knit organization in each school as a unit. All staff members should preferably be allocated by the school authorities, and teachers should not have to bear the cost of their salaries and transportation expenses, so that the work of the general office can be lightened, expenses can be saved, and the benefits for teachers can be greater.

After the establishment of the cooperative, the work should be rigorous, and the distribution should be fair, so that it can become a model for future social cooperation, and then be promoted to other sectors to assist the local authorities in their shortcomings and to spread the benefits to the community.

It is hoped that the local rationing authorities will pay close attention to the sympathy of general social discourse and reduce and provide assistance, cooperation, and guidance. If the amount of rationing is insufficient, it is hoped that the Commercial Control Association can make overall plans and provide various conveniences in procurement and transportation.

It is hoped that students' parents and people in the society who care about education will respond together and provide practical assistance. In addition to teachers raising a share of the funds themselves, people from all walks of life should donate generously and work together for the great cause, and the Zhongxin and Xinbao newspapers should serve as institutions for collecting funds. It is also hoped that the financial sector can provide convenience for advances and overdrafts so that economic turnover is flexible.

The cultural and educational circles have a close relationship, and the oppressed situation they are in is also roughly the same, so it is hoped that the entire community can be mobilized to be the backup for teachers. Newspapers bear the responsibility of leading society and should also uphold justice and encourage progress.

It is deeply hoped that the government authorities will understand the pure purpose of this movement and not interfere in its internal administration with political power, nor manipulate its organization or use its group with economic power.

In particular, it is hoped that friendly authorities will be able to promote this movement in accordance with the principles of communicating culture and improving education, providing full assistance in procurement and distribution, and providing appropriate guidance to the Chinese distribution institutions.

### "Wartime Women of the World" Symposium (1)

Attendees:

Germany: Foreign Affairs Secretary Mr. Kune Hiroo; German Embassy Mr. Bellgar

Italy: Embassy Secretary Mr. Gifu Seijun

United States: Consul Mr. Kondo Puichi; Allied Press Foreign Economy Deputy Director Mr. Terasaki Gorou

Great Britain: Foreign Affairs Official Mr. Bukobe Toshio

France: Allied Press Europe and America Director Mr. Inoue Isamu

Soviet Union: Foreign Affairs Secretary Mr. Ogata Shoji

In order to enhance production under the decisive battle, this year's Japanese national mobilization plan has decided to actively mobilize women. It is expected that women's entry into various production sectors will mark a new era. The activity of women, who account for half of the population, can indeed be said to dominate the fate of the country. In any country in the world, the active role of women who take the place of men is truly astonishing. We are now asking gentlemen who have lived abroad for a long time and have first-hand experience about the wartime activities of women in the Axis countries, enemy countries, France, and the Soviet Union, and publishing them as a paper symposium as follows:

Obligatory Labor Service

Q: First, we would like to start with the state of women's mobilization in various countries. Where are women being conscripted for compulsory service? Mr. Kune, what is the situation in Germany?

Kune: According to the General Labor Mobilization Law, all German women between the ages of seventeen and forty-five must register. This is a decree promulgated in January of this year. Before this, although women were not conscripted, they were already very diligent. It can be said that there are very few exceptions. Regardless of gender, from the age of eighteen to twenty-five, before taking a job, everyone must join the labor service team and do several months of compulsory service in the countryside. German women are quite strong physically, so they are not inferior to men in doing manual labor. No matter how wealthy the family, the daughters consider labor as an honorable thing, and the aided farmers are happy to accept the service. The image of spirited young girls wearing red headscarves and green uniforms while working forms a beautiful color in the German countryside during the busy farming season.

Q: After completing labor service, what kind of work are women mostly assigned to?

Kune: It can be said that there are very few professions where women do not cooperate. In addition to government officials and Red Cross nurses, there are also many who work as messengers and train conductors. Even the Japanese government-run railway bureau has begun to hire female ticket collectors...

Female Aviator Receives Highest Medal

Bellgar: Train conductors must undergo seven weeks of training in the company's factories. They start by teaching basic knowledge such as the mechanical structure. The wartime female auxiliaries employed by the postal service number about 90,000, including upper and lower level staff. Field postal affairs have greatly increased, and they also undertake the important task of long-distance communication technology to maintain contact with the war zone. The delivery of parcels is also handled by women.

Q: What kind of work is most suitable for women?

Bellgar: I think the management and manufacturing of precision machinery is extremely suitable for women's careful nature. In the field of aircraft manufacturing, female aviator Ms. Henna Reitsch has engaged in extremely valuable research and received the Iron Cross, the highest medal. Doing the same work as men without losing her gentle nature is the greatness of the lady.

Kune: After graduating from girls' school in Germany, they learn nursing. When they have their own children, if there is a minor problem or injury, they can handle it without calling a doctor. I hope that pre-marital preparation should be like this.

National Strength is People's Strength

Q: In Italy, are many women also joining various occupational sectors?

Gifu: According to the National General Mobilization Law promulgated last year, all women in Italy between the ages of fourteen and sixty must be mobilized. Fifty percent of Italian women work directly or indirectly in the production sector, half of whom participate in agricultural labor, munitions factories, bank and company affairs, transportation agencies, and various other fields. Eighty percent of primary school teachers are women.

Q: Isn't Prime Minister Mussolini's policy to keep women in the family?

Gifu: Prime Minister Mussolini once said, "A country's national strength lies in the number of people." Therefore, when women's labor becomes an obstacle to population policy, it is natural to find ways to eliminate this obstacle. Therefore, various facilities to protect mothers and children are implemented. On the one hand, they continuously give birth to children, but on the other hand, they also need them to work in the production sector. Italian women are very diligent in their families, especially rural women, who strive for food self-sufficiency. There is a Fascist women's organization called the "Rural Housewives Association," which sends female graduates to rural areas to teach cooking methods, etc. The reclamation of wasteland is also carried out by women's groups doing labor service.

French Women

Inoue: Like Italy, French rural women are also very diligent. People generally think that French women are very vain, gluttonous, and lazy. This is because they only see a part of the women in Paris and do not know the rural women of France, an agricultural country. Even Parisian women are actually very simple, frugal, and diligent. Since France's defeat, women's social activities have gradually become organized. The Vichy government's policy is to organize groups and turn French women in the family into French women of the country.

Q: So women's groups are forming the center of activities?

Inoue: The government has unified and merged women's groups, dividing them into girls' departments and women's departments, with women aged sixteen to twenty-five as members, and starting training. Under the slogan of homeland, labor, and family, they are made to understand the position of women in the family, and at the same time, they are adapted to the present era. Girls' school textbooks have abolished mathematics and foreign languages, focusing on cooking, sewing, and maternal education, and science is also mainly practical. They are really doing a very good job in family work. For example, they remodel clothes that their grandmothers used to wear into the latest fashions and wear them with pride.
