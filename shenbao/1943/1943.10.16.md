### Correcting Oneself

The recent takeover of the Shanghai concessions and the reorganization of the Jiangsu Provincial Government are both excellent opportunities to reform politics. This newspaper has reviewed the past and discussed the future, hoping that the government authorities will value this opportunity, seize it, and bring politics back on the right track to fulfill the era's mission of our Chinese nation. It is an undeniable fact that the corruption of Chinese politics has led to the darkness of society and the depravity of the nation. This has been the case for a long time, and it is becoming more severe today. Therefore, listing the points for reform is truly an endless task. Even if we outline the main points and elaborate on the obvious ones, it is still difficult to express them fully. The concluding sentence of this newspaper's editorial on August 16th, "When public opinion reaches the top, talents are excellent, and officialdom is rectified, Shanghai will be well-governed," serves as the outline for building a new Shanghai and a major prerequisite for building a new China. However, it has been more than two months since the takeover of the Shanghai concessions. Although the time is still short and we cannot expect too much, the impression from the perspective of the citizens is not "greatly disappointed." Yet, there is still no sign of fulfilling the aforementioned simplest three points. Thus, it is clear that reversing the overwhelming tide cannot be achieved overnight. It is necessary to trace the root causes, first cultivate spiritual strength, and then seek restoration. Therefore, with pure sincerity, we offer further humble suggestions.

Every nation with a position in the world must have its own precious traditional spirit, relying on it as an invisible weapon to defend its national life. If, unknowingly, it is affected and loses its inherent traditional spirit, the nation will inevitably be corrupted and humiliated, gradually leading to decline and extinction. This is what is meant by "events have inevitable causes and reasons have inherent principles." Our Chinese nation has a culture of over four thousand years, and it also has its own moving and tearful historical records. Its prosperity has always been when its traditional spirit is promoted and developed. Its decline has always been when its traditional spirit is destroyed and lost. Past events and traces can be examined in detail. Because its history is long and wise men emerge in large numbers, it has established concrete models in all aspects that are worthy of respect. The fundamental traditional spirit of politics is "correcting oneself."

Being strict with oneself and lenient with others is the beginning of correcting oneself. Cultivating oneself, regulating one's family, governing the country, and pacifying the world is the ultimate goal of correcting oneself. Politics means correctness. If the ruler leads with correctness, who would dare to be incorrect? If one is upright, orders will be followed without being issued. If one is not upright, orders will not be followed even if issued. This is why it explains the effectiveness of correcting oneself to influence others. Ruler should act like a ruler, minister like a minister, father like a father, and son like a son. This is why it explains the mutual benefits of correcting oneself. Since ancient times, words expounding on correcting oneself are sufficient to illustrate its essence. They are recorded in the classics and cannot be listed one by one. However, knowing without acting is of no help.

Correcting oneself involves training one's normal thoughts and correct concepts, not being swayed by the temptations of sensory pleasures, wealth, or threats of torture. Therefore, one can firmly establish lofty aspirations, cultivate a noble spirit, expanding to fill the universe and shrinking to fit within an inch. Thus, one can cultivate oneself in poverty and benefit the world in prosperity. From this, one can practice a life of frugality and simplicity, work hard to manage the world and benefit things, cultivate character, promote reputation, and not be moved by praise or blame, gain or loss, life or death, fortune or misfortune. Then, one can make decisive choices between taking and giving, entering and leaving office, without being casual. Only when inner thoughts match outward actions, and words match deeds, can one talk about politics. Politics originally means correcting oneself and then regulating the people. "Zheng" (政) is the cause, and "zhi" (治) is the effect. Without first seeking "zheng," there is no way to talk about "zhi."

The cultivation of correcting oneself is not as difficult, profound, or unattainable as generally imagined. However, those below average lack unwavering perseverance and firm intentions, and are easily assimilated by the environment. In an era of clear politics and honest society, even vendors and porters know to examine their words and deeds, fearing being despised by their peers. As for the scholar-officials, they dare not indulge in unrestrained behavior, lest they bring disgrace and ruin upon themselves. Therefore, in the past, it was often heard that officials spent their entire lives in office, returning home without funds and dying without coffins or burial arrangements. They not only did not feel ashamed of this poverty, but also took pride in their incorruptibility. They set an example for their wives and influenced their brothers, spreading throughout the community and inspiring their descendants, subtly influencing and becoming customary. They deeply understood that officials are public servants, with the idea of service as the center, and even more knew that as parents of the people, they should love the people as their official duty. From correcting oneself comes frugality, and from frugality comes integrity. Thus, one can always be brave and resolute, creating an atmosphere of solemnity and harmony. When the world declines and morality wanes, people forget righteousness for profit, national titles are treated like commodities, and officials themselves take maximizing profits as their premise and forming factions for personal gain as the principle of their careers. Extravagance and licentiousness become the standard for official rank. One can accumulate vast fortunes in a few months in office. If one doesn't, one can't flatter superiors and look down on colleagues. Superiors follow suit and everyone envies each other. Therefore, entering officialdom is like falling into a deep abyss. Some cannot pull themselves out, some excuse themselves by the actions of others, some underestimate themselves and do not take it upon themselves to change customs, or some intend to hold office briefly and do not want to encourage or afflict themselves, sitting idly by for the opportunity to be promoted and make a fortune. This is because the cultivation of correcting oneself is not deep enough, and the ability to control oneself is weak, insufficient to speak of foolishness in a lawless country. Weaknesses are exposed, and evil and chaos take advantage. Thus, superiors and subordinates collude, and officials and the people all tend to fall. Everything avoids the path of righteousness, seeking to fulfill private and obscure intentions. In this way, seeking public opinion to reach the top, excellent talents, and rectified officialdom is like climbing a tree to catch fish, which is difficult. Furthermore, the sea of desire is hard to fill, and private greed has no limit, leading to bribery and corruption, which becomes commonplace. Some half-heartedly go along, boasting of not revealing traces. Some avoid the heavy and seek the light, seeking forgiveness by protecting themselves wisely. Their hearts contradict their words, and they try to cover up but only expose more. Some even sell official positions and titles, with their wives profiting from it. Some are tyrannical and violent, relying on their factions to intimidate others. Even if it is not personally instructed, one should be held accountable for negligence. In reality, if one is not upright, then the family is not regulated. Rotting things breed insects, and there is a gradual progression from the small to the large.

Today's society has accumulated deep-seated problems. There are many who are unwilling to abandon darkness and turn to light, clinging to their illegal power. They will inevitably take any despicable means, exerting all their strength to resist the trend of political reform, striving to make those in power lose heart, become discouraged, and retreat in the face of difficulties. Therefore, all those with aspirations, whether in or out of office, should gather together as soon as possible, cultivate the thorough practice of correcting oneself, nurture a strong and fearless spirit, vow to be irreconcilable with demons and monsters, eradicate all the scum that endangers the survival of the nation, overcome all obstacles that hinder the renewal of political reform, and restore the traditional spirit of politics of our Chinese nation. Then, all kinds of problems can be solved easily. Otherwise, there is no talk of reforming politics, let alone the national mission.

### Japan-Philippines Exchange Broadcast Last Night

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Japan-Philippines exchange broadcast celebrating Philippine independence began at 7:30 PM on the 15th with the playing of the Philippine national anthem. First, Prime Minister Tojo of Japan delivered a congratulatory speech, followed by a speech of thanks from the new President of the Philippines, Laurel. The Japanese national anthem was then played, and the broadcast ended at 8:00 PM. The contents of the broadcasts by Prime Minister Tojo and President Laurel are recorded as follows:

Prime Minister Tojo's Speech: "The Philippines declared its independence on October 14th of this year and became a completely independent nation within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I am deeply delighted. His Excellency Laurel, endorsed by the public opinion of the entire nation, has assumed the office of the first President of the Philippines. It is self-evident how joyfully the 18 million people of the Philippines will greet this glorious day, and I hereby express my heartfelt congratulations. Looking back, more than forty years ago, the Philippines was about to gain independence through the efforts of patriots such as Rizal. At that time, the United States had agreed to establish a volunteer army for the Philippines, but the result was that the Filipino people were turned into docile subjects of the United States. For more than forty years, the Filipino people have endured and continued to struggle. As a result, the United States first baited them with autonomy and then promised independence. The so-called independence of the United States was actually to protect its own economic interests and use this to deceive and exploit the Filipino people. I am sure that the Filipino nation will be fully aware of this, and there is no need for further explanation. Furthermore, the United States, relying on its material strength, deceived and drugged the Filipino people and used the Philippines as a base to oppress and exploit East Asia, in order to fulfill its insatiable ambition to dominate the world. In the meantime, Japan, for the sake of establishing peace in East Asia through peaceful means, endured for many years until recently. However, in order to eliminate the source of trouble disrupting East Asia, it was finally forced to resort to military force on December 8th of the year before last. Thanks to the majestic power of the Emperor and the loyalty and skillful combat of the soldiers, the American forces occupying the Philippines were completely wiped out. In less than two years, the Philippines has completed various preparations and, based on the position of East Asians, has achieved the long-awaited true independence under an ideal. This is truly a cause for common celebration for the Philippines and for Greater East Asia. Indeed, the independence of the Philippines requires the completion of the Greater East Asia War to achieve its independence goal. Japan will provide full cooperation for the development and prosperity of the Philippines. Therefore, I hope that the people of the Philippines, under the guidance of His Excellency President Laurel, will work harder in the future to strengthen themselves, restore the true spirit of the Greater East Asian nations, and devote themselves to the defense of their country and the establishment of a wartime posture. It will become an independent country, an integral part of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and closely cooperate with Japan and other countries in Greater East Asia to build Greater East Asia. Currently, the countries of Greater East Asia are cooperating with Japan to achieve the common goal of liberating Greater East Asia and building a moral world. Now that the Philippine Republic has been born, adding a new country to the Greater East Asia nations, it is truly worthy of celebration. Japan deeply expects to cooperate with these countries, work wholeheartedly, and achieve the great ideal of universal prosperity."

President Laurel's Broadcast Speech: "The Philippine Republic declared its independence yesterday and held the ceremony for the establishment of the Philippine Republic. The independence of the Philippines is the long-cherished wish and highest aspiration of our Filipino people, and it has finally been achieved. This is truly a gift from the Empire of Japan. On behalf of all the Filipino people, I would like to express my deep gratitude to Prime Minister Tojo and the people of Japan. The smooth progress of all preparations and measures prior to the independence of the Philippines was due to the frequent cooperation and comprehensive assistance of the Japanese Army and Navy. We can only express our deep gratitude here. I hereby firmly declare our commitment to cooperate with the great cause of liberating the peoples of Greater East Asia that is currently underway. The future of the Philippine Republic faces many difficulties. However, we hope that the Philippines will become a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and will be able to find its place in the society of free nations in the world. We will bravely move forward."

### The Philippine Republic Plans to Establish a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, President Laurel Discusses His Aspirations

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new President of the Philippine Republic, Mr. Laurel, met with a group of reporters at his official residence at 11:30 AM on the 14th and discussed his aspirations. The main points are as follows: "I am deeply grateful for the goodwill of the Japanese government. The Philippines is now one of the nations of the world. Therefore, we have already sent independence telegrams to the diplomatic authorities of China, Thailand, Burma, Manchukuo, Germany, Italy, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, Croatia, Spain, Denmark, Finland, the Soviet Union, the Irish Free State, Turkey, Afghanistan, Argentina, France, Sweden, Portugal, and Switzerland, hoping that all countries will recognize us as soon as possible. We have sent a special telegram to Prime Minister Tojo on the Japanese side, thanking the officials and people of Japan for their deep sympathy and convenience given to the Philippines. What we should start with now is domestic issues, among which self-sufficiency in daily necessities and the implementation of fair distribution are the most urgent tasks at present. As a member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the new Philippines must first help the people of its country so that it no longer troubles Japan. The first thing the Philippine government must decide is the direction of the policy, followed by making it concrete, and finally putting it into practice. At this initial stage of taking office, it is not yet possible to announce all the policies, but the plans include: establishing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs; assisting the poor, especially widows and orphans caused by the war; and granting amnesty to political prisoners. At the same time, there are plans to increase the salaries of officials. In short, in order to make the Philippines a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the first thing to do is to stabilize the lives of the people so that they deeply feel the happiness of independence. I hope that all the people will understand this point and give the new country full support and encouragement."

National Assembly to Convene the Day After Tomorrow

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the declaration of independence of the Philippines, in order to promote domestic construction, a special National Assembly will be convened here on the 18th.

Centered on this, important strategies for nation-building will be reviewed. President Laurel will request the Congress to approve the Japan-Philippines Alliance Treaty concluded on the 14th. The international status and domestic construction projects of the Philippine Republic will have rapid and major progress.

Philippines is Preparing to Establish a Central Bank

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the independence of the Philippine Republic, in order to establish a new currency system and improve and expand financial institutions, the Philippine Central Bank will be established as soon as possible. The financial authorities are currently conducting research and preparation. The shortcomings of the American-style financial institutions can be completely compensated for by establishing a new central bank. During the transition period before the establishment of the central bank, the new government will temporarily provide funds from the Southern Development Gold Vault, Philippine branch, and recognize the circulation of the old peso banknotes and military tickets.

### President Laurel of the Philippines Pays Tribute to the German Head of State, Resolves to Overcome Difficulties and Strive for Brightness

Manila, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The President of the Philippine Republic, Laurel, recently received Mr. Vollhardt, a special correspondent stationed in the Philippines by this agency, and made a speech. He asked the correspondent to convey the respect of the Filipino people for the German people and their head of state, saying that the German people should especially understand the joy of the Filipino people. During the conversation, President Laurel emphasized the one-party dominance of the People's Party in order to maintain domestic order, and the amnesty of political enemies, especially guerrillas, will be given a two-month opportunity for self-renewal. In terms of economics, he seeks self-sufficiency in food, intensifies price controls, establishes distribution agencies, and prevents inflation. In terms of social reform, he focuses on raising the living standards of the people, increasing salaries, while developing the spirit of the masses and promoting the idea of the country first. At the end of his speech, the President said: "The future is a heavy responsibility, but I have made a great determination to overcome all difficulties and strive for the brightness of the future."

### Amicable Stage for Relations Between Manchukuo and the Philippines

At the same time, the Hiroba Office published the notice at noon on the 15th.

Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - After the Government of Manchukuo officially recognized the Philippine Republic, Manchukuo and the Philippines have entered the first stage of amicable relations. In its declaration of independence, the Philippine Republic has already clarified its determination to restore the original appearance of Asia and contribute to the construction of a new world order as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its relationship with Manchukuo, which has the ideal of building a moral world, will also be clearly established through this official recognition, and it will advance with its allied countries in the fight against Britain and the United States. Manchukuo and the Philippines are located in the north and south of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and their economic characteristics are indeed different. However, due to the relationship between their production materials, they will be combined into a cooperative relationship in the future economy, with mutual adaptation. Therefore, the close cooperation between the two countries in the future is particularly promising.

Chairman Wang, who also serves as the President of the Academy, personally attended and delivered instructions. Present were School Affairs Committee members Ren Yuandao, Xiao Shuxuan, Ye Peng, Bao Wenwei, Secretary-General He, Education Director Liu, all faculty members, and all students. Guests included military and political officials such as Wen Zongyao, Chen Chunpu, Xu Suzhou, and Chen Changzu, as well as Lieutenant General Bang Chai-shan, Chief of Staff Matsui, Lieutenant General Momoi, Major General Teraoka, Major General Ono, Deputy Minister Ishii, German Ambassador Wellmann, and Manchukuo Ambassador Lu Ronghuan.

Education Director Liu Chexiong then reported on the preparation of the military school and the Reserve Officer Training Class. Then, Chairman Wang was respectfully invited to deliver a speech, and all the students stood attentively, listening to the speech for about thirty minutes.

The Speech Was Sincere

The listeners were deeply moved. Then, Ye Peng, representing the School Affairs Committee, delivered instructions, encouraging the students to obey their leaders and serve the country. After President Wen delivered a speech on behalf of the guests, Lieutenant General Chai-shan of the Allied Army delivered a speech, pointing out two points and encouraging the students: 1) Obey the supreme leader, Chairman Wang, and display the spirit of the national army. 2) The Greater East Asia War is a war for the liberation and survival of the one hundred million people of East Asia and a war for justice, so it must win the final victory.

Full Text of Instructions

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The graduation ceremony for the first class of students from the Central Military Academy was grandly held at the Central Military Academy on the 15th. Chairman Wang, who also serves as the President of the Academy, personally attended and delivered instructions. The original text of the instructions is respectfully recorded as follows: "Today is the graduation of the first class of students from the Central Military Academy, and the opening ceremony of the Reserve Officer Training Class of the Army Teaching Corps and the personnel training class of the General Supervision Office of Management. It is a great honor to have guests from allied nations Japan, Manchukuo, and Germany participating. Since the opening of the military school, thanks to the enthusiastic leadership of the School Affairs Committee members, Secretary-General He, Education Director Liu, and all the faculty members, the dedicated assistance of the military advisors, and the students' hard work and diligence, we have achieved today's results, which I find deeply gratifying.

I recall that in the thirteenth year of the Republic (1924), when the Central Military Academy was established in Whampoa and held the opening ceremony for the first class of students, the Founding Father personally attended and delivered instructions, and ordered me to write a congratulatory speech. Later, it was made into a military song and then into the national anthem. The national anthem that we sing now is that congratulatory speech. Thinking back, it is truly inspiring.

After the opening ceremony of the first class of students at the Whampoa Central Military Academy, the Founding Father passed away in less than two years, and the East River Rebellion broke out. The students had not yet completed their graduation before rushing to the battlefield to fulfill their military missions, and some of them even sacrificed their lives for the country. You have been educated here for two years and will enter the Reserve Officer Training Class for training after graduating today. At this time of national difficulty and hardship, how grateful you should be to be able to study calmly."

### Japanese Army Achieves Victory Near Shahe, Hebei

A certain base on the North China Front, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Communist forces in western Hebei had long been surrounded by the Japanese army. Recently, due to the changing weather and lack of food, they attempted to break out of their predicament by taking advantage of opportunities to move. However, each time they were annihilated by the Japanese army. At dawn on the 13th, approximately 300 Communist bandits invaded southwest of Xingtang.

Japan's new elite fighter squadron immediately dispatched to intercept them, repeatedly launching fierce attacks, shooting down one above Bassein and hitting another five with bullets. Black smoke billowed as they fled in panic. It is believed that these enemy aircraft, due to the heavy damage sustained, will certainly crash into the sea. In this battle, the Japanese army also lost one plane. At this difficult time for the country, how encouraged should we be to study.

Realizing Pan-Asianism

Military academies have a long history, and military academy students have progressed from one stage to another, with Zizhuo doing his best for the nation and the people. The life of the nation and the people is infinite, while individual life is limited. What is called history is a continuous record of progress. Progress depends on people at each stage of the historical process putting in decades of effort, like pebbles and grains of sand paving a road. The hearts and blood of people born in each historical stage, connected together, become a scroll of history. The students of the military academy in previous periods have already fulfilled their tasks, like sand and stones that have already paved sections of the road. The current section is even greater than before, and there is light shining in front, guiding us to step onto it. What is this light? It is the liquidation of the hundred-year-old Anglo-American aggression. I hope that former military academy students will return one after another, and everyone will step onto this only bright road for China.

Stepping onto the Bright Road

Now, there are two roads before us, one is bright, the unity of the East Asian nations, and the other is dark, allowing Anglo-American aggression to continue. We must not take the second road. On January 9th of this year, the National Government participated in the war, and China and Japan signed an agreement to return concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, which have now been realized. The Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations will also be revised soon. It is deeply believed that from now on, there will be no more disunity within China. Step onto this bright road, everyone. Former students must also step onto it, and future students will definitely follow.

Now we are facing such a great era, such a glorious historical stage. You should continue the knowledge and experience gained from two years of hard work, perseverance, bravery, and diligence, continue the efforts of the comrades who have already sacrificed themselves, and guide the later comrades to continue their efforts, and take on the mission of this school. Now, the revival of China and the protection of East Asia have moved from the theoretical stage to the practical stage. I wish you all good health, and I wish you all the fulfillment of the great responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia.

### German War Report Announces: Withdrawal from Chapuruji; Dnieper River Dam Thoroughly Destroyed

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the 15th that after repelling the invading Soviet forces, they had withdrawn from Chapuruji (Zaboroiye) downstream of the Dnieper River. The German Command had moved heavy weapons, various vehicles, and other large quantities of military supplies to the west bank of the Dnieper River the afternoon before the withdrawal. On that evening, under the cover of rear guard troops, German troops withdrew to the west bank and thoroughly destroyed the dam there. The German rear guard troops also retreated by speedboat that night and were not pursued by the Soviet army.

### American Aircraft Attack Germany: Over a Hundred Lost

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – A report from the Overseas News Agency stated: Yesterday afternoon, there were fierce air battles over western and southwestern Germany. Ninety enemy aircraft were shot down, proving a significant setback for the enemy. German fighter planes intercepted and severely attacked the enemy aircraft. Most of the enemy aircraft destroyed were four-engine bombers. The enemy lost one thousand highly trained pilots yesterday. The attacking enemy aircraft were deceived by German fighter planes and could not approach their targets to carry out precision strikes. A German squadron pursuing a group of enemy aircraft (25 planes) achieved an astonishing result, shooting down no fewer than 20 enemy planes, with only five escaping. Most of the enemy pilots and planes were destroyed, and a few survivors were captured.

Another report stated that this morning, a reconnaissance flight by German aircraft discovered several more American aircraft that had been shot down. Therefore, the number of aircraft shot down has increased to 123, and this number may increase further.

### Japanese and German Governments Protest to Portugal for Violating Neutrality; Germany Declares Reservation of Right to Take Certain Measures

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Regarding the issue of the Portuguese Azores Islands supplying the British and American armies as military bases, the Japanese government instructed its envoy to Portugal, Ambassador Mori, on the 15th to protest to the Portuguese government. It pointed out that the Portuguese government's allowance of British and American forces, enemies of Japan, to go to the Azores Islands and use the island's military bases constitutes a violation of the obligations of a neutral country. The Japanese government, upon hearing that Britain and Portugal had signed an agreement, consulted with the German government and decided to make serious representations to the Portuguese government. It has been found that Britain has violated Portugal's neutrality for the second time. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, when the Japanese army occupied Timor Island in the Netherlands, the British and American forces violated the neutrality of Portuguese Timor and attempted to turn the island into a military base. Therefore, the Japanese army immediately cleared out the British and American forces to prevent them from violating Portugal's neutrality.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reported that the German government, through the German ambassador to Portugal, protested to the Portuguese government yesterday for violating its neutrality by placing the Azores Islands under British control. The German government also declared that it reserves the right to take certain measures as a result of this incident.

### Portuguese Military Exercises

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) – The Portuguese Ministry of the Army announced yesterday afternoon that the Portuguese army had completed its concentration yesterday in preparation for future value exercises. A certain army corps, with a force of three divisions, has concentrated in the exercise area. The Ministry of the Army's communiqué forcefully stated that the preparations for the exercises have been satisfactorily completed. The exercises will be led by the president of the Portuguese Military Academy, with General Machado leading three divisions of troops to participate.

### American Forces Launch New Offensive in Western Italy; Foothold Gained on North Bank of Volturno River

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Böllner, a special correspondent of the German News Agency in the Mediterranean region, reported that the only important battle in Italy last week occurred on the eastern side of the German defense line, especially in the coastal area of Termoli and the nearby western mountains. However, the situation is different this week. The British army is now pressing towards the German front line north of Naples with increased strength. After the British army transferred a large number of heavy artillery units to positions north of Aversa and in the Capua area, they launched a fierce offensive against the German positions on the north bank of the Volturno River. This military operation was covered in the coastal area by artillery batteries stationed on several anti-Axis warships anchored off the mouth of the Volturno River. After fierce fighting, the British army gained a foothold in several strongholds on the east bank of the river and forced the German army to retreat. The German army launched a counteroffensive under effective artillery cover, attempting to drive the British army to the opposite bank of the river, or to confine them to a small area, so that they would no longer be able to use the remaining bridgehead for large-scale military operations. When the German forces attacked an enemy bridgehead, a British regiment was completely wiped out, and hundreds of prisoners of war fell into German hands. British tanks only penetrated the German defense line in one place, near Capua. At the same time, in the Callere area near the upper reaches of the Volturno River, the German positions are holding firm.

### Symi Island in the Aegean Sea Occupied by German Forces

Istanbul, 15th (Central News Agency) – After occupying Symi Island in the Dodecanese Islands, German forces continued to expand their mopping-up operations. According to news from the 14th night, German forces have completely occupied Symi Island.

### Soviet Torpedo Planes Attack German Convoy

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – Colonel Hansen of the German News Agency Navy stated that on Wednesday, Soviet aircraft unsuccessfully attacked a German convoy off the northern coast of Norway, and four were shot down. The enemy used a new method of launching torpedoes for the first time, but the result was a complete failure. In the first fruitless attack, two enemy aircraft were shot down, and the remaining bombers were repelled. Soon after, a squadron of enemy torpedo planes appeared over the German convoy again and dropped three torpedoes from a height of about 2,000 meters using parachutes. It was not difficult for the German ships to evade these torpedoes. The Soviets apparently intended to use this new method to avoid losing aircraft. After the first two attempts failed, the third attempt was to launch a low-altitude attack with torpedoes, but again failed to hit the target. During the attack on the German convoy, the torpedoes hit two German protection ships, both of the "Boston" type.

### Turkish President Receives British and American Representatives

Ankara, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to Reuter's News Agency, it was learned here last night that Turkish President İsmet has discussed with British and American diplomatic representatives the Soviet Union's demands and threats to Turkey.

### Sweden's Policy Remains Unchanged

Stockholm, Sweden, 15th (Central News Agency) – Reuter's News Agency: American newspapers believe that Portugal can serve as a model for other neutral countries. Swedish newspapers wrote articles opposing this, stating briefly that the New York Times declared that Sweden and Turkey clearly want to join the Allied side, but are afraid and have not thought about the timing when the time has ripened. These remarks are very straightforward, and we also have the right and obligation to make the same straightforward remarks, stating that it is impossible to realize their wish and join the victorious side. The goal of Swedish foreign policy remains to enable the country to pass through the war period without suffering damage.

### Demonstrations in Buenos Aires

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 15th (Central News Agency) – After the resignation of three cabinet members, including Argentine Finance Minister Adamarina, the cabinet suffered a crisis. Argentine citizens demonstrated on the 13th, demanding that the government adhere to its neutral policy, and clashed with police everywhere, with 30 people arrested.

Buenos Aires (Central News Agency) – The Argentine Intelligence Agency recently issued the following statement regarding the resignation of the three Argentine government cabinet members: Regardless of the political importance of this cabinet resignation, the government's position is not affected in any way. This action is a measure taken in adherence to the national policy repeatedly stated by President Ramirez in the past.

### Mussolini and Rommel Discuss Military Issues; Italian Officers Evacuate Rome

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – It was recently reported that Italian Defense Minister Graziani had met with Führer Hitler at the German Führer Headquarters. Commander Mussolini also discussed military issues with German Commander Rommel, who is stationed in northern Italy. A telegram from Rome now reports that General Graziani has issued a military order to Italian officers as follows: Italian officers must depart Rome by the 14th to report to the Florence military command, except for those who are sick, reserve and reserve officers who have not yet served, officers belonging to the Third Military District, and the Rome City Garrison. In addition, Italian Deputy Air Force Minister Major Porter also issued a proclamation on the 14th, ordering Italian Air Force soldiers, except for those who were called up for service after September 8th, to report on schedule.

### The Third East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference: An Overview

The Significance of the Roundtable Conference

The third East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference, held in Beijing at the Huairentang Hall in Zhongnanhai, commenced on September 27th and lasted for three days. This conference was the first since China's entry into the war, and the atmosphere at the venue was filled with sincerity. The ardent desire of various economic figures for the victory of the Greater East Asia War was clearly perceptible. Moreover, the conference featured more constructive opinions than previous sessions, a welcome phenomenon. However, the original mission of the roundtable conference was to mutually understand economic situations in various aspects to enhance war power. In other words, it was passive in nature. Therefore, no matter what constructive opinions were offered, they were only that, resulting in a sense of inadequacy. This, however, stemmed from the original nature of the roundtable conference. As a result, the nature of the conference was inherently different from other meetings where the problems raised for discussion could be immediately implemented. Therefore, the failure to implement the proposals made at the roundtable conference was unavoidable.

During the first Beijing Roundtable Conference, Chinese speakers accounted for the absolute majority. Japanese figures listened to the requests and opinions of Chinese economic figures and reflected them in policy. Some individuals with this experience criticized the fact that there were fewer Chinese speakers at this conference. However, in today's context of actively enhancing war power through Sino-Japanese unity, it is more meaningful for Japanese economic figures to discuss in detail how Chinese and Japanese economic figures in the local area are active and what common economic difficulties they face, rather than adopting the so-called method of listening to the voices of Chinese economic figures to achieve results.

Although one cannot definitively say that viewing the East Asia Economic Roundtable Conference as a social gathering renders it nominal, if Japanese mainland economic figures and local economic figures can openly and honestly express their hopes, demands, and difficulties, and if they can be incorporated into economic development and war power enhancement, then we have no reason to endorse the argument that the roundtable conference is useless.

Resource and Labor Issues

During the first day's mining and industrial section meeting, the focus was on how to break through bottlenecks to increase production. The development of important resources such as iron, coal, and bauxite is indispensable for Japan's enhancement of war power. Although the authorities in North China and Mengjiang are currently striving to increase production, the lack of resources and labor problems are clearly hindering the increase in these materials. For example, the increase in coal and iron production and transportation volume is hampered by the inability to obtain more resources for massive production increases. Representatives from various regions repeatedly raised this situation and expressed their desire to transfer idle equipment from mainland Japan and Korea to local areas, with a considerable number of requests.

As for the labor issue, the fundamental problem lies in the food issue. Moreover, labor management of North China laborers is not yet fully developed. Although this is a key to solving the labor problem, local labor management is not easy. However, if left to its own devices, the labor problem will never be resolved. Therefore, voices calling for labor management were frequently heard at the mining and industrial conference.

Local Development of Light Industry

As for light industry, although the improvement of Japanese mainland enterprises has had a positive impact on local light industry, it would be difficult to assume that the gradual relocation of idle equipment to local areas would lead to the development of local light industry, as the actual situation is not that simple. Even if Japan's mainland implements enterprise restructuring, there is no immediate reason to move a large number of idle facilities to North China or Mengjiang. Moreover, from the perspective of the government authorities, a plan cannot be established without comprehensively considering the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it seems difficult to resolve everything as simply as local financial figures hope.

However, when purchasing food requires a large exchange of goods, local light industry is clearly a good performer if it can be manufactured locally. This point has been mentioned not only at the roundtable conference but also seems to be fully recognized in Tokyo. However, not only personnel but also local assistance is needed for the development of light industry.

Chemical Industry Deliberation Organ

As for the chemical industry, centered on soda and acid industries using salt as raw materials, industries such as glass, oil, pharmaceuticals, rubber, and paper can be cited. Although the chemical industry in North China is centered in the Tianjin area, which controls the Changlu salt fields, and the Qingdao area, which centers on the Shandong salt fields, its development in North China is slower than other industries, due to a shortage of electricity, resources, and funds. At this time, when advancing towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War, it is necessary to promote the development of the chemical industry and to establish a local self-sufficiency system for soda and acids. Therefore, the conference also emphasized this. The Qingdao representative advocated the establishment of a chemical industry deliberation organ to integrate local technical groups to develop this industry, which attracted considerable attention.

In addition, regarding the issue of electricity development, Naito, the vice president of the North China Electric Power Company, raised the Yellow River power generation project, which attracted attention. Mr. Naito strongly stated that as long as there is a passion for effort, the lack of resources can be overcome, delivering a stern rebuke to the economic figures who argued that production cannot be increased due to a lack of resources and who frequently mentioned resources. This seemed to be the most noteworthy point at the mining and industrial conference.

Resolving the Food Problem

After the first day's mining and industrial conference, the agricultural conference was held on the morning of the second day, followed by the continuation of the materials exchange conference in the afternoon.

At the agricultural conference, the most pressing issue was to alleviate the burden on farmers, which is a fundamental condition for increasing agricultural production. If farmers' burdens are not actually reduced through mere lip service, increased production is hopeless. Currently, the burden on North China farmers is already too heavy. This is partly due to the fact that the administration of the North China Political Affairs Commission has not fully penetrated the rural areas. However, the biggest reason is the heavy taxation on North China farmers. In addition to the taxes levied by the central government, they must pay various other taxes. This point must be corrected first. Secondly, consideration should be given to determining the purchase price of agricultural products based on production costs, in order to adjust them with general materials. Many of the attending representatives advocated this, which was the central focus of the agricultural conference. From beginning to end, the consistent theme was to reduce the burden on farmers, which is no exaggeration. This proposal is bound to have a strong response among the local and Greater East Asia authorities present, giving many hints for future implementation of policies.

As Chairman Ogi stated after the conference, the food problem arising in North China is not just a North China problem, but a food problem for China, Japan, and Manchukuo as a whole. Therefore, the solution to this problem cannot be achieved by each locality working independently, but must be solved through the joint cooperation of China, Japan, and Manchukuo.

Coal, iron, , bauxite, cotton, etc., are not only important resources for North China, but also important resources for the Greater East Asia wide area. While the resources of the South have not yet been fully utilized, the importance of resources in North China and Mengjiang is self-evident. When increasing the amount of these resources, the problem that must be solved is the food problem. Considering that reducing the burden on farmers is the key to solving the food problem proposed by the agricultural conference, will the governing authorities fully consider the voices of the various economic figures at the conference and reflect them in their policies?

Establishment of a Standing Committee

At the materials exchange conference in the afternoon, many constructive opinions were expressed, such as the desire to establish a specialized committee to strengthen land transportation capacity and remove obstacles to trade, strengthen coordination with Japan, and promote trade. According to the Tianjin representative, the obstacles to domestic trade in China today are: first, that sea and land transportation is not fully implemented according to plan; and second, that the price policies between the two regions (i.e., North China and Central China) have different objectives.

Regarding the implementation of sea and land transportation according to plan, North China Transportation is at the center, and although it is guided by the instructions of the military authorities and the embassy to ensure that there are no regrets, from the perspective of economic figures engaged in specialized trade, there are still shortcomings, which is the problem. Therefore, as stated by the Tianjin representative, it is necessary to establish a standing committee and frequently consult the opinions of those engaged in the field. When determining the scope of trade, the qualifications of the operators must be clarified. As for price policies, the political and economic situations in North China and Central China are different, and the political forces are also different, so it seems difficult to correct them immediately. However, it was emphasized at the materials conference that adjustments must be made quickly under the same objective.

The differences in control mechanisms were also pointed out. There is no denying the fact that the control mechanisms in North China and the control mechanisms are newly established and there are various points of dissatisfaction. However, constructive opinions to correct these shortcomings and promote trade between the two are something that anyone must agree with.

In trade between North China and Central China, North China, and Mengjiang, what can still be felt now is the concept of region. Although the concept of region is an inevitable phenomenon arising from love, in the face of the great goal of jointly striving for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, this concept should be eliminated as soon as possible.

In short, unlike the agricultural conference, where ardent opinions about the food problem were expressed to the fullest, the proposals of the representatives at the materials exchange conference were somewhat dull, which may be due to the nature of the problem!

Follow Up Zeal with Action

After the conclusion of the various specialized conferences, the relevant government and civilian officials explained the various issues raised by the representatives from various regions in the three specialized conferences on the 29th, and the consultation conference came to an end. This Beijing consultation conference can be said to have closed in success.

According to the impressions expressed by Chairman Ogi, at this first conference after China's entry into the war, the zeal of the various economic figures was deeply felt. If this zeal can be put into action and efforts are made to establish the economy of the Greater East Asia, then the reason for holding the consultation conference will arise on its own.

### Cotton Sundries Can Be Freely Transported Within the City; Business Coordination Committee to Send Explanation to Police Bureau

According to the Central News Agency, cotton sundries are divided into finished products and semi-finished products. The former refers to items such as socks, towels, undershirts, sanitary shirts, handkerchiefs, bed sheets, and blankets, while the latter refers to handkerchief blanks, bed sheet blanks, and blanket blanks, collectively referred to as cotton sundries. Except for being moved out of the Shanghai area control line, which requires permission from the Business Coordination Committee before it can be transported, there are no restrictions on movement within the city, such as for processing, manufacturing, or finishing and dyeing, so it can be transported freely. However, in the past, due to the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth and temporarily suspend movement, and various raw materials are similar to cloth, there have been incidents of detention. It is understood that the Business Coordination Committee has instructed the Cotton Products Industry Federation to separately open and explain the differences between various raw materials and cloth in order to facilitate identification and release by inspectors. It is understood that the above explanation has been drafted and approved, and distributed to the police bureaus in this city, which will instruct their subordinates to investigate and handle the matter.

### Flour and Wheat Committee Coordinates Flour Export Allocation; Satisfactory Wheat Harvest This Year

According to the Central News Agency, Sun Zhongli, the chairman of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee, and Inoue Yastada, the vice chairman, went north together for the purpose of North-South material exchange and inspection of the situation in the north. They returned from North China on National Day. In order to find out about Sun's impressions of this trip and what plans he has for flour exports from North China, the reporter visited the two gentlemen at the Silk Building on Beijing Road yesterday afternoon, where the secretary-general of the committee, Mr. , gave a brief interview as follows:

North China Facilities

Sun's impressions of this trip, as recorded in the newspapers a few days ago, are that he expressed his great admiration for the substantial progress made in various implementations in North China under the wartime system. All facilities in North China have made rapid progress in recent years. The irrigation problem is relatively serious, because the rainy season in the north is only two months a year, resulting in insufficient natural irrigation for farmers' production, which is very difficult. Fortunately, the North China authorities are actively working on well drilling in rural areas to solve the problem of farmland irrigation. The depth of each well is stipulated to be 40 to 100 feet. It is heard that tens of thousands of wells have been drilled in the four provinces and three cities, and in the future, this may solve the problem of people's food once and for all. The North China rationing mechanism is very complete, and has precise statistics. For example, the cities of Tianjin and Beijing are divided into districts for rationing, and the average distribution is very rationalized.

Flour Exports

Last year, the amount of flour exported to North China was not very large because the number of products was small. This year's wheat harvest is satisfactory, and the committee is in charge of flour and wheat unified processing and distribution, so wheat hoarding has disappeared. All factories are able to work, and production can be increased. If the purchase volume can be smooth and successful in the future, after the flour is made, in addition to supplying the needs of Central China, it will be exported to North China as much as possible, so as to make a small contribution to the food of North China.

City Rationing

Regarding the rationing matters in this city, a new organization is currently being actively organized by Chinese and Japanese operators. In the shortest possible time, it will be able to improve the handling in accordance with the committee's flour concentration and distribution plan, and under the strict supervision of the city authorities and the General Business Coordination Committee and the committee, the unified distribution will never increase due to the export to the north.

### Citywide Vaccination Campaign; Free Vaccination in All Districts Starting Today

The First District Health Department, in order to prevent the spread of smallpox and protect the health of the people, has started preventive vaccinations simultaneously by the department and its sub-departments on the 4th of this month, and since the issuance of certificates, citizens have been enthusiastically requesting vaccinations. According to the reporter's inquiry to the Municipal Health Bureau, it has now been decided to launch a citywide vaccination campaign starting today. The Municipal Health Bureau announced to the public that starting today, they can request free vaccinations and receive certificates at the offices and clinics of the Shanghai District, Zhabei, Nanshi, and Pudong Health Bureaus, in order to reduce the risk of citizens contracting smallpox and to promote the health of citizens.

### Soap and Match Registration Enthusiastic

The rationing system for soap and matches has been decided and will be piloted in Districts 1 and 8 first. If the results are good, it will be extended to the whole city. Districts 1 and 8 have already processed the inventory registration, which is limited to the 19th of this month. All stores or storers who have more than 300 bars of soap or one box of matches must register. Failure to do so will result in confiscation and punishment. The two districts have already announced this separately. It is understood that the registration is quite enthusiastic. If there is any evidence of smuggling the inventory out of the country, it will be severely punished.

### New Movement Association to Discuss Restrictions on Banquets and Entertainment

According to the Central News Agency, the Shanghai New Movement Branch has decided to hold a symposium for Western and Chinese restaurants at the Atlantic Western Restaurant on Sima Road at 3:00 p.m. on the 20th of this month, to discuss banquets and restrictions on entertainment methods, in order to materialize the practice of the New Movement diet and entertainment and to promote economy. It is also scheduled to hold a symposium for dance halls and coffee shops at the Rice on Qiaqi Road on the 21st. All directors and supervisors of the industry associations will be invited to attend.

### First Board Meeting of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Branch

Since the reorganization and establishment of the Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, the promotion work has been quite active. The secretariat of the association recently held its first secretariat meeting and formulated a work outline. It is now scheduled to hold the first standing council meeting of the association at 3:00 p.m. on the 16th to decide on various important work plans. All standing directors will attend the meeting at that time.

### "Gone with the Wind" Brought to the Stage; Hard Work Theater to Perform Today

"Gone with the Wind" (that is, the movie and novel "Gone with the Wind") has long been popular all over the world. The news that "Gone with the Wind" will be brought to the stage has also been rumored for a year. Finally, today, it is met with the public. (The Hard Work Theater will make its debut performance at the Paris Grand Theater today)

Adapting "Gone with the Wind" into a drama is actually very difficult. The plot is too complicated, and the content and scenes are too large, making it difficult to manage on the stage. Another point is that the movie is too successful, and it is not easy to satisfy the audience. But now we can finally see "Gone with the Wind" on the stage, which is undoubtedly good news for drama lovers.

There are several points worth noting about this performance:

The term "hard work" is already well-known to the drama audience, but it is the first time that it has been formally formed into a theater group with strong strength and lineup to formally meet the audience. Moreover, it is a long-term charity performance (all income except for expenses will be donated to the Shen Bao Scholarship Fund), which is especially worthy of sympathy.

The playwrights, directors, and actors of "Hard Work" are all well-known figures in the drama world. This performance of "Gone with the Wind" is almost all-out, and the results are considerable.

Although "Gone with the Wind" is adapted from foreign movies and novels, it only takes its touching plot. The content of this script has been adapted and is completely Chinese. (The script has been published in "Vientiane" magazine) It takes the National Revolution around the 15th year of the Republic of China as the background of the times and writes about the joys and sorrows of a group of young people. These situations are all familiar to us and are naturally more intimate and interesting.

I hope that drama lovers will not miss this great opportunity to enjoy a good show and also a good opportunity to promote the scholarship movement. (Jin Yun)

However, egg merchants in this city have repeatedly requested permission for free transportation. It is understood that the Sino-Japanese Egg Industry Federation has prepared the entire method and submitted it to the Materials Review Committee for approval.

### Basketball Match Ends; Mixed Team Defeats Qianghua, Shantou Team Defeats Tongren

The fourth game of the basketball match was held yesterday afternoon in the rain at the Paramount Ballroom. Qianghua lost to the mixed team, 62 to 54. Zhang Hua failed. Also, the Tongren team’s gentlemen were absent, making it impossible to form a team. Players were temporarily dragged together. The Shantou team won easily against this motley crew. The Shantou team took the lead with 8 to 0. Tongren finally scored one point from a penalty by Xuan. Afterwards, the Shantou team became even more rampant, and the score soared. At the end of the first half, the Shantou team had an absolute advantage with 19 to 1. In the second half, Tongren counterattacked, and Liu Fushan made many contributions, but unfortunately, the points lost were too great. The Shantou team finally defeated Tongren with a score of 46 to 19. In the main event, Xu Wen of Qianghua and Wang Jinghu both scored points, while Zhuo Guorong of the mixed team returned the favor. The game went from relaxed to tense. Qianghua took the lead by only one point with 21 to 2 in the first half. After the switch, the mixed team showed its power and was invincible. Qianghua did not believe it. Shaoqing and Wen Kui successfully scored goals, tying the score five times. Yu Zi of the mixed team also contributed greatly. The mixed team finally turned defeat into victory, defeating Qianghua 62 to 54.

Economic Commentary

### After the Price Reassessment of Various Industries

In this time of wartime economic hardship, everyone is looking forward to the stabilization of prices. Therefore, the move to reassess and set price limits by the price assessment committees of various industries is welcome news to consumers. In recent days, in addition to reassessing the price limits of various commodities, industry associations have also devoted themselves to rectifying industry regulations to prevent situations of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant behavior. We feel that the last clause in the newly revised regulations of various industries: "All goods that have been assessed and have price limits, whether wholesale or retail, must be responsible for adhering to the assessed price limits and must not intentionally violate them" is especially worthy of support. Because, in recent times, the failure of prices in Shanghai to universally and thoroughly stabilize is not due to the lack of effort of the control organs, nor is it due to the lack of effort of the various levels of institutions under the control organs, but simply due to the fact that some wholesalers and retailers, especially retailers, still cannot escape the tendency to pursue illegal profits.

The key to the price reassessment of various industries lies in how to eliminate the bad habit of outwardly compliant but inwardly resistant behavior. If it cannot be eliminated, then the reassessed price limits, no matter how reasonable they are, will only be "attempts." Price control originally relies on the cooperation of officials and civilians to achieve success, and the tools to promote success rely on dual legal and moral constraints. The various decrees of the government to stabilize prices must be enforced without any leniency. This is the constraint of national law on prices. Merchants must abandon selfish and self-interested claims, limit operating profits, and use this to benefit the population. This is the constraint of merchant morality on prices - always taking into account the interests of consumers and always thinking of the pressure that life places on the general public. In recent months, the government has exercised special powers to deal with hoarding issues, which can be said to have achieved some significant results. We earnestly hope that various industries can also exercise special powers to assist the price policy, and strive to give full play to the self-governance ability and awareness of merchants, and even report illegal behaviors themselves to warn those who violate industry regulations, and must remember and not forget the morality of merchants - always considering the interests of consumers and always thinking of the pressure of life on the general public.

### The Chamber of Commerce Plans to Adjust the Yarn and Cloth Organization

The cotton products centralized allocation method has been finalized by the Shanghai Affairs Department of the Materials Control Review Committee and submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval. It is expected to be implemented soon. In order to ensure the comprehensiveness of the implementation of centralized allocation of cotton products in various regions and the unified manufacturing control of cotton yarn and cloth, the Chamber of Commerce is planning to dissolve the cotton yarn and cloth purchasing office responsible for the implementation of the purchasing work. At the same time, it may set up another management department and establish cotton and cotton products divisions under it. The cotton division will be responsible for the purchase of cotton, the allocation of raw materials to factories, and all matters related to the manufacturing of cotton yarn and cloth. The cotton products division will be responsible for all matters related to the distribution of cotton products. It is expected that the newly established cotton professional division of the current Chamber of Commerce may also be dissolved in the future.

### Various Banks and Pawnshops Actively Handle Agricultural Loans

Since the Ministry of Finance promulgated the "Provisional Measures for Managing Financial Institutions" and the implementing rules for management policies, financial institutions (i.e., banks, pawnshops, and trust companies) have been operating normal businesses in accordance with legal procedures, thereby stabilizing finance, especially after the full recovery of the concession.

Financial Control

has been completely eradicated and no longer exists. All financial institutions in Shanghai are working hard to develop their businesses under the guidance of the Central Bank, and with the government's implementation of wartime economic policies, the adjustment of financial and industrial and commercial organizations, and the gradual promotion of the control of various major commodities, the exchange of goods between regions is smooth, and the use of funds is becoming more active. Therefore, after consolidating their own foundations and capital, they are actively expanding as appropriate.

Inland Business

branches and offices have been established in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Changzhou, Wuxi, Bengbu, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Ningbo, and other places to engage in deposit and loan businesses. It is learned that various financial institutions, in order to assist the government in promoting construction and increasing production, are paying particular attention to industrial and

Agricultural Lending.

The Bank of Communications and other banks have jointly handled wheat and silk loans. Although the Bank of Communications has made considerable progress in promoting rural loans, it has also cooperated with other commercial banks to allocate agricultural loans and has allocated a portion of funds to be re-loaned to various banks and pawnshops for rural loans.

### No Conflict Between Earth Wine and Liquor Brewing Associations

The government has adjusted various industry associations in order to implement a wartime economic structure and has merged organizations with similar businesses to unify them. The liquor industry associations in this city have also been merged into the "Shanghai Special City Liquor Brewing and Sales Industry Association," which was established some time ago. However, the establishment of the Earth Wine Vendors Association seemed to conflict with the affairs of the association and was also contrary to the adjusted structure. Therefore, a request was submitted to the Food Bureau for prohibition. The Grain Bureau has now issued an explanation stating that the Earth Wine Vendors Association has adopted the basic principle of transporting earth wines from various parts of Jiangsu Province, concentrating them in this city for wholesale to various liquor stores, and then selling them to Shanghai residents for consumption, which does not conflict with the affairs of the association. However, there are differences among the members of the association regarding the items presented, and each county magistrate has been notified.

Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday's market was weak and listless. There were fewer and fewer trading partners, and prices remained unable to rise.

Class A, B, D, and E showed no hope of rebounding. At 3:00 PM, there was suddenly favorable news, and the gray market rose sharply.

Grains: Miscellaneous grains saw reduced vendors due to morning rain, and prices were temporarily raised, but then turned flat due to weak sales, with the closing price still slightly higher. The price of rice fell due to more sellers than buyers, and the market trend remained flat and soft.

Rayon: Yesterday, real sales turned weak, and hoarding profits gradually began to be released, so the market trend showed a soft picture and retreated into the level.

### Central Reserve Bank's Financial Inspection Office to Unify Accounting Subject Names; Will Convene Accounting Directors of Various Banks and Pawnshops to Study and Determine

Since its establishment, the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been promoting the inspection work of various financial institutions very smoothly with excellent results. The entire financial business has been developed suddenly. Because the accounting subjects of various banks and pawnshops in this city are quite inconsistent, after investigating the names of the accounting subjects used by each bank and pawnshop, there are more than one hundred and several dozens. Each uses a different one. This situation does not conform to the system of wartime financial organization institutions, and it causes many misunderstandings and ambiguities with merchants. In order to unify the names of accounting subjects, all the different names of accounting subjects used by each bank and pawnshop have been collected for research, to meet the current needs and the ones adopted by each bank and pawnshop. It is heard that the office will convene the accounting directors of various banks and pawnshops, as well as experienced accounting experts, to study and determine the uniformity.

### Inland Cooking Oil Transported to Shanghai for Sale

The city's industry has recently been gradually moving inland. For example, in the past, the inland areas mostly relied on this city for cooking oil. Recently, under the principle of local manufacturing, small oil factories in the inland areas have sprung up like mushrooms after rain, and production has become excessive. Therefore, recently, a large amount of cooking oil has been shipped from Wuxi, Jiangbei, and other places to Shanghai for sale.

In other news, the local oil pressing factories have recently been in a state of suspension due to the lack of oil grain raw materials because the purchase of oil grains has not yet been implemented. They are resuming work.

### Japanese Side Reports Routine Joint Press Conference

Minister Izubuchi Meets Reporters for the First Time

Central News Agency report: The routine joint press conference of the Japanese, Army, and Overseas Affairs Authorities in Shanghai was held at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) on the 5th floor of the International Hotel on Nanjing Road. Minister Izubuchi of the Japanese Army News Department met with reporters for the first time since taking office. Also present were Mr. Akahoshi, entrusted by the department, and Minister Matsushima of the Fleet News Department, as well as Lieutenant Yamataka. The Japanese Embassy in Shanghai was represented by Information Chief Hirota and Vice Consul Fukuma. First, Minister Izubuchi announced the results of the Japanese army's occupation of Guangde and the southwest area of Taihu Lake. Then, Minister Hirota answered the reporters' questions about the recent agreement between Britain and Portugal, criticizing it in detail. Finally, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet News Department denounced the American spokesperson's boring propaganda and reported in detail on the Japanese Navy's adequate preparations. The conference ended at 5:00 PM.

Minister Izubuchi Announces War Results in the Taihu Lake Area

Minister Izubuchi of the Japanese Army News Department in Shanghai announced the Japanese army's war results in the southwest area. The details are recorded as follows:

Crushing Conspiracy

Minister Izubuchi first stated that the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a war to liberate the Asian nations. After Burma's independence, the Philippines also declared independence and officially established an independent republic. Looking back, the conspiracy of the anti-Axis powers has been completely crushed, and the meaning of the war on the mainland is exactly the same. In the past, the anti-Axis powers maliciously fabricated slander and destroyed our dignity. After our actions, the weaker countries will cooperate to complete their independence. This despicable rumor will be self-defeating. Minister Izubuchi also said that since the end of September, the Japanese army's actions in the five lakes area of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui have been quite effective. In order to show the Japanese army's intention to attack, both directly and indirectly, it has greatly assisted the Kuomintang's military, political, and economic aspects. In this operation, the Japanese army completely occupied important areas such as Guangde in the southwest area of Taihu Lake in less than ten days. Now this war zone has been expanded, and preparations are being made for the next target. The security of the occupied area will be established by the Japanese army. The area is 15,000 to 16,000 square kilometers with a population of 3 million. This vast area and prosperous population are included in the peaceful area.

Living and Working in Peace

Minister Izubuchi said that this area was the only source of food for the Third War Zone, producing 20 million bags of rice, 5 million bags of wheat, and 1.5 million bags of beans each year. Other geological resources, such as lime, amount to 7 million tons, and coal amounts to 50 million to 60 million tons. This huge amount of production is shocking and has now been completely included in the peaceful area. It is enough to hit Chongqing hard. The area was previously occupied by the Chongqing "Loyal Patriotic Army," which threatened to conscript supplies and impose exorbitant taxes. Therefore, the people hated the "Loyal Patriotic Army" very much. Since the Japanese army's attack, they have welcomed it very much, and a large number of people have returned. The main reasons for the people's enthusiastic welcome and the rapid restoration of security are that the Japanese army has considered the local situation. Daily necessities such as soap, matches, cigarettes, and cotton cloth were very scarce in the area. After providing the necessities of life, the large amount of local production was exchanged for materials, and the people lived and worked in peace. Minister Izubuchi said that the "Loyal Patriotic Army" has been completely defeated, and the security of the area is stable. Therefore, the British and American conspiracies to disrupt the peaceful area have been crushed, and the abundant rice production in the area will allow for a rich amount of rice to be collected when the rice is purchased in the future. In addition to supplying the local area, the excess can be transferred to other areas, which will greatly benefit the peaceful area.

Minister Matsushima Denounces American Propaganda

Minister Matsushima of the News Department denounced the recent boring propaganda by American spokesmen. Matsushima first pointed out that the spokesman said that the recent large-scale bombing by American aircraft showed that Japan would not retaliate and that Japan's power in the Pacific had weakened. Minister Matsushima immediately asserted that, as far as he knew, the Navy was preparing for the next major war and was preparing for the next major war, waiting for the opportunity to launch an attack. The recent facts of the Japanese Navy and Air Force bombing the Indian island of Xilan show that the Japanese naval aircraft can safely cross the Indian Ocean to scout the British military base. Therefore, any malicious propaganda by the anti-Axis powers completely contradicts our people's proof of the strength of the Japanese army. Finally, he cited the late Marshal Togo's "Do not speak, implement" legacy, which is a clear saying from the Meiji era in Japan, and is especially followed by the Japanese military. Finally, he refuted the anti-Axis side for spreading rumors without actually launching a counterattack, saying that they had scouted Burma or scouted the Japanese mainland, using this boring propaganda to attempt intimidation, while Japan would never adopt this kind of despicable means.

Chief Hirota Discusses Agreement Between Britain and Portugal

Mr. Hirota, Information Chief of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, commented on the signing of the agreement between Britain and Portugal:

Forced to Conclude a Treaty

Mr. Hirota first pointed out that this agreement between Britain and Portugal is determined to be a coercive policy implemented by Britain against small and neutral countries. Warring countries must not use neutral territories as political bases. This time, Britain's conclusion of an agreement on the island of Azore in Portuguese territory is actually Britain using it as a political base. Although Britain has repeatedly stated that there is no act of aggression against neutral countries after signing the agreement with Portugal, it is actually trying to cover up. People do not know that it is completely an act of aggression, but whether this kind of behavior is recognized or violated by the neutral countries is because they are too oppressed and recognize it. Therefore, we cannot think that Portugal supports it in a free environment. Moreover, in a few months, Mr. Sandringham was forced to pressure the Portuguese government, and the attempt to use the Azore Islands failed. This time, Britain did not resort to pressure and issued an ultimatum to force the Portuguese government to recognize it. Who would believe that this kind of behavior is not an aggression against neutral countries? Britain's use of Azore as a political base actually invoked the treaty concluded in 1273. From this point of view, it is difficult to base the assertion of one's own position on a treaty from 600 years ago. Mr. Hirota explained the use of territory by neutral countries to warring countries in three points: 1. Permanent lease 2. Ceding territory 3. Warring parties. The Portuguese government has not implemented the above three points so far. This time, Portugal has handed over the Azores Islands to Britain for use. We assert that it is completely violating the treaty. However, looking at the position of the Portuguese government, we can recognize that it is difficult to make preparations due to temptation and to avoid difficulties. It cannot be avoided during the war, but we hope that the Portuguese government will take care of all parties and do its best.

Observing European Trends

Information Chief Hirota answered the reporter's questions, observing the recent trends in Europe. He said that although the anti-Axis forces may be able to land on the Iberian Peninsula, if they land on the French connection, they will suffer a miserable disappearance. The anti-Axis side also clearly expects that it will use Portugal and Spain to join the anti-Axis alliance to launch a possible attack on the French mainland. The defense of Germany is as solid as a rock. Therefore, any attempt by the anti-Axis powers to use the two countries of Spain and Portugal to attack will be easier for Germany to compare with the military situation at that time. The current German defense is dozens of times stronger than the situation of Napoleon. Mr. Hirota further explained the following two points: 1. In Napoleon's time, Spain was occupied by Napoleon, and his brother was on the Spanish throne. The Spanish people opposed it, but the Spanish general, Duke Wellington, was enthusiastic about protecting this side in the German war and joined the Axis line. 2. Napoleon was defeated by Imperial Russia in 1812, but the current Soviet Union's own strength is stronger than Imperial Russia, and Germany has already defeated this powerful Soviet Union and won a great victory. Therefore, the German army is dozens of times stronger than Napoleon's army. Therefore, we will take the history of Napoleon's defeat as a lesson. The current strength of the German army is strong, and it is absolutely impossible to repeat its story.

Beijing Dispatch

### The Discovery of Ancient Cannons

Modern warfare's most effective weapons all use gunpowder. China was the first country to utilize gunpowder. During the Song Dynasty, it was already used in the military. What the Liao Dynasty called "Heaven-Shaking Thunder" was actually a type of "cannon." Later, gunpowder was introduced to Europe, where Westerners improved it and turned it into a modern weapon of war. During the reign of Emperor Chongzhen of the Ming Dynasty, Westerners residing in China were ordered to manufacture cannons for defending the Shanhaiguan Pass. Even during the Qing Dynasty's campaigns against the frontier regions, these cannons were used. Unfortunately, our people clung to old methods and did not investigate further. It was not until the Westerners invaded that we realized the power of the gunpowder that our ancestors used for firecrackers.

Beijing was the capital of the Ming and Qing Dynasties. Through repeated turmoil, many treasures were often buried underground. Recently, ancient cannons from the Ming Dynasty were discovered, which makes us reflect on the origins of this weapon and the history of our country suffering from it. The discovery of the ancient cannons was accidental. According to a newspaper report: "The Dun Microorganism Research Institute on Chang'an Street in this city was dredging a hidden ditch in its courtyard when it discovered five ancient cannons, each about three feet long and eight inches in diameter, all made of iron, believed to be relics from the Ming Dynasty. They have been sent to the History Museum for research. According to investigations, this location was once an ordnance bureau, and several ancient cannons have been discovered there in previous years. There are many ancient artifacts buried underground, hence this discovery." (New Beijing Daily, September 29th)

Oil Shortage and Coal Shortage

Over the past year, daily necessities in Beijing have experienced periodic shortages. At the end of last year, there was a soap shortage. A small piece of ordinary soap suddenly rose to more than one yuan and was still hard to find. Later, there was a fabric shortage, with a foot of blue cloth costing as much as two or three yuan. This spring, there was a food shortage, which occurred in waves and has become increasingly severe. The newspapers have suddenly reported that the authorities are planning to distribute supplies on a large scale, which seems to solve the shortage problem. However, the items allocated last time still cannot be redeemed even with coupons. How the future distribution will be is hard to be optimistic. However, the prices of kindling that had risen sharply after the city gates were closed for epidemic prevention have indeed fallen these days, marking a segment in the cycle. Some time ago, the price of soap suddenly dropped, while the raw materials for manufacturing soap became scarce and expensive. Recently, there has been an oil shortage and a coal shortage. Oil includes both fat oil and vegetable oil. People in Beijing have long stopped eating much pork. After the Mid-Autumn Festival, the price of meat rose from around four yuan per catty to over seven yuan, and nine out of ten shops had no meat to sell. The rise in vegetable oil prices is quite significant. Before the festival, a catty of peanut oil was 3.8 yuan, but now it's almost six yuan. It's also hard to buy from oil mills, and it's difficult to get even five catties. Coal is originally a local product of Beijing, but it has also become scarce recently. The price of coal was 2.4 yuan per hundred catties two months ago, but now it has risen to about four yuan. Soon, coal briquettes may become rare gifts. This periodic shortage clearly indicates that the reason is hoarding, otherwise, things could not suddenly appear and disappear. Does the authority have a thorough solution to this?

Traffic Restoration

In order to thoroughly prevent the plague, the Beiping authorities ordered the closure of Beijing's city gates. Only one or two gates were half-opened under strict military guard. At the same time, it was forbidden for people to take trains at Beijing stations. These measures gave some rumor-mongers an opportunity to be active, and all kinds of rumors circulated in Beijing every day. There were even extremely ridiculous rumors. In the past few days, several autumn winds have blown, and the weather has become significantly colder, so the plague's momentum has been greatly reduced. According to news reports, only seven people have contracted the plague in the past three days. Therefore, other epidemic prevention measures are no longer necessary, and the authorities have ordered the opening of the city gates from October 1st, and all trains can be taken freely. (October 6th)

National Forum

### High Pawnshop Interest

— Xiao

The recent assessment of vegetable prices and the distribution of daily necessities has brought great excitement and comfort to the citizens. Poor people can breathe a little easier, or at least no longer feel the pressure tightening every day. The authorities' concern for the people's suffering and their direct measures for the national economy are admirable. Implementing these measures thoroughly to alleviate the people's difficulties will bring significant benefits. However, the economic exploitation of the poorest people (lack of financial flexibility) has not been reduced at all.

Yesterday, a poor relative came to me and said that in order to buy a peck of rice, he pawned several lined cotton clothes and got 200 yuan in banknotes. Four months ago, 200 yuan was enough to buy a peck of rice. Now, four months later, with the cold weather approaching, he has to add clothes. He took a portion of his salary to redeem them. When he calculated the redemption price, it exceeded one-fourth of his salary, turning 200 yuan into 272.8 yuan.

He said, "For using a peck of rice," I gave away four sheng (market price). It's not easy for the poor to live."

This interest of over 70 yuan is too high. I asked him how it was calculated. He said, "A 'pawn deduction' of 10% and a monthly interest of 6%. The 'pawn deduction' is equal to a 'commission' or 'handling fee' that is added to the interest at any time. So, the face value becomes 220 yuan, and the monthly interest of 6% is calculated on that total. After four months, isn't it 52.8 yuan, turning it into 272.8 yuan? But I only received 200 yuan in reality."

"How terrible! The rich store rice, coal, and oil in their homes by the loads. They buy at low prices, so price increases don't affect them. Common people buy in small quantities, so they suffer from price increases. They lack financial flexibility and also have to endure the exploitation of high-interest loans!" After he finished speaking, he pointed out that someone was still eating rice that cost 70 yuan a dan, and someone had one or two hundred loads of coal briquettes piled up in their house.

I sighed.

He is a dutiful professional. He received higher education. Before the war, his income allowed him to have some savings after covering his family's expenses. After the war, he spent everything he had, and his monthly expenses exceeded his income. He would not take off his long gown. He had no money to hoard goods. He had no way to become an official. He cared about his dignity and would not borrow money from others. He still considers himself fortunate that he has not suffered unemployment.

He is a perfect example of the hidden poor. The war destroyed the entire national economy and created countless extremely poor people, refugees, and many hidden poor. Only a very small number became suddenly rich. There is no need to deny that there are many people who wear long gowns like him and suffer from "poverty," but are unwilling to borrow money and cannot reduce their daily expenses.

I thought of the poorest elderly, workers, lower-level laborers, and the unemployed. Therefore, I paid more attention to pawnshops, which regulate the private economy.

The wise officials of the Ministry of Social Welfare have proposed establishing public pawnshops. I don't think they have noticed the inside story of pawnshops under the current circumstances of high-interest exploitation. Here, I raise my voice and ask pawnshop owners to be compassionate, not to increase the economic pressure on the middle and lower classes, and to save the poor. I also hope that the gentlemen of the Ministry of Social Welfare and the municipal authorities will ban, regulate, or adjust these practices as soon as possible to relieve the people from their suffering!

### Small Opinions on the New Street Names

Part One

The method of correcting street names this time is very satisfactory. First: whether the names of people on street signs should be eliminated or preserved, all should be replaced with the names of places. Second: different place names on a straight line should be combined. For example, Difeng Road, Maiqi Road, and Jufu Road should all be renamed Dihua Road. Danshui Road and Popsey Road should be called Nantong Road. Mashan Road and Beile Road should be called Xiangpi Road. Bielbu Road should be connected to Chongqing Road, and Beiyun Road should be connected to Chengdu Road, etc.

According to this principle, the following roads have no need to be separated and should be combined into one name for easy memorization: Tianzhu Church Street should be connected to Sichuan Road, and there is no need to establish Tianhe Road separately. Jixiang Street should be connected to Jiangxi Road, and there is no need to rename it Dingnan Road. Lao Beimen Street should be connected to Henan Road, and there is no need to establish Changbai Road separately. Maidiyan Road should be connected to Shandong Road, and there is no need to establish Zaozhuang Road separately. Zhangjia Muqiao Street should be merged into Fujian Road, and there is no need to rename it Yongtai Road. Xinqiao Street should be merged into Zhejiang Road, and there is no need to rename it Ziyang Road. Xi Mulaihuo Street should be connected to Guangxi Road, and there is no need to establish Guilin Road separately. Baliqiao Road should be merged into Yunnan Road, and there is no need to rename it Yongping Road. As for the very short Longmen Road, it should be merged with Dingding Road (McGauley Road). Xianyang Road (Al Road) and Qimen Road (Seymour Road), Maoming Road (Murming Road) and Guilin Road (Myers Avenue), Fumin Road (Gu Road) and Yuhu Road (Yumei Road), Nanhai Road (Fuxing Road) and Guangyuan Road (Tasderlang Road), Xinxi Road (Min Ni Yin Road) and Anhui Road (Wei Ai Road), Zhengyang Road (Tongfu Road) and Huangshan Road (Jinshifu Road), and Xiangshan Road (Notre Dame Road) are all on a straight line and should all be merged into one name.

In addition, there are some that I think do not need to be changed: for example, Yalu Road should not be renamed Zhujiang Road, because Yalu River has a more historical meaning. Also, Qingpu Road is not as good as the old one when changed to Tianjin Road, and Qiujiang Road changed to Qinghe Road. Changing the name of the Museum Road to Huqiu Road is not necessary either.

Zhili Road, which has not been renamed, seems to have too much feudal flavor and should be renamed Hebei Road. Whether Fengtian Road should be changed to Liaoning Road is also worth pondering. It seems that there is already a Jiangyin Road (Mengdelan Road) in the South City. I don't know if it is the same one. Furthermore, West Lin'an Road (Zier Road) and Jinling Road (Avenue Edward VII) are on a straight line and should also be merged. Also, there is no Lin'an Road in the entire list of street names. I don't know if the "West" in West Lin'an is a mistake. It is suspicious. (Bai Hong)

Part Two

The road changes in the first and eighth districts have been officially announced on October 10th, which shows the municipal government's determination to take back the concessions and completely change the street names. The street signs will naturally also be changed. Taking advantage of this opportunity, I would like to offer a few words as a citizen.

In the past, the house numbers in the first and eighth districts only had numbers and no street names. This was not a problem for those who knew the roads, but it was inconvenient for those who were not familiar with the routes. I hope that attention will be paid to this in addition to the road signs. It is best to install more road signs and indicate the names of the previous and following roads on each road sign.

In addition to the first and eighth districts, there are many places in Shanghai where road administration needs to be improved urgently. For example, in the South City, apart from the two roads of the Republic of China, there are hardly any "decent" roads. They are narrow and rugged. Some don't even look like roads. Most of the houses in the South City have been destroyed. It is appropriate to take this opportunity to delineate the boundaries of the roads, not only to widen the road surface but also to renovate them. Once the road administration has been improved and the environment has become more beautiful, the original owners of the destroyed houses will be happy to rebuild them. This is a prerequisite for the revival of the South City. Please pay attention to it. (Meng)

### Eighth District Authorities to Formulate Measures for Handling Lost Children

— Cai Chimo

Now that the weather has turned cooler again, children from middle and upper-class families wear the most ordinary woolen sweaters and trousers. However, the price of wool is terribly high. The "Bee Brand" is shockingly expensive, and even the ordinary brands cost more than half a thousand per pound. As a result, the gangs who live by "peeling frogs" (a slang term for those who live by illegal schemes) are very active. Moreover, in addition to "peeling frogs," they can also "pick up right heads" (kidnapping children). Under these circumstances, there are incidents of children getting lost everywhere. The Third Police Bureau has recently formulated measures for handling lost children, which are transcribed below:

When on-duty detectives and neighborhood officers discover lost or abandoned children, they should immediately send them to the police sub-bureau in their jurisdiction. The sub-bureau will send personnel to investigate the child's parents or guardians, order them to find a guarantor to claim the child, and report it to the bureau and notify the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office for reference.

If the parents or guardians of the aforementioned lost or abandoned children come to the bureau to claim them, the bureau's responsible personnel should handle the matter in accordance with the regulations and must not deliberately make things difficult.

If the parents or guardians of the lost or abandoned children cannot be found, the child should be brought to the Identification Section of the Judiciary Department of this bureau to have their photo taken (children under two years old are exempt from being photographed). Then, the child should be sent to Guangci Hospital for care. At the same time, the photo should be attached to a report to the bureau, and a copy of the report, along with a photo, should be sent to the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office.

The Children's Protection Section will send personnel to conduct a detailed investigation of the child's parents or guardians based on the above report copy, order them to find a guarantor to claim the child, and notify the Correction Section of this bureau of the handling situation.

If the parents or guardians of the lost or abandoned children who have been sent to Guangci Hospital for care wish to claim them, they can go directly to the Children's Protection Section of the Eighth District Office to find a guarantor to claim them.

### Jiagu Mountain Farmer Generously Donates to Impoverished Teachers

I recently saw the article "The Call of an Impoverished Teacher" in the social service section of your newspaper, which filled me with sympathy. I am enclosing 100 yuan in national currency, which I would like you to pass on to Mr. Fan Mingxing. I hope that powerful people in society will generously donate to help the impoverished teachers. Sincerely, Jiagu Mountain Farmer (Editor's note: The payment has been received and will be handed over to Mr. Fan Mingxing.)

Youth Association Promotes Music

For the purpose of promoting music education, the Shanghai Young Men's Christian Association (YMCA) at Eight Immortals Bridge holds a music concert and record concert every Saturday afternoon at 5:00 PM in the YMCA Auditorium. The performers are all well-known musicians in Shanghai. The programs are all world-famous songs and are full of life's meaning. All students and young people who love music can participate for free.

### Dr. Chen Donates His Miracle Ointment

Dr. Chen Qichang, from 602 Sichuan Road, has donated his miracle powder to our office for distribution to the poor and sick. Now, he is donating 120 boxes of his miracle ointment. This ointment is specially used to treat various skin diseases and hemorrhoids, and its effect is very fast. Patients can get it from our office.

### Review of the Method of Eating Ginkgo Soaked in Vegetable Oil

Shen Bao published an article by Mr. Jiang Yilan on June 23 discussing the treatment of pulmonary tuberculosis, which mentioned that fresh young ginkgo with green skin soaked in vegetable oil for 100 days, then take out two at a time, and take them together with the skin and kernel, has a great effect. I don't know which layer of skin Mr. Lan is referring to when he says "skin and kernel." Fresh ginkgo looks like a plum. The outermost layer is a thick, juicy pericarp, which is usually not eaten. Inside is a hard shell, which is the common ginkgo. There is still a membrane inside, and the kernel is inside the membrane. I have asked someone to buy it, and it will be 100 days soon, but I don't know the truth and dare not eat it, for fear of danger. I hope Mr. Jiang will explain it further. (Tan Yongfen)
