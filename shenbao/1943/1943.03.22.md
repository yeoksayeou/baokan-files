### Participation in the War: Politics and Diplomacy

Yesterday's commentary briefly discussed the important relationship between participating in the war and national reconstruction and industrial development, as well as the expectations of the people. We believe that participating in the war and national reconstruction and industrial development should complement and promote each other. However, whether it is participating in the war, national reconstruction, or industrial development, the outcome depends on the success of political and diplomatic policies. Since joining the war, in less than three months, in terms of politics, there has been the realization of a wartime system, and in terms of diplomacy, there has been the beginning of Japan's new policy towards China. Standing in the position of the people, our expectations for the government are extremely earnest. We dare to continue discussing politics and diplomacy after participating in the war, national reconstruction, and industrial development.

The scope of politics is extremely broad, and the most important issue is the national system. Although China's five-thousand-year history has many brilliant achievements, due to the long-term autocratic monarchy system, the world was for personal gain, and there were very few days of political brightness, with longer periods of darkness. There were minor disturbances every few decades and major disturbances every few centuries, recurring endlessly. Although ancient sages and wise men created valuable culture, it often could not be inherited, promoted, and developed. Especially since the Song Dynasty, cultural progress has stagnated, and the people's physical strength has declined day by day. Investigating the reason, it is due to the "family owns the country" relationship. The people have no status or power, and they are at the mercy of the rulers' command and servitude and cannot strive for themselves. As a result, man-made disasters and natural calamities frequently occur, and the country's affairs become increasingly wrong. The Xinhai Revolution overthrew the autocratic system that had been passed down for thousands of years, and the Chinese nation saw the light of day. However, because autocracy had lasted for too long, political malpractices had accumulated too deeply, and social customs were too bad, it was not easy to reveal the ideal light in this historical transformation work in a short period of time. Subsequently, after the Sino-Japanese Incident, public opinion diverged, worries and difficulties followed, and the country faced the danger of division, and the people suffered from displacement. Fortunately, around the return of the capital, thanks to the efforts of the leaders of both China and Japan, the provinces along the Yangtze River and the coast were able to celebrate their recovery. Now, due to participating in the war, the international status has been elevated, and the wartime political system has a new atmosphere of starting anew with the people. If we can take this opportunity to reform politics and innovate the political atmosphere, we can complete the unfinished achievements since the Xinhai Revolution and establish a permanent foundation for the Republic of China. We pray that contemporary politicians will, based on the vision of the new world order, strive to awaken the people, organize the people, and improve the grassroots political institutions, so that everyone knows that the country is lovable and the government is respectable. The benefits are that, in the short term, the people's strength can be concentrated, and the country can be sound; and in the long term, the establishment of permanent peace in East Asia can also be initiated from this.

However, there is no need to avoid the truth. In this new era, China's politics is no longer a matter of one country, but has an inseparable relationship with the fate of the entire East Asia; and the relationship between China and Japan sharing weal and woe is particularly close. Since participating in the war, Japan's policy towards us has undergone a great and bright change, and all the manifestations are exciting. In this new era, our country's foreign policy should increase confidence, and whether now or in the future, we should strive together with friendly countries that have the same national policy as ours. However, our country has become a place of contention for the great powers for a hundred years and has long been trapped in a semi-colonial state. For the sake of permanent peace in East Asia, there must be a strong China to be able to cooperate with friendly countries to permanently maintain the stability of East Asia. Today, the starting point of the new policy of friendly countries should be nothing more than this. At the same time, because our country has been poor and weak for many years, there is also a sense of national inferiority. People may still use traditional eyes to evaluate the actions of foreigners in China and feel uneasy. If this subtle psychological awareness is allowed to lie dormant and grow, it will also lead to unfortunate misunderstandings. We believe that Chinese citizens should strengthen their self-confidence and hope that people of friendly countries will thoroughly understand that China is a nation of integrity and peace and will never hinder the legitimate interests of others. Therefore, our foreign policy must create an independent and free modern country. All those who sympathize with and support us are friends, and we must be harmonious and friendly with them and remain unwavering. After obtaining this equality, we will never be selfish with our strength, but will make good use of our human resources and cooperate with friendly countries that share weal and woe to strive forward and do our best to establish a new order of permanent peace in East Asia.

### Development of the National Government's Economic Policy

Taking China's participation in the war as an opportunity, the Japanese government has implemented a transformation of its policy towards China. In order to achieve the goal of establishing China's autonomy and independence, it has decided to return concessions, abolish extraterritorial rights, entrust the responsibility of maintaining law and order, and restrict the interference of special agencies in administration, and it has already stated this. Its actions are nothing more than hoping that China can become self-reliant and strong and then share the responsibility of carrying out the Greater East Asia War.

In response to this policy transformation of Japan, China has resolutely implemented the reform and establishment of its various policies. For the economic policy, which is considered the most urgent, it has first reorganized the National Economic Commission into an agency directly under the National Government, increased the number of members, and accommodated influential figures in the financial community, using it as the highest agency, as the economic center, and as a new starting point for China's economic policy under participation in the war.

The outline of the wartime economic policy announced by the Supreme National Defense Council is its initial undertaking and is the basis for the National Government's economic policy in the future, so it must be given importance. This outline is divided into five items: increasing production, adjusting prices, saving consumption, stabilizing currency value and regulating finance, and transforming economic institutions. The item of increasing production concerns increasing the productivity of agriculture, industry, and mining, so it stipulates the securing of raw materials and fuels, the guarantee of profits, etc.; the item of adjusting prices stipulates the improvement of transportation institutions, the adjustment of distribution institutions, and the crackdown on hoarding; the item of saving consumption stipulates the increase in the production of substitutes and the restriction of the production of non-essential goods and luxury goods; the item of currency and finance stipulates the improvement of financial institutions with reserve certificates as the center, the encouragement of savings, the restoration of agricultural, industrial, and mining financial institutions, and the prohibition of speculation; and the item of transforming economic institutions stipulates the reorganization of economic institutions, the establishment of a consistent institution from production to distribution, and the implementation of a group management system. The characteristic of this outline is that it grasps the key points of China's current urgent problems, but the question is how to implement this outline. Based on the above basic outline, the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National General Association of Commercial Control on the 11th of this month. The regulations stipulate that a control association shall be established for each type of commodity, and a general association of control shall be established in Shanghai to lead them. A Japan-China joint material control deliberation council shall also be established as an advisory body. Under the supervision of the National Government, the control association shall, by means of autonomous control by the people, carry out the purchase and distribution of controlled materials and the supply and distribution of imported materials. According to the talk of Minister of Industry Mei, the control association has the characteristics of implementing the separation of politics and economics and transitioning from government control to civil autonomous control.

Promulgated at the same time as these regulations was the Provisional Regulation for the Control of Wartime Material Movement. The movement of materials in Central China has long been implemented by the Japanese side, such as the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Material Movement in Military-Occupied Areas in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River (promulgated in September of the 30th year of the Republic of China), the Regulations for the Restriction of Material Movement in and out of the Shanghai Area, and the Regulations for Material Movement in the Qingxiang Area, etc. However, due to the newly promulgated regulations on material movement control by the National Government, most of the above-mentioned regulations on the Yangtze River area were abolished, and other restrictive regulations based on these regulations, as well as restrictions on material movement in the Qingxiang area, etc., were also abolished. Therefore, the control of material movement in peaceful areas has become much freer than before. The current shortage of materials in Central China, which is facing national difficulties, can be supplemented by the promotion of movement due to the effect of these two regulations. In terms of material collection and distribution, it can be said to be a historical reform since the incident.

What is even more noteworthy is that, according to the announcement of the Ministry of Finance, the Reserve Bank's funds will be used to establish a new Central Savings Association, which will plan to issue three new types of bonds: economic recovery lottery bonds, installment savings bonds, and prize-winning principal repayment bonds. This method is one of the means of implementing the policy outline on encouraging savings. In order to adjust the imbalance between currency and materials, which has become a problem in Central China, it is necessary to absorb the surplus purchasing power in any case. These savings bonds and the grain warehouse bonds, which are expected to be issued soon, can be considered to have a major task in the reflux of currency, so this is another new policy worthy of attention.

From the 10th of this month, new Qingxiang work will begin in the Zhenjiang area, and soon the Qingxiang work in northern Jiangsu will also begin. These Qingxiang works are different from those previously carried out, and are carried out autonomously with China as the main body. Moreover, because these areas are important locations in terms of security and economy, this work has brought great economic effects to the government. In this way, the National Government's business of economic reorganization in Central China is being practiced step by step, and Japan's long-term policy transformation will soon be seen. Therefore, we hope that it will make a great contribution to enhancing the war power of Greater East Asia. (Ding: Translated from the March 14th Reader's Report)

### Germany Commemorates Fallen Soldiers: Hitler Delivers Speech, Strategic Planning for Eastern Front Completed, Guaranteeing Victory Next Month

Berlin, March 21st, Huitong News Agency: Today, Berlin held a memorial day for fallen soldiers. German leader Hitler delivered the following speech: "We are holding a memorial ceremony for fallen soldiers in this venue, and it has been the fourth time. This memorial ceremony was extended to today before it was held, because for months, I have been busy with official affairs and have hardly had any time. Today, I was finally able to get away and come here. We should thank the soldiers who sacrificed themselves on the Eastern Front, because we have overcome the difficulties and are on the right track. Our front line is now as solid as a rock, and all the decisive strategies have been fully planned. Once next month arrives, we will enter the final stage of victory." The leader continued, "Since the outbreak of the war, the number of Germans who have died has reached 542,000. This sacrifice will never be in vain and will be forever engraved in the hearts of the German people." Regarding the Allied air raids on Germany, the German leader said, "This move will indeed make more areas of Germany become war zones, but he guarantees that the result of these bombings will increase the German people's fighting will and their determination to hate the Allied countries. All neutral countries today are supported by the sacrifices of the German army. Today, the Axis countries and their allies in Europe and East Asia are fighting for their survival, but to achieve this goal, it is impossible to eliminate communism without success. It must be eradicated before we can enjoy lasting peace." The German leader also said, "Regarding the issue of rebuilding a new order after the war, it will be discussed at length by prominent figures from all countries."

### Foreign Minister Chu's Talk After Returning to Beijing: Visited and Met with Representatives of Various Countries in Shanghai

In addition to attending the tea party hosted by Ambassador Shigemitsu to entertain the diplomatic community, I also took this opportunity to meet with diplomatic representatives of various countries, which was very pleasant. Since the recognition of the National Government by Germany and Italy last year, European countries have successively taken the same steps to establish normal diplomatic relations with the National Government and send representatives to reside in our country. The friendly situation is gradually increasing. Since our country joined the war, we have not only devoted ourselves to the common war against Britain and the United States with our friendly country Japan, but also the European Axis countries are pursuing the consolidation of friendly relations with the same goal. The successive declarations of the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by various countries prove that the enthusiasm of our country in participating in the war is deeply understood by various countries. In order to actively promote the realization of this issue as soon as possible, I held separate meetings with representatives of various countries. I met with representatives of Italy, Spain, Denmark, and other countries successively. After the meetings, the discussions were extremely harmonious. Although I could not make concrete consultations on the above issues due to the short time, I learned that all friendly countries have a positive willingness to assist in this issue and achieve its realization as soon as possible. This enthusiastic expression of sincerity can be seen in the overall consultation, where satisfactory discussions were achieved within the scope of various principles. In short, I firmly believe that with the full assistance of our friendly country Japan, significant progress will be made in the near future regarding the two matters of receiving concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights. Also, I was able to meet with the German Consul General in Shanghai this time and visit the organization of his intelligence work. I am deeply impressed by the scale of its organization, its neat operation, and its thorough flexibility."

Furthermore, due to food shortages in Shaoquan, all tea houses in the city have been uniformly converted into cafeterias with restricted dining, demonstrating the level of chaos in the area.

### Authoritative Discourse by Japanese Ethnological Research Circles: The War Aims of Japan and the United States Differ

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) Dr. Takada Yasuma, Director of the Japanese Ethnological Research Institute and an authority in the field of ethnology, recently authored an article entitled "The War Aims of Japan and the United States Differ," published in the "Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun." He pointed out that the United States' war aim is merely Roosevelt's attempt to conquer the world. His argument is quite insightful, and the gist is as follows: In today's war, the United States is indeed our most important opponent. But what exactly is the war aim of the United States? Even if one asks the American people, they will be at a loss for an answer. The United States already possesses the majority of the world's wealth and resources, and its national income is among the highest in the world. They have no need to seek anything further. Moreover, no country in the world would even consider invading the United States across vast oceans if it only had its understanding and assistance. Therefore, the United States has no reason to participate in the war, nor need it worry about foreign invasion. It is truly perplexing that the United States has ultimately been drawn into the vortex of war. Japan has no intention of harming the United States and sincerely hopes to gain its understanding. However, the United States has strongly provoked Japan and rashly initiated hostilities, which is truly a strange occurrence in the world. The American people are unaware of the reasons for the war between Japan and the United States and deeply feel that there should be reflection on this matter. If we observe calmly, we can discover that the reason for the United States engaging in war lies solely in Roosevelt's ambition to conquer the world. This is also the driving force behind the United States' waging war. Only if one is compelled to fight for national self-defense can it be called a just war and lead troops with dignity. However, today's war by the United States is for personal ambition and can be said to be without just cause. The intellectual class of the United States still does not understand the purpose of the American war. Some say they are fighting to uphold democracy. Roosevelt and Churchill also say that this war is not only a conflict between totalitarianism and democracy, but also a war between the two ideologies. As for whether what they say is true, there is obvious contradiction in the facts. If they want to outwardly express support for democracy, they should also uphold and implement democracy internally. But if one looks at the United States, is there not still a class system with barbaric customs? And are more than ten million Black people not still being treated inhumanely? Not only that, but its immigration laws actually violate democracy. Democracy is a system for realizing the freedom and equality of individuals, but the current immigration laws of the United States do not mention equality or freedom at all. Furthermore, has the United States also realized democracy in its economic organization? If we look at the United States since the global economic crisis, there have always been ten million unemployed people in the country. Although the US government has made various efforts to reduce the number of unemployed, it has had no effect. Until the outbreak of the war, the number of unemployed remained the same as before, and the major financial magnates in the country believe that the existence of unemployed people is a natural state of affairs. They still do not change their attitude of striving for profit. May I ask if the goal of democracy should be like this? What we should still not ignore is Roosevelt's dictatorial politics. After the outbreak of the war, he monopolized power in all aspects of politics, diplomacy, military affairs, and economy, almost implementing complete dictatorship. In order to realize his personal ambitions, he did not hesitate to draw all Americans into the war. Therefore, the American people themselves have no sense of war, but are driven by Roosevelt's ambition. This dictatorial politics is contrary to democracy. Furthermore, according to recent reports, the United States also said that they are fighting for self-preservation. This is even more absurd, because dreaming of dominating the world contradicts self-preservation and self-defense. Then what exactly is the United States fighting for? The motivation for American citizens to participate in the war is not entirely to obey Roosevelt's will; they only hope to develop as a group outwards as a country. They still deeply hope for the expansion of the country itself. In this sense, the idea of American imperialism can be said to be deeply rooted. Therefore, their blind obedience to Roosevelt is only to seek personal enjoyment, and for personal enjoyment, they attempt to seize world resources, ultimately threatening the survival and independence of the nation. How can this be called the way of freedom and equality?

### Germany and the Soviet Union Mobilize Fresh Troops for Reinforcement: Fierce Battles in the Upper Reaches of the Donets; Key City of Zevsk Captured by Germany; Soviet Offensive in the Orel Region Fails

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch) According to official Berlin news last night, General von Manstein's German forces launched a strong counteroffensive from Kursk and advanced towards the Donets River, capturing Zevsk (90 kilometers northwest of Kursk) and Tomarovka (approximately 15 kilometers west of Belgorod). German forces operating southeast of Kharkov have advanced to the upper reaches of the Donets River on a broad front in recent days and have crossed the river in several places. Over the past few days, Soviet forces have fiercely attacked Chuguyev, a key point approximately 30 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, in an attempt to drive out the German forces. However, the city and railway station are still firmly held by German forces. The Soviet offensive at this location resulted in the annihilation of the 62nd Infantry Division, and its commander was captured. Reuters Moscow admitted that the Soviet forces in this sector of the front were gradually being threatened. It is said that the entire battle along the upper reaches of the Donets River has now reached a critical stage. Both sides are engaged in heavy fighting, but the vast area is desolate, making it difficult to transport supplies to the rear of the Soviet lines. Yesterday, German mechanized reinforcements and aircraft launched a fierce attack on the narrow area southeast of Kharkov. Soviet reserves have also been moved closer to the main battle area, and the fighting is intensifying. The Soviet side is waiting for the ice on the Donets River to melt, hoping to reduce the German pressure. The German forces are currently concentrated in certain districts, and the German forces in one of these districts forced the Soviet forces to retreat to new lines in the past 24 hours. A major battle for a certain key city is now underway. The German forces are concentrating all their efforts at this point in an attempt to break through the Soviet defenses. German forces in another district launched an offensive with two large columns of tanks yesterday, it is said. According to another British report, General von Manstein is now deploying some of Germany's most elite soldiers in an attempt to cross the middle reaches of the Donets River. The outcome of the battle there is expected to be decided within 48 hours, it is said. Furthermore, news from Berlin last night stated that after the German forces captured Belgorod, they continued their offensive around the city on Friday, repelling strong Soviet resistance and attacking the small town of Tomarovka west of Belgorod. Before the fall of the city, Soviet forces launched several counterattacks, which were all repelled, resulting in the loss of 65 tanks. German forces to the north continued their offensive in the Kursk area and captured Setsk after fierce street fighting. At the same time, the Red Army continued to launch large-scale attacks in the Orel region, south of Vyazma, and at Staraya Russa south of Lake Ilmen, repeatedly attacking the strong German defenses despite suffering heavy losses, but achieving nothing. The German High Command announced yesterday that the Soviet losses in the battles around Kharkov since February 13 amounted to over 54,000 dead, 20,000 captured, and the Red Army also lost 1,410 tanks, 3,372 artillery pieces, and 3,045 various heavy infantry weapons.

Somewhere on the Soviet border, 21st (Havas dispatch) The focus of today's Eastern Front is still in the south, with German forces intensifying pressure along the Kursk-Voroshilovgrad line. The Red Army hopes that the weather will warm up, bringing the fighting to a standstill. Yesterday, German armored forces continued to launch offensives, reaching the upper reaches of the Donets River, and crossing the river in several locations to the south. The Soviet side also acknowledged that the Red Army had lost an important position in the Donets River basin. Fierce fighting is still ongoing in the Chuguyev area. German forces are advancing towards the city of Kupiansk. To the north, after German forces captured the city of Belgorod, they also cleared the Soviet-held salient in the Lebedin area and captured the Tomarovka station on the Belgorod-Krolevets railway. According to a Moscow Radio broadcast, the battle on the Donets River has reached its peak, with both sides mobilizing large numbers of fresh troops for reinforcement. The number of German infantry and armored vehicle personnel is far greater than that of the Red Army, and they are constantly advancing, encountering resolute resistance from the Red Army. Semi-official Soviet sources acknowledged that German forces also have air superiority over the front lines, but the Soviet side also has reason to be optimistic, as the ground ice and snow have begun to melt, turning the ground into a sea of mud, and after the rivers thaw, the ice floes are drifting with the current, and natural obstacles have reappeared. However, the German forces have already crossed the Donets River, preventing the Red Army from digging trenches on the riverbank, and the railway between the Don and Donets rivers was destroyed by the German forces before their retreat, making it more difficult for the Soviet Union to concentrate its forces. In the Zevsk-Kursk area, the German forces are continuing to exert pressure, forcing the Red Army to abandon Zevsk, thus removing the threat posed by the Red Army to the cities of Bryansk and Orel.

### Continuous Heavy Rains; Situation Quiet on the Tunisian Front; German Forces Capture Important Hill in the North; Supply Line of the British First Army's Left Wing Cut Off

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas dispatch) Due to continuous heavy rains on the Tunisian front, the area has become a sea of water, so military operations on the front have stalled, and even air force activity is impossible. German war reports state that the entire Tunisian front is quiet, and that German aircraft bombing the port of Tripoli were very successful. According to Allied Command Headquarters, Tunisia is extremely quiet today, and the British Eighth Army is currently consolidating its positions.

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency dispatch) According to news from Berlin last night, German forces in northern Tunisia captured Hill 474 on Friday, despite adverse weather conditions, cutting off the main force of General Anderson's British First Army from its only supply port on the Mediterranean coast in Tunisia, Tebaga. The supply route from Madoubi (approximately 75 kilometers southwest of Bizerte) to Tebaga is now controlled by German forces, and Black Point (approximately 75 kilometers northeast of Tebaga), including Hill 474, is now in German hands. German forces continued to advance westward after overcoming strong British resistance on Friday, capturing several important positions of the British First Army despite the bad weather. With the British vehicle supply route between Tebaga and Madou now controlled by German forces, the left wing of the British First Army cannot obtain direct supplies from this only port held by British forces in Tunisia. This is the final victory of the Axis offensive aimed at driving the British forces out of Bizerte and Tunis. In this attack, the Axis forces have captured Cape Serrat, Black Point, Settnan, and Tamura. According to a United States reporter dispatch from General Eisenhower's headquarters last night, American forces in the Gafsa region of central Tunisia are encountering strong resistance from Axis forces in the El Guettar Mountains. Axis artillery and infantry are firmly entrenched in pre-built positions, and a fierce battle is expected soon. Heavy rain has made the battlefield muddy, with depths ranging from three inches to two feet, making it almost impossible for tanks to move. As for the situation in southern Tunisia, the British forces under General Montgomery attempted to break through the Axis defenses in the Mareth Line area on Wednesday but failed, and the situation has been quiet since Friday. No changes in positions were reported by either side last night.

### German Submarines in the Atlantic Attack British Convoy; Relentless Pursuit for Five Days and Nights; Seventeen Ships Sunk

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency dispatch) A spokesman for German Naval High Command Admiral Dönitz stated yesterday that German submarines had sunk a large number of ships in a convoy in the Atlantic, based on prior experience. After the convoy departed from England, it was detected by German submarines, which then alerted other submarines to prepare for an attack. On the night of March 16, German submarines broke through the outer defenses of the enemy fleet and attacked its ships, sinking twelve of them totaling 70,000 tons and severely damaging four others. The next day, the four damaged ships also sank. The remaining ships, seeing the situation was unfavorable, sped up in an attempt to escape, but the German submarines continued to pursue them relentlessly for five days and nights until they ran out of torpedoes. In this operation, German submarines also sank a British destroyer, it is said.

### Japan-U.S. Air War Roundtable (3): From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods

The tragedy born from a lack of aviation knowledge requires a preparedness and determination to fear nothing.

Reporter: It doesn't matter when they come, tragedies won't happen, there must be sufficient preparation and strong determination. If this continues, with such tense emotions...

Bennet: That means being fearless!

Okada: Thinking about the other extreme is also dangerous. At the same time, negligence is also dangerous. It is the duty of those in charge to make people clearly understand the correct standards and objective requirements. For example, after the air raid on April 18th last time, various reactionary rumors spread, and all sorts of opinions were heard. If you analyze this situation, you can see that the lack of aviation knowledge led to speaking without limits. This is the only reason for the reactionary rumors. For example, the concept of aircraft speed is almost imagined as something out of mythology. Furthermore, the aircraft's range is exaggerated, simply lacking common sense. As a result, all sorts of imaginations become popular, leading to self-confusion and panic. Although our country has air defense propaganda, we should instill more aviation knowledge and aircraft knowledge into the public, otherwise, they will not understand the true air defense belief. To take an example before our eyes, during the last air raid, some people said that the planes flew divinely, but this was not divine, but rather flying at around 500 kilometers per hour. This is not economic speed, it is flying at combat speed. It's like looking at distant mountains from a train. They don't even have this kind of common sense, so they say "divine" and "leisurely." If they understood a little more scientific knowledge, after seeing it with their own eyes, and had some common sense about the speed of the aircraft, they wouldn't talk nonsense. Just saying, "be determined, be decisive, be calm" doesn't work. Therefore, there will no longer be extreme fear. This is really like deceiving children. It is also an unscientific idea. I believe the prerequisite is to infuse more aviation common sense.

Oonishi: For example, if an airplane is flying towards you, it would be good to know where it usually drops bombs to fall near you; but when the airplane drops bombs, they think it will fall near them. This is because they lack common sense about airplanes dropping bombs. Airplanes fly over your head, but the bombs dropped will never fall on your head. Without this common sense, no matter where the bombs are dropped, they always feel like they will fall on them.

Okada: That's how it feels when you watch. When it's flying toward your head, you don't think that way. This type of angle, this type of common sense, is really lacking.

Oonishi: Everyone says it's right above them, but there's only one point directly above.

Matsuura: The human eye has illusions.

Abe: This kind of knowledge must be instilled in the public.

Oonishi: Generally speaking, they mostly know that if a bomb lands near them, it will land near them. Bombs dropped while flying sideways will not land near them. Bombs dropped while flying directly towards them at a certain angle may land in their location. Where I live, the most worrying thing is the lack of shelters. Where can you go to be safe? There isn't such a place. Where I live, is it safe to go into the forest? That's not necessarily safe. If there's a reliable shelter to hide from air raids, everyone would be calm and not panicked, but we don't have this kind of air raid shelter. Some people dig air raid shelters in their own homes, but they don't reach a truly safe level. Safe air raid shelters are almost non-existent in private residences. Whenever there is a drill, the problem is always where to evacuate. Because there is no absolutely safe place, the evacuation location is also not necessarily safe, and gathering many people in the shelter means that bombs may fall there. Therefore, safe and solid air raid shelters are urgently needed, and at the same time, these safe air raid shelters should not be too far from the people, so panic and confusion will never occur. However, this is probably the case everywhere in Tokyo.

Okada: The way to turn danger into safety is to avoid concentrating in one place as much as possible.

Oonishi: Logically speaking, it is a dangerous thing to gather children and the elderly together under a banner, and to drag the sick and injured to this place.

Abe: If you stand in an open field in a park, bomb fragments will not hit you if the bomb lands far away. If you lie in a depression, it is also not dangerous if the bomb lands at a considerable distance. That is to say, lying on the ground and not gathering in one place, but dispersing separately, can achieve a near-absolute level of safety.

Oonishi: I think my house will not be hit by a bomb.

Abe: It is safer to live in a house with a place separated by a mat. It's very dangerous for everyone to be together.

How to Evade Air Raids? A Japanese-Style Guidance Method is Needed.

Reporter: It seems that the best way to evacuate is to disperse separately and escape to a suitable place.

Abe: So-called evacuation is preparing to deal with the fire caused by incendiary bombs, the strongly harmful explosions of poison gas bombs, etc., before the bombs are dropped. This is the only spirit of wartime evacuation.

Okada: Because an airplane flies over your head for at most ten minutes, lying down in a nearby ditch, or leaning against a cement wall, etc., but the best way, I think, is to lie down in a nearby place. During the air raid on April 18th last time, those who lay down were spared, and of course, we must attribute this to the propaganda of methods for evading air raids. This kind of lying-down training is very necessary. For example, women clearly knew that lying down was right, but because they were not trained, they were killed by bomb fragments. There were also people who were spared when a bomb exploded seven meters in front of them, and there were people who saved their lives by crawling under a ping-pong table. There was an example of a child hiding behind the back of a water tank and turning danger into safety. Conversely, there were people who were killed by fragments of anti-aircraft fire while standing. During recent training, there has been a great deal of debate about evasion. They say that there is no need to create an evasion area, that evasion is incompatible with the Japanese nature, that it is a cowardly act, that Japanese people want to risk going out to put out fires, to rescue people in a hail of bullets. Evasion is like not being a firefighter, and going to an air raid shelter. This kind of statement is wrong, because in times of war, even during an assault, there must be temporary cover and concealment before moving forward, and because cover and advance is the basic principle of an assault, there are firefighters who still refuse to leave the evasion area even when the enemy plane has flown far away. There's really no way to deal with this. Staying in the evasion area for two hours means that nothing else can be done. These problems are very difficult to correct just right. When an emergency alarm is issued, enemy planes should arrive in about fifteen minutes, but sometimes the enemy planes do not arrive for more than an hour after the emergency alarm. Therefore, a lookout is sent, and only when the lookout sees the enemy planes flying over the city and issues an air raid alarm do they go to the evasion area, and then after bombs fall everywhere, they leave the evasion area to put out fires. There are times when things don't go well, and some people even say, "I misjudged last time, next time I will look carefully no matter what."

Bennet: Regarding evasion, if it is not particularly emphasized, when simply emphasized in a normal way, it will not produce effective results, and evasion is a momentary thing of about one minute, so this point is very difficult for the Japanese to achieve.

Oonishi: They all think, "How regrettable it would be if others saw it and I didn't see it." They also hold a contemptuous view of cowardice.

Okada: Therefore, there must be a guidance method that suits the Japanese people. Furthermore, things like anti-aircraft fire fragments are also quite dangerous, so when anti-aircraft guns are firing, they should also evade slightly.

Fujita: Anti-aircraft fire fragments are also quite dangerous?

Oonishi: It's dangerous if you don't wear a steel helmet.

Okada: Therefore, people who want to move freely in the anti-aircraft artillery position must evade. I once went to Songbing Fourth National Elementary School to observe evasion training. Because it is a densely populated area, the principal enthusiastically led all the faculty and students in training, and the results were very good. Elementary school students all carry cushions. They fasten this cushion to their side with buttons, and when the air raid alarm sounds, they put it on their head. Then they crawl under the table. If they are on the playground, they disperse, and then use their hands to block their ears and eyes. This is the formal method.

Fujita: Block with hands?

Okada: Of course, block with hands. Because ruptured eardrums or injured eyes would be terrible, so you have to do it this way. This doesn't require a lot of work. After blocking, immediately take it down to put out fires.

Fujita: Is it done this way after the order is given?

Okada: When the lookout tower shouts "Enemy planes flying over the city," do it this way. This is because the children of the national elementary school cannot go home when the air raid alarm is issued, and if they are outside for two or three hours to evade the alarm, the parents are also very worried, so this training is a completely appropriate method. Or, part of them are advised to go home. If you don't do it this way, sometimes it doesn't make sense. Especially the Japanese people are particularly protective of children. If children are injured, it will still shake people's hearts very much.

Fujita: Children's affairs are the most difficult to handle.

Okada: It's really difficult to handle. Adults being injured does not affect people's hearts like children, so you must think of a proper evasion method for children.

### Thirtieth Ration Distribution: Shortage of Rice Funds to be Supplemented Next Period

The contracted rice shops in the Public Concession and French Concession have prepared the 30th ration of household food. Starting yesterday, it is distributed with rice purchase certificates and flour certificates. The total is two and a half "sheng" of white rice (including domestic Du rice, Wuhu Xian rice, and foreign rice), priced at 7.5 yuan, which is slightly more expensive than the previous period by 5 "jiao" per "sheng." The total is one catty and four taels of second-grade flour, and four taels of third-grade flour, priced at 3.3 yuan. Although the quantity is reduced by four taels compared to the previous period, the price is the same. The validity period of the above 30th rice flour certificate is until March 30th. Overdue certificates will be voided and cannot be reissued. As for the contracted rice shops, they were notified yesterday by the Rice and Flour Allocation Office of the Public Works Department that the 30th period rice price is 368.5 yuan per bag of 101.5 kg, and the flour is still 92 yuan per bag of 49 pounds. However, the rice price when each rice shop received the sales order this time was 308.6 yuan per bag, so according to the new price, it should supplement 59.9 yuan per bag. The payment is limited to the next period to receive the sales order to supplement the payment.

### Rice Distribution to be Further Improved

Since the major food items in the Shanghai area are subject to strict control, and the authorities have gradually increased the allocation of household food, the food situation in this city has stabilized, and the psychology of food panic has weakened. As for the source of household food in this city, according to the Great Universal News Agency reporter, it can be optimistic. At present, the transportation between Shanghai and the neighboring rice-producing areas has gradually become convenient, and the authorities have also planned proper methods for the distribution of public rice. It can also be guaranteed that any private embezzlement and corruption of rice shops will be investigated and punished.

### Cigarettes in this City Implemented Rationing: All Procedures Being Expedited

The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association handled the distribution of tobacco in this city. It previously notified all cigarette shops, large and small, to register with the association for review. It is now known that the review has been completed. There are more than 300 approved general sales merchants, and more than 5,400 small retailers. As for retail prices, they cannot be announced because the prices of some cigarettes are still under discussion. The association is currently expediting all procedures. Once the procedures are completed, an official announcement will be published. Also, it is reported that the Huazhong Cigarette Distribution Association, in order to unify and concentrate the distribution of cigarettes, has completed the registration review of cigarette retailers throughout the city. There are more than 300 approved general wholesalers, and more than 5,400 small retailers. The general wholesalers are divided into A and B levels. They have respectively filled out contracts and paid the deposit to the designated tobacco industry bank within the specified time. The general wholesalers have convened a members' congress to discuss future business policies, and a concrete plan has been decided. Starting yesterday, the city's cigarette prices have begun to fall. The existing cigarette shops are striving to sell their inventory, fearing that once the rationed goods are issued, they must be sold at the limited price, and this inventory will inevitably lose money. Furthermore, foreign households have also emerged, so cigarette prices in recent days are expected to decline further.

### City Residence Permits: Use Carefully

Regarding the citizen residence permits, the Municipal Police Department has issued more than 1.4 million. There are still many who have not received them. Citizens who have already obtained the residence permit should use it carefully and avoid losing it.

### A Complete View of French Vietnam (5)

— A Vietnamese Person

(4) The Pearl of the French Colonies

Vietnam is "the Pearl of the French Colonies," a boast often made by France. If one examines all of France's colonies, it has long lost its original territories in the Americas. In Africa, it can be described as the "French Colonial World," but ultimately consists mostly of barren land. The most resource-rich of all is Vietnam!

Regarding Vietnam's industries, the most important is its abundant agriculture, with rice production holding the top position. In recent years, the mining industry has also seen some development. Additionally, the forestry and fishing industries cannot be overlooked. From an economic perspective, the distribution of industrial areas is as follows:

(1) Saigon Area: Refers to Cochinchina, Cambodia, Southern Laos, and the area south of Faifo in Annam. Except for fishing along the coast and in the southern swampy areas, the entire region is an agricultural zone, one of the world's largest rice-producing areas.

(2) Haiphong Area: Refers to the Tonkin Protectorate and the northern part of Annam. The main industries are agriculture, mining, and manufacturing.

(3) Central Annam Area: From Thuan An to Cape Faifo, this is primarily an agricultural zone. Cinnamon, sugar, tea, maize, etc., are exported from Tourane, but rice production is relatively low.

The fact that agricultural products account for 70% of Vietnam's exports indicates the significant role of agriculture in Vietnam's industry. The majority of agricultural products, such as rice, tobacco, cotton, and mulberry, are produced by locals using traditional methods, which are essentially Chinese production methods. In addition, there are modern enterprises managed by Europeans, such as rubber, coffee, and tea plantations. Other local products include maize, beans, soybeans, sweet potatoes, millet, sesame, peanuts, vegetables, fresh fruits, pepper, cinnamon, cardamom, star anise, opium poppy, medicinal pastes, betel nuts, sugarcane, coconuts, gutta-percha, kapok, hemp, ramie, lacquer, indigo, turmeric, etc. Modern agricultural enterprises also cultivate maize, sugarcane, castor beans, tung oil, and hemp in Tonkin; rice, pepper, and oil palm in Cochinchina; rice in Cambodia; and quinine in Laos.

Forests cover approximately 57% of Vietnam's total area, especially in the upper Mekong River region, abundant in ironwood and general timber, but much of it remains undeveloped. The situation is as follows (units in ten million kilometers):

Richly stocked forests 600
Moderately stocked forests 14,000
Richly stocked grasslands 12,300
Moderately stocked grasslands 140
Total 42,440

Among these, ironwood (used for shipbuilding and construction) is particularly abundant in Laos, along the upper Mekong River. The annual output is 20,000 to 100,000 cubic meters. It is transported down the river to Saigon and then exported to India, Hong Kong, France, Britain, Singapore, and other places. In addition, soft wood for match production is also produced in large quantities. Bamboo is an important construction material and furniture material for the locals. Rattan is particularly abundant in Annam and Tonkin, and is exported to Hong Kong and southern Chinese provinces, providing a significant source of local revenue. Wood and charcoal are managed by overseas Chinese and locals, and exported from Saigon and other places to Thailand, Hong Kong, and elsewhere.

Vietnam is bordered by the sea on three sides, and has large rivers and lakes inland, so aquatic products are very abundant, providing a major sideline for rural areas. It can be divided into marine and freshwater categories. (1) Marine fisheries, the most important areas are (A) the Tonkin coast, centered around Ha Long Bay, where Chinese fishermen have an advantage, coming from the Beihai and Hainan Island areas. Their catches are mostly sold in the Haiphong market. (B) The Annam coast, mainly in the northern part, has about 30,000 fishermen and aquatic product processors. The number of female workers is also about 30,000, and there are about 3,000 fishing boats. (C) The Cochinchina coast, centered on the east coast and the Gulf of Siam, where the fishermen are mostly overseas Chinese and locals. (D) The Cambodian coast, where about 3,000 Annam fishermen and overseas Chinese invest in aquatic product processing, with many small factories employing 1,000 to 4,000 francs. (2) Freshwater fisheries, due to the abundance of rivers and lakes, are very developed despite primitive fishing methods. The most prosperous area is Cambodia, with the Tonle Sap Lake, which covers 3,000 square kilometers at its lowest water level, serving as a natural fish farm.

Exports of marine and freshwater products have been increasing year by year, mainly to Singapore (71%), Hong Kong (12%), and China, Thailand, and other places.

Agriculture accounts for 70% of Vietnam's exports in the form of food, which is one of the most significant results of French rule. From the beginning, their policy towards Vietnam was primarily aimed at creating a country supplying agricultural raw materials to satisfy the development of their own industry. However, even in agriculture, they have absolutely not promoted modernization, striving to maintain primitive agricultural production methods. As a result, agriculture, forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries remain in the primitive economic stage, and farmers live in poverty.

Next, Vietnam's important resources are minerals, especially known for the high quality and abundant reserves of anthracite coal. Currently, the larger-scale production includes coal, tin, tungsten, gold, and zinc. In addition, there are also iron, antimony, phosphate, rock salt, talc, etc., being developed.

Fuel minerals, i.e., various coal mines, occupy a relatively important position in Vietnam's industry, centered around Tonkin, which mainly supplies anthracite and lignite. The anthracite, also known as Hong Gai coal, is found in nine anthracite mines near Dong Trieu along the coast of Ha Long Bay, with two each of bituminous and lignite mines. The annual output is around 2 million tons. In 1939, exports amounted to 1.57 million tons, worth 9.9 million Vietnamese piasters, mostly sold to Japan, China, and the Philippines, Thailand, Singapore, Hong Kong, etc.

The main metallic minerals are zinc and tin. Tin mines are famous in Tonkin and Laos. The former is developed by the Tonkin Tin Company and Wolfram Company, while the latter is developed by the Vietnamese Mining Exploration Company. A tin smelting company is located in Haiphong, and 99% of the product is exported to Singapore, with the remainder sold to France and Hong Kong.

In addition, tungsten production is 327 tons (1938), gold production is 312 kg (1937), iron production is 72,000 tons (1938), antimony production is 47 tons (1936), and phosphate production is 43,000 tons (1938). As for lead, silver, silica sand, talc, asbestos, gems, etc., there are no official statistics.

However, due to France's protectionist policies, although many French people are involved in management, the actual production volume and quality have not reached the proper level. Abundant resources are still abandoned in the wild. This can only be attributed to the lack of active interest among French entrepreneurs in developing Vietnam, and the difficult situation of France itself is also a very important reason. (End)

### First Division of the Western League: The Yi Army Leads, Lianyi Temporarily Ranked Second, and Donghua is Third

The First Division of the Western League football league has entered its second round. Yesterday, four matches were postponed due to wet playing fields. Jia Youliang, a player from the Donghua team, was injured in his right eye due to excessive tension during the Tongren Fuyuan Cup charity match and left the field immediately to receive medical treatment. It is said that the injury is minor and there is no cause for concern. In the recent situation in the First Division, the Yihai Army still holds the top spot, with six wins, two draws, and one loss. The only team that can compete with the Yi Army is Lianyi. Donghua is ranked third, although the points difference is only one point, the hope of winning the championship is slim. Lianyi has one more match, so the points ratio is actually equal to the Yi Army. If the points are equal at the end, there is hope for a final to determine the championship. If Lianyi can win every game, their future prospects are limitless. The First Division championship may return to the Chinese. However, most of the Yihai Army's strong players have left, and Lianyi still has the hidden danger of Donghua. If they unfortunately lose to Donghua, all their previous efforts will be in vain, creating an absolute advantage for the Yihai Army, and the future of the Chinese will be bleak. The fourth-place Jewish Portuguese Chamber of Commerce is temporarily ranked fifth. St. Francis has not been very successful in the league, ranking sixth. Sokol has lost repeatedly and is at the bottom. The Jiaozhou Park has been scheduled to stop using the playing field starting on April 1st, and the authorities are very distressed. In addition to trying to resolve the issue, they are also looking for another venue to ensure a satisfactory conclusion.

Yesterday's newspaper was released at 7:20 PM.

### Economic News

After the abolition of the permit system for the movement of important materials in the Shanghai area, the use, manufacturing, and sale of all materials are now under the autonomous control and regulation of the Sino-Japanese trade associations and existing organizations established in the spring. To ensure the sound operation of the regulatory mechanisms of these associations, the relevant authorities are currently studying specific measures, and a proper solution is expected to be finalized by next week at the latest.

Translated Commentary

### New Policy and the Responsibilities of Economists

The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association has been born. China's autonomous economic control can gradually progress from now on, and its control system is expected to achieve further success. However, we are also reminded that the responsibilities of Chinese economists are becoming increasingly important. This time, the ability to establish a wartime economy and resolve wartime livelihood issues through autonomous regulation by private economists demonstrates the vision and strength of Chinese economists, and the wise and decisive decision of the Chinese and Japanese authorities is commendable.

Chinese economists must also understand the intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, adapt to the needs of military and civilian life, and strive for complete success. This is the responsibility of Chinese economists, and the operation of the Control Association should also be approached from this perspective. These matters are well-known to informed individuals in China, especially economists with broad perspectives. However, among some people in the financial sector, there are still those who do not fully understand and believe that it is premature, or hold misunderstandings. Some consider the new policy to be a move towards liberal economics, some believe it is a precursor to restoring the pre-Greater East Asia War state, and some believe it is a reaction against the control system. Such absurd and unfounded misconceptions are rampant among merchants. Therefore, the current major issue is to dispel these fallacies and misconceptions from the economic sector, so that the public can understand the nature and direction of the new policy, as well as the true intentions of the Chinese and Japanese authorities.

The goal of the new policy is to achieve the military needs related to the Chinese economy, while also rationally resolving livelihood issues. It should be noted that adopting autonomous control methods is the most effective and reasonable approach. If this fact can be clearly understood, all misunderstandings about the new policy will naturally dissipate, and the hesitation towards joint ventures and cooperation with the Japanese side can also be resolved. Chinese economists must understand that only by cooperating with the Japanese side can the wartime economic problems and livelihood issues be fundamentally resolved.

As the new policy is implemented, the possibility of cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese people will also increase. True cooperation and equal conditions can be achieved.

Japanese economists, taking advantage of the opportunity of the new policy's implementation, are prepared to abandon all privileges, which is a symbol of their initial enthusiasm for cooperation. Japanese economists are now making their best efforts to adapt to the new policy. If the Chinese side distorts these facts and is misled by rumors, they will inevitably regret it in the future. At the same time, the Japanese side should also consider the overall situation and strive to achieve cooperation between the people to complete the rear area task of promoting the Greater East Asia War.

### Various Trade Associations Ordered to Register Inventory

To assist in the handling of material movement matters and to promote the welfare of the trade, the city's trade associations have been ordered to register the inventory of their respective industries, and the deadline is set for the 23rd of this month. All member merchants can obtain the required inventory registration forms from the relevant trade associations between 9:00 AM and 12:00 PM, and between 2:00 PM and 4:30 PM daily, and submit them to the associations within the deadline. The associations will then compile and submit them to the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association for record-keeping. Those who hesitate or conceal information will not be entitled to the right to issue transport permits in the future. The registration items are as follows: (1) Name of goods, (2) Quantity, (3) Place of origin, (4) Storage location, (5) Purchase price, (6) Name of the merchant, (7) Detailed address, (8) Date of storage, (9) Telephone number, (10) Name of the manager or person in charge, (11) Intended use (whether for retail or transport to other areas), (12) Remarks. The trade associations have already notified their member merchants to comply and automatically suspend any movement of goods until the registration is completed.

### National Chamber of Commerce Control Association Decides on Important Cases Regarding the Movement of Goods Within the City

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association held a joint provisional meeting of directors and supervisors the day before yesterday (20th) to discuss the issue of the movement of goods within the city and the issue of exporting and importing non-controlled goods. With the guidance of Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce at the meeting, a satisfactory solution has been reached. The association's work has been extremely tense since its inception. Yesterday (21st), although it was Sunday, the responsible personnel still worked as usual. Chairman Tang also convened a meeting with the Secretary-General, secretaries, and relevant responsible personnel to discuss all work progress issues. It is reported that the association will move into the building at 984 Avenue Haig next week. The full text of the association's telegram to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce regarding the resolutions on the movement of goods is recorded below.

Telegram to Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce in Nanjing: This association convened a provisional joint meeting of directors and supervisors today. As the issue of material movement is of great importance, we specially invited Vice Minister Yuan to attend and provide guidance. The relevant proposals and resolutions are listed as follows: (1) How should we handle the fact that all goods in Shanghai can be moved freely according to the government's issued crackdown regulations? (2) Some trade associations have sent letters stating that since the suspension of material movement, goods that are not under control have also been prohibited from moving. They have requested assistance to alleviate the difficulties of merchants. How should we handle this issue? Resolution on both cases: The movement of goods within the Shanghai area, except for those stipulated in the crackdown regulations that must wait for notification after registration is completed before they can be moved, all other goods are allowed to be moved freely. Please notify the relevant parties. (3) How should we handle the issue of moving goods out, except for those stipulated in the crackdown regulations that require permission from this association? Resolution on this case: For goods outside the scope of the crackdown regulations, this association will temporarily not handle applications for import and export until the government issues other measures. (4) How should we determine the quantity of various goods that must be approved by this association for import and export as stipulated in the crackdown regulations? Resolution on this case: (A) Before the new measures are decided by the Material Control Review Committee and issued by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce to this association, we will temporarily handle them according to the original method. (B) Before the organization of this association is fully completed, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce will send personnel to handle the matter on behalf of the association using the association's permission seal. We are reporting this first and hope to have it put on record. Please also notify the relevant authorities to handle the matter accordingly. This association also intends to make a formal announcement immediately for the benefit of merchants. We will report other cases in accordance with regulations. Chairman Tang Shoumin of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association respectfully bows."

### Trends in Essential Goods

Since the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association in Shanghai, the control of materials has gradually strengthened. Sugar and charcoal have been rationed since the 11th. In the future, the control of all essential goods for stabilizing people's livelihoods will gradually be strengthened. Here is a classified explanation of the control of livelihood materials.

Cigarettes

The control of cigarettes has been in place for more than three years, but it cannot be said to be in the most perfect state. Various organizations have been reformed in the meantime, but all have failed. At the end of last year, the China Tobacco Distribution Association, the previous control organization, was dissolved, and a Sino-Japanese joint venture, the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association, was established to correct the shortcomings of past control. Rational control in the future is very promising. The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association was established in October of the 15th year of Showa. Its task was to prevent the flow of cigarettes into enemy areas, and to regulate sales and prices between Shanghai and the interior.

However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the tobacco industry, which had been monopolized by Britain and the United States, was transferred to Japanese management and controlled by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association. The Chinese side still entrusted the former general agent, Yongtaihe, to handle the matter. The Japanese side managed retail sales through the Tobacco Retail Trade Association. Because of the changing economic situation, cooperation in production was urgently needed, so the merger of Chinese and Japanese tobacco merchants was realized.

In January of last year, the China Tobacco Innovation Company was established to absorb and merge six major Japanese cigarette companies: Toyo Leaf Tobacco, East Asia Tobacco Innovation, Xingya Tobacco, North China Tobacco, and Wuhan Huacheng Tobacco. The Chinese side also established a Chamber of Commerce Tobacco Association Office to be responsible for controlling production and sales, negotiating prices, and jointly purchasing raw materials.

Although there was such an organization for production and sales, the sales situation remained chaotic, and the black market continued. This was because the two sides of production and sales could not be fully connected. At the same time, the failure to thoroughly control sales on the Chinese side was also a reason. Although the Japanese side tried its best to maintain the official price, it instead created speculation in the concession area, and prices continued to rise.

This situation could not be allowed to spread, of course. In order to establish a consistent production and sales control mechanism and maintain official prices, the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association was dissolved in December of last year, and the Sino-Japanese joint venture, the Central China Tobacco Innovation Distribution Association, was established to plan all production and sales matters across the board.

Another point of concern for everyone is how much the number of Chinese tobacco firms will be reorganized and reduced. The reason is that if these tobacco firms cannot be controlled, then the new order in the tobacco industry may not be hopeful. The Central China Tobacco Distribution Association plans to reorganize and reduce it to two-thirds of its current number.

### Go Away, Echo!

— Someone

(1)

I have been sent back to my hometown.

The exhausting, bone-wearying labor, the shadowy and strange, foul-smelling air, are luxuries I can no longer afford. The turbulent and unstable overall situation, and the difficulty in obtaining food, have also determined my fate. The owner said to me, "You are no longer needed here, go back home!"

Three years of diligent learning, ending like this! I have already lost two fingers, a man with incomplete fingers! Must I bear this terrifying, crippled hand, and return home bitterly to face my fellow villagers?

I still remember the first time I entered the factory. Mr. Lian, a fellow villager and elder, was then a runner in the factory. He led me into the factory, incessantly telling me many of the factory's rules on the way. I listened, understanding some and not understanding others; watching his gray-white bearded chin, moving up and down as if something was rolling in his mouth, the spittle flying everywhere, I found it very amusing. But one sentence stuck in my mind, and I still remember it to this day:

"Ah Gui, you are no longer a child. When you get there, you must learn well. Your entire career is here!"

I am no longer a child! Although still young.

(2)

After the apprenticeship ceremony, the factory owner (who was also my teacher), called over a person and said, "He Cheng, take him to the machine room and don't bully him!" He was a boy a year older than me, also an apprentice, thin and agile. According to him, the master never entered the machine room, and wouldn't even do anything himself; apprentices had to practice and learn on their own.

The factory was divided into two departments: flashlight and battery. In the flashlight department, there were six workers, specializing in making the flashlight body and parts. Assembling the lights was contracted out to others. In the battery department, there was one engineer, and two assistants, who were his students, specializing in helping him handle chemical matters. Other work was all done by female workers. They were all paid by the day and did not live in the factory. There were four apprentices in the factory, including me, all children of about the same age; He Cheng was considered the most senior. The chubby Yuan He, and "Youtiao" He Chun, worked upstairs in the battery department, while He Cheng and I were downstairs in the machine room. Ah Chun liked to buy Youtiao (fried dough sticks) for others, hence his strange nickname. (It also symbolized his thin and long body!)

Due to my peculiar accent, they would laugh whenever I spoke, and sometimes even deliberately asked me to say tongue-twisting words. Soon, I also got a nickname, called "Little Jiangbei."

The number of machines was very small. It was only later that I could identify what a lathe, planer, shaper, etc., were. The huge flywheel, driven by a belt, spun incessantly, making a "whooshing" roar, interspersed with the clanging sounds of the machines; "Bada bada," crisp and rapid. I saw several dark, rough hands moving between the machine dies. The upper die came down, the hand left the lower die, the upper die bounced back up, and the hand inserted another copper piece into the die. Then the stamped copper pieces poured out from behind the die, one by one, gathering in a basket. He Cheng told me that if the upper die hit your finger, it would surely be crushed into a cake; I couldn't help but break into a cold sweat. But seeing the workers so calm and at ease, even having the mood to joke with their neighbors, I couldn't help but be amazed. Their hands were as if they had eyes.

At first, I only did some simple work: passing tools, collecting scraps, counting numbers, and sometimes buying cigarettes for the workers, buying wine or other things for the "Young Master" – he was the factory director's nephew, also the highest-ranking employee in the factory, in charge of accounting and also supervising the work. People called him "Young Master." – These, it was said, also had to be learned.

Gradually, I was also able to hold scissors and pliers. He Cheng said that everything had to be tried out on your own; no one would teach you. Therefore, I wanted to try everything myself, seeing how purely and skillfully they worked with the machines, and how accustomed they were, I couldn't help but envy them. Someone on the shear machine went to urinate, so I took his place while he was away; this was not difficult, as long as the copper or iron sheet was aligned with the template, and you stepped on it. Look! I could do it too, just a little slower. When the person returned, he didn't blame me, but looked at what I had done and said, "If you like stepping, then do it for me." So I worked for him, stepping until my legs ached and I complained, but he just smoked and smiled to the side.

He Cheng was much more capable than me. He could replace anyone in anything, except for repairing the machine dies (that was naturally the job of the machinist). Once he asked me to try stepping on a mold. I was afraid of crushing my fingers, but he laughed at my timidity, and told me to first remove my hand from the mold before stepping on it. The principle was similar to the shear machine. I tried to do it slowly, and it worked.

(4)

Suddenly, the situation changed, external routes were cut off, and the factory's products could not be sold to other places, so it could only reduce its scale. Relying solely on the local area, honestly speaking, a flashlight factory could hardly stand. Gradually, workers were laid off, and the flashlight department stopped work; then the engineer resigned, and the battery department also shut down. The factory was then left with only a few apprentices, very quiet and still.

Soon, the factory changed its direction, manufacturing paper clips; because they had a market. The factory director's mind was very quick; as long as he heard there was a profit to be made, he would do it. It was also very grand, as he claimed to be maintaining the livelihood of the workers; but in reality, it was hard on us apprentices, because not many workers were added, but the apprentices were assigned to enough places of need: we had to do everything, day and night without rest.

Fortunately, in this hectic and arduous work, I learned a lot. The "Young Master" no longer thought my work was not up to par, and only urged me to do it faster.

In less than two months, the market for paper clips narrowed, and the factory switched to making copper caps; those were the necks of small light bulbs (small light bulbs). Because of the enthusiastic orders, day and night shifts were started up again. And so my misfortune came.

Copper caps, those cylindrical little things, had to be punched out one by one from the machine. After the things were shaped, they had to be placed one by one on the mold to be embossed with line patterns, so the hand had to constantly enter and exit the mold to escape danger. In addition, because of the violent vibrations, the mold would often break, sometimes the upper die would not go down, and sometimes the upper and lower dies would bite together and not bounce up.

In order to save expenses, the factory only used two old machinists, and we had no salary. However, whether it was cutting, stamping, or tidying up, most of the work was done by us. The main responsibility of the two machinists was only to repair the molds and give guidance. So we were all exhausted, while they were free to chat and laugh.

Once, the machine I was stepping on broke down, and the two machinists were not around. The upper die was easily lifted up, but could not be stepped down. I looked at He Cheng. He was on my right, stepping very smoothly, and the caps slid into the basket one by one behind the machine. I coughed dryly and stepped down with all my might, but forgot to take my hand out. The upper die suddenly fell down. I only escaped with my right hand, and the pain made me faint. I only heard a commotion in my ear, and then I didn't know anything anymore.

I gradually regained consciousness and found that I was in the labor hospital, with He Cheng accompanying me.

The doctor said to me, "The index finger and thumb of your left hand are only missing a section, it doesn't matter." Doesn't matter? I am already a disabled person!

While lying in the loft, only He Cheng would occasionally take the time to comfort me.

"Why are you sad?" Seeing that I was always frowning, He Cheng asked, trying to comfort me.

"Is there anything more hateful than being disabled? How can I face people?"

"For us who learn crafts, losing a few fingers is a common thing. Those who haven't been injured aren't considered old machinists." He Cheng deliberately consoled me. Then he told me about several familiar machinists, all of whom had incomplete little fingers.

The wound gradually healed, and the new skin covered it, like two bald monk heads, round and smooth. The shortened two sections could no longer grow back.

Time is truly a painful comforter. Gradually, my feelings of regret were not as strong as they used to be, although seeing the two bald heads still made me feel bad.

What's done is done. I can only hope for the future, the near future, to become an outstanding machinist; look, the scar of the crippled finger is a sign of success! I can only think like this. So I immersed myself in work with a fiery heart again.

But the factory's closure was like a bolt from the blue, shattering my only glimmer of hope. Who should I hate? "This is your lifelong career, you must learn well!" The old voice was still ringing in my ears.

Go back home. My fate must not be in Shanghai.

### I Am Even Thinner

— Weng

The hour hand is pointing at six, and my colleagues have already gone home one after another. Finally, it should be my turn.

After arranging everything, I dragged my tired body and walked on my way home. The three bowls of thin porridge I had for lunch had long been digested in my stomach. On the road, I saw fragrant and crispy cakes, but my pockets were empty and I didn't have a penny on me, so I could only swallow my saliva, turn my head and continue walking forward.

"Mr. ×!" A familiar voice came from behind me, and I turned my head as if waking from a dream and looked back. It turned out to be one of my students.

"Mr. ×! How are you?" he came up to me and said.

I reluctantly relaxed my furrowed brow, gave a wry smile, and nodded, replying, "I'm okay."

Okay? Okay what? This question was spinning in my mind, and I couldn't think of anything good for a moment.

"Are you still at that school this semester?" he continued to talk to me.

Who knew that the stomach in my belly was grumbling.

"Yes," I replied weakly.

"I've now been admitted to ×× Middle School. Their tuition is really cheap, only half of yours. With your tuition so expensive, who can afford to go to your school. And..."

"—" I looked at him.

"Mr. ×, I haven't seen you for more than a month. How did you get even thinner?" he suddenly thought of this.

"—" I didn't speak.

"Are you sick? Mr. ×," he asked me again.

Thin! Yes, I'm thin, even thinner than last year. Am I sick? No, I'm not sick, my body is still very good, but how did I get thin? I don't know.

"No, I'm not sick," I said, shaking my head, "Maybe my hair is longer, making me look thinner."

My belly was rumbling and grumbling endlessly, so I continued:

"It's getting late, let's see you again. When you have time, come to our school to play."

"Goodbye, Mr. ×!" After saying that, he bowed.

We parted ways.

When I got home, my wife had already prepared the porridge and told me to eat. I quickly drank three bowls of the watery thin porridge.

After eating, I lay blankly on the bed, and my wife continued her needlework.

"Did the school pay you today?" she suddenly asked me this question.

"No!" I said weakly.

"Today is the end of the month, why haven't they paid you yet?"

"—"

"There's not a grain of rice left, what are we going to eat tomorrow?"

"Can't you go and settle your wages tomorrow? Settle your wages and buy some corn to cook some porridge," I said.

"The wages have already been settled. There's no more work on hand, how can I go and settle my wages again?"

I had nothing to say. I just connected my two eyebrows tightly.

"How did you get even thinner?" The question the student I had just met on the road asked, floated into my mind again.

Thinner, indeed much thinner than last year. When the last semester just started, my wife and I, with the little income we earned through hard work, could still manage to have a meal; but recently it's gradually become impossible, prices are soaring endlessly, but our income hasn't risen with it, it's just that little bit. As a result, in recent months, we haven't even been able to eat rice, we eat porridge every day, and the porridge is gradually becoming thinner.

It's another semester. Tuition has doubled, and I don't know if the salary can be doubled. Even if it's doubled, whether it's enough is still a problem; moreover, my wife's belly stubbornly refuses to behave, and I watch it grow bigger day by day. Counting the days, it's not far from the day the child is born. There's also the clothes on my body, which are so tattered that they can hardly be worn anymore.

This series of thoughts turned over and over in my mind, and I couldn't find a way to analyze them.

"Oh! What will we do when the child is born?" My wife paused for a while, seeing that I didn't say a word, and opened the conversation first.

I lay on the bed, silent all the time, staring at the light hanging on the ceiling. Suddenly the light gradually dimmed, I couldn't see the light clearly, my eyes were wet, and tears began to flow out, dripping onto the pillow after passing my cheeks.

My wife is going to give birth, and there are no old women in the family who can help and guide, so of course it's much safer to go to the hospital, but where is the money for the hospital expenses?

"Your summer gown is already so tattered that it's beyond repair, and you can't wear it anymore, are you going to make a new one?" Seeing that I didn't speak, she changed the subject.

"Pawn it," I said, continuing to maintain my silence, only planning in my heart.

A gown is indispensable, especially for teachers, it is even more indispensable.

Thinking and thinking, I couldn't find a way to solve this problem.

"I don't want to think about it anymore! Take off my clothes and go to sleep! Let's talk about it tomorrow!"

I said to myself, taking off my clothes and going to sleep.

### Spring Memories

— Sha Yun

Casually recalling the fragrance of early spring, this fragrance has the radish flavor of Tongqiao (Copper Bridge) in my hometown; I am afraid to think of the spring in my hometown, because I am afraid that I will see it again in my dreams:

Mother's loving eyes. Kites filling the sky above the ancient wall and in the fields, Mom, you are again at the foot of the sun, chatting with Aunt Li by the fence about a tragic story. In the spring night, I can still distinguish my mother's laughter, tonight is a good moon, Mom, are you reminiscing about the quiet bell sound in the ancient temple?

### In Praise of Color

— He Wen

In this universe, every color has its power, just as the poets say: "Color is something that can be seen, smelled, tasted, and heard!"

Not only can aesthetic poets find purity and light in white, and feel sorrow and pain in black, they can also hear the sound of harps in white, discover the sound of flutes in yellow, and see black, as if countless piano keys are dancing before their eyes.

If you are not colorblind, your life will at least be affected by pigments to some extent. Various beautiful or mixed colors can control your mood, even your soul; it can give you happiness, but it can also make you sad and disappointed!

A pessimistic person nearing the end of his life told people: in his environment, all he sees is a deathly gray-white: pale faces, gray-white hair, white walls, vast gray fields, gray-white light... So everything around him is dyed gray-white, and the bleak white becomes the cause of his melancholy.

When prisoners are sent to a dark prison, they will think that the whole world is dark, and their hearts will become increasingly cold and blurred.

Many unbearably vulgar colors often pollute people's souls, producing all kinds of crimes. Bright, beautiful, and dazzling colors are rippling, bright red lights, emerald green wine, light red rouge with a charming smell, and the dreamy clear yellow gold, sparkling silver white... dazzling people's hazy eyes, blinding their reason... So they do not hesitate to harm others, ruin their future days, and try to pursue intense colors, pursue the endless satisfaction of desires, pursue evil...

Young people have fallen, old people have despaired, criminals do not know repentance, and decadent people destroy themselves. This is all due to the temptation of color, the stimulation of color, and the bondage of color.

Some people love to find the power of life in color, the brilliant golden morning light makes people cherish their youth more, under the brightly colored banner, everyone will strive and cheer up; sky blue clothing makes people feel solemn; palaces painted in gold and vermilion make people feel magnificent, and colorful paintings, beautiful art, give us the ability to further recognize humanity's artistic creativity!

The world relies entirely on the melody of color, the harmony of color, bringing progress, and harmony among people relies on the harmony of color, the vibrancy of color, bringing warmth and passion!

We need pure pigments, which are the colors of truth and beauty. People love to appreciate all kinds of colors in nature, which are so simple and elegant, without the slightest bit of false rendering!

The azure sky, the vast white clouds, the green mountains, and the green water, are all as pure as virgins. Purple grapes, milky white lilacs, light red roses, are certainly the characteristics of the universe, but green grasslands and golden wheat fields are equally lovely. Facing the beauty of the universe, everyone is willing to give up all extravagant hopes and seek a simple world.

The pigments in the universe are matched so appropriately that there are never any errors or flaws, and they can inspire the wisdom of appreciators and admirers. Why does a black swallow have a red beak, why can red flowers be drawn out from the tender green leaves? These are all questions between the ordinary and the extraordinary.

In fact, everything in nature never contains mystery, you have to observe carefully and think patiently, and it will always give you various new inspirations.

The change of color dominates everything in the world, and the vibration of color controls the fate of mankind!

Everyone has a favorite color to represent their personality and temperament. Melancholy women wear plain clothes all year round, greedy merchants also love purple sauce color, insidious people often like gray-black, brave people pursue bright red, and upright people love white.

The colors needed by young people are completely different from those needed by old people. Young people can find vitality and life in color, while old people merge the pigments they come into contact with into a shallow state of mind!

I say: everyone's life will also reflect a color, some lives are red, blue, and some are gray, yellow, white, black...

Our lives cannot be without various pigments, but over-indulging in strong colors, having tasted the world's weariness, and losing the taste of true life. Not needing a bit of color will lead to lonely and empty days! Unable to understand the true meaning of life. Only those who know how to match and regulate pure pigments have a fulfilling life!

Because of the various pigments, we do not live in a monotonous world!

Editor's Note

We do not accept drafts written in classical Chinese, this is probably self-evident. Hopefully the two drafts written in classical Chinese, which are quite well-written, have their place too.
