### Weekly Review: The Psychological Great Wall

— Yoshida Toyo

No matter how intense the situation of the Greater East Asia War may change, its outcome will always lead to the victory of Asia. I am fully optimistic about this point. Because I know that as long as Japan strikes at the aggression of Britain and the United States, and upholds the true Asian spirit, more than half of the world's population will surely become Japan's backing. The combination of Japan's material civilization and the entire Asian nation, which fervently hopes for liberation, will constitute an unprecedented great force in world history. Japan's material civilization is a special civilization developed on the basis of Asian production methods. If Asian nations do not seek liberation, it is fine, but if they seek liberation, they will inevitably adopt a special form of material civilization in the process of their liberation. In addition, the so-called Asian spirit does not only mean that Japan stands on the position of an Asian member - in fact, this point is great enough - but also the respective spirit of resistance developed in the history of Asian nations. In other words, the spirit often uses material wealth to resist the forces of external domination, and the spirit is a constant desire to maintain its own independence and freedom.

Asians observe their own spirit through the self-action of the spirit, and take grasping the common body as a lifelong profession. In the process, Asians confronted the material civilization of Europeans and developed a profound and mysterious spiritual civilization. When it comes to Asian spiritual civilization, one immediately thinks of Confucius and Lao Tzu in China, Buddhism in India, or Shinto in Japan. However, the characteristics of Asian spiritual civilization are not satisfied with these established things, and take these things as stepping stones to leap to higher places. While leaping, they abandon these kinds of stepping stones and constantly implement new progress. But in addition, the spiritual progress that is not bound by anything cannot be known by logical analysis, but is a state of intuition that can be grasped by experience. What exactly is this spiritual state? Here, I will give a few examples to illustrate it.

The famous Greek philosopher Diogenes (412 B.C. - 323 B.C.) was actually born in Sinope (a city on the Black Sea coast of Turkey) in Asia Minor. He was called "Barrel Sage" because he was poor and homeless, so he lived in a barrel by the road. At that time, there was Alexander the Great, who was brave and warlike and conquered a vast territory. Through the introduction of his friend Aristippus, he wished to meet with Diogenes. Diogenes, who often lived in Athens, wrote a letter in response to this request, saying that if he wished to meet, he would like Alexander the Great to come to his residence in person. Let us temporarily look at the full text of his letter:

"Aristippus! Having read your letter, I know that King Alexander of Macedon is very willing to see me. It is your own business to add the title of King of Macedon to Alexander (for example, no matter what the Macedonians are), but you know that I am not a subordinate of anyone. If Emperor Alexander wishes to know me and my life, then please come to my place. And I think that going from Athens to Macedon and coming from Macedon to Athens are the same distance."

He had no fear of the power of Alexander the Great, who conquered the world, nor any humble attitude. Regardless of everything, he still lived according to his own desires and according to what he believed in, the free spirit unbound by any object, and vividly expressed in this short letter.

Later, Emperor Alexander met Diogenes in Athens. After Alexander the Great saluted Diogenes, he asked, "What do you want?" Diogenes only said one sentence to this question: "Do not stand in front of me." At that time, Alexander, who held the wealth and power of the whole world, finally felt like a beggar in front of Diogenes.

This kind of true mountain spirit that is not affected by external objects transcends the problem of life and death. This spiritual state can be said to be the culmination of Japanese Bushido. Japanese Kendo is a means to achieve this state of mind. Therefore, Japanese Kendo focuses more on the state of mind than on skills. This is the difference between Kendo and foreign Fencing.

The protagonist Miyamoto Musashi in the Japanese film "Duel at Ichijoji Temple" shown at the Da Hwa Grand Theater the other day is not a fictional character, but one of the characters who realized this spiritual state through Kendo. One of his senior disciples, Terao Kyumanosuke, was a retainer of the Hosokawa clan. One day, Hosokawa Mitsunao, the lord of the Hosokawa clan, said to Miyamoto Musashi, what is the spirit that can be attained through Kendo that cannot be shaken by any external object (Miyamoto Musashi called it "the body of rock")? Miyamoto Musashi said, "Then I will show you this spirit in reality." After saying that, he immediately called Terao Kyumanosuke over. Miyamoto Musashi sat next to Hosokawa Mitsunao and said to Terao Kyumanosuke, "By the order of the lord, Terao Kyumanosuke is ordered to commit seppuku here and now." At that time, the order of the feudal lord was absolute, and the vassal had to obey absolutely in any situation. When Kyumanosuke heard this, he said without hesitation, "I obey the order, and will commit seppuku in the adjacent room." After performing the salute as usual, he calmly walked out of the room. From beginning to end, Kyumanosuke's demeanor did not change at all, completely no different from usual. Musashi said to Mitsunao, "The attitude of Kyumanosuke that you are seeing now is 'the body of rock'." Mitsunao was greatly moved and summoned Kyumanosuke back, greatly praising the spirit cultivated by the sword. The spirit that obtains true freedom is liberated from the fear of death, which is the state of "regarding death as returning home."

Confucius also often sought the free spirit of self-control. Therefore, he attached great importance to his disciple Yan Hui, who possessed this spirit. Now, let us excerpt a passage about Yan Hui from "Historical Records and Commentaries":

"Yan Hui was a native of Lu, styled Ziyuan, thirty years younger than Confucius. Yan Hui asked about benevolence, and Confucius said: 'To subdue oneself and return to propriety is benevolence to all under heaven.' Confucius said: 'How virtuous is Hui! A basket of rice, a ladle of water, living in a humble alley, others cannot bear its hardship, yet he does not change his joy. Hui is like a fool, but when he retires and examines his private life, he is also sufficient to develop it. Hui is not a fool. When he is employed, he acts; when he is dismissed, he hides. Only I and you have this virtue.'"

Although Yan Hui was advised by Confucius to go out and become an official, he rejected this idea and was willing to live on a basket of rice and a ladle of water. Of course, if he had real political power, he would have practiced his way, but at that time, the politics of the various countries were very chaotic, and there was really no possibility for him to practice his way. Therefore, people generally say that Yan Hui "does not change his joy in a humble alley." In fact, he likes and loves the independence of the spirit.

Confucius also talked about the personality of his disciple Zilu: "To wear tattered hemp clothes and not be ashamed to stand with those who wear fox fur robes, it is Zilu!" This sentence can also express Zilu's free spirit that is not affected by external objects. Later, Zilu died in battle during the civil strife in the state of Wei. Zilu's attitude at that time also showed a free spirit that transcended life and death. Regarding this record, let us look at "Historical Records and Commentaries":

Speech by Director-General Okazaki

Looking Forward to Further Administrative Progress in the Future

Your Excellency Mayor Chen: and everyone present: Today, we are undertaking this epoch-making and important mission in the history of the Shanghai Public Concession. From today onwards, the Shanghai Public Concession Municipal Council will be headed by Your Excellency Mayor Chen and will be renamed the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality. I and my colleagues would like to say a few words here to express our infinite congratulations to Your Excellency Mayor Chen. Assisting the Republic of China in obtaining national freedom has been a long-standing wish of Japan. Today, China has completely restored the territorial and administrative rights of the Shanghai Public Concession, and it is our honor to participate in it. The spirit of friendship that has existed between China and Japan is aimed at common interests. Today, it is even more necessary for China and Japan to jointly undertake the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. Japan and its allies are now working hard to manage the post-war work at this stage. For China to fulfill its mission in East Asia, the complete independence and freedom of all its territories and administration is an absolute prerequisite. At this time, it is with heartfelt admiration that a statesman with the vision and foresight of Shanghai Mayor Chen Gongbo is in charge of the administration. Since I took office as Director-General, I have felt that my talent is light and my responsibility is heavy. Fortunately, I have received full cooperation and understanding from all parties, so that I have been able to handle difficult municipal administration smoothly without failing. I must also express my gratitude to everyone.

In the past, due to various reasons, the administration we handled could not be strongly implemented in all aspects, or there were a few that had not been resolved. It is hoped that under the leadership of Mayor Chen in the future, these will be strongly completed in a unified manner and achieve satisfactory results. At the same time, we also expect to expand the current administrative efficiency in the future to adapt to the local situation, and then engage in the development of highly administrative efficiency, so that the new administrative organs of commercial cities will be able to take economic administrative measures further than the previous Municipal Council.

Shanghai has experienced various difficulties in the past, and today it has finally completed the unification of the entire Shanghai administration. In the future, it will certainly not only be the largest commercial city in China. I am convinced that it will gradually prosper and develop and become an industrial, cultural, and political center.

Finally, I thank all the guests for taking the time to attend, and I express my infinite gratitude for all the assistance and cooperation you have given me in the past.

Mayor Chen's Reply Correcting the System Must Be Carefully Considered

Director-General Okazaki: Ladies and gentlemen: On the day that China participated in the Greater East Asia War, Japan first declared the abolition of extraterritoriality, the return of the exclusive concessions, and the return of the administrative power of the Public Concession. Later, it cooperated with the National Government to work on the diplomacy of the countries related to the Public Concession, and the friendly countries successively made the same declaration and signed it. Japan's original great goal has finally been completed today. At the beginning of receiving the Public Concession today, we should express our gratitude to Japan and pay our respects to the countries concerned.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Director-General Okazaki and the Chinese and foreign directors and staff of the Municipal Council, especially the Japanese staff, have maintained Shanghai's prosperity and established Shanghai's security in difficult and precarious times, so that the Public Concession of today can be handed over to China in its entirety. Their perseverance and enthusiasm are especially admirable to me.

In the future, I can only continue your perseverance and enthusiasm in accordance with my personal duties, and maintain the efficiency of the original organs. Although the regulations of the Public Concession in the past were not entirely in line with China's system, I am deeply convinced that the people of the wood will carefully consider and handle them. In the future, even if there are revisions, we will take into account China's laws and regulations on the one hand, and the local reality on the other hand, so as to integrate the spirit and facts into one and complete the organization of a great Shanghai in the East. However, in any case, the administrative efficiency will never be reduced, which I am deeply confident in.

Although the Municipal Council has now been abolished, Director-General Okazaki and the directors are all in Shanghai. I will consult with them at any time in the future, and I will not fail to live up to your hard work and assistance. Moreover, all the staff of the various institutions under the old Municipal Council, except for those who have resigned, will be continuously hired and employed by me. In the future, I especially hope that the municipal administration of Great Shanghai will continue to improve, so that millions of Chinese and foreign citizens can coexist and prosper in Shanghai, and their happiness will increase day by day.

### The Task of the Preparatory Committee is Completed: Burma Declared Independence Yesterday.

The Constituent Assembly Passes the Basic Law of National Organization. Ba Maw is the First National Representative and Prime Minister.

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) Burma's administrative head, Ba Maw, accepted the announcement by General Kawabe, the supreme commander of the Japanese Army in the Japan-Burma area, on the 1st at 10:00 am, abolishing military administration and dissolving the administrative government. In view of the fact that the task of the Independence Preparatory Committee has been completed, the committee was dissolved, and a Constituent Assembly was convened for new independence procedures. Therefore, the Constituent Assembly immediately selected 25 members of the Independence Preparatory Committee as members and established it. It convened at 11:00 am and elected U Set Win as chairman. It first declared that the Assembly was a parliament representing the will of the people. Then, in the presence of General Kawabe and Japanese military personnel, Ba Maw solemnly declared the independence of Burma with a solemn demeanor at 11:30 am. Immediately afterwards, the basic law of the national organization drafted by the Independence Preparatory Committee was reviewed and unanimously approved. Before the Burmese national constitution is formulated, the basic law can be called the temporary constitution that regulates the operation of the Burmese nation. Finally, the General Assembly unanimously elected the head of the executive government, Ba Maw, as the national representative of the new Burma. Therefore, Ba Maw took office as the first national representative of Burma with the general will of all Burmese people. After taking office, he vowed to fulfill the responsibilities entrusted to him by the national representative in accordance with the above-mentioned basic law. At this point, the Constituent Assembly completed its epoch-making and important mission, and the dissolution was announced at noon. Burma completed its independence at this point and began to create the first page of a new history under the Greater East Asia War.

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The national representative of the new Burmese nation announced the appointment of new cabinet ministers (15 ministers besides the prime minister) and advisors to the Privy Council (20 people) at 11:00 am on the 1st. The list of new cabinet members is as follows: Prime Minister Dr. Ba Maw, Deputy Prime Minister Takin Mya, Minister of Interior U Win, Minister of Foreign Affairs Takin Nu, Minister of Finance U Hla Min, Minister of National Defense Major General U Win, Minister of Taxation U Aye Lwin, Minister of Justice U Toe Yin Ye, Minister of Education U Hla Min, Minister of Agriculture Takin Chit Maung, Minister of Commerce and Industry U Mya, Minister of Communications Takin Thein Maung, Minister of Forestry U Hla Pe, Minister of Health and Propaganda U Set Win, Minister of Cooperation U Tun Win, and Minister of Public Works and Reconstruction Takin Lon Pe.

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) After completing the independence procedures, the Burmese government issued a statement in the name of Foreign Minister Takin Nu to the foreign ministers of various Axis countries and neutral countries at 3:00 pm, declaring the independence of Burma. The countries to which the statement was issued include Japan, Germany, Italy, China, Manchuria, Thailand, Hungary, Spain, Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia, France, the Soviet Union, Turkey, and Finland.

### Japanese Government Declaration: Recognition of Burmese Independence

The Two Countries Also Conclude a Treaty of Alliance

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The Japanese government issued the following statement on the 1st regarding the independence of Burma: On the 1st of this month, Burma declared independence and immediately declared war on Britain and the United States. The Empire immediately recognized the country and concluded a treaty of alliance with it, agreeing to cooperate closely to complete the Greater East Asia War and jointly build Greater East Asia. Looking back on Burma's suffering under British oppression for more than a hundred years, it has now achieved its long-cherished wish and gained the glory of independence. It has now risen up and stood with the Empire on the common front to defeat Britain and the United States. It is precisely the Empire's desire to eliminate the roots of a century of disaster in East Asia and build a new order based on the spirit of national founding that all nations obtain their place and all people live in peace. Therefore, it is deeply gratifying. Now, the State of Manchuria is exerting its national strength to cooperate with the Empire and carry out the war. The Republic of China and Thailand are also working to complete the common war under full cooperation with the Empire. At this time, the independence and rise of the State of Burma to participate in the great war has further strengthened the unity of Greater East Asia. The Empire and these countries will cooperate closely and echo the European allies to defeat the common enemy, Britain and the United States, and strive to build a new order of morality. Here, we specifically clarify the beliefs of the Imperial Government to both China and foreign countries.

Treaty Contents

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The treaty of alliance between Japan and Burma stipulates the fundamental relationship between the two countries. The fundamental principle is to respect each other's independence and autonomy and build a new order of Greater East Asia based on morality to contribute to world peace. The contents of the treaty are as follows: Article 1: The government of the Empire of Japan and the government of Burma shall fully cooperate in military, political, and economic matters. Article 2: Japan and Burma shall cooperate closely for the common purpose of promoting the autonomous development of the countries of Greater East Asia and the prosperity of Greater East Asia. Article 3: Details of the implementation of this treaty shall be decided by the responsible officials of both countries as necessary. Article 4: This treaty shall be implemented from the date of signing.

### New Burmese National Flag Design

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The new Burmese national flag has a yellow ribbon and three red stripes as the background, with a peacock with outstretched wings in the center. Its correct dimensions are five feet long and three feet wide. The yellow, green, and red ribbons, each one foot wide, are arranged vertically from top to bottom. A white circle with a radius of one inch is attached in the center, in which is a peacock.

### Wang, Concurrently Premier of the Executive Yuan, Sends a Telegram to Congratulate the Burmese Prime Minister

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency telegram) The Ministry of Foreign Affairs and the Ministry of Propaganda issued a joint communique at 7:00 pm on the 1st as follows: Burma formally declared independence on August 1st. President Wang of the Executive Yuan specially sent a telegram to Prime Minister Ba Maw to extend his congratulations. The telegram reads: "To His Excellency Prime Minister Ba Maw of the Burmese Cabinet: Upon receiving the telegram from Your Excellency's country announcing independence, the government of this country expresses its deep sympathy. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, your country has responded to Japan and eliminated the forces of British aggression. Now, as desired, you have obtained the glory of independence. Another independent country has joined the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the future is even brighter with mutual cooperation. The government of this country hereby recognizes Your Excellency's leadership of your government and expresses its congratulations. It is deeply believed that the friendly relations between the two countries will be even closer from now on. Wang Zhaoming, President of the National Government and Premier of the Executive Yuan of the Republic of China."

### Burma Enters State of War with Britain and America

Ba Maw Announces at the Constituent Assembly

Rangoon, 1st (Central News Agency) - At 4:30 PM on the 1st, Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw issued a proclamation after a meeting of the Constituent Assembly, reading a Burmese-language announcement stating that Burma had entered a state of war with Britain and America, effective immediately. Subsequently, at 4:45 PM in the same meeting room, he signed the Japan-Burma Alliance Treaty with Japanese Ambassador to Burma, Sawada. Burma's declaration of war against Britain and America prior to signing the Japan-Burma Treaty clearly demonstrates that the decision was made by Burma itself and was its own responsibility, as determined by Prime Minister Ba Maw after consulting with the Cabinet and Privy Council.

"Zigong was the magistrate of Kong Yu, a minister of the State of Wei. Kui Kui rebelled against Kong Yu and planned to enter Kong Yu's house. He then attacked Duke Chu with his followers, and Duke Chu fled to Lu. Kui Kui was then installed as the ruler, becoming Duke Zhuang. When Kong Yu rebelled, Zigong heard of it while he was outside and rushed back. He met Zigo at the gate of Wei City, who said to Zigong, 'Duke Chu has left, and the gate is closed. You should turn back to avoid suffering disaster in vain.' Zigong said, 'One who eats the food of another should not evade his difficulties.' Zigo then left. An envoy entered the city, and the city gate opened. Zigong followed him in. He went to Kui Kui. Kui Kui and Kong Yu ascended the platform. Zigong said, 'Why does the ruler need Kong Yu? Please allow me to kill him.' Kui Kui did not listen. Thereupon, Zigong wanted to set the platform on fire. Kui Kui was afraid and sent Shi Qi and Hu Ju down to attack Zigong, breaking Zigong's hat string. Zigong said, 'A gentleman dies, but his hat is not removed.' Then he tied his hat string and died."

Zigong's death was indeed as Zigo said, "suffering disaster in vain"; however, it was by no means such. Instead, it was in front of the spirit of freedom, transcending the concept of life and death, and there was an irrepressible free movement. Zigong simply acted according to this spirit. Confucius, who also grasped the samadhi state of the spirit of freedom, immediately predicted, "Alas! You is dead!" when he heard of the internal strife in Wei!

Yoshida Shōin—a Japanese advocate of expelling foreigners and revering the Emperor—wanted to go abroad on a foreign ship but was arrested by the shogunate and beheaded. Before his execution, he sang loudly without regard for others: "Although I know it will be this way, there is a sacred and inviolable Yamato spirit." The true spirit of freedom has the characteristics of disregarding any interests and having an irrepressible impulse. This is somewhat different from the spirit of Europeans. When the tyrant Nero massacred Christians in Rome, the Apostle Peter first fled from Rome. On the way, he blamed himself for leaving so many Christians behind, escaping alone. At that moment, he saw the shadow of Christ going to Rome in the sky. The Apostle Peter asked Christ, "Master, where are you going? *Que Vadis Domine*." Christ replied, "I am going to Rome for you." So Peter returned to Rome and went to Nero's cross. If this were Terao Kyūma-no-suke, Zigong, or Yoshida Shōin, they would not have needed to ask, "Master, where are you going?" They would have long regarded death as returning home and accepted the death penalty. With a calm mind, able to go from life to death—when the heart is cold, the fire is not hot—this is the spirit of freedom of Eastern people. The Japanese troops who died in action on Attu Island and Guadalcanal were mostly Japanese farmers, various clerks, or ordinary people. However, none of these people were captured by the enemy, and they fought to the last person and the last drop of blood. This proves the great existence of the "Asian spirit." Comparing this with the spirit of Europeans makes it very clear. In the Asian spirit, from beginning to end, there is no calculation of success or failure, because Asians know that when they should die, they die. This is the actual expression of life, the only way for the spirit to survive forever.

This spirit, during the Greater East Asia War, was for Britain and America, an incomprehensible, truly Asian psychological Great Wall of Japan. However, this psychological Great Wall is not unique to the Japanese. If it were unique to the Japanese, the future of the Greater East Asia War would not be optimistic. The reason why I am optimistic about the Greater East Asia War is because I believe that China and Japan have this shared spirit of freedom, that Asian people inherently have this shared spirit of freedom. If Japan can revitalize this Asian spirit, if it can arm this Asian spirit with Japanese material civilization, then no matter how intense and cruel the situation of the Greater East Asia War may be temporarily, the arrival of final victory is beyond doubt. Assuming that all Japanese can understand that this spirit of freedom also exists among the Chinese, I believe that full peace can be achieved immediately. Assuming that Japan has a spirit of freedom that transcends interests, and China also has a spirit of freedom that transcends interests, then the Sino-Japanese War will never continue with each side holding weapons without end. This is a very simple theory. (Translated from Chinese)

Postscript: The Sunday Commentary, originally scheduled to be published yesterday, was postponed to today due to the publication of a special edition celebrating the recovery of the concessions.

### New Prospects for Burmese Independence - Remarks by Propaganda Minister Lin

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Burma was liberated. With the assistance of Japan, it declared its independence yesterday (August 1st). Propaganda Minister Lin made the following remarks on this occasion:

Complete Liberation of East Asia

"Today—August 1st, the 32nd year of the Republic of China—is the day of the final success of China's recovery of the concessions. It is also the day of Burma's independence, marking an epoch-making milestone on the road to the liberation of East Asia. The former demonstrates China's brightness, while the latter proves that the ranks safeguarding East Asia are becoming increasingly solid. Both events were completed at a time of victory in the Greater East Asia War, with the joint assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. This truly proves that the independence and freedom of East Asian countries and the complete liberation of East Asia are inseparable. All Chinese and East Asians, on this great and memorable day, while sharing in the deep celebration, should further increase their sense of responsibility, and with a spirit of advancement, take on this epoch-making mission.

Relationship with China

The historical relationship between Burma and China is very deep and long-standing, and their geographical relationship is also like lips and teeth. After India was annexed by British aggression, Burma unfortunately fell under its colonial rule. Britain then used this as a further step to invade China. The mutual safety and shared pain of both countries are self-evident. Therefore, Chinese revolutionary comrades have always been extremely concerned about the Burmese issue. In the past, the Burmese national liberation movement has undergone three major bloodsheds and countless struggles, and Chinese revolutionary comrades have especially extended boundless sympathy to this. When the official news of Burma's independence was announced, the excitement of the Chinese government and people further increased their expectations for the Burmese nation in the future, and further gave them new prospects for the future of East Asia.

Significance of the National Bloc

First: The Burmese nation's demand for independence has been brewing for a long time, manifested in fierce actions, and not just for a day. Why was it only realized after the Greater East Asia War? This shows that as the world's political and economic development has reached the stage of national blocism, the acquisition and guarantee of a nation's independence and freedom not only takes the simple national self-consciousness as its intension, but must also take the national bloc's self-consciousness as its extension. The independence of Burma cannot precede the liberation of East Asia and must be sought within the liberation of East Asia.

The tendency of facts does not allow us to ignore it. All East Asian nations, in light of China's recovery of the concessions and Burma's independence, will naturally know how to make choices for their own destiny, and will certainly generate greater vigor and make greater efforts. After independence, Burma will certainly be able to closely cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan and work hand in hand with our country for the future of Burma and the common destiny of East Asia.

The Fruit of Sincere Unity

Second: In the past, British and American aggressors recklessly slaughtered the general weak nations without any scruples. After the outbreak of the European War and the Greater East Asia War, they became increasingly anxious about their own safety and used the so-called Atlantic Charter to carry out the final deception on the long-oppressed nations. Their intentions are clear. The friendly nation of Japan stands at the forefront of the Greater East Asia War and is the advanced country of East Asia. It does not need to be bound by any false charters or use empty words as a sign. However, Tojo's repeated statements and the factual performance following these statements are more sincere and powerful than any charter. This is our observation of Burma's independence, and it is also our understanding of Shanghai's recovery of concessions. We firmly believe that East Asian nations must seek unity with sincerity, seek victory in the Greater East Asia War with unity, and seek the common existence and co-prosperity of East Asian nations with this victory.

Prelude to Indian Independence

Third: The impact of Burma's independence is not only for Burma itself but is also of great importance to the future of the liberation of Greater East Asia. We can say that Burma's independence is actually the prelude to Indian independence. The Indian compatriots, who have long been trampled on by British imperialism, will inevitably become more and more determined to fight a final and decisive battle with British imperialism with the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan, so that the last piece of land on the road to the liberation of Greater East Asia can be returned to East Asia, and Indian compatriots can regain their freedom.

On this day of Burma's independence, I would like to wish Burma prosperity with the greatest enthusiasm, wish victory in the Greater East Asia War, and wish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere limitless development.

### Inauguration of Chen, Concurrent Head of the First District Public Office, Who Also Assumes Office as Head of the First Police Bureau - The Whole City Hangs Flags to Celebrate the Recovery of the Concessions

After the Shanghai International Settlement was taken over by personnel dispatched by the National Government, it was incorporated into the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, and the First District Public Office and the First Police Bureau were established. The posts of Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau have been concurrently assumed by Mayor Chen, appointed by the National Government. After the completion of the handover ceremony of the International Settlement, Chen, concurrently the Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau, immediately led Chief Secretary Wu Songju, Deputy Head Su Chengde, and other senior officials to hold an inauguration ceremony. The ceremony was simple and solemn. After the ceremony, Chen, concurrently the Head of the Office and Head of the Bureau, delivered the following speech:

Ladies and gentlemen: Today, I am ordered to concurrently serve as the Head of the First District Public Office and the Head of the First Police Bureau of the Greater Shanghai Special Municipality. I am very pleased to have my first conversation with you at the time of my inauguration. You have all served in the International Settlement for many years and have made outstanding contributions, especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. You have worked hard to maintain the municipal administration of the Shanghai International Settlement and to ensure its continuous development. I would like to thank you all first. In the future, although the International Settlement has been changed to the First District, I hope to maintain the effectiveness of the administration with your efforts and even enhance its effectiveness. I deeply hope that you will base your service on your virtue of being dutiful and impartial and give me your assistance. As for the Chinese and foreign staff, except for those who voluntarily resign, all will continue to serve in their positions. This is something you all know. Regarding treatment such as annual salary and retirement benefits, they will be based on the original regulations. Even if there are reasonable revisions in accordance with Chinese laws in the future, they will only be improvements and will never cause you any regrets. This is what I dare to assert today. Many Japanese employees of the former Shanghai Municipal Council, and the number of newly added Japanese employees since December 8, the year before last, is not small. In recent years, the progress of the facilities in the International Settlement has been particularly outstanding. In the future, I hope that you will continue to serve the Greater Shanghai Municipal Government with the spirit of being dedicated and devoted to your country. China and Japan share life and death in the Greater East Asia War, and their cooperation is seamless. Shanghai, in the rear, is no less important than the front line. Chinese and Japanese employees should cooperate sincerely to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War as soon as possible. This is what I deeply hope for. After the speech, the ceremony was completed with music.

### Reflections on the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement: Broadcast Address by Japanese Minister Tajiri One Evening in Shanghai

The Shanghai International Settlement was officially returned to China yesterday (the 1st). Especially appointed Minister Plenipotentiary Tajiri Aigi delivered a broadcast address on Shanghai Radio from 9:00 PM to 9:15 PM on the 1st, entitled "Reflections on the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement." He provided a detailed explanation of the true significance of returning the concessions. The content of Minister Tajiri's speech is divided as follows:

A Great Undertaking in Chinese History

The administration of the Shanghai International Settlement was officially returned to China at 9:30 AM today in a solemn and grand ceremony, and was received by the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Municipal Government. Furthermore, the French Concession was returned to China on the previous day (the 30th), thereby permanently ending the administrative power of the concessions in Shanghai. The return of the Shanghai International Settlement to China is not only the completion of the most important element of Chinese sovereignty but also a groundbreaking undertaking in Chinese history. The first day of August can truly be called a day worthy of eternal commemoration by China.

Eliminating the Final Page of British and American Influence

Since the Opium War, the Shanghai International Settlement has been the largest vanguard base for British and American aggression in East Asia for a century. The British and American nations repeatedly used the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council or the related League of Nations to prevent China's unification and development, obstruct Sino-Japanese cooperation, invade East Asia, and disrupt peace, exhausting their ambition. The number of their crimes is countless. This history of British and American concession crimes is also due to Japan's initiation of the Greater East Asia War and the elimination of British and American influence in China, bringing it to a final page. In the year and a half that followed, due to the maintenance of public order and the necessities of the war, the final handling of the concession issue was not immediately seen. Now, based on the righteousness of East Asia, Japan swiftly returns the Shanghai International Settlement, a trace of British and American crimes, to China. At the same time, the new China is bravely advancing toward the completion of its construction as a modern nation. Japan is truly deeply moved by this and sees it as highly meaningful.

Fundamental Policy of Returning Concessions

Japan has already liberated the Greater East Asia region from the shackles of British and American politics. Now, it is taking a further step to actively build a new order in Greater East Asia. Japan's just and enthusiastic assistance to the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the participation of Javanese people in administration, Thailand's recovery of lost territories, and the independence movements that are being celebrated, is truly sufficient to demonstrate Japan's fundamental policy regarding the construction of political, economic, cultural, and other orders for the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia. At the same time, this return of the concessions is also a part of Japan's fundamental policy and is being implemented accordingly. Therefore, the return of the concessions cannot be observed solely from the perspective of Sino-Japanese relations.

Ignoring the Significance is a Misunderstanding

The Empire and China should be the core of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. There is no need to state this more clearly. The Empire is striving to promote the independence and completion of the new China, build a thriving continent, and establish a new relationship of Sino-Japanese cooperation. From the grand ideal of Hakkō ichiu (Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof), the development and prosperity of the new China is not only a matter of course but also a prerequisite for the construction of Greater East Asia. The formation of the Sino-Japanese axis is the core for establishing the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The return of the concessions is the first step in this process and has extremely great significance. However, many Chinese people are blinded by immediate interests and believe that this return of the concessions is merely a political game, tending to overlook its far-reaching significance. This is truly a very great misunderstanding and the result of being swayed by enemy propaganda. One must know that without the livelihood of an independent and complete people, the livelihood of a colony and the life of a beggar are essentially no different. Furthermore, if one honestly observes the new direction of world history unfolded after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the process of its realization, then the old order of Britain and America is indeed full of flaws. On the other hand, the liberation and construction of Greater East Asia is now gaining the approval and cooperation of the billion people of Greater East Asia. This fact cannot be ignored. Among them, the only ones who continue to collude with the old dominance of the United States and Britain and continue the futile resistance war, compared to the National Government, which is dedicated to the prosperity of Greater East Asia and the construction of the new China, it is extremely clear which one is truly advancing in the direction commanded by world history. The return of the concessions is by no means a political means to propagate and strengthen the National Government but is one aspect of the Empire's righteous diplomacy with the aim of the prosperity of Greater East Asia and the cooperation in building the new China. The Chinese people should accept it with complete sincerity and without any selfish motives, and by honestly and wholeheartedly cooperating with the National Government, they will be truly loving China. Moreover, since China is already at war with Britain and America, those who truly love China must gladly adhere to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's advocated Pan-Asianism, and without fear of sacrifice, boldly aim at rescuing and building Greater East Asia, establishing a total war wartime system in all aspects, and building a new state that is the core of the new order in Greater East Asia. The entire nation, both government and people, must unanimously move forward in this direction.

Starting Point for Building a New China

Furthermore, observing the management of the concessions after their return, the relationship to the construction of the new China is extremely important. This is because the concessions, which have always hindered China's development, will henceforth become the starting point for building a modern nation in all aspects, including political, economic, and cultural. The construction of the new China does not end with the formal and complete return of sovereignty over the concessions. Taking Shanghai as an example, the politics of Shanghai, with the municipal government at the core surrounding the former concessions, must move further forward. The grand task of integrating Shanghai's economy with other regions must also be completed. In particular, the British and American ideologies that have entrenched themselves in the Shanghai concessions for years and hindered China's prosperity have not yet been eradicated, and China's inherent ideology has not yet been restored. Therefore, this opportunity should not be missed, and efforts should be made to eradicate British and American ideology. Building a new Shanghai after the return of the concessions is truly a major task and responsibility entrusted to the people of Shanghai. Today's Shanghai truly needs the spirit of the Xinhai Revolution of thirty-two years ago and the efforts of blood. The National Government authorities and the leading and youth levels of Shanghai have now happily encountered an opportunity to rise up. If there is a lack of such rising up, sacrifice, and effort, then discussing participation in the war is completely meaningless. In order to make the return of the concessions a successful result, there is no other way to advance. Regarding the construction of the new Shanghai, Japan will not hesitate to provide goodwill support. When flipping through the historical pages from the Meiji Restoration to the First Chinese Revolution, and then to the liberation of East Asia, it can be seen that it is truly full of lofty reform ideas. Japanese people, especially the Japanese living in China, should grasp this original meaning and cooperate in building Shanghai. The efforts of the blood and sweat of the Chinese people, coupled with the cooperation of the Japanese, will lead to the completion of the new Shanghai. In this way, the victory and glory of the Greater East Asia War can be shared by the newly reborn Shanghai. Japanese residents should also deeply feel the greatness of their responsibility and respond to this situation with extraordinary determination.

Mayor Chen Will Exchange Broadcasts With Tokyo Governor Tonight

The Shanghai French Concession and International Settlement have been successively returned to China by our country. Shanghai Special Municipality Mayor Chen Gongbo expressed his infinite gratitude and joy for the cooperation of the friendly nation of Japan and specifically arranged to exchange broadcasts with Tokyo Governor Ōkai Shigeo from 10:10 AM to 10:35 AM on the 2nd on the Shanghai Radio.

Chairman Wang's Address

The Shanghai Special Municipality held a "Celebration Assembly of People's Representatives to Celebrate the Return of the Concessions" at 4:00 PM this afternoon (the 1st). National Government Chairman Wang personally delivered an address, the original text of which is recorded below: What I wanted to say has already been said in today's broadcast. Now, I will only add a few sentences. On April 26 of the 29th year of the Republic [1940], when the National Government was celebrating the return of the capital, I published an essay, "The Spirit of Self-Reproach." What is most needed during a celebration is self-examination and self-encouragement. Now, as I participate in this assembly to celebrate Shanghai's return to the "coarse boundary" [concessions], I still hold this spirit of self-reproach. Why did China have concessions? On the one hand, it was the aggression of Britain and America. On the other hand, it was our inability to resist the aggression of Britain and America. We cannot but blame ourselves for this point. Why did Shanghai have concessions? It was because a group of people, shouting loudly, such as Zeng Wenzheng [Zeng Guofan] and Li Wenzhong [Li Hongzhang], in order to fight against the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, did not hesitate to seek assistance from the British foreign gun squads, and thus used the Shanghai concessions as a reward. We cannot but blame ourselves even more for this point. Since Shanghai had concessions, although there were also passionate movements to reclaim the concessions, there were also people who regarded the concessions as a comfortable nest. We cannot but blame ourselves for this point. This time, the return of the concessions was not due to our own strength, but due to the assistance of the friendly nation of Japan. As we look back on the past, face the present, and look forward to the future, we can only examine ourselves and encourage ourselves. I also have very painful words. In May of the 28th year of the Republic [1939], I arrived in Shanghai to preside over the peace, anti-communism, and national building movement. At that time, if Chongqing had adopted my proposal, then when the European War occurred, China and Japan would have been able to cooperate wholeheartedly and deal with it calmly. Why did it have to be delayed until today? Even if that were not the case, as long as the compatriots in the two Shanghai concessions could adopt my proposal and work together, then when the Greater East Asia War occurred, Shanghai would have already had three years of organization and training. It would have been able to cooperate wholeheartedly and deal with the situation. It would have exerted a great force in the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the lives of the people of Shanghai, such as the instability of prices today, etc., could have been reduced by at least two-thirds. Why is there such a situation today? When looking back on the past, there is only heartache. We should still face the present and look forward to the future and encourage ourselves well. Do the Shanghai compatriots still have doubts about the victory of the Greater East Asia War? Shanghai is the place with the most rumors. With rumors about the Greater East Asia War and the world war, there are speculations. I tell you that war is like waves. We are sitting in a boat. We can only hold on to the rudder and move forward through the waves. Do not shake ourselves. If you listen to a rumor and speculate more, the material gold and prices will rise and fall with the waves, and psychologically you will rise and fall with the waves. You are just looking for fear. The Greater East Asia War is bound to be won. If you believe the words of the Chongqing side, China can only be like India. This is an unbreakable fact. Only the victory of the Greater East Asia War can protect East Asia and protect China. This is also an unbreakable fact. Since this is the case, what room is left for doubt? For more than ten years, I have always been unwilling for the Sino-Japanese Incident to occur. After it occurred, if there was an opportunity for improvement, I would like to improve it, at least not to make it worse. For the Greater East Asia War, from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death, this is a consistent spirit and an immutable policy. We can only strengthen our beliefs and take on everything. Once the belief is firm, we can use courage, diligence, perseverance, and hard work to realize the belief. The Greater East Asia War is bound to be won, but it is not a lucky victory. China's participation in the Greater East Asia War will be liberated as a result of victory, but the result of victory is not obtained by luck. All the people of China must be prepared to go to the front line. The first step of the work is still to ensure public order and increase production. These first steps of the work certainly have many difficulties, but these difficulties, compared to the soldiers on the front line and the people behind the lines of the friendly nations, we only have time to feel ashamed. Where do we need to complain? We must recognize that in this long war, the nation that can endure the most labor and endure the most suffering is the nation that will ultimately be victorious. The Chinese and Japanese people are both known for their diligence and frugality in the world. Take the habit of diligence and frugality, based on firm beliefs, to deal with the Anglo-American hedonism, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is bound to be in our hands.

In summary, today we celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions, not to celebrate the completion of China's independent autonomy, but to celebrate that China has gained this basis to unleash its joint forces to realize the legacy of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. China will gain freedom and peace as a result of the victory of the Greater East Asia War and fulfill the aspirations of building the Republic of China.

### Minister Tajiri's Speech

Japanese Minister Tajiri said to the audience at the People's Assembly: Comrades of the friendly nation, in the past, what hindered the independence and integrity of China and obstructed the establishment of friendly relations between China and Japan was the aggressive ambition and strategy of Britain and America in East Asia. However, the British and American forces in East Asia were driven out by our forces a year and a half ago.

Today, China has recovered the public concession, the base of British and American aggression in East Asia. From today, the history of the most humiliating concessions in China will be forever eliminated.

From today, the construction of the new Shanghai will begin. The history of the construction of the new Shanghai, including the Japanese concession area, will begin from today. If the various construction works of the new Shanghai, such as economy, culture, and politics, can develop smoothly and brightly, then the construction of the new China can be said to be half completed.

If the Chinese and Japanese people in the new Shanghai can truly shake hands and strengthen cooperation between China and Japan, then further progress can be made.

Furthermore, after the construction of the new Shanghai is achieved in this way, Shanghai can share the responsibility of defeating Britain and America.

Defeating Britain and America cannot be achieved solely through propaganda; it must be put into practice. However, to achieve this goal, you should make more efforts.

I hope to complete the construction of the new Shanghai and celebrate the future brilliant development of the new China. I will simply say a few words of thought as a congratulatory speech.

Today, in my position as mayor, I would like to disclose my personal expectations for the future of Shanghai and for all of you. My speech will address the administrative issues of Shanghai. The former Shanghai International Settlement is now renamed the First District, and the former French Concession is now renamed the Eighth District. For the sake of future administrative efficiency, these two districts will soon be merged. Furthermore, in the past, the zoning of the region was often unreasonably divided due to the existence of the two concessions, especially due to the relationship of the cross-border roads. In the future, Shanghai will no longer have the distinction of concessions and non-concessions. It should be re-adjusted to make the districts in the city gradually conform to the ideal zoning. As for public order, there are already three units, namely the police bureau of the municipal government, the public concession, and the French concession patrol rooms. Now, based on the original units, they are temporarily divided into three police bureaus, namely the First Police Bureau, which governs the First District, the Second Police Bureau, which governs the districts already under the city government, and the Third Police Bureau, which governs the Eighth District. However, the First and Fifth [sic] bureaus will also be merged soon. In this way, Shanghai's police forces can be unified and the police force can be strengthened. In the future, Shanghai's public order will definitely be more established than before. However, today, in the early stages of unifying the Shanghai municipal administration, there are still many unnatural facts. To achieve a truly ideal municipal administration, it will have to wait for the future. I only hope that Shanghai's municipal administration will advance with the Greater East Asia War.

In the past, both concessions had public directorates, and there were also organizations such as taxpayers' associations among the Chinese people. Although the various systems are different, I believe that the municipal government should value the opinions of the people. Therefore, after taking over the two ancestral boundaries, once all administrative facilities are slightly stabilized, I plan to restore the Provisional Council, selecting and employing people with prestige, status, and ability in the community to provide consultations, so that the people have the right to make suggestions on municipal administration, so that the upper and lower levels are consistent and assist in the progress of the municipal administration. (Rest omitted)

### Foreign Minister Chu's Address

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8 of the year before last [1941], the British and American forces that had always been entrenched in the Shanghai International Settlement were swept away in one fell swoop. And now, further, the administrative power is returned to China. On the one hand, Japan sacrifices great interests. On the other hand, it serves as a special envoy to persuade the countries concerned. This great man's determination and lofty friendship are entirely based on the promotion of the spirit of East Asian morality. This point is something that the people of the country should deeply recognize in addition to gratitude.

In addition, the friendly nation also pays attention to the fact that the friendly nation of Japan is taking the same measures to return the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement to our country. Although China and France and China and Italy are far apart from each other, their diplomatic relations have always been trusted, and they are standing on the same front in the anti-British and American position. This time, based on a friendly position, we also express our gratitude for giving up the administrative power of the coarse boundary.

Why are we celebrating the return of the concessions here? How should we celebrate the return of the concessions? We are not celebrating emptiness or meaningless cries. Everyone sitting here will think of the painful history of British imperialism invading our country with machine guns in one hand and opium guns in the other a hundred years ago, and the conspiracy of British and American imperialism to build a second Indian empire in the Yangtze River basin for one hundred and fifty years.

It is not easy to recover the concessions. We have been able to complete the recovery of the concessions in just five or six months with the help of friendly countries. We are members of the war. Our country must participate in the war with total force. How much strength have we exerted? We cannot but deeply reflect. Furthermore, looking at Shanghai, the shortcomings, disadvantages, and stains that have influenced politics, economy, military affairs, and culture in the past must be thoroughly eliminated one by one. Since the incident, there have been seven battles so far. The result of the war has created a phenomenon of rising prices and difficult living conditions, which is the most felt suffering by the people of Shanghai. However, if we open our eyes and look at the suffering compatriots in the interior, who have no rice or wheat to fill their hunger and eat the roots and horse manure until the infants die, and here, in the past, because of the existence of the concessions, we were lavish with meals costing 10,000 or 20,000 gold coins, all of which were caused by the buying-class poison of British and American aggression. The National Government's slogans of "sharing joys and sorrows" and "sharing life and death" are addressed to all compatriots. Only by sharing suffering, sharing sweetness, dying together, and living together can we assume the responsibility of reviving China and defending East Asia.

### Change of Name of the Central Reserve Bank Office

Due to the return of the French Concession, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has changed the name of its French Concession office to the Bo District Office. All previously issued deposit slips, deposit receipts, contracts, and signature samples remain valid.

Each set consists of four types, namely 25 cents, 50 cents, 1 yuan, and 2 yuan, totaling 4 yuan. In addition, all mail received and sent yesterday was stamped with a special commemorative postmark.

### Brief News

### Celebrating the Reclaiming of Concession Areas with a Charity Football Match: Three Provinces vs. Western Union, Today at 6 PM at the Recreation Ground

Three Provinces will play against Western Union at the Recreation Ground on Albert Road. The grand opening is scheduled for 6 PM today. The second match is scheduled for the 6th (Friday). To highlight the grand occasion, the organizers have invited Foreign Minister Chu Minyi to deliver the opening speech, Mayor Chen Gongbo to perform the opening kick, and Miss Zhou, the daughter of Finance Minister Zhou, to present the awards. Tickets are priced at twenty yuan and fifty yuan. All proceeds, after deducting expenses, will be donated to the Shen Bao and Xin Bao Scholarship Funds. There will also be a smaller match before the main event.

A Small Football Interlude

Featuring Three Provinces versus Saint John's. Saint John's has an outstanding record in the President’s Cup, while Three Provinces is renowned for its dominance in Shanghai. Their encounter will be just as exciting as the main match. Over the years, Western Union has assembled the elite forces of St. Francis and Portugal. Their fierce energy at the Xuhui field a few days ago still lingers in the minds of fans, and the sharpness of their five forwards has been praised. With the return of the central defense line, the tightness of the defensive line, and the agility of goalkeeper G. Su Shi, they demonstrate limitless attacking and defensive power. As for

The Three Provinces Tiger Formation

Although a newly emerging force, it has recruited first-class famous players from the Tung Wah and Lianyi teams, such as Dai Xiaojing, Jia Youliang, Sun Jinshun, Wu Qixiang, Li Tiansheng, and Qu Yongfu. With the foundation of Xuhui, their fighting strength is even stronger. They have absorbed the best of English talent, making them a truly powerful team, confident enough to compete with any team. However, Western Union's full force should not be underestimated. With their long experience on the field, seasoned tactics, and cunning style, they are like nine-tailed foxes. Fortunately, Three Provinces has a strong force and high morale, capable of matching the ferocity of tigers. Today's encounter of evenly matched opponents will undoubtedly be exciting. It is expected that the Recreation Ground will be packed with spectators. The referee is Shen Huichun, with linesmen Chen Jixiang and Huang Renyi. The lineups are as follows:

Three Provinces: Gao Lianjun, Lian Junzhi, Li Tiansheng, Wen Xingqi, Wu Qixiang, Yongfu, Song, Saint Myerson, Zhuang Wenquan, Zhou Defa, Sun Mianshun, Xiaojing, Gao Baozheng, Chunhua, Jia Youliang

### The Promotion of Shanghai's Economy and Industry After the Reclaiming of Concession Areas

The Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession have been handed over to our government on July and August 1st respectively, through the close cooperation of friendly nation Japan under the principle of constructing a New East Asia. The bases of American economic aggression for the past century have now been completely eliminated, and all administration has been unified. Under the government's management, Shanghai's false prosperity can now move towards genuine prosperity. Regarding the future promotion of Shanghai's economy and industry, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed various organizations and learned of the preparations underway, as follows:

Adjusting Finance

Shanghai's financial institutions (banks, money shops, trust companies) were in disarray due to the special relationship with the former concession areas. Their organizational systems were inconsistent, and the entire financial authority was largely controlled by British and American commercial firms. British banks controlled their operations, preventing them from expanding their own businesses. In the event of political changes, they were manipulated and influenced, and the government could not directly manage them, causing the entire financial system to suffer turbulence. After the Greater East Asia War, the government implemented measures to manage financial institutions. However, even until now, some financial institutions in the concession areas, still relying on the concessions, violated regulations and failed to apply for registration, continuing to operate. Now that the reclaiming of the concessions has been implemented, there are no obstacles to enforcing the management of financial institutions. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank is planning to strictly scrutinize illegal financial institutions. Any financial institutions found to have failed to apply for registration will be shut down, their operations suspended, and they will be handed over to judicial authorities for prosecution. Financial institutions will be strictly managed to prevent speculators from using loans to hoard goods and manipulate market prices, and to protect the rights and interests of the people's assets.

Unifying Institutions

Shanghai's commercial organizations are also complex and unsound due to the concession areas. In the event of political changes, hoarding and manipulation are prone to occur. Since the government announced its participation in the war this year and implemented wartime economic policies, the General Association for Commercial Control was established to adjust the organizational structures of various trade associations. Measures were implemented to centralize the control of materials and organize self-governing merchant groups, adopting a system of unified collection and distribution of materials. Although the organizational structure has been adjusted and improved, the control could not be fully enforced due to the constraints of the concession areas. As a result, prices could not be thoroughly suppressed, and speculators were not completely eliminated. Now that the two concession areas have been reclaimed, in order to unify the control institutions, the Commercial Control will unify the organizational structure, centralize material control, and integrate deliberation, investigation, and management, so that the increase in production, the suppression of prices, and the distribution of goods can all be reasonably resolved. Commerce will naturally move towards normal prosperity, living up to the hope of economic cooperation between China and Japan on an equal and mutually beneficial basis.

Promoting Industry

Shanghai is a key industrial area, with factories throughout the country. Before the incident, Chinese factories were mostly controlled by British and American firms, due to the immaturity of China's industrial technology. As a result, all rights were lagging behind. In recent years, British and American factories operated by friendly nation authorities, as well as Chinese factories in Central China, have been returned to Chinese management. The National Government's current steps in implementing wartime economic policy emphasize increasing production and meeting the material and economic needs of wartime. Therefore, promoting industry, especially Shanghai's industry, is the most important wartime measure. Now that the Shanghai concession areas have been reclaimed, the first priority in revitalizing the construction of Greater Shanghai is to promote industry. Currently, the government authorities are actively guiding the inward transfer of floating capital, investing in rural areas to increase production, and using raw materials produced in the interior to supply Shanghai. Factories are stepping up the production of products to meet the needs of material. Then, Shanghai's genuine economic and industrial prosperity will reap the greatest benefits from the substance of equal and mutually beneficial cooperation between China and Japan.

### Eliminating Speculation

Furthermore, according to the speculation of economic authorities in this city, the false prosperity of Shanghai in recent years has been entirely created by the power of the concession areas. Merchants and civilians with capital, disregarding national welfare and the people's livelihood, violated laws and regulations by hoarding goods, speculating and profiteering, and manipulating market prices under the protection of the concession areas. Although the relevant authorities have strictly taken actions to ban it, it is ultimately difficult to achieve the desired effect. Now that the concession areas have been reclaimed, the laws are stricter than in our government, the judicial system has also been unified, and the municipal authorities are able to enforce the laws with severity. The authorities' strict enforcement of management duties is expected to eliminate speculative behavior and stabilize prices.

### Bank Restrictions on Withdrawals Are Completely Groundless

Last Saturday coincided with the end of July, and rumors were rampant in the city that banks would restrict withdrawals starting August 1st. The reporter knew that this rumor was groundless and not worth paying attention to, but in order to avoid the spread of misinformation and confusion, the reporter visited the responsible authorities of the Central Reserve Bank yesterday (July 31st). They replied that the government is currently striving to stabilize finance and stabilize prices. There is no reason for such a move. It should be known that the current situation is completely different from the past. If withdrawals were restricted, it would only cause financial unrest and stimulate prices. Therefore, there is absolutely no reason to restrict withdrawals, which is very clear. Today, the facts have proven that the market is as stable as it should be, and the rumors will die out on their own.

### Night Battle of Kula Gulf

The three-dimensional naval, land, and air battle between Japan and the United States unfolding in the Southwest Pacific is becoming increasingly intense and fierce. In the Kula Gulf naval battle of August 4th and 5th, the Japanese Naval Water Minesweeping Force inflicted a major blow on the U.S. Navy in that area. Since then, a major problem has arisen in the enemy's maritime operations, which deserves special attention. At the time, the Japanese General Headquarters announced the results of the Kula Gulf night battle, in which the Japanese water mine warfare unit sank one USS Helena-class light cruiser, one USS Fletcher-class destroyer, one light cruiser of unknown class, and one auxiliary ship. American Thames Newspaper reporter Dun Tuile reported from the Kula Gulf naval battle, printing the details of the dazzling night battle and the demise of America's most elite light cruiser, the USS Helena, as follows:

Something Blocking the Way

"For two hours starting at 1:00 AM on July 5th, our fleet slowly and secretly proceeded northeastward on the sea off Kolombangara Island. In the black night, the beautiful stars shone in the sky above the calm sea. But everyone felt that hidden behind this solemn atmosphere was an impending danger. Suddenly, in the blackness, a huge object blocked our path. It was the Japanese Navy! Upon closer inspection, it appeared to be a squadron of Japanese light cruisers. 'They're coming!' Every member of our squadron, every member of our crew, felt a jolt of electricity run through their chests. Our fleet gradually turned in a direction parallel to the Japanese fleet. The distance between us was only 100 meters, but the Japanese seemed not to see us, and continued silently on their way."

Hit

"Hit!" The tense faces of those on the bridge shattered their confidence. The Japanese fleet struck first. As the men, startled by the commander's order to begin battle, were hurriedly preparing, something suddenly exploded before their eyes, breaking the silence of the night with fierce flames and explosions. We were plunged into a perilous sea. The ship's hull shuddered violently, and the deck was splattered with blood. At first, the reporter was confused, not knowing what had happened. Then, he realized that the ship he was on had been struck first by the Japanese! When the Japanese fleet pretended not to notice us, remaining still and silent, they were actually aiming to fire!

A Moment of Tension

The Japanese then launched their main offensive weapon: torpedoes. Heaven and earth were engulfed in flashes, explosions, and flames. The reporter was blinded by the flashes of the artillery fire, and, along with his comrades, desperately clung to the armored plates of the bridge. The trajectories of the white torpedoes fired by the Japanese were clearly visible even in the darkness. A signalman spotted the trajectory of a torpedo and frantically blew his horn to warn of it, but the ship had no room to maneuver. In a deafening explosion, the torpedo accurately struck our ship. The engine room, ammunition depot, ammunition handling room, and the crew inside the cabins were all thrown into chaos. The reporter closed his eyes, silently thinking, "This is it." After an hour of fierce fighting, the distance between us temporarily widened. When I regained consciousness, I saw that the stern of our ship was sinking into the sea under the glare of searchlights. At this time, another warship was spotted. The commander immediately ordered a destroyer to rush to investigate. The destroyer braved the Japanese artillery fire and used searchlights to search the sea, but the report was delayed. The anxious commander shouted angrily, "What are they doing?" Soon, the report came: "It's Number 50!" Needless to say, this was the number of our new cruiser, the USS Helena. She had been hit by several torpedoes, rendering her unable to move. Burning fiercely, only charred remains were left. The surviving crew abandoned the mother ship on rafts before we did. For a while, the nearby sea was covered with a thick layer of oil, and the small rafts struggled to stay afloat in the oily sea, moving away from the sinking mother ship. The USS Helena, like a Gulliver from a novel, sank into the sea, and countless accessories floated on the surface. Three destroyers were nearby, and other ships were stationed on the outside to provide vigilance. The crew members adrift in the vast ocean lit phosphorus fires and raised their hands for help. The scene was like a picture of hell. At this moment, the shadows of the Japanese naval fleet chasing from the Kula area seemed to be approaching. We had to escape as soon as possible. In the South Sea night, dawn comes early. In the airspace controlled by the Japanese air force base, we had to escape quickly. There were many survivors still drifting in the sea, waiting to be rescued, but we could only leave them to their fate. Among those abandoned, there was also the captain of the USS Helena, from Georgia. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo-based Houchi Shimbun, Argentinian Kyongsong dispatch, July 25)

### A Visit to the Shanghai Old People's Home: White Hair and Rosy Cheeks, Heaven on Earth

Stepping through the crimson side gate of the Shanghai Old People's Home from the rugged streets of Nanshi, you immediately enter another world. In the vast garden, a fragrant breeze blows, washing away the dust of the secular world and making you feel incredibly peaceful. Amidst the chirping of small birds, the song of a cicada drifts by, revealing that this place is full of lively vitality. Who wouldn't say this is heaven on earth?

The Old People's Home was built on Jifei Street on the outer Ma Road in Nanshi, and it has been thirty years since then. The zealous Catholic Society of the Holy Redeemer (the fourth congregation of women saints to come to China), which had been doing missionary and charitable work in China, ran an "Old People's Home" at the Xujiahui Mother Mary's Church. Later, it expanded in scale and became completely independent, becoming the Old People's Home of today. The general public in Nanshi, such as rickshaw pullers, still call it the "Old People's Home."

The Old People's Home movement has a history of over a hundred years in Europe, and it is run by Catholic nuns who support poor and helpless elderly men and women. In China, there is only this one Shanghai Old People's Home. For thirty years, it has been dedicated to serving the elderly. Any poor and helpless elderly person, male or female, aged sixty or older, can be admitted to the home, regardless of whether they are religious or not, to live out their remaining years. The original quota was 300 people, but since the outbreak of the war, there have been too many lonely and helpless elderly people in Shanghai. Unable to bear to see them slowly die in the streets and alleys, the quota was increased to 350 people. Due to limited financial resources, no more could be admitted beyond the quota, unless a resident died, in which case a "replacement" could be made.

A Miracle in the Dining Hall

It was 5:00 PM on a summer afternoon, just as the elderly were having dinner. The four large "dining halls" were full. Every healthy elderly person walked from their rest room or elsewhere to the dining hall and found their assigned seat. Each person had their own personal tableware, including a large rice bowl, dishes for the dishes, a spoon, chopsticks, and a napkin, all stored in their own personal drawer. The large dining tables, freshly painted red, were about ten meters long and seated about fifteen people each, appearing very comfortable. In the women's dining hall, there were also square tables for eight people, and they also had their own personal tableware. Young trainee nuns in uniforms served the elderly, moving back and forth like shuttles, with kind smiles on their faces, nodding to this person and asking that person, "Would you like some more?" How intimate! What daughter-in-law is so filial? However, they were broad in mind and body, and their appetites were not small. Eating two "large bowls" was very common. Rice and grains used to come mainly from foreign donors in addition to donations from various parties. Since the outbreak of the war in the Pacific, this supply has been cut off. After the rice supply was exhausted, they relied on household registration rice for support. However, the amount of household registration rice was often far from meeting the needs, and they had to supplement it with some mixed grains and retail rice. In addition, two nuns from the Old People's Home regularly solicited donations from all walks of life in Shanghai, mainly from various vegetable markets, large hotels, and various general associations, looking for food. In the past, the daily intake was quite considerable, with whole boxes of bread and biscuits, whole chickens and ducks, as well as fish, meat, and vegetables being donated by philanthropists. As a result, the elderly ate well every day, with both vegetarian and meat dishes, and were very fortunate. But this was a year and a half ago. Now, life is very difficult in all circles, especially for foreign merchants, and food sources are becoming less and less abundant. But the reporter still saw snacks and biscuits donated by Sullivan, as well as wheat porridge, dried vegetables, and seafood donated from other foreign food stores. After being prepared, they smelled delicious, and the elderly chewed on them with relish.

The kitchen, after dinner was over at this time, had been cleaned very thoroughly. Iron carts and brass carts for transporting food were lined up along the corridor. The ingredients needed for tomorrow's breakfast were also prepared. After all, under the leadership of the nuns, it was different from being managed by other men. There was not the unpleasant smell of a large restaurant kitchen at all. On the contrary, the huge and impressive Sino-Western cooking equipment in the stove, the shiny pots and pans, and the steaming hot water were all pleasing. From this, a gentleman need not stay far from the kitchen.

### Prospects for the Price Problem

— Xiao

If prices are not stable for one day, people's hearts will not be at peace for one day. The majority of the working masses cannot sleep soundly, which affects production and work, which in turn affects social order. The outcome of a war depends half on the battlefield and half on the economy and society. To win a military victory, one must have well-equipped and well-trained soldiers. To win an economic victory, one must first stabilize the people's economic lives. Therefore, for the sake of oneself, for the sake of society, and for the sake of the country's war effort, apart from a few exploitative classes and those who deliberately fish in troubled waters, who would want prices to rise? Who would have the heart for prices to rise?

In times of war, who does not know that production is difficult? Who does not know that there is a shortage of materials? This is a well-known major deficiency in the wartime economy. Taking the country as a premise, we should find ways to make up for this deficiency. How can we use this opportunity to hoard materials and seek exorbitant profits! If those who get rich by this means think that even if they are established entrepreneurs, they can look down on everything, then everyone in the world would be a major capitalist! Who knows that in reality, such people are the criminals of the country. If hoarding is said to be the only way to make money, then may I ask, the three famous American tycoons, Henry Ford, Rockefeller, and Carnegie, did they get rich by hoarding cars, hoarding kerosene, or hoarding steel? Tao Zhugong, as everyone knows, was a famous wealthy man in ancient China, but history tells us that the reason he became rich was not by hoarding.

Furthermore, is hoarding to make money really beneficial? Our answer is: it is not beneficial. Because in a commodity society, everyone is a commodity owner. Even a worker who has nothing has his commodity (labor). If the price of your commodity rises, the price of my commodity can also rise. If the price of rice rises, the price of sesame oil will also rise, the price of clothing will also rise, and the wages of workers will also rise. Everyone raising prices is equivalent to not raising prices. The money earned by the rice hoarder is taken away by the oil hoarder, and then taken away by the cloth hoarder. As a result, the money earned by Xian is still earned by others (even if there is a surplus, it is negligible).

The benefit of making money by hoarding is not obtained, but the economic crisis caused by hoarding may occur. What crisis? That is, capital is concentrated in hoarding and does not go to engage in production. The less production, the more scarce the materials, and as a result, the entire society will experience two crises: a material panic and a credit inflation.

In short, we believe that suppressing and stabilizing prices is something that conforms to the will of Heaven and the hearts of the people. There is no need to discuss it further here. As for the methods of suppression and stabilization, they can be summarized into three:

First, increase production.

Second, maintain currency credit.

Third, crack down on speculation and hoarding.

From a fundamental point of view, naturally only the first and second methods can make prices naturally stabilize. But fundamental methods cannot take effect immediately, and to concentrate capital on production, we must first reduce opportunities for excessive profits. Therefore, we believe that to suppress and stabilize prices now, we must first implement the third method. However, there are many people in society who advocate this method, and the government has been implementing it for a long time, but why is it still not effective? Why are prices still rising? There must be other reasons for this. We once said: As long as the power of the government is within reach, it will never allow the abnormal development of wartime profits to continue indefinitely. We have seen the price situation in Shanghai, and we cannot help but deeply feel the government's economic center. Therefore, we feel that the fact that prices have not been suppressed and stabilized to this day must also be attributed to the government's lack of power.

This is the actual state of prices in Shanghai now, and it is also the actual state of prices as a whole. But this state exists with the existence of the concession areas. Now that the concession areas have been reclaimed, this state will naturally disappear. At this moment, the power of the government can extend into this economic center of China. The government's policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices will not and should not be changed. But the implementation methods of this policy will definitely have a thorough reform in the future. Wartime prices must not be allowed to develop freely, and as long as the government exerts its power and persists to the end, it will definitely achieve the goal of implementing the policy of suppressing and stabilizing prices. When the opportunity for excessive profits disappears, floating capital will naturally run to the path of production. At that time, not only will there not be a phenomenon of floating capital not finding a place to go, but there will instead be a feeling of insufficient production capital.
