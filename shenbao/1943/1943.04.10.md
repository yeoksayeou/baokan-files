### Thoroughly Investigating Hoarding Requires Breaking the "Emphasis on Sentiment over Law"

Yesterday, our editorial on "Separating Officials from Merchants" had points left unsaid. Chinese human relationships are truly too complex. Without radical reforms, any good laws and beautiful systems will always yield results that are half as effective as intended. We are now striving for national independence and freedom, and we can no longer afford to be dilatory and careless.

As discussed yesterday, this time the government's thorough investigation of large-scale hoarding in Shanghai is a wise measure taken by the government to stabilize people's livelihoods. To be more specific, the government's determination to thoroughly investigate hoarding can be said to be a means. Its purpose should not be limited to punishing a few evildoers. Instead, the goods obtained through this thorough investigation must be confiscated in full. After the government confiscates a large amount of materials, it can use them to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. This is the main purpose of the government's thorough investigation of hoarding.

Our most sincere wishes are: first, that the government consistently uphold its position; and second, that we support the investigating officials in conducting a fair and impartial investigation. Originally, these two points are already matters of responsibility, and even if we don't say them, they should be done. Third, our people must reform themselves and thoroughly change the atmosphere. I would like to reiterate as follows:

First, for the government to implement a thorough investigation of hoarding and even adjust prices, the first thing needed is for all people to abide by national laws and further assist the government in implementing laws. This spirit and this principle are inherently required and understood by modern citizens and need no further explanation. However, in our society that values sentiment over law, it is necessary to vigorously promote and advocate for it. Why has our price problem become so serious? The main point is that our social habits are too loose and too casual, causing national laws to become mere formalities. The Chinese people have the virtue of leniency and the nature of freedom. The extreme of leniency becomes indulgence and appeasement; the extreme of freedom becomes casual and careless. If these two habits continue to develop, leniency will become indiscrimination, and freedom will become disunity. This is already a burden on national construction and revitalization in peacetime, and in times of tense war, it will add infinite difficulties. Now that the government is determined to ban hoarding, it will naturally enforce it strictly without leniency or indulgence, and the people of the whole country must automatically abide by the law and automatically enforce the law. The government has promulgated many economic laws, but society is almost indifferent. There are certainly many people who deliberately commit crimes, but there are countless people who unintentionally disregard the law and fall into illegality without even realizing it. In big cities, many rich people indulge in unrestrained desires, while the poor have no food or clothing. The rich enjoy themselves without shame, which is hateful, but everyone is used to it and does not impose social sanctions. It is especially shameful that people do not know that there is law. Our traditional morality of valuing sentiment over reason and bending the law for the sake of personal relationships is really unacceptable. This traditional habit is the evil consequence we are suffering today. Everyone remember: we must emphasize reason and abide by the law. There must be a style of breaking through personal relationships in society, and there must be a spirit of upholding justice even at the expense of family in the government. To change customs and overcome difficulties together, we must start with the people automatically abiding by the law.

Second, unscrupulous merchants and those who make a fortune from troubled waters must restrain themselves and not test the law. The government has made a great determination to launch this thorough investigation of hoarding. In order to implement this great determination, it has clearly stated "no matter who it is, they will be punished severely." Therefore, in times of chaos, heavy penalties are used. Today, it is even more necessary to punish one as a warning to a hundred. The ancients said, "It is better for one family to cry than for the whole road to cry." Severe punishment of the wicked is to warn the public and protect the majority. We, with the intention of benevolence, warn unscrupulous merchants to quickly withdraw, as the lessons are not far away.

Third, officials must not break the law while enforcing it, otherwise they will suffer strange disasters. In the past, the reason why hoarding and speculation were so prevalent was that the people were lazy, the merchants were cunning, and the officials were corrupt. Because the people did not know how to actively abide by the law, unscrupulous merchants were able to sell their cunning skills, and unscrupulous officials were able to fish in troubled waters. Now that there are clear laws and severe penalties, the people will know to be cautious and abide by the law, and the merchants will fear the punishment and fear the law, so officials will not be able to play with the law. Because everyone is following the rules and regulations, eating frugally and saving money, if officials still abuse their power to embezzle and pervert the law, then they will inevitably be intolerable to public anger and suffer strange disasters. Let us give two examples to prove the power of "if there is injustice, there will be a cry for justice." Last year, Germany invited a group of Turkish journalists to visit Berlin and specially allowed the Turkish journalists to eat twice as much food. This caused discontent among the German people in the cafeteria, and they intervened collectively, causing the government receptionists to apologize on both sides. On the one hand, they explained to the people that it was to treat foreign guests favorably, and on the other hand, they asked the Turkish journalist group to forgive them, and finally reduced the food by half before they were able to resolve the situation. Also, a few years ago, in order to conserve materials, Japan banned people from heating fires in winter. One day, a fire broke out in the neighborhood of Heitaro Hiranuma. In order to rescue the fire and grab things, several baskets of charcoal were moved out of the Hiranuma's house. As a result, the crowd was in an uproar. The government banned people from heating fires, so why did the Hiranuma's have charcoal? Later, the police and security guards earnestly comforted them, saying that Hiranuma was old and afraid of the cold, and the charcoal in his house was given to him by his students and old friends. They asked for forgiveness. These may seem like small things, and they are not cases of officials abusing their power to embezzle and pervert the law, but public anger is still difficult to violate. From this, we can see how absolutely the people of Japan and Germany usually abide by national laws. Their officials naturally dare not do evil. Therefore, everyone's life is hard, only the officials are fat, not only will the government use strict laws to restrain them, but the people will certainly not agree.

In the end, if this time the government's determined investigation of large-scale hoarding unfortunately falls into the circle of traditional morality that values sentiment over law and ends silently, or lets go of big fish and catches small fish, we cannot bear to say and do not need to say the consequences. The task is heavy and the road is long, may everyone cherish it.

### Japanese Prime Minister Fetes Special Envoy Chen at His Official Residence Yesterday, and Held Lengthy Talks Beforehand

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Chen Gongbo of the Chinese visit to Japan began visiting former Special Envoys to China, Kiichiro Hiranuma, Hachiro Arita, and Ryutaro Nagai at 9 o'clock today.

The talks lasted about an hour and a half, followed by a welcome dinner hosted by the Prime Minister at 6:30.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo hosted a banquet at his official residence at 6:30 p.m. today to welcome Special Envoy Chen Gongbo and his entourage from the Republic of China. Chinese Ambassador to Japan Xu Liang, former Vice-Chairman Suzuki of the Japanese Privy Council, Chief of Staff Sugiyama, Vice Chief of the Naval General Staff Ito, President of the House of Peers Matsudaira, Mayor of Tokyo Kishimoto, President of the East Asia League Shino, Prince Konoe Fumimaro, Hiranuma Kiichiro, Arita Hachiro, and over two hundred others attended. On the host side, Prime Minister Tojo and all the ministers attended. During the banquet, Prime Minister Tojo delivered a welcome speech, and Special Envoy Chen delivered a speech in response.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Welcome Speech

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered a welcome speech at the banquet for Special Envoy Chen's visit to Japan. The general idea is as follows:

"Although it has only been three years since the National Government returned to the capital, its development can be said to be rapid. On January 9th of this year, it resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States to eradicate the long-standing scourge of East Asia. This is completely in line with the Empire's belief in the co-prosperity of all nations and the construction of Greater East Asia. The Empire will work together with [China] in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, sharing weal and woe, and sharing life and death. When I visited the Republic of China last time, I witnessed the hopefulness of the Chinese people and their engagement in construction, and I was deeply moved. The rapid development of China is due to the tireless efforts of Chairman Wang and Minister Chen Gongbo. Here, I express my deepest respect. The Imperial Government sincerely prays for and strives to realize the sound development of China, and will spare no effort to assist. To achieve this goal, the Empire, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, returned the Imperial leased territories in China and recognized China's recovery of the administrative rights over the Beijing Embassy District and the Xiamen Public Concession. This is the first step the Empire can take to help China fulfill its expectations of abolishing unequal treaties. Other related countries have also followed suit with the Empire's measures. China's century-old grievances and various problems have gradually been resolved here. The joy of the 400 million Chinese people can be inferred, and the Empire also expresses its congratulations. In the future, we will do our best to cooperate and hope that all of you in China will manage this major global change well. At the same time as the establishment of the Greater East Asia New Order and the development of the new China, contribute to the construction of East Asia. I am convinced that Special Envoy Chen's visit this time will not only make the relations between China and Japan closer but will also greatly benefit the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Here, I hope that after Special Envoy Chen completes his mission and returns to his country, he will further cooperate with the Empire to achieve the common goal of defeating Britain and the United States and liberating East Asia."

Special Envoy Chen's Reply

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Chen gave a reply at Prime Minister Tojo's welcoming banquet. The full text is as follows: "Minister of General Affairs, Honorable Ministers, Honorable Guests, today I am honored and grateful to visit your country on behalf of my government and to receive the Prime Minister's gracious hospitality. I recall with pleasure Prime Minister Tojo's visit to our country last month to reply to our Chairman, and it was a great pleasure to hear his insightful remarks. Today, I once again see his brilliant demeanor and hear his wise teachings, which further excite my heart. Your country's return of all exclusive Japanese concessions in China, recognition of China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Embassy District, the abolition of extraterritoriality and other favorable measures, and its efforts to support the construction of a new China, and in the future, in response to the development of the new relationship between China and Japan, it has also decided to reconsider various existing agreements in the same spirit, and, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the return of the National Government to the capital, it first implemented the return of exclusive concessions and cooperated in the return of the Beijing Embassy District and the Xiamen Public Concession. All these decisions are sufficient to show your country's determination to assist China's freedom and independence, liberate the nations of East Asia, and build a new order in East Asia. They are also sufficient to show that the Prime Minister has lofty ideals and great ambitions, and the courage and enthusiasm to reform the political era of the old world order. This is something that our country cannot express its heartfelt gratitude in words. This time I am visiting your country on behalf of my country to express our sincere thanks. Our country is honored to be able to follow your country in participating in the Greater East Asia War and to fulfill its due strength and responsibility. I know that our abilities are weak, but we are driven by the oppression of British and American imperialism for a century, the demands of justice and conscience, and the enthusiasm of your country to liberate the nations of East Asia, so we do not consider the weakness of our strength, but seek the peace of our conscience. In this Greater East Asia War, with your country's superior manpower and material resources, the foundation for certain victory has long been laid. The foundation of our nation lies in the spirit of eternal cooperation between China and Japan and the determination to share weal and woe and share life and death. I sincerely hope to follow your country and share the responsibilities that we should bear. Our country's determination is not limited to declaring war. We hope to contribute all our material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War as much as possible. We hope that your country will recognize our sincerity and give us close cooperation and vigorous support. I recall that three years ago, I was ordered to visit your country to return the courtesy, and I was hosted by former Prime Minister Rice. I once said, "I personally believe that China and Japan will have to jointly shoulder the great task of East Asia." I did not expect that today our country can truly follow your country in participating in the Greater East Asia War. This is not only the honor of the people of our country, but also the honor of myself. I hope that the Prime Minister and all the ministers will not hesitate to educate us so that China can follow your country and complete this epoch-making mission and task, then the people of our country will truly share in the honor."

### Statement Issued After Arriving in Manchuria

Xinjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Special Envoy Zhou Fohai of the Republic of China to visit Manchuria issued a statement after arriving in Xinjing, stating that he had long wanted to visit your country, and he was very pleased to have his wish fulfilled at a time when the Greater East Asia War was making progress. The purpose of his visit this time was, first, to strengthen the relationship between China and Manchuria so that they could work together with their ally Japan to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and second, to study the economic construction achievements of Manchuria over the past decade as a reference for the revitalization of China. The relationship between China and Manchuria has been based on the foundation of friendship between the two countries since the issuance of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchuria. Last May, Chairman Wang of the National Government visited your country to promote the friendship between China and Manchuria. In June of the same year, Prime Minister Zhang Jinghui of your country visited China to reciprocate. The relationship between China and Manchuria has been further enhanced in friendship and closeness due to the mutual visits of the leaders of the two countries. On January 9th of this year, the National Government implemented a declaration of war against Britain and the United States. China and its ally Japan have moved from a connection of sharing weal and woe to a combination of sharing life and death. China and Manchuria must therefore cooperate more closely. The purpose of his visit this time was to respond to the new situation of China's participation in the war and to have sincere discussions with the dignitaries of your country on various issues in order to strengthen the cooperation between China and Manchuria and enhance the strength of cooperation between China, Japan, and Manchuria. The enhancement of this strength is the guarantee for winning the Greater East Asia War. The National Government deeply feels that its responsibilities are great and its tasks are arduous since it declared its participation in the war. Moreover, China's national strength and people's strength are both in decline, and it is deeply feared that its strength is insufficient. In order to be able to complete the purpose of the war, the National Government has made every effort to carry out various wartime facilities since its participation in the war. For example, in politics, it has reformed the administrative institutions of the central and local governments; in finance, it has adjusted bank lending to stabilize finance and suppress prices; in terms of material control, it has established a Material Control Review Committee and a National Commercial Control Association in order to ensure the smooth flow of goods and the full use of materials; in the military, it has reorganized the existing troops in order to enhance its strength; in terms of public security, it has strengthened the Qingxiang work, expanded the Qingxiang area, and successively held the National Local Officials Conference, the National Judicial Administration Conference, the New National Movement Promotion Conference, the National Economic Conference, the National Military Conference, the National Education Administration Conference, and the National Congress of the Chinese Nationalist Party. The above-mentioned work is all to establish a wartime system, enhance combat capabilities, and make a greater contribution to the Greater East Asia War. China and Manchuria are adjacent to each other, each with vast territories and abundant resources. If they can make every effort to develop and utilize them well, they can become pillars for stabilizing East Asia and prospering East Asia. They can also cooperate with allies to quickly complete the construction of the New East Asia. Your country has made every effort to develop and utilize the treasures of Manchuria for more than a decade, creating great and impressive economic construction. I am planning to take advantage of this visit to study the process and results of your country's economic construction, and I am also planning to have sincere talks with the government leaders, hoping to learn from your country's existing construction experience and achievements so that China's economic construction can be easily effective. If China's manpower is strong and its material resources are rich, if it can be used well and developed, not only can China's national strength be strengthened and the people can be enriched, but it can also make a great contribution to the construction of various friendly countries and the construction of Greater East Asia. China, Japan, and Manchuria must be firmly united to form the axis of East Asia, so that on the one hand, we can unite the countries and nations within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere to form a strong East Asian group, and on the other hand, we can form a strong world group with Germany, Italy, and other European Axis allies. If this can be the case, not only can the forces of Britain and the United States be eliminated in East Asia, but also the rule policy of Britain and the United States can be shattered in the entire world situation. China and Manchuria are interdependent and have the same bloodline. We must be of one mind and one body, unite sincerely, and jointly complete the mission we should bear. This is my hope and the purpose of my visit to your country.

### Japanese Army in China Releases Weekly Battle Report

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Dispatch Army in China released on April 9th that in the area north of Thaton, the Japanese army has since late December of last year surrounded and annihilated two divisions of the British Indian Army that were stirring up trouble, reaping great results. The enemy's propaganda has already mentioned the recapture of Burma. As a result of this operation by the Japanese army, it has been proven that the British Indian army's will to fight and combat power are extremely fragile. Moreover, the Chongqing side has not taken any action in Yunnan, exposing the shortcomings of the enemy's joint operations, confirming that Chongqing lacks weapons and ammunition, and is a specialist without any counter-offensive ability during the training period. Moreover, since late March, Japanese aircraft have learned that the US Air Force in China intends to carry out air strikes on the mainland, so they preemptively launched air strikes on Hengyang, Lingling, Lishui, Jian'ou, and other places on the 30th and 31st of this month. In the north of Lingling, an air battle occurred with 24 Chongqing D-40 type aircraft. It is estimated that four Chongqing aircraft were shot down, which shows that the Japanese Air Force has controlled the enemy's attempt to carry out air strikes on Japan and ensured air supremacy in Chongqing.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Imperial Headquarters in Tokyo announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 9th that the Imperial Naval Air Corps carried out a large-scale air raid on enemy ships in the Florida Island area of the Solomon Islands on April 7th. The results and our losses are as follows: (Results) Sinking one enemy cruiser, one destroyer, ten transport ships, severely damaging two transport ships, slightly damaging one transport ship, shooting down thirty-seven enemy aircraft. Six of our aircraft self-destructed. (This naval battle is called the Naval Battle of Florida Island).

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the Japanese army in the Solomon Islands implemented a shift-in-defense operation, the enemy forces in the southern Solomon Islands, still centered on Guadalcanal Island, with Florida and Russell Islands as their east and west wings, are still attempting to counterattack, and are accumulating soldiers, weapons, and tigers, looking forward to trying. However, the Japanese naval aircraft large formation was launched during the daytime on the 7th, slamming into the enemy ships and aircraft forces that were currently parked on the surface of Florida Island. Completely hit and set on fire, sinking into the fierce flames, and then successively sinking, the enemy's attempt to politically counterattack has suffered a great setback. As a result, the Japanese aircraft finally sank one enemy cruiser, one destroyer, two large transport ships of 8,000 tons, two medium-sized 5,000-ton ships, and two small 3,000-ton ships, and severely damaged one medium-sized and one small transport ship each, and destroyed one large transport ship. The enemy's fighter groups were also slammed by Japanese aircraft, and 30 new aircraft, 6 N33-type aircraft, and 1 airship were shot down, totaling 37 aircraft. Among the great achievements of the Japanese army this time, the sinking of a large number of enemy transport ships can be characterized.

The island is located about 40 kilometers north of Guadalcanal Island, and the climate is still good. The Ziraki Port on the island is a natural good port. The residents are Melanesians. Two-thirds of the island is covered by jungle. Only the south coast is densely populated. Before the war, there were more than 300 white residents, with the British Governor's Office, churches, hospitals, courts, customs offices, and other institutions. Sanitary facilities were also quite complete, making it a relatively popular island in the Solomon Islands.

### Japanese Army Fiercely Attacks the Kyauktaw Area; British Army Outposts Have Retreated

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese army had previously launched annihilation battles in the Kaladan operation and Kyauksew, and the enemy has already admitted defeat. On March 18th, the Indian Anti-Axis Army issued a statement saying that the Japanese army's offensive on the east bank of the Mayu River in the Arakan front was still continuing. In order to prevent the troops north of Razabil from being isolated, the Anti-Axis Army felt it was necessary to reorganize the front line. Recently, in the dry area of the Kaladan River, the British detached force has joined forces with the main force. Furthermore, Reuters war correspondent Firot reported that the Japanese army is currently actively reinforcing its forces and is fiercely attacking the British army's front-line positions in the Kyauktaw area of the Kaladan River. Therefore, the British army outposts have retreated to the main force positions, and have withdrawn four miles northeast of the Kyauktaw area, reaching the Ahbaw Kunlapin area. The Japanese army's transportation line is extremely convenient. On the contrary, the British army's transportation lines are all mountainous areas. In the Mayu River area, the Japanese army bombarded the British army positions three miles away and, after occupying a certain high ground, is currently attempting to encircle the British army in the area north of Razabil.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Japanese Army Air Corps stationed in Burma, on the 6th, used a large formation of fighter-bombers to fiercely bomb the Akola airfield, about 200 kilometers northwest of Chittagong, reaping great results and returning safely to their original defenses.

Although my strength is weak, I have the support of all the units that have won a hundred battles, and I have the determination to defeat any remnants of the enemy, whether in India or in Chongqing. However, I specifically clarified that I am willing to do my best with my subordinates and soldiers to complete the great cause of East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity. First, I express my gratitude to the Burmese people for overcoming various difficulties in wartime, enduring sacrifices, and cooperating with our defense forces.

### Fierce Battles in Southern and Central Tunisia, British Encirclement Plan Ultimately Unsuccessful

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a military correspondent for the Havas News Agency, fierce battles continue in southern and central Tunisia. The Anti-Axis forces are constantly reinforcing. The British Eighth Army has broken through the defenses held by Axis infantry, but a counter-attack by Axis armored forces failed to recover the situation. However, this German action was not without success, as it prevented the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area west of El Guettar from being encircled. According to General Montgomery's plan, after this breakthrough, the British forces would use tank columns to advance north directly towards Maknassy, which has been the center of operations for the U.S. Fifth Army in recent weeks. If the British tank columns could realize this plan by the early morning of the third period (unclear meaning from original article) and make contact with the U.S. forces, the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area would have their lines of communication cut off. Fortunately, a counter-attack by Marshal Rommel's tank forces prevented the success of this British plan. The Axis forces, in fierce fighting, obtained the opportunity to withdraw completely without being encircled. However, a portion of General Montgomery's motorized forces ultimately advanced westward along the northern edge of the road to Tozeur and made contact with the U.S. forces east of El Guettar. By this time, the Axis forces in the Djebel Cans area had completely withdrawn and were no longer threatened. Therefore, the British and U.S. forces met outside the Axis lines. At the same time, Marshal Rommel shifted his southern front line to a new position, using the hills east of Maknassy as the main base for his right flank. Details of the new Axis positions in the coastal area are not yet known. In the plains, which are gradually becoming the site of operations, the Anti-Axis forces should be able to fully exploit their numerical and equipment superiority, so the new Axis defensive lines may be under the greatest pressure. Further north in central Tunisia, fierce fighting may also occur. The Anti-Axis forces may once again attempt to strike towards the coast to cut off the Axis forces in southern Tunisia. After the first failed eastward offensive, the Anti-Axis forces may launch another eastward attack further north, generally advancing from the Pichon area towards Kairouan and Sousse. In the past few days, the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army at Pichon has been greatly reinforced, and the elite British troops now appearing in the area seem to be intended to serve as the vanguard when the Anti-Axis forces launch an offensive in this area. This British unit seems to have been transferred from the British First Army front line in northern Tunisia. Even after transferring this unit, the British First Army still has sufficient strength to assist in an offensive with a large number of tanks in the Medjez el Bab area on Wednesday, but they were repulsed and heavily damaged by the Axis forces.

### Wartime Economy and Sino-Japanese Cooperation: Minister of Industry Mei's Remarks to Japanese Reporters (2)

Question: How long will it take to complete the reorganization of trade associations? Approximately when...?

Answer: It varies depending on the industry. Some are already very well-established, while others need to be reorganized. The Ministry of Industry plans to complete all the organizational structures by the end of April.

Question: The issues concerning the five regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai have been temporarily resolved. As for the relationship with North China, or with Wuhan, Guangdong, and other places, how will the domestic trade structure be reorganized?

Answer: Trade with Guangdong or Hankou is relatively simple because the currency system is already unified. For other regions, although various methods are being devised due to the lack of currency unification, the domestic trade structure will ultimately be adjusted under the overall plan of the National Federation of Trade Associations.

Question: What about Japan, Manchuria, and Southeast Asia within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? What is the relationship between this trade structure and Japan?

Answer: Yes, for the Co-Prosperity Sphere, that is, so-called foreign trade, we will organize another trade association (tentatively named) in the form of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, different from the National Federation of Trade Associations. It will be jointly managed by Chinese and Japanese personnel.

Question: When is this scheduled to happen?

Answer: It can also be realized by the end of April.

Question: Secondly, regarding the reorganization of institutions in the mining and industrial sectors, such as heavy industry and light industry departments, will any research be conducted? Trade associations or collaboration associations?

Answer: The control of mining and light industry is not yet included in the National Federation of Commercial Control Associations, but the control in this area can be completed very simply, and it will ultimately be subject to separate control. Anyway, raw materials and their finished products can be controlled by commercial control methods. The scope is narrow, so control is also easy to implement. For example, the Industrial Federation has already been established, and the Coal Industry Federation and the Textile Industry Federation have also been established. In the future, we only need to strengthen them.

Question: In this area, measures to increase production seem more important than reorganizing institutions. What plans are currently in place for measures to increase production in relation to industry?

Answer: There are two ways to think about increasing production: increasing production in the industrial or agricultural sector by improving technology to naturally increase production. At the same time, this time, we will use commercial control methods from the side, not only to increase industrial production, but also to increase agricultural production. In short, the adjustment of prices can indirectly promote the increase in production.

After the exploitation of middlemen is completely eliminated, it is believed that production will be promoted directly and indirectly.

Question: Regarding production in the agricultural sector, for example, the problem of farmers returning to their hometowns, abandoned farmland, and no one to cultivate it, while vagrants gather in cities and struggle to survive. It seems necessary to regulate this flow of people from the production sector to the consumption sector!

Answer: There is not a severe shortage of labor in rural areas. The government does not intend to encourage farmers to return to their hometowns because there is no shortage of labor in reality. For example, recently, most of the wasteland has already been under development. You can see it on the train, and you can see a lot of newly reclaimed land from the plane.

Question: Rural finance is also a problem, such as purchasing seeds, farm tools, fertilizers, etc., and various funds are needed for reclamation. How can rural finance be improved, and what are the countermeasures?

Answer: That plan has already been completed. With the Bank of Communications in Shanghai as the center, many banks have organized a "Rural Finance Bank Consortium," determined the policy of lending to rural areas, the investigation has also been completed, and it will be implemented next month.

Question: At that time, the interest rate may become a considerable problem! What is the approximate interest rate from the office to the cooperative?

Answer: The Ministry of Finance is currently adopting a high-interest rate policy to combat speculation. This is to prevent speculation, so we try to raise the interest rate as much as possible to make speculation difficult. After the control of materials is complete in the future, speculation will naturally disappear, so the interest rate will gradually decrease, and only after the decrease can loans be given to the rural sector. Loans to the rural sector should, of course, have a spirit of low interest rates.

Question: Financial institutions lend like this, but in reality, farm tools, seeds, or reclamation are mostly related to the Construction Department. It is thought that there are already concrete measures for water conservancy or the manufacturing of farm tools. Please explain.

Answer: Both sides are currently carrying out considerable plans. Regarding farm tools, the former National Economic Commission cooperated with Japan to establish a relatively large-scale farm tool manufacturing plant in Wuxi, which will supply farm tools to farmers at very low prices in the future. Regarding water conservancy, the Ministry of Construction is now working hard to establish water conservancy plans in various aspects. The Minister of Construction seems to advocate avoiding damage to rural areas and promoting plans in this area.

Question: The issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Because Sino-Japanese cooperation has become closer recently, it is in a state of comprehensive progress. Regarding this issue, please explain.

Answer: I am very optimistic about Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. As a practical matter, if China has so-called heavy industry, then, in general, the Chinese side hopes to cooperate with Japan. As for light industry, it seems that the Chinese side should make efforts in the supply of raw materials.

Question: In the industrial sector, cooperate with Japan in terms of capital; in the light industry sector, China supplies raw materials and Japan operates it. China hopes to operate light industry itself. What does this mean?

Answer: This is the only core issue. Of course, we hope to cooperate in capital in the heavy industry sector, but it is not said that capital cooperation is not allowed. Light industry also does not exclude Japanese participation, but it means that if Chinese people can operate light industry themselves, let Chinese people operate it themselves. It seems that there is no need for cooperation in this area now. This is how it should be in certain necessary measures, and it is by no means saying that cooperation is bad in principle. The current situation is a state where we cannot but adopt the principle of emphasis.

Question: Among the more than a thousand cases of British and American enemy property, many are economically related. How will China operate them?

Answer: I plan to obtain detailed materials and then conduct specific research.

Question: In the meantime, it seems necessary for national capital to participate considerably. At the same time, what are the plans for government financial revenue? For example, for companies returned by Japan, will the government sell all these shares to the public, so that the government obtains temporary financial revenue? Or will the government continue to hold these shares and use the dividend income to enrich government finances? What are the plans for the operation of enemy property in this regard?

Answer: Of course, anyone is thinking about using it for financial revenue. However, the government does not seem to have specific plans on how to handle it at present, and even the Ministry of Finance has not yet conducted research in this area.

Question: It is expected that there will be many economic aspects among the enemy property to be returned in the second and third times. This issue is a very important financial issue. Has the government not thought about this?

Answer: In terms of adjusting financial and economic issues, the Chinese government and the embassy have completed various studies and preparations based on the nature of the companies. The nature of the companies is different, so it is impossible to generalize. For example, companies that are in two extremes and cannot operate have no need to exist. Therefore, it differs depending on the nature and content of the company. Both sides have drafted considerable proposals, which cannot be announced yet.

Question: When can it be realized?

Answer: It can be handled all at once, or solved gradually one by one.

Question: President Takashima once said: After most of it is returned to the Chinese side, the civilian industries will generally be operated by the Chinese side themselves. The funding plan will also be based on the principle of emphasis this time. Therefore, after the civilian industries are returned to the Chinese side, the funds will generally be raised locally. Can the Chinese side supply these funds in Changdi? Will the civilian industries returned to Changdi and the enemy property recently transferred to the National Government be regarded as China's own finance? If they are returned to national capital, will they be reinvested in Japanese national policy companies?

Answer: The participation of national capital is very easy and not difficult at all.

Question: Next, we would like to ask about the issue of stabilizing people's livelihoods and prices. In order to stabilize people's livelihoods, we must first allocate daily necessities proportionally. To implement the proportional allocation system, we must first investigate the population and investigate households. Now the parties concerned are in trouble because they do not know how many people are in each family. For the sake of future rationing control, haven't you fundamentally thought about investigating the population and reorganizing household registration?

Answer: Although not as strict as in Japan, the household survey is now roughly completed. For example, major cities have citizen certificates, good citizen certificates, etc., which will be closely implemented in the future proportional allocation of materials.

Question: The problem of official prices. Maintaining the official prices of daily necessities will probably be completed soon? For example, can cigarettes be sold at official prices? Is it the same everywhere? If necessities such as rice, soap, candles, matches, and cigarettes are distributed at official prices, it is the best way to stabilize people's livelihoods.

Answer: The first step is to implement the official system starting from a very small number of daily necessities.

Question: To maintain official prices, rationing must be implemented. For example, what is the current method for cigarettes? They are cheap in Japanese stores but expensive in Chinese stores. In cheap places, you can't buy them at any time, while some places have expensive goods. In this case, is the official price system for cigarettes possible?

Answer: Official prices have been established. However, it is impossible to implement official prices that are too far from the actual market prices, that is a certain principle. Therefore, it is the first key point to make official prices naturally implemented. Another key point is to ensure materials. If you cannot have sufficient materials, official prices are certainly futile. If you pay attention to these two points, I don't think there is anything you can't do.

Question: In order to maintain official prices, Japan is strengthening economic police. Do you have this intention here?

Answer: This has been implemented by the Ministry of Interior. Currently, the first group of 40 economic police officers is being trained. Their level is higher than that of ordinary police officers, and they must be higher than ordinary police officers in terms of knowledge and treatment. Such police officers will continue to be trained in the future. The first 40 or so will be active in the Nanjing area.

Question: Speculation in commodities seems to be caused by idle funds, which is related to the Ministry of Finance. The crackdown in this area seems to be very lenient.

Answer: The Ministry of Finance is currently studying this. When the trade association structure is complete in the future, this phenomenon will naturally disappear. At present, loans for speculation are not within the trade association but are speculators outside the industry. After the trade association structure is complete in the future, the Ministry of Industry will issue strict orders to bankers at the same time, strictly prohibiting loans to merchants outside the industry. This is an inevitable trend.

Question: Does the Gold Industry Trade Association participate in the National Federation of Commercial Control?

Answer: Yes. The current chairman of the National Federation of Commercial Control is Mr. Tang Shoumin, a representative of the financial community. Financial control and commercial control will proceed smoothly at the same time in the future.

Question: Cooperation between China and Japan in this way makes the economic power of production and commerce in the peaceful areas very strong. Therefore, compared with the non-peaceful area of Chongqing, this place seems to have an advantage from an economic point of view. In the political aspect, a state of comprehensive peace cannot be achieved because there are opposing opinions. But in the economic aspect, this great economic power seems to be able to extend to the Chongqing area through the contact area. The increase in this power can be said to be the realization of comprehensive economic peace. Regarding this point...

Answer: I believe that this will be successful. If control can proceed smoothly, people's livelihoods in the peaceful areas can be stabilized in half a year. At the same time, it can attract people from the enemy areas to return. Moreover, not only can the people's livelihoods in the peaceful areas be stabilized, but if we grasp the hearts of the people in the Chongqing area, I believe that this incident can also be resolved. Because the exchange of materials is not just materials, but emotions and thoughts can also be exchanged. (Xiang: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, March 29-31) (End)

### Thorough Investigation of Speculation and Hoarding: Deliberations on Implementation Methods, Punishing Past Speculative Behaviors, and Strictly Investigating Current Hoarding Locations

In light of the recent increasingly severe speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, the government authorities, understanding that most of those engaging in profiteering through hoarding are powerful figures in the financial and industrial sectors, believe that if such speculative and hoarding behaviors are not thoroughly investigated and curbed, they will cause further price increases, harm the people's livelihood and stability, and have a significant impact. Therefore, they have specially ordered Vice Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance, Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue of the Shanghai Municipal Government, and Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the National Commercial Control Association to thoroughly investigate illegal activities such as speculative buying and selling and hoarding of materials by financial and industrial institutions in the city. If proven true after investigation, they should immediately report to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment, and the confiscated goods will be confiscated and handed over to the public. It is reported that Chen Zhishuo, after receiving the order, has already arrived in Shanghai and yesterday (the 9th) convened a meeting with Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Secretary-General Zhao of the Municipal Government, Supervisor Chen Yunwen of the Commercial Control Association, and others to discuss the methods of thorough investigation. The thorough investigation is expected to begin immediately. It is said that all financial institutions and industrial and commercial circles in the city, including all past hidden speculative buying and selling activities and the destinations of materials currently hoarded, are targeted for thorough investigation. Those unscrupulous merchants who only seek personal gain and disregard the people's livelihood will find it difficult to escape the law and will be severely punished by the government.

### Shanghai West Police Bureau Orders Officers to Treat Citizens Kindly

Pan Da, the Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, in order to encourage all police officers to treat citizens with a kind attitude, issued an order yesterday, stating in brief: "The police authorities are responsible for protecting, nurturing, guiding the public, maintaining order, and defending public security. They have the closest relationship with the society. Officers should be able to be moderate and amiable in their dealings with people. Moreover, within the jurisdiction of this bureau, there are many important figures, government officials, both Chinese and foreign, residing here, and even more, courtesy should be comprehensive. Any rude words or deeds will be punished. It is imperative that the citizens develop affection and cooperation, trust and respect for this bureau. This Director has high hopes," and so on.

### Resumption of Pig Special Tax for Seawall Construction Projects

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government believes that the annual seawall projects in the Pudong, Baoshan, and Chongming districts of the city are of great importance and require a large amount of funding. Upon receiving an order from the Central Government, the provinces and cities should raise their own funds for the seawall projects. Although the municipal treasury has coordinated and paid for it, the funds are still insufficient. In order to ensure that the seawall project plans are not interrupted, it has been decided to resume the special pig tax in the city and to levy a tax of 20 yuan per pig, following the tax rate of Jiangsu Province, for funding. All pig transportation within the city limits should pay taxes according to the regulations.

### The Municipal Grain Bureau Rectifies Public Grain Sale Institutions in the City

Since the implementation of grain distribution according to population in the urban area, all institutions handling grain distribution according to population in each district have already been designated to be responsible for the public grain sale offices. These institutions should not be easily changed to avoid affecting grain distribution and increasing the difficulty for citizens to purchase rice. In order to effectively rectify the situation, the Municipal Grain Bureau has issued separate orders to the subordinate district offices stating that in the future, the designated public grain sale offices within each district should not be increased, decreased, or changed without the approval of the Bureau. All district offices should comply with and implement the policy of prioritizing the promotion of grain policy.

### Extra Rice for Rickshaw Pullers

According to the Shanghai Rickshaw Pullers Association, the second batch of rice purchase certificates, numbered 33 to 26, will be issued to rickshaw pullers from April 1st to 20th. Rickshaw owners can collect them from the certificate issuing office at 234 Ma Huo Road in the afternoons of each day, except Saturdays. In order to prevent fraud, the association requires that rickshaw owners' applications for rickshaw pullers' extra rice must be based on the rickshaw puller's license. However, the rickshaw puller's license is limited to rickshaw pullers whose certificates actually belong to the rickshaw owner, otherwise it will be invalid.

### Municipal Government Holds War Declaration Commemoration Ceremony

Yesterday (the 9th) was the fourth-month anniversary of the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States. The Municipal Government held a commemoration ceremony in the auditorium at 10:00 a.m. yesterday. Officials from all bureaus of the Municipal Government attended and performed the rituals. After the ceremony, the chairman read out the full text of the proclamation, and the ceremony concluded.

### Strict Prohibition of Drug Use: Judicial Personnel Should Set an Example, District Court Sets Deadline for Signing Pledges

Regarding the use of drugs by public officials, there are original prohibition rules, and judicial personnel should set an example to reverse the declining trend. The Ministry of Judicial Administration, based on the resolution of this year's National Judicial Administration Conference, strictly prohibits judicial officers from using drugs and has formulated rules for reporting and investigation, ordering all levels of courts under its jurisdiction to strictly comply with them. After receiving the order, the President of the Shanghai District Court has instructed his subordinates to sign pledges within a limited time and submit them together.

### Children's Welfare Symposium (I): Organized by the Social Service Department of This Newspaper

Children are the source of the nation and the future masters of the country. The significance of Children's Day lies in arousing the attention of society to children and paying attention to children's education and various welfare undertakings. In the past, very few Children's Days have yielded practical results. After the Children's Day celebrations, children's problems are often put aside.

On Children's Day this year, the Social Service Department of this newspaper specially invited workers from groups who have always been enthusiastic about children's issues and groups dedicated to the education of refugee children, in order to commemorate the 12th Children's Day in our country and to benefit the suffering children who are also the young masters of the country. In addition to specialized scholars, representatives from Catholic, Christian, Buddhist, and various charitable organizations engaged in the education of refugee children were present, marking the beginning of mutual assistance and unity among refugee children's education groups. It is hoped that they can cooperate permanently in the future to solve the difficult problems of the refugee children who have already been accommodated and those who are waiting to be accommodated.

Dr. Hu Zuyin: Having not engaged in the practical work of refugee children's education, I offer my opinions on the cooperation issues of refugee children's education groups from a third-party perspective, divided into two aspects, passive and active: (1) Passive cooperation: For example, the initiation of this Children's Welfare Symposium. The Children's Protection Section of the former Municipal Council also had similar initiatives, allowing for the joint exchange of experiences and joint research on all difficult issues. It is hoped that this type of symposium can be held regularly and can be rotated to various educational institutions to achieve the effect of mutual learning. (2) Active cooperation: It would be best if Shanghai's refugee children's education groups could be centrally managed, which would save a lot of manpower and resources. However, this is purely ideal and may be difficult to achieve in reality. Recently, due to the difficulty of providing supplies, some people have advocated dispersing refugee children to the countryside. Can Shanghai's education groups concentrate on running the system together? If so, food can be requested in the name of the entire education group, providing children with the greatest needs at the most economical nutrition. In addition, manpower can also be saved. This will naturally achieve better results in the entire refugee children's education undertaking.

Dr. Chen Shishi: Considering the high cost of living in cities, it is advisable for refugee children's education groups to relocate to the countryside. New teaching methods must be adopted for refugee children's education. Funding should be subsidized by the government. Normally, contact should be maintained with the education and social authorities to cooperate and divide labor. Orphanages that are structurally similar should be merged. The most important thing is to work together to improve the effectiveness of education.

### Tax Investigation Office Strictly Cracks Down on Tax Evasion by Transportation Merchants

The Tax Investigation Office of the Ministry of Finance has been established for more than three months and has spared no effort in promoting investigation work. According to the person in charge of the office, the local branches and investigation offices under the jurisdiction of the office have also been established one after another, and efforts have been made to promote tax investigation work. The income from various consolidated taxes, special taxes, and stamp duties on tobacco and alcohol in the spring of this year has increased sharply due to the sharp reduction in smuggling and tax evasion. Taking Shanghai, which is under the jurisdiction of the head office, as an example, in the past three months, hundreds of cases of violations and tax evasion have been detected, including goods from major companies. Due to unfamiliarity with declaration procedures, they are entrusted to unscrupulous transportation merchants to take shortcuts and evade taxes. Therefore, the transportation merchants who specialize in illegal profits will be strictly cracked down on to avoid losses to legitimate merchants. Recently, it has been found that unscrupulous individuals are extorting money under the name of the office. Personnel have also been dispatched to secretly investigate at any time. Once detected, they will be severely punished to ensure the safety of merchants. If people find counterfeit offenders, they can also hand them over to the local police authorities at any time to report the facts and deter cunning individuals.

### Air Defense Training to Be Conducted Again: Scheduled for Four Consecutive Days from the 12th of This Month

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command recently issued Notice No. 14, scheduling civilian air defense training for four consecutive days from the 12th of this month.

Regulations on the Passage of Emergency Vehicles Prescribed by the Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command

Shanghai News from the Central News Agency: The Shanghai Japanese Army and Navy Air Defense Command recently issued Special Notice No. 3, which provides detailed regulations on the passage of emergency vehicles in Article 5 of the Shanghai Air Defense Sound and Traffic Control Regulations. The content of the regulations is recorded as follows:

Special Regulations for the Passage of Emergency Vehicles

It shall be issued only if the Air Defense Command deems it absolutely necessary for public emergency.

(3) The vehicle owner who has obtained the special pass has the obligation to display the emergency vehicle identification on the vehicle and has the obligation to present the pass when requested by the traffic management agencies.

Remarks

(2) The emergency vehicle number is based on the special pass number.

### Rowe-Eden Talks Fail: Comments from the Tian Intelligence Department

Hirota, the intelligence chief of the Japanese Embassy Office, said at a routine meeting with foreign journalists yesterday that the anti-Axis powers completely disregarded more important issues, especially the issue of Chongqing. This is proof of the failure of Eden's mission to the United States. He also pointed out that Eden had virtually admitted the failure of talks with President Rowe in the House of Commons on Thursday, because the scope of the talks was limited to trivial matters, while the following important issues were obviously disregarded: (1) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards Chongqing; (2) The anti-Axis powers' position towards the Soviet Union; (3) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards the status of weak countries in the anti-Axis camp. According to Eden's explanation, he did not do this, but discussed with Rowe about the steps to be taken in the war and political cooperation, which cannot be disclosed at present. Hirota continued that even if the above three issues had been discussed by both sides, they would never have reached an understanding. On the point of political cooperation, Hirota said that it could be divided into four items: (1) The anti-Axis powers' attitude towards France; (2) The anti-Axis powers' position towards the neutral countries in Europe; (3) The relationship between Britain and the United States; (4) The post-war policies to be adopted by the anti-Axis powers. There must be a conference to promote world peace. Regarding item (1), Britain sacrificed General de Gaulle everywhere. General Eisenhower, the commander of the Allied forces in North Africa, postponed de Gaulle's trip to North Africa, which is enough to show the anti-Axis powers' policy towards France. Hirota solemnly said that even if the French issue is resolved, de Gaulle will be sacrificed. Therefore, in order to obtain coordination with the United States, Britain does not hesitate to sacrifice its friendship. Regarding item (2), Hirota said that the anti-Axis powers may incite various neutral countries to join their camp or use their usual methods to sabotage the neutrality of other countries. However, we must not stand idly by and let them do whatever they want. Hirota finally said that the anti-Axis powers take maintaining world peace and avoiding another world war after the war as their mantra. However, may I ask who was the culprit of this great disturbance? Eden made bold statements in the House of Commons, which are truly unattainable.

### Uniform Issuance System to Be Implemented for Hua Central Regional Epidemic Prevention Certificates; Citizens Requesting Physicians to Inoculate Must Exchange for a Certificate in a Fixed Format

A senior official of the Public Works Department's Health Department told reporters yesterday that in order to promote the epidemic prevention movement, once the concession area starts large-scale cholera vaccination on April 20, a unified epidemic prevention certificate system will be implemented within the Hua Central region. The first phase of the epidemic prevention movement in the two concessions this year will start on the 20th, and will be implemented first in the areas where epidemics are most prevalent in the past. The first phase will last until the end of May, and the second phase will start in July and end when the cholera epidemic disappears. The Baojia personnel in the two concession areas will also participate in the promotion. If citizens request physicians to inoculate, they must exchange the certificate issued by the physician for an epidemic prevention certificate in a fixed format from the Health Department. If a physician issues a certificate without inoculation, they will be investigated and punished if found out.

### Postal Remittances Between Shanghai and Guangdong Resume: Limited to 50 Yuan Per Person

The Shanghai Postal Savings and Remittance Bureau has been trying to restore remittances to various places, but the amount of remittances is slightly limited. Now, in order to facilitate remittances for the public, the bureau has resumed opening remittances to various places in the Peace District of Guangdong Province from now on, but the temporary limit is 50 yuan of Chinese Reserve Certificates per person per day.

### French Concession to Test Alarms This Afternoon

### Economic News

The grain industry in this city, in order to assist the authorities in allocating food for the people, previously telegraphed the Ministry of Food of the National Government to initiate the organization of two joint venture associations for rice and miscellaneous grains. It is now learned that the two associations are actively proceeding, collecting capital of 10 million yuan in preparation for operation. It is also heard that similar organizations for edible oil and flour are also being initiated, and are jointly planning to proceed under the leadership of the National Government.

### Translated Commentary: Thoroughly Investigating Speculation Thoroughly

Because of the rampant speculation in Shanghai, the National Government issued an order instructing senior officials from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the National Commercial Control Association to impartially investigate, "Anyone who engages in speculative buying and selling, manipulates market prices, and disrupts the market, regardless of who they are, should be reported to the Supreme National Defense Council for special punishment, and all materials seized will be confiscated."

The biggest economic problem in Central China now is the rising prices, and the biggest reason is hoarding, which is a consensus view. Now the National Government is resolutely starting to eliminate this evil, which is a timely measure.

Speculators also have their own reasons to explain the legitimacy of rising prices. First, they cite currency deflation, believing that prices will inevitably rise in places where currency is deflated. However, this kind of view is completely contrary to the facts. Just look at the previous proclamation issued by the Public Works Department and the recent statement by the Vice Minister of Finance. They both stated very clearly that the currency in Central China is definitely not more than the old legal tender circulation period. In addition to reserve certificates, even if there is an expansion of so-called credit currency, the discussants also believe that it does not have the nature of inflation. Taking a step back, even if this is considered a reason, the current price increases are definitely not legitimate.

The second basis for speculators is that production is shrinking and materials are lacking. However, on this point, the facts also contradict their eloquence. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, production activities in Central China have indeed been sluggish, so it is undeniable that production is shrinking. However, the lack of materials caused by the shrinking of production is definitely not the reason for today's soaring prices. Thinking about the huge inventory, the amount of materials existing in Central China or Shanghai has not decreased recently.

What is the reason for the soaring prices? It can be said that it is caused by the deliberate distortion and forced explanation of the relationship between currency and materials. If the materials currently existing in Central China are bought and sold in a normal quantity and method to make them circulate, then the prices will naturally be balanced. However, because of the activities of speculators, the smooth operation is hindered. Hoarding! Profiteering! As a result, the quantity of circulating materials in reality is less than the quantity of materials existing in reality. This situation stimulates the general public, and all cash is transferred to the only materials. The above-mentioned bad cycle is the best example of the abnormal shape of prices in Central China.

The only way to correct this situation is the above-mentioned must eradicate speculative buying. The National Government's measures this time are for this purpose. The real problem is not in reciting and understanding economic theories, but in how to implement specific economic policies based on these theories. We dare to say frankly here that some people now believe that at least most of those who are doing evil and hindering the economy of Central China are related to the members of the National Government. We certainly do not hope that it is true, but in any case, if the National Government solves this problem smoothly, it can achieve the two major goals of economic recovery and grasping the hearts of the people. This is what we earnestly desire with great enthusiasm. (Translated by Yunpeng from the Continental New News on April 9)

### Office for the Permission of Goods Movement: Urging the Submission of Expired Permits

According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency, since the National General Association of Commerce's Office for the Movement of Goods began accepting applications for permits to move goods in and out on March 16th, many Chinese and Japanese merchants have applied. A significant number have already obtained permits and completed their goods movement. The office is now strictly enforcing the attached conditions on the permits, and is urging merchants who received permits for moving goods in and out before March 20th to promptly submit their expired permits and receipts to the office for cancellation, as the validity period has expired. It is reported that failure to submit expired permits for cancellation will result in the cancellation of their eligibility for a second application.

### New Exchange Settlement Methods Between North and Central China

Regarding the exchange settlement methods between North and Central China, in the past, military scrip exchange, special yen exchange, and Shanghai exchange were used together. Military scrip exchange was used for remittances from the Japanese side and for settling transactions of specific goods such as coal, wheat flour, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth. Special yen exchange was used for settling transactions of other general goods. Shanghai exchange was used for remittances from the Chinese side and for settling import and export transactions without exchange. However, since the issuance of new military scrip was stopped on April 1st, the above settlement methods should also be fundamentally reformed. What are the new settlement methods? All parties are paying close attention. Regarding this matter, after discussions between the Central China and North China bureaus, it has been tentatively decided to adopt the following settlement methods, which have been implemented since April 1st.

(1) The original military scrip exchange will, in principle, be changed to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange from April 1st, that is, direct settlement will be based on the ratio of 100 Central Reserve Bank of China notes to 18 military scrip. General remittances that previously used military scrip exchange will now be converted to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange. The exchange for travelers will be changed to direct exchange between Central Reserve Bank of China notes and Federal Reserve Bank of China notes. Furthermore, the settlement of specific goods transactions that previously used military scrip exchange will, in principle, be changed to Central Reserve Bank of China note exchange, but a portion of specific goods will use special yen settlement.

(2) The settlement of general goods transactions will continue to be in special yen. However, the special yen exchange rate had different prices for imports and exports in the past, with 17 military scrip for sales and 18 military scrip for purchases. Now, the rate will be completely unified, with a uniform rate of 18 military scrip for both imports and exports from April 1st, with only a 0.5% handling fee.

(3) The settlement of transactions without exchange will continue to use Shanghai exchange.

As for Shanghai exchange, the Federal Reserve Bank of China has adopted a centralized system, with the official exchange rate being 30 Federal Reserve Bank of China notes for 100 Central Reserve Bank of China notes. Although there are clear regulations for this controlled Shanghai exchange, there is currently a significant amount of free Shanghai exchange (black market exchange between Central Reserve Bank of China notes and Federal Reserve Bank of China notes) between Chinese banks and money shops. Therefore, it is practically impossible to completely ban this free Shanghai exchange, and it is generally believed that free Shanghai exchange will continue to exist in the future.

### Ministry of Food Investigates Selling Prices of Chicken and Duck Eggs

According to a Shanghai dispatch from the Central News Agency, due to the continuous rise in the selling prices of chicken and duck eggs in recent years, the Ministry of Food has specially prepared forms to investigate the purchase and sale quantities of chicken and duck eggs in various regions, as well as the selling price situation, and the capital established by egg shops in various regions, and has ordered the responsible food authorities in each region to fill them out in detail for verification and handling, in order to effectively prevent hoarding and manipulation.

### Exchange Settlement Methods Between South China and Various Regions

Guangzhou, 9th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Consulate General here today announced the exchange settlement methods between South China and various regions after the cessation of military scrip issuance: the exchange settlement methods between South China and North China, Hong Kong, Hainan Island, Mengjiang, and various regions in Japan and Manchuria will be based on the rate of 18 Japanese yen equivalent to 100 Central Reserve Bank of China notes, with Japanese gold for transactions with Japan, Manchurian national currency for transactions with Manchuria, Federal Reserve Bank of China notes for transactions with North China, Mengjiang Bank notes for transactions with Mengjiang, and the military scrip buying and selling rate for transactions with Hong Kong and Hainan Island. Furthermore, the exchange with Thailand, Vietnam, and other southern regions will be settled by converting Central Reserve Bank of China notes into the local currency. The Southern Development Gold Corporation will handle the exchange for other southern regions, and remittances from overseas Chinese in Vietnam to South China will be handled by the Central South Company.

### Tobacco Exchange Association Market: Returning Security Deposits to Fellow Traders

Since the implementation of the tobacco distribution scheme by the Central China Tobacco Distribution Association in this city, all tobacco sellers have had to sell at the officially set prices. The authorities of the Tobacco Exchange Association, in view of this, announced the closure of the association's market. Therefore, they officially notified all fellow traders yesterday to return the 300 yuan security deposit and the pledge forms previously paid. From today, each shop can send a representative with a seal to collect them, and the market entry and exit permits previously issued will also be returned by each shop.

### Comprehensive Rationing of Japanese Daily Necessities

As the war becomes increasingly protracted, the controlled rationing of goods becomes more important. The smooth rationing of daily necessities is essential for ensuring domestic security and national unity. Japan's current rationing agencies can be said to have been established separately for each type of goods due to the development of various control regulations. However, because of the complexity of the types of agencies, there are still many shortcomings, resulting in situations such as monopolized sales, uneven distribution of goods, and black market prices. Although there are many reasons, one is that the multiple goods are related to the rationing agencies which are different and are not comprehensively rationed. Therefore, it is not possible to establish a consumer plan, which is the biggest reason.

The rationing organization of "purchasing cooperatives" is a consumer organization, so it is the most suitable and rational way to correct the above shortcomings. However, a comprehensive expansion of purchasing cooperatives would ultimately require a fundamental reorganization of the entire national commerce. As the war deepens, the adjustment of daily necessities rationing agencies becomes more necessary. Therefore, the National Consumers' Cooperative Association of Japan has put forward the following countermeasures for the government to consider and implement. The proposed contents are: (1) Urban rationing agencies should have a "public" character and have close relationship with consumers, so that consumers can assist locally. (2) Organize consumers nationwide to establish an agency capable of comprehensive rationing. (3) Change the areas of neighborhood associations into appropriate economic zones and establish consumer organizations there, with neighborhood units as their internal organization. (4) Designate the most terminal distribution points as comprehensive distribution points and select stores with this qualification to operate or supervise the above-mentioned consumer organizations. (5) Consumer organizations should formulate rationing consumption plans within the zone, and through the neighborhood unit, contact the town association, and comprehensively guide consumers. (6) Consumer organizations should organize federations and jointly form councils with rationing agencies, industry patriotism associations, etc., to be responsible for deciding on rationing goods, rationing methods, and other rationing adjustments.

### The Thrift of the Germans

— Jian Nong

The thrift of the Germans is admirable! Their twenty years of enduring hardship and biding their time has been obvious to all and need not be said. Since the outbreak of this war, they have been pooling their wisdom and military strength, actively producing, and doing everything possible to save energy and contribute strength. Consider this recent fact:

According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, Germany is now restricting and regulating even women's clothing. Dr. Bao Aier, head of the Textile Section of the German Ministry of Economy, has a great aversion to fashionable women's clothing. He issued a statement saying, "What we need now is cotton cloth and tailoring suitable for the wartime economy. German women should get used to wearing clothes as simple as those of ancient Spartans." More humorously, the doctor added, "Men should be encouraged to see in their new attire that they have 'attractive power.'" - This, I think the doctor is a bit too worried. - As a result, after he issued this statement, German fashion companies will only be able to sell practical styles of clothing in the future, and only styles prescribed by the state can be displayed in glass windows.

What about the situation in Shanghai? In this season of pleasant weather, gentle breezes, green willows and red peach blossoms, countless young ladies and wives are probably racking their brains to plan their 1943 spring clothes, preparing for a contest of novelty and beauty? This is not our men's business, and we should not overstep our bounds and meddle too much. What attitude should we take ourselves? I believe that in this time of difficulty in obtaining even a thread and scarcity of materials, we do not have to deliberately imitate the cynical behavior of the ancient Greek Stoic school, who wore tattered robes and were proudly self-satisfied - they disdained honor and despised social etiquette, almost destroying all conditions for comfortable living and returning to the pure society of ancient times, so they adopted the beggar's staff and luggage as a symbol of the philosopher. - But the spirit of Zilu, a highly talented disciple of Confucius, who "stood without shame in tattered hemp clothes alongside those who wore fox and badger furs" is indispensable! However, perhaps some people think this is a way of "the fox eating sour grapes," a way of comforting oneself and relieving embarrassment...

### Nervousness

— Xiao Lin

"Nervousness" is also a great enemy that kills one's life achievements. A nervous person, whether in the family, at school, or in society, is a person who never has a moment of peace. He does not know what "happiness" is, what is the joy of group life.

Nervousness is psychologically one of the mental illnesses, his self-consciousness is keen in searching, amplifies self-esteem, and obscures his own personality. Before an external stimulus reaches the threshold of stimulation, a nervous person is already restless. In his mind, he is always a "target of public criticism." No matter what he says or does, or what others are saying or doing, he imagines that everyone is criticizing him, analyzing him, and even scolding, insulting, and secretly laughing at him.

Over time, we can imagine that he will never start doing what he desires and plans. He seems to feel that there are thousands of eyes closely looking for his mistakes. He thinks that if he succeeds, others will definitely be jealous. What if he fails? He dare not even imagine it... So he "achieves nothing" and "lives a frustrated life."

If we think about it carefully, there are too many such people. Because nine out of ten cowards who only retreat and never advance suffer from nervousness.

In a small sense, it can destroy a useful life. In a large sense, it will hinder social progress. The way to get rid of it is not to take yourself too seriously or too lightly. Take an interest in things outside of yourself, live a group life, and do not underestimate the personality of others... Then make an absolute determination to control your overly sensitive nerves. Always give others sympathy. If you can do this, you can get true freedom and achieve success happily.

### Root

— Xin Bo

Perhaps A Chou was not a person who liked crowds of people, so he did not walk up the steps where they came down, but veered slightly to the west, touching a dry stone stream, took a few steps, and then went towards the top of the mountain. Da Gen followed him. In this way, when they reached the top of the mountain, they bypassed a City God Temple and arrived at the Tian Qi Temple in the center of the mountain.

There were five or six temples on this mountain, located at almost the same distance apart on the top of the mountain, which was long and stretched from southeast to northwest. The San Mao Temple was relatively low, and the other four were at almost the same height. There was open ground to the left and right and in front of the Tian Qi Temple, so there were many people doing business and playing. The people in the temple were really crowded, so they did not go in.

A Wu greedily looked around. Although everything he saw was familiar, he never let it go easily during this once-a-year opportunity. He and Da Gen had different points of attention. He still looked at Chongwen Town in the south. It was a little different from what he had seen in front of Xiaolingshan. He felt that it was particularly low and narrow. Tangjia Mountain in the south of the town was particularly close, as if he could cross it with one step. His eyes gradually shifted from far to near, landing on Lingshan Bay at the foot of the mountain. Lingshan Bay really had a good situation. Behind it was the long Lingshan, the branch ridge extending south from the western end of Lingshan on the right, and the junction of Lingshan and Xiaolingshan on the left, with Longhumen forming its eastern key. It faced Chongwen Town from a distance, but the terrain was much higher than Chongwen Town. The terrain gradually lowered step by step to the south, and it was not until it completely broke away from the embrace of the hills on the east and west sides that it was truly flat land.

There were a dozen or so houses scattered sparsely in the bay. Some were connected in groups of three or five, and some were alone, distributed according to the best locations. Wisps of cooking smoke mixed with the wet mist. Although they were not far apart, they did not look very clear. Therefore, A Wu could not find Da Gen's home there. (28)

### After Watching "Man Jiang Hong"

— Xiao Chuang

The story of "Man Jiang Hong" is about a courtesan by the Qinhuai River who falls in love with a poor painter. The poor painter also loves her. The courtesan, misunderstanding that the painter has fallen in love with someone else, is forced to fall in love and marry someone else. The poor painter suspects that she is only destined for destruction under the control of money. Later, after understanding that everything was due to a misunderstanding, it was impossible to salvage. The courtesan sacrifices her own life for the sake of her lover. The accompaniment also has a courtesan in the Qinhuai River, a poor photographer falls in love with her, and helps her, but love needs money, she can't marry him, later, this poor photographer becomes famous and rich, they are married, other wealthy gentlemen, poor artists, people who regard love as a play, and ugly aunties - pimps, are quite lively. I haven't read the original, but I don't understand what changes were made after the adaptation?

It is said that the play was written collectively, and I agree with what was said in the "Man Jiang Hong" post-reading, that I doubt whether this script was written by one person, its artistic tone is very harmonious and unified, there are places to point out, that scene when they meet at "Qingliang Mountain", it is still not emphasized enough, the satire is not sharp enough, that courtesan falling in love with that glib youth Wan Zaiqing in West Lake is superfluous, it will obscure the character of that courtesan, I even more disapprove of making the banker Wan Youguang become such a character, a loyal but not faithful, sincere but not sincere character, this kind of person simply doesn't understand what love is, he only knows the satisfaction of lust, relying on the power of his money to dominate a woman, and after he is tired of this one, he can find another woman, and that poor photographer Li Taihua still marries that other courtesan Xiao Xiang, what is the biggest problem for the whole play? Love cannot be forced, and even more cannot be opportunistic, Xiao Xiang should not get such a result, this is my opinion, in short, these are the lack of awareness in the original, and the mistakes left behind, although the playwriting skills are skillful, they still cannot hide them.

The director is also very dedicated, and has arranged the three acts and eight scenes without any confusion, and clearly explains them to the audience. Some places can be seen to have taken a lot of effort, especially the last few scenes, which are very difficult, unless one has rich experience and cultivation to handle them so appropriately.

Among the actors, Lan Lan's role is the most important, every scene has her in it, with her ability, she is very capable of taking on the role, and plays that courtesan very realistically, clear lines, skilled acting skills, fully able to portray the courtesan, such a long play and can be meticulous, the up-and-coming actors should emulate her, it is a pity that she said that she is saying goodbye to the audience after this play, I hope this is not true, this theater stage is in great need of such excellent actors like her, Bai Chen plays the banker, and is very able to perform the personality of the person in the play. Hai Tao's Sun Shi played well, Li Zongshan's Xiao Xiang was not bad, Liu Ji's Li Taihua was very successful and other actors were very competent.

"Man Jiang Hong" is adapted from Zhang Henshui's novel, so the whole play lacks pure awareness, only has shallow expressions, and no deep meaning of life, the director, playwright and actors are all above standard, the great scenery, lighting effects are very beautiful, if it is completely for entertainment, then it is worth watching.

### Accept Criticism

— Liu Yun

Everyone has shortcomings, and with shortcomings, one cannot avoid being criticized by others.

Criticism has good intentions and malicious intentions. Good intentions are a good lesson or admonition. On the contrary, malicious criticism is slander, it is the erasure of one's personality, and the alienation of others. We should accept it with different attitudes.

Generally speaking, secretly gossiping about people is mostly unfaithful criticism, that is, slander. Slander. This harmful and self-serving, bad method is so despicable! We can laugh off this kind of criticism and there is absolutely no reason to defend it or to be afraid of it.

Conversely, we should accept well-intentioned criticism without any doubt, no matter who it comes from. This is extremely important for success in career and achievement in scholarship.

Often, we cannot instinctively distinguish whether a criticism is well-intentioned or malicious. In this case, we might as well accept the criticism and then use reflection to examine ourselves. If there is something to admit, admit it frankly and strive to correct it. If there is nothing to admit, then remain calm. In this way, whether it is slander or defamation, it is just a waste of effort for the other party.

### Organizing an Elderly Welfare Association

— Zhao Ximing

· Welfare for the Elderly · Improve People's Hearts

The elders of the He Qi Nian Hui, Qi Lao Hui, and the soon-to-be-formed Qi Ying Hui, taking advantage of today's trend, organize an "Elderly Welfare Association," starting with helping the poor elderly, called "Ji Lao". Let those who have the strength contribute their strength, those who have money contribute their money, benefit the elderly, and improve people's hearts. The methods are as follows: (1) Seek the cooperation of colleagues from the Qi Hui and distribute the responsibilities widely. (2) Seek the support of kind people in society and open up another channel. (3) Encourage the elderly to rely on their own efforts and do some work. (4) Encourage the elderly to be determined and do some business. I believe that the elderly must work. Although their physical strength is weak, their mental strength should be strong. As the saying goes: There is no greater sorrow than the death of the heart, and physical death is secondary. Being old is not sad, what is sad is being old and unsuccessful, and the elderly are still greedy. The elderly should have a sense of self-respect and self-responsibility, and strive to live on their own and help others. Profiting without labor should be deeply cautioned against. This kind of elderly person can be saved, otherwise, what is the point of saving an elderly person whose heart is dead? Only the elderly with a living life can be saved. Heaven helps those who help themselves, and human power is limited!
