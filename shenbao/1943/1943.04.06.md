### Request to the Government to Resolve to Suppress Hoarding

We can assert with certainty that the highest goals of all national political and economic policies are to "improve the people's livelihood" and "stabilize the people's livelihood." Any government that wants to achieve a strengthened position and gain the support of the people must devote itself to improving and stabilizing the people's livelihood. The ruling authorities would certainly not deny this principle!

Aside from other issues, the most pressing problem related to the people's livelihood is the issue of commodity prices, the severity of which is increasing day by day. If this issue is not reasonably resolved, then all measures to improve and stabilize the people's livelihood will become empty talk.

Regarding the resolution of the commodity price problem, we have repeatedly expressed our opinions based on our observations. From the food issue to the comprehensive control of commodity prices, to the comprehensive implementation of price limits, and even how to eradicate the black market, we have published theoretical and technical opinions. However, upon further review, because of the power of public opinion, except for the food issue which has shown some improvement, the severity of other general commodity price issues has not lessened, but has even increased. Therefore, today we address the topic of "Suppressing Hoarding" again, with sincere emotion, solemnly offering the following suggestions:

From a fundamental perspective, the main reason for the continuous surge in commodity prices is the shortage of goods. Not long ago, the National Government issued an economic policy outline, the first item of which was "Increase Production." We share the same sentiment and therefore support the government's efforts to implement this task, formulating comprehensive principles and phased production plans for each department. All factors that hinder or restrict production should be eliminated as much as possible, so as to ensure that the planned goals are achieved.

However, taking Shanghai as an example, it has always been a distribution center for various goods, maintaining a sufficient reserve volume. In fact, it should not suddenly experience an excessive shortage. So, where have these previously sufficient reserves of goods gone? Undoubtedly, they have been hoarded by a few people. Therefore, we can assert that the current shortage of various goods in Shanghai is not a "genuine shortage," but a "man-made shortage." In order to regulate goods, suppress commodity prices, and, more importantly, stabilize the people's livelihood, we dare to urgently propose that in addition to supporting the government's plan to increase production, we also demand that the government make the greatest determination to suppress hoarding and speculation. Only by thoroughly suppressing hoarding and speculation can we effectively treat the symptoms of suppressing commodity prices and improving the people's livelihood today.

It is undeniable that hoarders are found among people in the political circles as well as various levels of the population. If we really want to suppress hoarding, we should start with the big tigers with strong political backgrounds. Then, it will not be difficult to achieve "wind sweeping the grass," and general small and medium-sized hoarders, knowing that they have no chance, will emerge from their hiding places. As for the implementation of suppression, we should first investigate the evidence. Our suggestions are:

(1) Some people often denounce the treacherous merchants and powerful figures who disrupt commodity prices, but these merchants and powerful figures are mostly people who are relatively prominent and resourceful in society. Especially those who falsely use the power of high-ranking officials have even more extensive connections. Treacherous merchants and powerful figures must be curbed, and officials engaging in business must be strictly prohibited. The government already has a ban on civil servants concurrently operating businesses, and this law must be thoroughly implemented. Therefore, we urge the government to investigate which officials are concurrently serving as chairmen, directors, or major shareholders of commercial banks or enterprises. Special attention should be paid to participation under assumed names; or which merchants have become officials. These people with dual identities of official and merchant, merchant and official, should be required to resign from their official positions or their businesses, focusing on one career only, and should not be allowed to advance and retreat freely, having their way in both worlds. If the government can achieve this step, the public perception will be refreshed, and the separation of officials and merchants will be practically beneficial to the enforcement of suppressing hoarding and speculation.

(2) At the same time, the government should select honest and upright officials or impartial members of society to thoroughly investigate the accounts of commercial banks or enterprises related to people in the political circles. Is the use of funds within the scope of legitimate business? According to market rumors, banks related to some people in the political circles often have huge checks of several million or even ten million yuan issued. It is necessary to investigate the exact purpose of these checks, study the clues, and not be obscured by smokescreens.

(3) The warehouses owned by various banks in Shanghai are numerous and fully stocked. This group of goods, a paradise for hoarding, also needs a fair and thorough investigation to determine the owners of the goods and the dates and prices at which the goods were deposited.

(4) To ensure safety, hoarders usually insure their goods with insurance companies. Therefore, the policyholders of various insurance companies are also subject to thorough investigation.

After a thorough investigation to obtain conclusive evidence of hoarding and speculation, those engaged in hoarding and speculation should be severely punished. Our humble opinions are:

Treacherous merchants are the henchmen of corrupt officials, and corrupt officials are the background of treacherous merchants. Without treacherous merchants, the crimes of corrupt officials would sometimes be restrained, fearing that once they are caught, there would be no way to deny it. Therefore, ordinary cunning people, under the government's ban on civil servants engaging in business, are prepared, unwilling to show their faces themselves, but distributing their relatives and old friends to engage in management, while they themselves manipulate from the sidelines, taking advantage of the situation. In case something happens, if they can cover it up, they ask people to cover it up; if they can reduce the punishment, they try to reduce the punishment; otherwise, they stay out of it. Therefore, these cunning people cannot be let go, and they must be made to suffer the consequences of their actions.

Managing commodity prices is managing goods. To manage goods, one must manage people, especially those who manage people first: manage those who manage people well, then the general population can be expected to be managed well, and goods can also be expected to be managed well. This is a key point. The rise in commodity prices during wartime is "normal," but irregular jumps are "abnormal." The "normal" part can be explained from an economic point of view, and the "abnormal" part must be blamed on politics. Those who create the sin of "abnormal" must be punished with clear laws and severe penalties. Punish the present to warn the future, punish one to warn hundreds. If the offenders are high-ranking government officials, and they are protected and indulged, then all efforts will be in vain. Let's cite two past examples to prove this:

(1) In 1937, when Wu Dingchang was the Minister of Industry, there was large-scale speculation in the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange. Wu himself went to thoroughly investigate the accounts and uncovered several major speculators. Wu wanted to punish them, but these major speculators were all related to Madame Kong Xiangxi. Later, Du Yuesheng flew to Lushan to intercede with Chiang, and the matter vanished without a trace.

(2) Last year, Lin Shiliang, the Transportation Manager of the Central Trust Bureau of the Chongqing regime, took advantage of the tense military situation in Yangon to seize the opportunity to rush transport commercial goods. The case was investigated, convicted, and executed. This case was also related to Kong behind the scenes, but as a result, Lin died, manager Xu Xingchu was punished, and the main culprit remained at large.

From this, it can be seen that the government must have the determination of "officials committing crimes and civilians being treated equally" in order to suppress hoarding effectively. It is heard that the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, and the Shanghai authorities are determined to suppress hoarding with the greatest determination. We absolutely support this and can regard whether this measure can achieve practical results as a touchstone for the National Government's improvement of politics and its ability to strengthen itself, and at the same time, it is the most powerful guarantee for gaining the support of the people.

### Chairman Wang's Speech: Revitalize China and Defend East Asia

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency) – This morning, the central authorities solemnly held the spring sacrifice ceremony. Chairman Wang personally presided over the ceremony and delivered the following speech: Fellow compatriots, fellow students, because we have a teacher, we have a student-teacher relationship in addition to our compatriot relationship. I already explained this during the autumn sacrifice last year. What should I say at this spring sacrifice? The teacher Confucius once said, "It is difficult to act on words that one is not ashamed to speak." The Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, once said, "It is not difficult to act, but it is difficult to know." The spirit of these two sentences is consistent. It is most difficult to seek knowledge, but once known, it is not difficult to speak it, but difficult to put it into practice. Pitiful compatriots, you have been writing in the eight-legged essay style for too long, you only know how to speak, not how to act. You should firmly remember the words of the teacher Confucius, "It is difficult to act on words that one is not ashamed to speak." You should also firmly remember the words of the Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen, "It is not difficult to act, but it is difficult to know." Empty words are not enough to be called seeking knowledge; it must be put into practice. The first sentence is practice, the second sentence is practice, and the first sentence is still practice. Then, what should we practice? Zigong asked, "Is there a single word that can be practiced for a lifetime?" Confucius said, "It is perhaps 'reciprocity.' Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." This is from a negative perspective. If we speak from a positive perspective, it is "Establish others as you would establish yourself, and advance others as you would advance yourself." Combining the positive and negative aspects, the spirit of Confucianism can be said to be complete. Mencius said, "To practice reciprocity vigorously is the closest way to seek benevolence." The method of seeking benevolence is none other than practicing reciprocity vigorously. What is meant by vigorously practicing reciprocity? Both the positive and negative aspects are forcefully practiced, approaching benevolence. Why is this so? Empty words without practice are ten thousand miles away from benevolence. For example, even if one has the heart to save the country, but cannot bear the responsibility of saving the country, then one can only be called cruel. Being brave and diligent, persevering and enduring hardship, are not just empty words, but must be put into practice. Revitalizing China and defending East Asia can only be achieved through practice. This is what I want to contribute to my fellow compatriots and students at this spring sacrifice.

### War Results of Japanese Troops in Hubei, Shandong, Henan, and Hebei Provinces

Hankou, 5th (Central News Agency) – Since the 23rd of last month, various Japanese troops have fiercely attacked the troops of the 180th Division of the Chongqing Army entrenched in the area north of Jingmen, completely defeating them. Continuing on the 31st, they fiercely attacked Lixi, a battalion of the Chongqing Army 33 kilometers north of Jingmen, and by evening, they had driven them all north. On the 1st of this month, a battalion of the Chongqing Army on the high ground about four kilometers east of Lixi was fiercely attacked by the Japanese army and retreated north as well. In the war results gained by the Japanese army in the past two days, it is estimated that 1,000 Chongqing Army soldiers were killed, four were captured, and one light machine gun and eight rifles, along with countless bullets, were seized.

### Grand China's Participation in the War Lecture Meeting Held in Tokyo; Former Ambassador to Japan Xu Liang Attended and Gave a Speech

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Today at 1 p.m., the Grand China's Participation in the War Lecture Meeting was grandly held at the Hibiya Public Hall. The ceremony was performed as usual. First, General Iwane Matsui, Vice President of the Xingya Alliance, gave an opening speech. Then, Xu Liang, the Chinese Ambassador to Japan, and others successively gave important speeches on their determination to live and die together and to destroy Britain and the United States after China's participation in the war. Subsequently, Fengyi Tsushima, President of the North China Development Corporation, and Huanming Okawa, Doctor of Law, gave speeches on the economic development of China participating in the war and on appealing to the people of the new China. After each speaker finished, Chinese films, the China Amusement Conference, and "Real Records of Peaceful Nation Building" were shown. Finally, Tokyo Mayor Kishimoto led everyone in shouting slogans and the meeting adjourned.

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) – Former Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Xu Liang, gave a speech at the "China's Participation in the War Lecture Meeting" in today, saying that he had asked Chairman Wang for permission to resign because his parents were old, and luckily Chairman Wang granted it. He will return to China within days. From then on, he can serve his parents at home and contribute to the Great East Asia War abroad. He will have no regrets for both public and private matters, and he is even more delighted. Recalling that since his arrival, he has received various assistance from all levels of your country, which enabled him to complete his important mission. He would like to take this opportunity to express his heartfelt gratitude to everyone and bid farewell. Although he is returning to China, he will continue to fight for the Great East Asia War, regardless of time or region. We will never rest until we achieve final victory. Before China's participation in the war, some Chinese people thought that the Great East Asia War was someone else's business. This national mentality was the biggest obstacle to Sino-Japanese cooperation and the construction of the New Order in East Asia. Now that China has participated in the war, the Chinese people should know that Japan is a comrade-in-arms who lives and dies together, and standing idly by is absolutely not allowed. Moreover, after participating in the war, the concessions have been recovered and extraterritorial rights have been abolished. What the Chinese patriots have died fighting for for decades has now been realized. Chongqing has lost its ability to resist. In the future, the entire China will be able to cooperate in the Great East Asia War. The unprecedented glory of East Asia will surely be realized. He will report to the government and the people in detail about the true situation of your assistance to China and the calmness, loyalty, and courage that should be shown in this Great East Asia War. At the same time, he will thank everyone on behalf of China and wish the Great East Asia War victory.

### American Forces Attacking the Maktar Pass Heavily Defeated by German Air Force, Retreating in Disarray. Both Sides Deploying Troops in the Medjez el Bab Area, British Forces Advancing South Towards Rommel's Line.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) Yesterday, American forces fiercely attacked the Maktar Pass in Tunisia, aiming to occupy it, but were thwarted by elite German troops and heavily bombed by the German air force, resulting in a devastating defeat and retreat. Before the attack, the American forces bombarded heavily for years, and then infantry launched fierce attacks on the German positions from both sides. However, the German troops fought bravely, halting the American offensive and then applying pressure to the attackers. The German air force joined the battle at this time, and the outcome was decided. Fast German fighter-bombers and dive bombers launched fierce attacks on the attacking American forces. A squadron of American tanks used for the assault was bombed. Military reports indicate that thirteen of them were completely destroyed by German aircraft and flat-trajectory guns, and the rest retreated east of the pass, mired in mud and unable to move.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to news from the Tunisian front, there has been no large-scale fighting on the northern and central fronts recently. Currently, the fighting is concentrated on the southern front and the Maktar-El Guettar area. American forces in that area are trying to advance eastward, but the Axis forces are preventing them, leading to fierce battles. The American forces are pressing towards Gabès from El Guettar, attempting to threaten the Axis forces' rear. However, due to the rugged terrain and muddy roads, many tanks cannot perform effectively. The remaining enemy troops have suffered great damage due to heavy Axis artillery fire. The German troops suffered heavy casualties in the northern hilly area of Doukebelda and have been repelled by the Axis forces. In the Utelef area north of Gabès, only artillery battles have occurred between the two sides. The anti-Axis forces on the northern front are attacking Djebel Gfifa between Sedjenane and Mateur, but there is no large-scale fighting. German troops in the Medjez el Bab area are reorganizing their forces, and it seems that there are large supplies from the rear. It is observed that there will be fierce battles in this area soon.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) The British forces in the Medjez el Bab area of Tunisia have now completed their redeployment. Military personnel here generally expect that the war will restart in that area.

German forces in the Izyum area are now engaged in eliminating the last two Soviet bridgeheads on the Donets River. After two days of fierce fighting, German mechanized and grenadier units have cleared a large area in the Izyum-Donets River bend, allowing German forces to cross the Donets River and attack the center of the Soviet forces preparing for a counterattack. The center of the Donets line originally turned back east in that area, but after this operation, it has been re-extended. Military sources stated that German forces south of Ilmen have also advanced. German forces near Staraya Russa have repelled attacking Soviet forces and pursued them deep into Soviet lines. German and Romanian forces continue to hold the shortened front line of the Kuban bridgehead. Soviet forces launched large-scale attacks in the Kuban River basin and along the Sea of Azov. The northern bank of the Kuban River is defended by German troops. The Soviet forces attacked five times along the river but were all blocked by the German troops.

### Discarding the Concept of Rights and Interests in China, Expecting the Realization of Coexistence and Co-Prosperity

Prime Minister Tojo's Address at the Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable Conference

The promotion of economic cooperation between China and Japan is a matter of utmost urgency that cannot be delayed. It is essential for China and Japan to join hands in establishing the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In light of this, the Japanese government held a roundtable conference on Sino-Japanese economic cooperation at the Prime Minister's official residence at 9:00 a.m. on February 29th.

The Japanese government was represented by Prime Minister Tojo, Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki, Vice-Minister for Greater East Asia Yamamoto, and Directors of the Army and Navy Affairs Bureaus Sato and Oka. The private sector was represented by the five major business leaders in Sino-Japanese relations and other representatives.

At the beginning of the meeting, Prime Minister Tojo and Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki delivered speeches (details of which are provided separately below), followed by an immediate discussion. The attendees were all authorities in their respective fields, and they provided detailed and proactive opinions on specific measures for Sino-Japanese cooperation based on their extensive experience and ardent patriotism.

Summary of the Prime Minister's Address:

On this occasion, I would like to express my deep respect for your contributions and hard work over the years in the complex Sino-Japanese economic relationship. The National Government, standing on the basis of shared hardship, has further strengthened its determination to share life and death, declared war on Britain and the United States, and demonstrated its commitment to advancing along the same path as Japan to complete the war. Taking the National Government's participation in the war as an opportunity, the Japanese government intends to take this opportunity to re-examine the economic relations and make fair and reasonable adjustments to the existing economic facilities.

The government's top priority is to thoroughly implement the policies decided this time. During my previous visit to China, Japanese officials and civilians there all deeply understood the government's policies and showed extraordinary enthusiasm. I am very pleased with this situation. However, I would like to see even greater results, that is, that the public, especially the Japanese financial circles that directly or indirectly manage businesses or participate in economic activities in China, should fully understand the government's intentions and assist the government, which is the most necessary and effective thing to do.

Today is no longer a time to argue over rights or interests. Instead, we should join hands with the Chinese people, cooperate with them, and seek economic development from the standpoint of coexistence and co-prosperity. This is what I hope for from everyone present today. I hope that everyone present today will fully understand the government's policies outlined earlier and ensure that everyone involved locally thoroughly understands this intent in order to achieve practical results.

In this extraordinary autumn of the Great War, we must face it with extraordinary determination. Please understand the government's will and provide special cooperation. I earnestly hope for this.

Address by Minister Aoki for Greater East Asia

(1) In the past, economic activities in China had to be painstakingly managed to counter the anti-Japanese movement, and they also had to counter the British and American forces that used the concessions as strongholds to restrain and obstruct Japanese economic activities. Furthermore, since the China Incident, special economic activities have been necessary to meet Japan's operational needs. For these reasons, Japanese economic activities have often been managed based on privileges or rights and interests, resulting in a sense of antagonism between Japanese and Chinese businesses. This tendency certainly existed. However, due to the outbreak of war with Britain and the United States, the largest competitors in China, the British and American forces, have been completely removed. Moreover, the National Government and the Chinese people have now shown a comprehensive attitude of trust and cooperation. Therefore, today we must completely abandon the concept of antagonism or international rights and interests and promote friendly economies based on Sino-Japanese equality. However, it is certainly not easy for businesses that have been operating in China for a long time to change their long-standing habits along the lines of national policy. I especially hope that everyone will provide guidance and encouragement in this regard.

(2) After the establishment of new relations between China and Japan, the Japanese businesses that have been operating in China will not be forced to withdraw or dissolve, except for special cases. However, with regard to businesses that are managed and controlled by the Japanese side for special reasons during the Incident, it is natural that appropriate adjustments should be made according to the new policies and the nature of the business. Furthermore, changes in management personnel may also be anticipated as assets are transferred. In short, as mentioned above, we should get rid of old habits and aim to realize genuine Sino-Japanese cooperation from a standpoint of equality. (Translated excerpt from the March 30th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

### Impressions of the Capital

— Liu Hanru

The Chairman's speech was concise and clear, and his attitude was sincere. He was kind and compassionate in the ceremony. His words moved everyone's heartstrings, causing people to feel respect involuntarily. The commemorative ritual lasted an hour and ended with the entire assembly enthusiastically chanting "Long live the Republic of China," marking a historically significant moment.

At 10:30 a.m., the Chairman walked into the center of the restaurant entrance, chatting with General Hata as he walked. Following them were Foreign Minister Chu and Minister Lin, accompanied by Ambassador Shigemitsu, the Italian Ambassador, the German Chargé d'affaires, and other foreign envoys, as well as officers from the army, navy, and air force. They entered slowly to the sound of music. Shaoxing wine and champagne filled the glasses. The sound of clinking glasses and congratulations, combined with the aroma of wine, filled the air, filling the entire hall. Diplomatic relations would become even closer from this point on.

At 11:30 a.m., another scene unfolded in front of the National Assembly Hall. This was the beginning of the military parade. The Chairman, dressed in his Grand Marshal's uniform, appeared on the temporary parade stand. The "Grand Marshal Flag Escort Team," holding the large flag, stood upright beside him, dignified and solemn, which was awe-inspiring. Row after row of patriotic warriors saluted and marched past the Chairman until 12:00 p.m., when the grand ceremony ended. The morning's celebrations came to a temporary conclusion at this point.

In commemoration of the return of the capital, this newspaper specially sent 1,000 copies to Beijing on the 30th to be distributed to various sectors. At around 4:00 p.m. today, the reporter transported the newspapers to National Central University, where the Shanghai football teams were putting on a friendship match. The football field was packed with fans from the capital. Taking advantage of the break, the reporter distributed the newspapers from all four corners of the field. In no time, the newspapers were snatched up. The people of Nanjing had been separated from this newspaper for a long time, and some even asked the reporter if this newspaper was still being published. Their affection for this newspaper moved the reporter greatly.

While in Beijing, I visited fellow journalists, including the president of the Republic of China Daily News, the president of the China Daily News, and various members of the Central News Agency, as well as reporters from the North China Journalists Association and Mr. Irie from the Domei News Agency. I am grateful for their warm hospitality and the exchange of ideas. We all felt that the communication among journalists is insufficient at present. For example, it is not easy to see the Shen Bao in Beijing, Nanjing, Tianjin, Qingdao, and other places, and it is also difficult to find newspapers from the aforementioned places in Shanghai. In this turbulent era, the exchange of Chinese and foreign cultures is still needed, and the mouthpiece of the domestic people—the newspaper—should be clear first. Regarding this point, we all believe that journalists should work hard to resolve this difficulty.

The cost of living in Nanjing is generally lower than in Shanghai. I cannot give examples of prices here, but just taking rice as an example, the black market price of rice in Shanghai is now twice as high as in Nanjing. Also, for example, if you go to the Confucius Temple to eat a bowl of pork noodles, half a basket of six large steamed buns, and a small bowl of dried bean curd shreds, you can't say that that's "cheap," can you? In Shanghai, it would cost more than 25 yuan, but in Nanjing, 12 or 13 yuan would be enough. (To be continued) Also stating that a certain official of the American government plans to visit London in the near future.

### American Delegation to Visit Moscow

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a report from the London correspondent of the Stockholm Tidningen, U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles and his party are expected to arrive in London. Whether their final destination is London or Moscow has not been disclosed. According to American sources, a delegation will depart for Moscow to discuss issues with Stalin, such as those recently discussed by Eden in Washington.

### Britain Convenes Near East Transportation Conference

Ankara, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) News from Egypt received here today states that British Minister of State for the Near East Casey, in view of the various difficulties in transportation and supply, has scheduled a transportation conference of twelve Near Eastern countries to be held in Cairo next Thursday. It is expected that one of the main topics of discussion at this conference will be the reorganization of the anti-Axis transportation system to reduce the number of ships lost due to Axis submarine attacks. It is reported that Iran, Iraq, Syria, and Abyssinia will send representatives to attend.

### Daladier, Blum, and Others Moved to Germany for Imprisonment

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) It was announced here this evening that the German government has decided to move former French Prime Ministers Daladier, Blum, and General Gamelin, the commander-in-chief of the French forces in the 1940 war against Germany, to Germany in order to avoid British and American plans to seize these individuals. The original text of the German government's announcement is as follows: "Based on the information it has received, the German government has determined that the British and American governments intend to seize several French figures who have always been in France in the hope of using them to establish an opposition government to cause unrest and chaos in France. Therefore, the German government has decided, following the precedent of former French cabinet members Reynaud and Mandel, to move former French Prime Ministers Daladier, Blum, and General Gamelin to Germany. For the reasons stated above, the German government cannot comply with the request of French Head of State Laval to allow these individuals to remain in France. However, the German government assures the French government that the military necessity of moving these individuals will not cause them any harm, nor will it change their treatment by the French government. The German government will return these individuals to the French government for disposal when circumstances permit."

### Paris Suffers Surprise Attack, Numerous Deaths and Injuries

Vichy, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) When anti-Axis aircraft attacked Paris today, it was during the first races of the spring horse racing season at the famous Longchamp Racecourse, resulting in at least thirty deaths and numerous injuries, making it impossible to make an accurate estimate. The bombers appeared over Paris at around 2:00 p.m. today, just as the first race was about to begin. The bombers dropped bombs from high altitude, many of which landed near the racecourse. The spectators fled in panic, trampling each other. The cries of women mixed with the sound of anti-aircraft guns. Order was restored after an hour. Thirty people died, and many more were seriously injured.

### Hungarian Prime Minister Visits Mussolini

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency dispatch) After meeting with the Pope on the 3rd, Hungarian Prime Minister Kállay also visited Italian Prime Minister Mussolini at the Palazzo Venezia for talks.

Sofia, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Stefani News Agency, the Bulgarian official news agency published an article emphasizing the importance of the Bulgarian-Albanian border demarcation agreement, stating that the agreement will simultaneously cede the village of Pestiani and a portion of Lake Ohrid and its lakeshore to Bulgaria. Negotiations for this agreement began during the Bulgarian Prime Minister's visit to Rome in July and concluded on March 30th of this year.

### New Trends in the European Economic System

The durability of the Soviet Union has now been proven by facts and cannot be underestimated. Therefore, Britain and the United States are concentrating their efforts on disrupting Europe, viewing it as the key to determining the outcome of the war. On the Axis side, resistance activities have also become increasingly active recently, with the domestic situation extremely tense and the entire war system completed. In order to counter the Anglo-American system, how should this new system of Europe-wide total war be strengthened to adapt to the current emergency situation? In order to understand the international interrelationships of the European economy that form the basis of the broad economic warfare system, reporters (Wakayama, Yamamoto, special correspondents) interviewed Mr. Jakobsson of the Basel Bank for International Settlements and two or three influential international economic experts, and exchanged opinions with them. Of course, the position of neutral countries is now quite delicate. While some arguments are quite correct, there are also many prejudices. The content of the conversations was very interesting.

Jakobsson is a Swede and an advisor to the Bank for International Settlements. He is the editor of the Bank for International Settlements' annual report and an expert familiar with international economics. At the same time, he is a financier widely watched. Before Sir Otto Niemeyer of the Bank of England went to China to reform the currency system, he was once recruited by Japan, but the matter did not come to fruition, and he still misses it. His understanding of Japan's position is quite fair.

The other gentlemen are also international economic experts, but they cannot escape the influence of long-term free economic thought, harboring the illusion that a free economy is still possible in the future, and rarely understand the inevitable evolution of history.

The first question: "Regardless of whether European countries are willing, in order to counter the communization of the Soviet Union and the economic blockade of Britain and the United States, should they have closer cooperation with Germany and Italy in the future?" On this point, no clear conclusion was reached. The interviewees believed this to be a matter of the European people's trust in Germany, while the reporters took the position solely from the perspective of the real material foundation.

Britain and the United States have been using post-war tactics to instigate and disrupt Europe for a long time because they do not have the strength to defeat Germany and Italy. Recent news magazines talk lavishly about post-war issues, which are clearly exaggerated and fabricated propaganda. Although Germany and Italy inevitably face many difficulties, they undoubtedly want to link European countries together.

Speaking of the current status of clearing agreements. The clearing agreement was initially regarded as a countermeasure to resolve the freezing of assets with Germany, and was started after negotiations between Germany and the opposing countries. To date, it has been expanding daily. Except for Spain, Portugal, and Turkey, 17 European countries are interconnected through Berlin based on multilateral clearing agreements. This is a technical foundation that constitutes the European total war system. On the other hand, despite the many difficulties in wartime today, the biggest problem is that European countries export more to Germany than they import from Germany, resulting in an increase in claims against Germany.

Some people view the increase in claims against Germany as a pessimistic reason for the future of the clearing agreement. Germany explains this as "the nature of claims against Germany is like long-term wartime savings stored in Germany, which will be gradually supplied and repaid by Germany in the form of goods after the war." Therefore, the increase in claims against Germany is not a reason for pessimism. In the future, these claims will enable European countries to cooperate more closely with Germany and Italy in order to win the material foundation of the Europe-wide total war.

The next question is, "After the claims against Germany reach a considerable amount, due to advance payments, European countries will inevitably issue more inconvertible paper money and cause inflation. What are your opinions on this?"

Regarding the issue of inflation, everyone unanimously held an optimistic view, believing that the situation that occurred after the last war would not be seen again for the time being. The reasons are:

First, the completeness of the economic control organization;

Second, everyone has considerable knowledge of the consequences of malignant inflation;

Third, the dominance of capital has been suppressed.

That is, the power of politics over organized economic activities is far greater than it was in the last war. The expansion of social facilities has stabilized the rear life, and at the same time, controlling prices and reducing bank interest rates have made it impossible for capital to reap excessive profits. Furthermore, the method of raising war funds also strives to suppress the outdated method of relying on public debt and absorbs surplus purchasing power. Therefore, all countries have successively increased taxes, and the percentage of war expenses borne by taxes in each country has significantly increased compared to the last war. Considering these things, at least inflation similar to that after the last war will not occur. Many powerful opinions believe that gold will still play a considerable role after the war, but there will be considerable changes depending on the US gold policy. Many other issues were also discussed. In short, emotional issues have obscured the eyes of judging reality, and there is no firm awareness of the inevitable trends in the future. This is the impression gained by the reporters.

But on the other hand, the reporters also saw the reality of the situation, ruthlessly overturning the above ideas. Why can't the agricultural Balkan countries not produce a certain amount of food? Why can't neutral Switzerland not cultivate gardens on the mountains and dismantle the flowers and plants in the parks to plant potatoes? In short, the characteristic of this war is that the burden of sacrifices in the war is not borne by a certain part but by a broad layer of the entire population, and whether they are willing or not, it is shared jointly by the national layers of several countries. Regarding this point, a certain person said, "Whether it is the US Lend-Lease Act or the issue of increasing claims against Germany through the European clearing agreement, they all prove that this war is an activity of a broad total war." Because the purpose and hopes of the war are very great, the methods of war, even in the participating countries, cannot but be different, and therefore the one-sided flow of materials cannot but be stopped. The sacrifices of this war cannot be borne by only one country, but must be borne jointly by several countries. No one can be indifferent to the war, and even a small country in Europe cannot go beyond the European war circle.

As for the quantity and price, it will be announced separately after being approved by the authorities.

Special Ration Sugar Rotation Review

As for the special ration sugar for self-use by various industries last month, the review has already started. However, because there are more than 10,000 rationed households, it has not been possible to complete it all at once, so a rotation system has been adopted, reviewing them one by one in order. Those that are completed first are issued first. Notification slips have now been issued for a portion, which can be exchanged for sugar purchase certificates to buy sugar from designated Class B sugar merchants. The price is the same as the previous period, at five yuan, five jiao, and five fen per catty, plus two li for the Public Concession Bureau donation. Another portion is also being reviewed and will be issued within days to process the procedures for exchanging certificates and purchasing sugar.

### Yesterday, All Sectors of the City Held a Confucius Ceremony

The city's Spring Sacrificial Ceremony was held solemnly yesterday morning at the Confucius Temple in the Southern City. Mr. Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, represented Mayor Chen Gongbo as the chief officiant. The ceremony was simple and solemn. It is estimated that no fewer than a thousand people, including officials from various districts of the city, principals of various primary and secondary schools, and male and female students, attended.

The situation was extremely grand. In addition to armed police guarding inside and outside the Confucius Temple, the Boy Scouts of the Second Municipal Middle School maintained order. A red silk banner was hung high in front of the Dacheng Hall, with the words "Spring Confucius Ceremony in Shanghai Special City" written on it. Candles were lit brightly in the hall, and incense smoke filled the air. A bunch of incense and flowers were offered in front of the Great Accomplishment Sage Teacher and various holy positions, and the atmosphere was especially solemn.

Sacrificial Text for Confucius

The Confucius sacrificial text yesterday read: "We, in the thirty-second year of the Republic of China, on the fifth day of the fourth month of the year Guiwei, Chen Gongbo, Mayor of Shanghai Special City, together with officials, respectfully offer flowers and clear wine to the Great Accomplishment Sage Teacher Confucius, saying, 'Only the Teacher, whose laws have flourished for thousands of years, crowning a hundred kings, brought together the great accomplishment of sacred learning, which has never been seen by the people. First in loyalty and forgiveness, the sage harmonized with the mean, opening up thousands of years of culture with the tinder of sixteen characters. Pi Yong's bells and drums overflowed with harmonious sounds, and the elegant songs of Sheng Zhao brightened the grand ceremony. Now, at the Spring Festival, we piously prepare rituals, and lead our colleagues to offer our admiration. The spring breeze is warm, like the Teacher's kindness in nurturing, and the rain knows the time, offering the praise of harmony. We respectfully follow the sacrificial rites, with the Second Sage, the Returning Sage, the Narrating Sage, and the Zong Sage as companions,'" and so on.

Chief Officiant's Dedication

The chief officiant, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, Zhao Zunyue's dedication said, "The Teacher's teachings are immortal for thousands of years. The flourishing of our country's culture and education is based on the Teacher's teachings. The so-called cultural spirit of Greater East Asia is actually the teachings of Confucius. Cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world. Everything from the personal conduct of individuals to the entire national governance is fully instructed to future generations without any omissions. The personal conduct of individuals should not violate the Doctrine of the Mean. Speaking with loyalty and trustworthiness, and acting with sincerity and respect, are especially good precepts for future generations. Therefore, Confucius's learning contains everything. For thousands of years, the culture of East Asia has been passed down forever. The National Government's policy after returning to the capital is based on this, and restoring the spring and autumn sacrifices is not just a model for respecting the Confucian community and remembering the teachers and sages. It is used as a dedication," and so on.

Confucius Sage Society

On April 5th, the Qingming Festival, coinciding with the clear weather of Shangsi, the Chinese Confucius Sage Society held a grand Confucius ceremony at its clubhouse on Avenue Edward VII. Preparations had been made the night before, with offerings of sacrificial vessels, silk, incense, and fresh flowers arranged in front of the statues, which were extremely solemn and splendid. More than a hundred people attended, all dressed in blue robes and black jackets, behaving elegantly. The chief officiant was Chairman Tang and Chairman Shen, and the accompanying officiants were Vice Chairmen Feng and Shen. The announcer called for everyone to stand up straight and sing the national anthem and the song of honoring Confucius. The national anthem was the Three Principles of the People, and the song of honoring Confucius was "Confucius, Confucius, the Great Confucius, before Confucius, there was no Confucius, after Confucius, there is no Confucius, Confucius, Confucius, the Great Confucius." After everyone finished singing, the ritual of offering began: (1) Bowing deeply to the statue of the sage, three bows, (2) Silence, (3) Offering incense, offering wine, offering flowers, (4) Reading the prayer, which reads, "We, Shen Enzi and others, disciples of the Chinese Confucius Sage Society of Jiangsu Province, Shanghai County, respectfully offer sacrifices to the Holy Teacher Confucius, saying, 'Our Teacher, whose virtue is superior to the thousand sages and whose teachings crown the hundred kings, reveals the sun and moon as always, and is unprecedented among the people. Belonging to the memory of the River Horse carrying the map, we cherish the auspicious unicorn spitting out jade. The palace walls are beautiful, and after generations, the scenery is renewed. The position of nurturing and harmony traces its fame and reaches far and wide. Spreading longevity and the transformation of people, the Jun Mao are all respectful, recommending fragrant incense, presenting the categories of Yi Lun's order, and the etiquette is more elaborate, stricter than the Bian Dou. Happily meeting Shangsi, we respectfully follow Yi Zhang, solemnly displaying our humble sincerity, and respectfully carry out the sacrificial rites, may you enjoy the offerings,'" (5) Performing the ritual of burning the prayer, (6) The ceremony is completed, Qin Qin.

### After the Implementation of the New System for the Movement of Materials, Ships Operating on the Yangtze River are being Reorganized. Existing Vessels are being Fully Utilized. The City's Transportation Industry is Expected to Become More Prosperous.

After the implementation of the new system for the movement of materials, the transportation of materials between the inland and the city will become busy. The city's shipping company authorities believe that it is necessary to adjust this situation in order to increase the city's production. The city's China Shipping Company authorities have already considered this point and will make full use of the existing vessels operating on the Yangtze River. According to the Datong News Agency reporter, most of the city's transportation companies have a large amount of goods waiting to be transported for export. Therefore, they are paying close attention to the shipping company's adjustment of shipping and hope that it can strengthen the transportation capacity of the ships. According to general speculation, since there are many types of material movements in the city that are not subject to control, if the transportation capacity of the shipping companies is further strengthened, the city's declining transportation industry can be improved slightly.

### Nanshi Self-Defense Corps General Meeting. More than 500 Members Participating.

The Nanshi District Baojia Self-Defense Corps held a general meeting of its members at the Penglai Grand Theater in Nanshi yesterday morning at 10 o'clock. A total of more than 500 people, including Fang Chiefs, Bao Chiefs, Lianbao Chiefs, and Jia Chiefs, attended. Mr. Sugiama and Mr. Furukawa of the Nanshi Allied Gendarmerie also attended. The details are recorded below:

Unanimous Participation from All Sectors of Nanshi

In addition to General Corps Commander Wang Delin, Mr. Wang Baosui, Chief of the Xiejiao Police Branch, Mr. Jiang Ziyun, Chief of the Zhonghua Road Police Branch, Mr. Feng Shiying, Chief of the Detective Squad, Mr. Huang Jinren, Chief of the First Fang, Mr. Jiang Zhenwu, Chief of the Second Fang, Mr. Zhuang Zhiyin, Chief of the Third Fang, Mr. Xu Peishan, Chief of the Fourth Fang, and Ms. Mo Peixin, Chief of the Fifth Fang, citizens from all sectors of Nanshi also unanimously attended the Nanshi District Baojia Self-Defense Corps General Meeting. At the same time, Mr. Sugiama and Mr. Kenichi Furukawa of the Nanshi Gendarmerie also attended, totaling more than 500 people.

General Corps Commander's Opening Remarks

After the ceremony, General Corps Commander Wang Delin gave the opening remarks, briefly saying that since the implementation of the Baojia system, local security has been increasingly consolidated. Recently, the Municipal Baojia Committee has been established, and under the guidance of Director Lu, it will be even more complete. The Bao Chiefs are the leaders of the residents and should especially lead by example and be fair, honest, sincere, and diligent in their work. The Nanshi Baojia Self-Defense Corps was established on June 15th last year. Because of the close cooperation between the police and the Baojia, the achievements of the Self-Defense Corps have been outstanding and have been repeatedly praised by Director Lu Ying of the Municipal Police Bureau. It is the responsibility of the squad leaders to supervise and command, so the squad leaders should bear the direct responsibility for whether the Self-Defense Corps can fully exert its responsibilities. From now on, everyone should recognize their responsibilities, earnestly carry them out, and enable every member of the Nanshi Self-Defense Corps to exert their abilities and increase the strength of the police corps.

Allied Official's Remarks

Following this, Mr. Sugiama, Commander of the Nanshi Gendarmerie, gave a speech, saying that the cooperation between the Gendarmerie and the Municipal Police Authority promotes the improvement of local security, and the Baojia Self-Defense Corps should also closely connect with the Gendarmerie and the Police Bureau to make local security more complete and to reach the stage where nothing is picked up on the road, and the people can live and work in peace. I hope that all Bao Chiefs, Lianbao Chiefs, and Jia Chiefs will earnestly carry this out.

Two Branch Corps Commanders Speaking in Succession

Subsequently, Self-Defense Corps Branch Commanders Jiang Ziyun and Wang Baosui stood up and gave speeches one after another. Jiang said, "The Baojia cannot be separated from the Self-Defense Corps. The soundness of the Self-Defense Corps is of great importance to the security of the entire area. The duty of the Self-Defense Corps is to maintain local security with local forces." Wang Baosui's speech said, "The meeting held today is of great significance, because it allows the corps' actions to be clearly understood by all members without any alienation. There are more than 500 Self-Defense Corps posts in Nanshi, divided into three shifts, mobilizing more than 1,500 people every day to maintain local security, which can promote the escape of criminals, but all members must not be perfunctory, and all Baojia Chiefs should constantly warn everyone," and so on. At the end, General Corps Commander Wang Delin gave a reply, and then the meeting was adjourned.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council is Conducting Cleaning Work and Simultaneously Carrying Out Large-Scale Sweeping of Streets and Roads

In order to improve the appearance of the city, the Shanghai Municipal Council is sparing no effort in the cleaning of the streets. It has specifically ordered a group of sanitation workers to carry out cleaning work on the roads every day, tearing down old and dirty posters and scrubbing the walls. This work will be carried out every few days thereafter. At the same time, in order to maintain the cleanliness of the roads, the Bureau, in addition to urging the sanitation workers to work hard, washes and sweeps the roads and sidewalks on a large scale every four or five days.

After receiving the order, the Department immediately notified all its subordinate bureaus to comply and also issued a public notice to all merchants and people.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department Expanding Epidemic Prevention Work

The city's district health authorities have already started to handle epidemic prevention and health matters in various districts. The Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has sent staff to step up inspections of the vegetable markets, food, and roadside stalls within the concession, and strictly manage all related health matters, sending staff to inspect. Due to the expansion of work, the existing inspectors are not enough to allocate, so it has been submitted for approval to recruit Chinese junior inspectors to be trained and appointed.

In order to maintain the health of the people in the French Concession and eradicate smallpox and infectious diseases, the French Concession Health Department dispatches doctors to lead staff twice a day, in the morning and afternoon, to various Lianbao offices to provide free smallpox vaccinations for men, women, old people, and children. In recent days, the weather has been warm, so many residents have flocked to the Lianbao offices to request vaccinations, with more children than adults.

### New Motor Vehicle Permits Valid for Three Months

The Shanghai Municipal Council announces that the new motor vehicle permits for the period from April to June this year (i.e., the notices affixed to the windshield of the car) have been prepared, and car owners can collect them from the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Fuzhou Road Police Headquarters before April 7th. Permits that have expired are no longer valid after April 8th. Car owners are requested to pay attention.

### Noodle Food Industry Association Handles Member Registration

The Shanghai Noodle Food Industry Association, jointly organized by the machine-made cut noodle industry, the fried cooked food industry, the cake and steamed bread industry, and the cake, noodle, and fried dough stick industry, will soon be one month old since its establishment. It has been making every effort to negotiate with the authorities to restore the allocation of flour and has had some hope. However, many members in each group are found to be duplicates. Because there were originally associations in each industry and one store joined several associations, it is very inconvenient for reporting procedures and allocation matters. With the permission of the Shanghai Municipal Council Association Section and the decision of the association's board of directors and supervisors, a general registration will be held from today (6th) to the 9th in order to adjust and serve as the standard for flour allocation. Therefore, within the above-mentioned period, members of each group must bring their spring business license, flour card, citizen certificate, brand name, seal, and private seal, and the manager must personally go to the Jueyuan Buddhist Temple at No. 418 Chide Road, identify the nature of the business, and register with each group.

### Special Feature: The New Chinese Navy - A Tour of the Hai Xiang and Hai Xing

— Liu Hanruo

Since the return of the National Government to the capital, China's army, navy, and air force have been rebuilt with the assistance of Japan. The reconstruction of the new navy is like a new spring bud growing.

The gunboat Hai Xiang of the Weihaiwei naval base and the training ship Hai Xing of Shanghai, in order to participate in the celebration of the return to the capital, sailed from their respective defense zones to Nanjing, were inspected by Chairman Wang, and after completing their mission, recently sailed to Shanghai and were anchored at the Bund wharf on Nanjing Road. This reporter, in order to see the face of this new Chinese navy, made a special trip for a brief inquiry.

Under the national emblem, the white cross Chinese naval flag fluttered on the Huangpu River. The two warships were quietly berthed alongside the ship. Because the Chinese navy does not often appear on the Huangpu River, many people on the shore were casting curious glances at them. Naturally, the size of the Hai Xiang and Hai Xing ships cannot be compared with the large warships of other countries anchored in the heart of the river. However, let me tell you: these are just training ships and river defense gunboats!

On the Hai Xiang, because the captain had gone ashore on official business, I only met the deputy captain, Major Li Jikang, a robust figure and handsome in appearance, a young man who spoke very gently. Major Li told the reporter everything about the Hai Xiang:

"The Hai Xiang is a gunboat of 865 tons, 200 feet long, with a normal sailing speed of 10 nautical miles, and a full speed of 13 nautical miles. It is equipped with two cannons and two new-style anti-aircraft machine guns. The entire ship has 20 officers, 100 soldiers, and 20 naval academy cadets. The Hai Xiang is one of the Weihaiwei fortress base fleet. It was handed over to our country by Japan in August of the 30th year (1941). The captain is Mr. Ma Yunsheng."

Everywhere on the ship was clean and orderly, and the soldiers were full of vigor. White uniforms with the "Republic of China Navy" cap badge were floating everywhere. This is the future "China belt and sash, golden soup of East Asia"!

After visiting the Hai Xiang, Deputy Captain Li accompanied the reporter to visit the Hai Xing. Under the leadership of Deputy Captain Chen Lianke, another tour of the Hai Xing was conducted. According to Deputy Captain Chen, "Except for the stern of the Hai Xing being slightly higher than the Hai Xiang, everything else is largely the same. She was built in England in the 17th year of the Republic (1928) and is now used as a training ship for the Shanghai Naval Academy." On the deck, I saw many people using binoculars or diligently inspecting the machinery, presumably naval students practicing.

After inspecting the two ships, we returned to the shore. Seeing our naval flag fluttering in the wind on the bank of the Huangpu River, I couldn't help but silently wish the new Chinese navy a bright future!

### Economic Circle

The Central China Tobacco Allocation Association Implements Uniform Distribution: The first batch of goods was distributed on the 25th of last month. The next distribution is expected to be around the 10th of this month. The allocation includes Nanyang, Datong, and other cigarettes. As for the method for Chinese merchants, it remains the same as the previous period. The goods can only be shipped after notification from the association.

The Central Market firewood and charcoal cooperative in this city has a total capital of 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan collected first. The previous rumor of a capital of 600,000 yuan, with 300,000 yuan collected first, is inaccurate.

### Commentary: Stabilizing Prices Lies in Unblocking Raw Material Sources

Stabilizing prices lies in increasing production. To increase productivity, the first step is to unblock raw material sources. Currently, foreign raw materials are unavailable. However, domestic agricultural and mineral products can serve as raw materials for industrial products and can replace foreign raw materials. If transportation infrastructure can be improved and transportation efficiency increased, agricultural raw materials from various inland areas can be transported to industrial areas as much as possible, such as Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Nanjing. Then, manufactured goods from factories can be transported to inland areas as much as possible, implementing a barter system. In this way, raw material sources will be unblocked, and prices will naturally stabilize. Because costs are reduced, all prices can naturally fall. Not only in Central China, but also between North and Central China, and between Central and South China, if each region actively trades its local specialties, adhering to the principle of material exchange, prices in various regions can be uniformly stabilized. The public's fear of material shortages can also be eliminated invisibly. Therefore, in addition to using political power to control prices, it is also necessary to unblock material sources. It is essential to improve transportation infrastructure, increase the amount of raw materials available daily, and consistently improve factory productivity. Then, supply and demand will be balanced, materials will circulate, and the most difficult price problem can be easily solved.

### Deputy Minister Chen of the Ministry of Finance Discusses: Our Country's Wartime Finance is Solid, the People Have the Ability to Bear Taxes, and Inflation Will Absolutely Not Occur

Nanjing, 5th (Central News Agency): Since the National Government officially entered the war, our country's wartime system has gradually been established, and the economic and financial system has also gradually become consolidated. This reporter visited Deputy Minister Chen Zhishuo of the Ministry of Finance yesterday to inquire about recent financial and economic issues of the National Government. He kindly answered them one by one as follows:

Question: What are the characteristics of our country's wartime finance?

Answer: The characteristics of our country's wartime finance must first be grasped. Our government is now cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and implementing participation in the war. The current focus of finance is to increase production. There are various types of increased production industries, especially "turning the scattered into the integrated and turning the non-existent into the existent" is the most important. All material and human resources scattered throughout the country must be concentrated to contribute to the Greater East Asia War.

Question: Are special wartime taxes currently being implemented?

Answer: There is no special tax collection at present. There is no need for special taxes at present.

Question: What is the current capacity of the domestic population to bear taxes?

Answer: The public not only has the ability to bear the current taxes, but also has a deep understanding of taxes, which is a good phenomenon. Even if taxes are increased, it is believed that the general public will be able to recognize the goal, assist the government in completing the great cause, and will not feel any pain.

Question: After the friendly nation Japan stopped issuing military scrip in various parts of China, it has had a significant impact on the future of our country's currency system. What are your thoughts?

Answer: Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the Central Reserve Bank was first established and granted the right to issue currency to unify the currency system and lay the foundation for finance. Over the past three years, the right to issue Hwa Hsing Notes was first abolished, then the equal circulation of Central Reserve Notes and old legal tender was abolished, and then the legal tender nature of the old legal tender was abolished, eventually eliminating the old legal tender, so that the Central Reserve Note is the only currency in the peaceful areas. Regarding military scrip, the friendly nation Japan, in order to assist our country in completing the unified currency policy, has stopped the new issuance of military scrip and the cancellation of old legal tender from April 1, which is no different in meaning. The only difference is that the method of withdrawal is one of decisive action and the other of natural trend.

Question: Can our country avoid the occurrence of inflation?

Answer: The current issuance of Central Reserve Notes is only over 2 billion, which is still far from the needs of various regions. Those who are ignorant of the principles of economics and finance are concerned about inflation due to rising prices, but they do not know that the Central Reserve Note currently holds more than 60% of reserve funds. Whether now or in the future, there will absolutely not be inflation.

### Minister Gu of the Ministry of Food Explains the Organization of Cooperative Societies

Shanghai (Central News Agency): Minister of Food Gu Baoheng has been in Shanghai for several days to promote the food control issue, contacting leaders of various industries in the city and providing guidance. This reporter visited Mr. Gu yesterday (the 5th) to inquire about the organizational issues of the controlled food cooperative societies. He kindly made the following statement: The organizational rules for the Ministry of Food's controlled food cooperative societies, published in the Beijing and Shanghai newspapers on the 1st of this month, were originally a draft for research purposes and were not announced or implemented. Since the National Government officially promulgated the Provisional Regulations for Business Guilds, this proposal has become a thing of the past. Except for rice merchants (rice and glutinous rice), who still organize local rice purchase and sales management offices under special laws, other food industries such as flour, miscellaneous grains, sugar, eggs, tea, and livestock should organize trade guilds under the guidance and supervision of the Ministry of Food's Food Bureau and the county and municipal government's competent authorities. The traders in each industry should organize trade guilds, and the local trade guilds should form a joint federation. The various trade federations should jointly form a commercial control federation (excluding foreign trade industries for the time being) to complete a highly autonomous control mechanism. The trade guilds and federations of each lower-level organization are directly governed by the commercial control federation. The commercial control federation oversees everything, and the Ministry of Food fulfills its guidance and supervisory duties for the food-related parts of the commercial control federation. Furthermore, the business categories under the jurisdiction of the Ministry mentioned in the newspapers on the 4th incorrectly listed flour as cotton. As for edible salt, it has special regulatory agencies due to tax relations, so it is not under the management of the Ministry of Food. There are also many other errors that cannot be listed. Please take the news reports of my speech at the reception for the directors and supervisors of the commercial control federation and the leaders of various industries on March 31 as the standard, so as to avoid the outside world being unaware of the truth and spreading misinformation.

### The Municipal Bureau of Economy Started General Registration of Major Commodities Yesterday: Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth is Transferred by the Commercial Control Federation

Shanghai (Central News Agency): In order to comply with the powers conferred by the Provisional Regulations and to implement the wartime economic policy and the task of material control guidance and supervision, as well as to handle the balanced distribution of materials fairly in the future, the Shanghai Special Municipal Bureau of Economy has launched a general registration of major materials in Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to formulate guidelines for promoting all wartime economic policies based on the statistical figures of this general registration. The measures for the bureau to handle the general registration of major items have been formulated and announced to the industries for their information. Registration will start on the 5th of this month and end on the 30th of this month. It is reported that in order to facilitate the registration of companies and shops in various industries, those who have registered with the National Commercial Control Federation for cotton yarn and cotton cloth will have their registration transferred by the Commercial Control Federation to the bureau without the need to register again. As for foreign shops or owners outside the respective trade guilds, they must apply to the bureau for registration. Those who resist or conceal, or underreport, will be severely punished once verified.

Major Item Registration Form

Since the bureau promulgated the general registration measures for major items in the city, it has been decided to start the registration process yesterday (the 5th). All shops or companies in various industries in the city must truthfully fill in the columns listed in the application form for major item registration and apply to the bureau for registration. (A) Applicants for registration: (1) Shop name, (2) Name of shop owner or manager, (3) Business address, (4) Telephone number (If privately owned, state the name, occupation, address, and telephone number of the owner). (B) Item type: (1) Item name, (2) Trademark, (3) Quantity, (4) Storage location, (5) Remarks.

### Controlling the Prices of Daily Necessities Will Be Implemented Gradually

According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the Public Works Department has decided to gradually implement price controls in order to curb the prices of various major daily necessities. New price controls have already been implemented for cigarettes, and retail stores have been strictly ordered to comply. Those who disobey secretly will be severely punished. Therefore, the authorities have dispatched a large number of investigators yesterday to investigate whether retailers are complying with the price controls on daily necessities. As for soap, matches, and candles, their prices are also under the travel control of the authorities, and limited prices will be announced soon. It is also heard that after the authorities have achieved results in controlling the prices of the above-mentioned daily necessities, they will expand the scope and organize a strict control system. This system may be unprecedented, but its effects will be even better. Once a strict control system is established, the prices of other daily necessities will be subject to its control, so that retailers, wholesalers, or manufacturers will be unable to seek illegal profits. As for residents, there will be no shortage of daily necessities for their personal use.

### Chinese, Japanese, and Manchukuo Railway Authorities Will Hold the Second Round Table Conference

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency): The second round table conference on railway materials between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has been scheduled to be held from the 26th to the 28th of this month at the Ministry of Railways here.

Changjiang Industry and Trade Association Holds Third Congress

At the Sino-Japanese Economic Roundtable held on the 30th of last month, Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia expressed his strong desire that Japanese businessmen involved in Chinese enterprises must promote friendly economic cooperation on the basis of Sino-Japanese equality. He hoped that the private sector would cooperate in this regard. In order to adapt to this new policy and solicit opinions from all parties to gather ideas, the Changjiang Industry and Trade Development Association specially held its third congress at the Tokyo Peerage Hall on the occasion of its third anniversary (April 2nd). Attendees included Xu Liang, former ambassador to Japan, the former 5th Director of the Planning Board, Counselor Tanaka of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the chiefs of various sections, Director Takei of the Accounting Bureau of the Navy Ministry, Director Lingnuma of the Price Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, President Tamura of the Japan Fisheries Co. from the private sector, as well as representatives from East Asia Shipping, Mitsubishi Trading, and banks and news agencies related to Central China, totaling more than 100 people. President Tamura delivered a speech first, followed by discussions on various issues, which yielded fruitful results. (From the Continental New Report on April 4th)

Utilizing Spare Time - Prisoners

The extent of a young person's future achievements can be determined by how they utilize their fragmented spare time. Those who constantly complain and think, "I have no time," truly seem to have no spare time. However, those who steal time from being busy, their ambition will be there, and time will be there, because no one can absolutely not find spare time and time, unless they use spare time for improper things, or doze off. Therefore, those who can utilize space can help them succeed, and those who cannot utilize space instead use their spare time to do things that are harmful to their body and mind, and find a path of degradation for themselves.

We often wonder why many friends of our fathers and brothers have not attended any schools and are mostly "apprentices" by origin, but they read a lot of books and write beautiful calligraphy... What is the reason for this? This is all the reward they get from using their spare time. Frankly speaking, "We are now no matter how busy, not as busy as they were when they were 'apprentices'! But they say that it is always possible to steal a little time from being busy to read a few pages and write a few words," so what about us?

You might as well ask yourself, "Where have our precious spare time gone? Has it been used entirely for proper purposes?"

Scientific Essays - "Cancer" Peng Liu

Picking up the pen, I can't help but think of three "worries": the danger of cancer is indeed terrible; that terrible cancer can be treated with a kind of light is also strange; that in today's scientifically advanced world, common knowledge of cancer is not very popular in China, I can't help but feel sorry.

Speaking of cancer, it is truly terrible. Those who suffer from this disease will be summoned to heaven in a few months to a few years. The so-called pain is caused by the abnormal transformation of cells in a certain part of the body, which grows abnormally. It can occur in any part of the body. The so-called abnormal growth means that it does not exist in normal situations and common diseases. The differentiation and growth of this cell is unbelievably rapid, like the saying "growing day by day." Since the cells are growing so rapidly, they need abundant nutrition. Therefore, the nutrients needed by all parts of the body are plundered by them, resulting in extreme weakness of the patient. Moreover, these cells are different from normal cells: even if the body's nutrition is close to exhaustion, they still stubbornly do their best to exploit and extract until death. However, the horror of cancer is not only this. During the growth period, cancer grows outward non-stop on the one hand, and penetrates into the internal tissues on the other hand, just like the roots of underground trees, spreading branches in all directions without a definite range. If you want to cut it out, you can't cut it all out, and when it penetrates and encounters any organ, it also pushes in, either growing firmly with the organ, or destroying and penetrating the organ and continuing to grow, causing the organ to lose its function. What's more, cancer cells also have the characteristic of migration, with a great "tendency to flee". When a certain part has cancer, it can soon occur in another part (for example, breast cancer can cause cancer under the armpit). Therefore, even if all methods are used to remove the cancer, it often recurs, "Wildfires cannot burn out the weeds, the spring breeze blows them back to life," this is truly the case. In the end, the body must ulcerate and rot miserably, and life ends here.

Such a terrible cancer, in theory, we should understand its cause and prevent it: unfortunately, although countless scientists have exhausted their efforts to study the cause of cancer, although several theories have been established, some think that it is due to changes in age (cancer mostly occurs in old age, and it can be said that there is no cancer in childhood) and changes in endocrine in the body, some say that it is because of excessive stimulation, and some even create other theories, but the exact cause is still not clear. Moreover, cancer does not seem to have the possibility of infecting people, so there is no way to prevent it at all, and it can only be treated after it has occurred.

The treatment of cancer, in the past, everyone believed that the method of surgical removal was not thorough, but fortunately, the French scientists, Mr. and Mrs. Curie, discovered radium, and cancer was considered to have a relatively satisfactory treatment. The latest method now is to use surgery, X-ray irradiation, and radium tablet irradiation together, which can achieve great results.

However, this method is only relatively satisfactory and not fully ideal, because several types of cancer (such as cancer of the cervix, breast, vulva, nasal cavity, etc.) can indeed be cured in the early stage, but in the late stage, there is no guarantee, at most it can only prolong life for several months. Moreover, there are several types of cancer (such as cancer of the esophagus, lung, stomach, intestine, etc.) that cannot be cured with this method even in the early stage. So, in the end, no matter how pitiful common sense of pain is, how strange light therapy is, cancer is still terrible after all.

Controlling Desire Zhang Xin

Humans are naturally endowed with a pair of eyes to see things, a pair of ears to hear things, and a brain to think about things. The changes in the world and the vicissitudes of human affairs can be seen if not heard. After seeing or hearing, the brain will think about the reasons behind them. Therefore, the times are a book without words, and life is a rich education. Even illiterate people cannot be said to have not learned or been trained. The myriad forms of the universe are projected on their eyes, strike their eardrums, and stimulate their nerves every day. They cannot help but feel, cannot remain indifferent, unless they are blind, deaf, and idiots.

Therefore, everyone understands some principles of being a person, such as the origin of success, the root of failure, how to be promising, and how to fall into depravity. You can't help but know what you see and hear. Then, shouldn't everyone cleverly abandon evil and pursue good? Why do some people still do evil? Is it said that they are forced by life and have no choice? Yes, this is the reason for thieves and the like. There are also many other people who have no worries about clothes, food, or shelter. Why do they also do things that harm others and benefit themselves? The only reason is that "desire" is at work. They are all confused by their insatiable desires and cannot control them.

Therefore, it is difficult to fill the sea of desire, and wanting more after getting something is originally a bad habit of human beings. We must control it, and then we can sacrifice ourselves for others and benefit society. If we let it go, it will harm others and benefit ourselves, and create disaster for society, like a horse without reins, once it starts, it cannot be stopped.

Careful thinking, careful action, and a simple life are the methods to control desire. Fire tests gold, and desire tests you. If you can control desire and not let it control you, you will see your greatness.

Sense of Responsibility Shi Yang

Most people probably have this feeling, that is, before something is done, they often feel worried, and after the thing is completed, they feel happy. Why do they worry before things are done? Because the things placed in front of them need to be done, which means that they have taken on the responsibility of this matter. Because they cannot escape this responsibility and cannot get help from others, they begin to feel uneasy in their hearts. They fear that the obstacles in the process will hinder their progress and cause their failure. But once things are successful, the joy at that time is indescribable, because the responsibility has been removed, and the big stone in their hearts has been put down. Moreover, in a struggle, they have gained a lot of experience, and when they encounter the same situation in the future, they have methods to deal with it, and there is no need to worry unnecessarily.

The more things you do, the easier it is to deal with, and you are also willing to take responsibility. This proves that your experience is sufficient, so you are not afraid of trouble. People who are inexperienced and have little experience in the world are often afraid of trouble and are unwilling to take responsibility. Therefore, when things come, they always try to escape and shirk responsibility.

Escape and shirk responsibility may solve the current difficulties, but the difficulties caused in the future will be greater. Their contact with the outside world cannot be universal, they cannot get rich experience, and the efficiency of daily work will be greatly affected. Therefore, when encountering difficult things, they can only ask others and ask others to make decisions with them. Isn't this painful?

Therefore, the arrival of responsibility should not be feared or avoided, but only met head-on. It will therefore temper your perseverance and increase your wisdom. And temporary difficulties strengthen your ability and effectiveness in handling things in the future.

Root Xinbo

"Really?" Just this sentence, without continuing, seems like he is thinking about something.

The road gradually slopes down, down to a place only two or three feet above the ground, where a large flat rock is paved. This is the boundary between Little Dai Mountain and Ling Mountain, and also the throat of Ling Mountain Bay leading east to the outside. It is called Dragon Tiger Gate, and it really looks like a gate guarded by Ling Mountain as the dragon and Little Ling Mountain as the tiger. Some children jumped on the rock and said, "There are golden carts and silver axes underneath. People from Jiangxi have seen them!" After saying that, they also put their ears to the stone to listen, and then stood up and said, "There is indeed the sound of car axles underneath."

A Wu and Da Gen walked past the grindstone and onto the foot of Ling Mountain. This is much steeper than Little Ling Mountain, and is full of yellow stones, with no yellow soil for planting. However, the yellow stones on the road are paved into step-by-step levels, which makes it easier to walk.

After walking up for a while, they arrived at a temple in the middle of the mountain. This is the Sanmao Temple. The stone slabs paved in front of the mountain gate are flat. People who come up the mountain almost always take a breath here before entering inside, or going further up. They stopped here and looked at the scenery to the east. Because Little Ling Mountain blocked the south, Ling Mountain itself blocked the north, and Ling Mountain Bay was in the west, only the east and west were open, and you could see infinitely far.

"Have you been to our family's Wubao Mound?" A Wu asked, pointing to a cluster of villages near the foot of Port Mountain.

"I've been there."

"Oh, the place with the most houses is Qiantang Bridge," A Wu said, raising his head a little, "Have you been there too?"

"I've been there. I've been to within ten miles around. But I don't go any further, because other people also have to do business. I only do business within ten miles." (3400)

Begonia Shi Xin

Reviewing spoken drama and reviewing Peking opera are of course different. Centering on acting is the attitude of reviewing Peking opera, and centering on content is the attitude of reviewing spoken drama.

Begonia was performed at the Carlton for more than one hundred shows, and it was full every day. However, there are very few texts reviewing it, it seems that only the "Impressions of Begonia" by Qin Minjun in this newspaper is less than a thousand words, and fortunately this text is very appropriate.

However, with Japanese friends present, Lu Bao once compared it to the "Little Tsukiji" in Japan and praised it. To be fair, it was a bit "feverish." Mr. Hisaichi is originally an expert on spoken drama. I advise Mr. Hisaichi to go to the Great World Amusement Park to see civilized dramas. There are too many Chinese dramas that are better than Begonia.
