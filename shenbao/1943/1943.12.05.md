### Opinions on Water, Electricity, and Gas Restrictions

— Qiao Mu

To cope with extraordinary circumstances and conserve fuel, various public utility companies in this city have implemented restrictions on water, electricity, and gas consumption starting December 1st. The percentage of reduction varies depending on the usage, ranging from 10-20% to 40-50%. As user consumption decreases, the companies' operating revenue will also decrease accordingly. If not compelled by the situation, the companies would certainly not resort to this. Therefore, we hope that all users can recognize the situation and fully cooperate with the unavoidable measures taken by the public utility companies. However, we cannot help but offer a few suggestions regarding the implementation of these measures, hoping that the authorities will consider and adopt them.

Among the public utility companies that have established quotas this time, only the French-owned Ningpo Electric Light Company and the Shanghai Gas Company have officially announced the detailed restriction methods in the newspapers, so that users know what to abide by. However, the Shanghai Power Company, which has the largest number of users, has not yet made a formal announcement. Users lack a standard to self-impose restrictions, as to whether the established methods are completely consistent with the rumors circulating. However, the rumored fines for exceeding the limit are quite substantial. If overconsumption and penalties occur, it will be difficult to prevent users from using this as an excuse to dispute with the company. Therefore, the Shanghai Power Company has an urgent need to officially announce the detailed restriction methods as soon as possible to avoid future disputes.

Based on past experience, although the price increases of various companies are stipulated to take effect from a certain month, the consumption after the meter reading of the previous month has not been calculated separately. Because the amount of the price increase was relatively small, users did not pay much attention to it. This time, the stipulated fine for exceeding the limit is quite substantial. If someone had their meter read on the 20th of last month, then the remaining days of this month would only be two-thirds of a month, and no matter how strictly the limit is enforced, it would be difficult to exactly meet the quota. Since the new method is stipulated to be implemented on December 1st, it should not be retroactive to avoid users being penalized innocently. Therefore, we advocate that the consumption after the meter reading in November should be calculated separately from the consumption in December, and separate bills should be issued to ensure fairness and avoid the possibility of most users being penalized for exceeding the limit.

The new restriction method stipulates that electricity users, regardless of their past electricity consumption, will be uniformly reduced to 70% (Shanghai Power Company) or 65% (French Electric Light Company) of the highest monthly consumption in October, November, and December. We believe that such a general regulation is not very reasonable. Because those who waste electricity on weekdays can still be unaffected even if 30% (or 35%) is deducted now. However, those who have already been extremely frugal and only consume to the bare minimum have nothing left to cut. As a compromise, the two companies should set a minimum electricity limit based on the amperage of the users' meters to provide relief.

There are some unclear or unexplained points in the company's announcements. For example, item A of the Gas Company's announcement of the new restriction quota stipulates that the new restriction quota is based on the average consumption in January, February, and March, and is reduced proportionally according to different uses. However, item B stipulates that the minimum restriction quota is 130 units. Suppose a certain cooking user's average consumption in January, February, and March is 100 units, will it be reduced to 80 units according to the proportional reduction stipulated in item A? Or will it be increased to 130 units according to item B? Or can it be exempted from reduction because it does not meet the minimum restriction? The meaning is unclear. Users may be penalized for exceeding the limit due to misunderstanding, and the company may inevitably increase disputes as a result. Clear explanation and public announcement seem to be imperative.

The amount of water used is closely related to cleanliness and hygiene. From a public health standpoint, restricting water use is absolutely unacceptable except in cases of water shortage. Moreover, the fuel consumption of water plants is far less than that of power plants. Furthermore, why are citizens in one district not restricted, while citizens in the other eight districts are restricted in the same city? Not only should the French Tramway and Electric Light Company pay attention to this point, but we also hope that the municipal authorities will pay attention to it as well.

We agree with the selection of suggestions in the short commentary in this month's issue 3B of the China News regarding the electricity consumption of production industries, which should not be restricted in the context of wartime production increases. Furthermore, smoothing the sources of coal supply is a fundamental issue, and all authorities should strive to plan for it.

Finally, one more point: Public utilities are monopolistic by nature, so in various countries, it is customary that any amendments to the business charter that are related to the interests of citizens must be approved by the city council and formally approved by the municipal authorities. This time, the public utility companies in this city have revised the restriction methods, and it seems that the approval procedure for the main municipal authorities has been overlooked, which we also find regrettable.

### Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday the Occupation of Changde County City; Head of the Combat Reporting Team Made a Statement

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Changde on the 4th, the Chongqing troops in Changde surrendered by waving a white flag on the morning of the 3rd after defending the area for a week under fierce attack by the Japanese army. By this point, Changde County City had been completely occupied by the Japanese army.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th that the Imperial Japanese Army began its offensive operation against the Chongqing 6th War Area on November 2nd, giving the Chongqing troops in that war zone a thorough beating, and completely occupied Changde County City at 11:00 AM on the 3rd. The main comprehensive combat results since the start of the operation up to December 1st (excluding the combat results of the Changde County City capture operation) are as follows: Chongqing army losses: The Chongqing army corpses recovered by our side numbered 18,497; 3,361 prisoners; 14 Chongqing aircraft shot down; 74 artillery pieces captured; 3,275 guns captured. Our losses: 556 killed in action.

Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain frontline area of the Japanese army in Central China, the head of the Japanese Central China Front Operations Army Reporting Team made a statement, explaining the significance of the Japanese army's capture of Changde. The general idea is that the Japanese army captured Changde, an important hub in Hunan Province, on the morning of the 3rd. The Chongqing army had previously fortified all the agencies, schools, factories, churches, and residences of Changde County. The Chongqing army's stubborn resistance is rare in the history of the Chinese battlefield. Today, we have wiped it out in one fell swoop and occupied it, which can be said to have crushed the Chongqing side's thinking of resistance. It has a profound impact on the Chongqing side militarily, politically, economically, and psychologically. Since the start of the Japanese army's operation, it has only been a little over three decades, and it has wiped out the second-line corps of the Chongqing army. The Changde operation, although only one battle in this operation, has already crushed the Chongqing army's heavy forces on the Yuanjiang River, which is of great significance. From this, it can be seen the skill of the Japanese army in integrated siege and field tactics. The first half of the war has passed, and it is approaching the second stage. Thanks to the success of this operation and the courage of the Japanese army, the situation of the war is expanding.

The offensive into the interior is witnessing great results. The Chongqing army, after losing the sixth district, mobilized the forces of the ninth war zone in its poverty in order to try to act wantonly. But this kind of action only gives the Japanese army an opportunity to eliminate them. The Japanese army will immediately punish the newly mobilized troops of the Chongqing army, and the time of their annihilation will not be far away.

Hankou, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain frontline area of the Japanese army in Central China: The Japanese army recently ambushed the Chongqing army, which was moving north from the Ninth War Zone to rescue Changde, near Changde, and achieved great combat results. In this battle, the Japanese army unit completely defeated approximately 5,000 men, including the main force of the 190th Division of the Chongqing army, a part of the 10th Division, and one regiment of the 385th Division, northwest of Zengjiaji. According to reports, the Chongqing army left behind approximately 2,000 corpses, and the Japanese army captured countless mortars and heavy machine guns. Zhu Yue, commander of the 190th Division of the Chongqing army, was killed by a bullet, and the division commander's orderly was also captured by the Japanese army. According to the description of the battle situation, when the Chongqing army was surrounded by the Japanese army, the division commander had the intention of retreating early, and later used a part of the army to resist the Japanese army to cover the retreat of the division headquarters, but it was too late, and the Japanese artillery shells had already struck near the division headquarters, and the division commander was killed by a bullet as soon as he moved. According to reports, four division commanders of the Chongqing army have been killed in this operation.

### Soviet Troops Amass Heavy Forces, Focus of War Shifts North; Fierce Fighting Underway in the Dnepr Pocket

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: The situation on the Eastern Front has not changed much in recent days. The adverse weather conditions are sufficient to affect the progress of the war, especially the unrelenting heavy rains in the south. However, the Soviet army continues to advance towards the Dnepr Pocket. There is fierce fighting southwest of Kryvyi Rih, as well as in the Cherkasy area. The situation has changed slightly. The Soviet army in the Gomel area has shifted the center of its offensive to the highway between Smolensk and Orsha, concentrating approximately 30 or more infantry divisions there. Further north, German forces are counterattacking southwest and west of Nevel.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German military experts commenting on the military situation on the Eastern Front stated: Although the Soviet army continues its tactics of constantly shifting the focus of the war, it has not achieved any success in the 40-day campaign in the Dnepr River area. On Thursday, in addition to the fighting southwest of Kryvyi Rih, the Soviet army launched a new offensive to seize the highway west of Smolensk. The importance of some parts of the Kiev area front has now been lost. The protracted nature of the fighting there is largely due to adverse weather conditions and the resulting mud that makes the ground difficult to travel. A strong offensive by the Soviet army in the western part of the Perekop Isthmus has been repelled, and German forces have achieved some victories in the Kherson area. Due to the severe cold weather in the Nikopol and Kryvyi Rih areas, there is only limited activity, but the major war in the Cherkasy area continues. The Soviet army has concentrated as many as 31 divisions in the area west of Smolensk, which shows how intense the fighting is there.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency: A German Foreign Ministry spokesman stated yesterday that reports from the British side that Turkey would soon join the war were "one-sided" speculation. Political circles in Berlin have recently made repeated statements to the Turkish press, saying that there is no intention to induce Turkey to participate in the war.

### Madman Arrested for Plotting to Assassinate Roosevelt

Geneva, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to German news: Agents of the US Federal Bureau of Investigation captured a madman last month who was plotting to assassinate Roosevelt.

### Northern Adriatic Sweep Concluded, German Forces Fortify Positions in Italian Mountain Region

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Zagreb dispatch, it is reported that the Axis forces' publicized sweep operation in the Northern Adriatic has concluded, and the water city has been completely secured.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: The position of the British Eighth Army on the Italian front has not improved. The left wing of the Anglo-American forces has not yet launched an offensive. General Montgomery's troops have made no progress in the mountainous region near the coast. The renewed intensity of the western front, coupled with the American Fifth Army's concentrated heavy artillery fire on the entrenched German positions, proves that General Eisenhower has ordered General Clark to begin the offensive. In the eastern theater, it is confirmed that the German forces' combat experience is not overshadowed by the enemy's numerical superiority. The enemy's deployment of large numbers of bombers and tanks in the mountainous terrain has proven ineffective. The German counter-offensive has inflicted significant losses on the British Eighth Army, and thus, the army has made no progress in the mountains. Recently, the weather has improved, and both sides' air forces have been active, mutually attacking the enemy's supply lines and transportation hubs. The German air raids on Bari have been very successful.

### Weaknesses Exposed in Anti-Axis Camp, Heads of State Conference Apparently Achieves Nothing

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to Havas correspondent Fischer: Reliable sources reveal that the anti-Axis powers' heads of state conference held in Iran appears to have been another setback for Anglo-American plans. It is likely that Churchill and Roosevelt will stay somewhere while in their respective countries to discuss the results of the conference. In any case, the long journey made by the Anglo-American leaders to meet Stalin in the Middle East has resulted in a great loss of face. Berlin officials consider this matter the most fortunate evidence of Anglo-American reliance on the Soviet Union.

Turkish Political Circles' Views

Turkish Capital, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: The ongoing talks between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin have greatly attracted the attention of political figures here. According to the latest information, Stalin stated from the beginning that he could only meet with Roosevelt and Churchill in a location within the Soviet sphere of influence, and therefore refused to go to Cairo and suggested Tehran or Tabriz as the meeting location. These individuals predict that political issues concerning post-war European borders will not be brought up for discussion. The official report issued after the Cairo Conference between Roosevelt, Churchill, and Chiang Kai-shek has also drawn the attention of political figures here. The semi-official organ "Ulus Newspaper" commented that the United States clearly harbors ambitions to dominate the Pacific. The newspaper also noted that Australia's failure to formally participate in the Cairo Conference is quite noteworthy. Chongqing seems also to be dissatisfied with the results of the Roosevelt-Churchill conference, and a spokesman for the Chongqing Embassy in Turkey has strongly stated that the wording of the official report was not drafted in consultation with Chongqing. Chiang Kai-shek's wife served as an interpreter during the Cairo Conference, and her translations were reportedly subject to strict scrutiny by the British side. It is said that Madame Chiang protested to the British authorities.

British Dissatisfaction

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report from London, public dissatisfaction in Britain with the Cairo Conference resolutions is increasing. If the Tehran Conference does not yield satisfactory results, Churchill will not be well-received by the people upon his return to Britain. "Svenska Aftonbladet" stated that Londoners are now beginning to realize that the publication of the Cairo Conference resolutions was a major blunder, as the anti-Axis powers' intentions towards Japan only serve to increase the resistance of both Japan and Germany. In addition, the lack of concrete plans in the Cairo Communiqué has also been met with strong criticism. According to London's view, the anti-Axis group should draft future construction plans for East Asian nations as a countermeasure to Japan's "East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere," and at the very least, guarantee the political independence and economic development of East Asian countries. The British Conservative Party publication "The Observer" is sparing no effort in criticizing the anti-Axis powers' policies, especially in Europe, which only serve to confirm Germany's slogan that "the anti-Axis powers' war aims are to destroy Germany."

### Switzerland to Establish Diplomatic Relations with the Soviet Union, Contents of Soviet-Czech Treaty Revealed

Basel, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report, the Swiss "Basler National-Zeitung" reported yesterday that Switzerland will establish diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union. The source of this news is based on the fact that the Swiss Federal Council's Foreign Affairs Committee recently met to discuss "establishing normal diplomatic relations with various great powers." The newspaper continued, saying that Swiss economic circles have adopted a more lenient attitude toward the Soviet Union, and business relations between the two countries are in preparation.

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report, the Czechoslovak government-in-exile in London revealed on Friday the contents of the soon-to-be-signed Soviet-Czech treaty.

### To the American People

— Yoshisaburo Nomura

In the midst of the victory at Bougainville, the Greater East Asia War has already entered its second year. On the first anniversary last year, we said that Showa 18 (i.e., 1943) was the decisive year for the future, and the great battle between Japan and the United States currently underway in the Solomon Islands is truly the climax of that decisive battle. Our interception is extremely sharp, but the enemy's counterattacks are also becoming increasingly fierce, and our situation is becoming increasingly serious. Former Ambassador to the United States, right-wing member, and Navy Admiral Yoshisaburo Nomura has contributed an article entitled "To the American People" to our newspaper (Dokuritsu Hochi). The article reviews the encounters during the final breakdown of Japan-US negotiations from November 20th to 26th two years ago, and points out Roosevelt's ambition to dominate the world, and its shocking contradiction with the feelings of American people's lives, amidst the current war situation where frequent victories are being reported. The fatal blow in the Solomon Islands is truly the only opportunity for the American people to calmly reflect on that contradiction, and in Japan, it is an excellent opportunity for 100 million people to elevate the "decisive year" to a "year of victory" due to this battle.

Seeing the recent war situation centered on the Solomon Islands, although there have been repeated battles in the north, the adventurous war of the United States, which has not yet launched an attack, the first thing that comes to my mind is the decision of the Quebec Conference in August. In that conference, the United Kingdom and the United States began specific discussions on a joint operational plan to attack Japan. This can also be seen from Churchill's remarks at the time. The sudden activation of the war in the Solomon Islands is one of its manifestations.

The Pacific First doctrine or the Europe First doctrine has always been the focus of American discussion. Some have argued that the United States should take on the Pacific, while the United Kingdom should take on the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The Quebec Conference went a step further, and the United Kingdom and the United States not only agreed on the war goal of attacking Japan, but also decided to closely cooperate on operational goals in the Pacific. From the United Kingdom's appointment of Mountbatten to the transfer of the Mediterranean Fleet to the Indian Ocean and the concentration of the US Navy on Rabaul with a large-scale fleet, these events have an inextricable relationship that cannot be examined individually. The blows inflicted by the Japanese Navy on Pearl Harbor and the Battle of the Coral Sea at the beginning of the war shattered the Anglo-American alliance in the Pacific waters and severed the iron ring of the so-called encirclement of Japan. Now, the new Anglo-American counterattack plan against Japan decided at the Quebec Conference has suffered another setback in the Solomon Islands before it could be implemented. This great Japanese victory in the Solomon Islands is extremely significant in many ways, and its impact will be profound from now on. The American people must take this opportunity to remember once again how strong the strategic posture of the East Asian grindstone once established is, and how unreasonable it is for the United Kingdom and the United States to try to break through this outer line from east to west.

From the beginning, the United States completely lacked the confidence to fight Japan independently. The United States knew that without using the strength of the United Kingdom and without relying on British power, it would have no chance of winning the war against Japan in Asia. This will be described in detail later. As the former ambassador to the United States, I was responsible for opening negotiations for Japan-US relations. At that time, the American leaders knew in more detail than any other country regarding military preparations, the morale of the soldiers, the preparations of the people, and Japan's geographical position in East Asia that Japan was the most terrifying enemy in the world. Only in the point of material production did they see that Japan had a weakness. However, they did not think that they could defeat Japan on their own. Has this not changed at all after the start of the war? In fact, due to the strength of the Japanese Army and Navy, the firm strategic position of securing Asia is being actively completed. The American people cannot but further recognize this situation.

In Europe, after the surrender of the Badoglio regime in Italy, the United Kingdom's naval power in the Mediterranean was more than adequate. However, the domestic situation in the United States does not allow the war to continue for a long time. The longer the war drags on, the stronger Japan's war power will only become. As such, the Quebec Conference decided on a large-scale Anglo-American counter-offensive strategy in the Pacific. Now, the enemy's operations, centered on the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, have suddenly become active. Waiting for the assistance of the United Kingdom coming from the Indian Ocean, from today onwards, the American counter-offensive war against Japan, with the Anglo-American naval power as the foundation, will gradually become tense. We must also be fully aware of this and be more vigilant.

American Strategy of Prolonged Attrition

So, what is the American strategy in the Pacific? What is the United States trying to achieve in the South Pacific? First, it is an overall strategy of attrition against Japan. This is what influential people in Washington said to me at the beginning of the war. Also, newspapers and so-called military experts often wrote articles evaluating Japan's national strength as being too low and predicting their own country's victory. Second, like the "island hopping" tactics being carried out in the Aleutians and now in the South Pacific, they are gradually advancing to approach the heart of Japan.

They believed that once Japan's Co-Prosperity Sphere was completed, Japan would obtain the necessary materials from there, and as a result, its war power would increase day by day. Soon, Japan would become a truly strong country with strong resistance. Therefore, they believed that they had to find a way to obstruct this as soon as possible.

Now, what they are doing is choosing a weak point of Japan to break down one corner of it. This is the island hopping or over-island tactics. When attacking the group of islands, they flew over Kiska Island to attack. The implementation in the Solomon Islands is also one of them, and they are also conducting power reconnaissance on the area near the Kuril Islands. If there is a gap to take advantage of, they will launch at any time, but the center of gravity is actually only in the Solomon Islands. They attacked the Solomon Islands only after the agreement of the MacArther and Halsey fleet commanders. MacArthur often said, "We will return to the Philippines soon." They clearly intend to take the Solomon Islands and Rabaul and then go straight to other islands from there. MacArthur also said, "This is the most necessary location for the war against Japan, and it is more important than a war launched from Hawaii or Alaska."

However, we are not negligent in paying attention to and being vigilant about this "island hopping tactic" that has blinded the entire new war. The first step in the attrition strategy is to disrupt the sea transportation lines, making it difficult for Japan to obtain the necessary supplies from the south and hindering the transportation of necessary troops and weapons to the front lines. They use naval forces, mainly submarines, and supplemented by aircraft in order to attack the transportation routes and supply routes within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. If the air bases on mainland China can be advanced and used without being destroyed by the Japanese air force, they will wait for an opportunity and immediately threaten the traffic in the China Sea from the air. However, when promoting the above two strategies, they know that the power of the United States alone is not enough, so they have repeatedly complained about the lack of thorough cooperation from the United Kingdom.

### Municipal Government Establishes Police Office to Manage Citywide Police Affairs, Mayor Chen Concurrently Serves as Director

Central News Agency reports that the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has established the "Shanghai Special Municipal Police Office" to coordinate citywide police affairs, managing the First and Second Police Bureaus of the city, as well as the police corps formed by organizing the volunteer police teams from the former Public Concession and the preparatory teams from the former French Concession. Mayor Chen concurrently serves as the Director, Lu Ying is the Chief of the Second Police Bureau, Du Zhengjian is the Deputy Chief of the First Police Bureau, and Su Chengde is appointed as the Chief of Staff. The office has a secretariat and an audit office, with Sun Lifu serving as the Chief Secretary and Dai De serving as the Chief Auditor. Subsequently, the citywide police will be under the guidance of this office, which is temporarily located in the office of Chief Sun of the General Affairs Department of the First District Public Office.

### First District Public Office Establishes Rent Arbitration Committee to Handle Rent Disputes

Central News Agency reports that according to an announcement by the First District Public Office, the office has established the "Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee" to take over the duties of the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Rent Mediation Committee. Before the return of the Shanghai Concession to the Chinese government and the implementation of the abolition of the former Municipal Council, the council established the Rent Mediation Committee under the Legal Department in order to adjust the relationship between landlords and tenants, mediating disputes over rental housing, protecting tenants from illegal rent increases, and assisting landlords in seeking peaceful resolution of disputes. The committee handled a significant number of rental housing disputes, achieving remarkable results.

Inviting Committee Members for Close Cooperation

After the return of the Concession's administrative rights to the Chinese government, the Rent Mediation Committee was transferred to the Social Welfare Department due to the abolition of the Legal Department. The Social Welfare Department originally had an organization called the Subletting Housing Management Section to mediate disputes between sub-landlords and sub-tenants, so it was deemed inappropriate to assign disputes between landlords and tenants to the department. Therefore, the Rent Mediation Committee was reorganized into the "Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee," and prominent social figures were invited to serve as committee members, working closely with the Social Welfare Department to handle rental disputes within the jurisdiction of the district.

Seeking Peaceful Resolution of Disputes

If there are disputes between landlords and tenants, they should seek peaceful resolutions and should not resort to violence or legal action. If direct negotiations between the two parties are ineffective, they can submit the case to the office's Rent Mediation and Arbitration Committee for review. Inquiries regarding the procedures for submitting cases and other information can be made at Office 375, Social Welfare Department, No. 180 Fuzhou Road. The committee members are as follows: Chairman Huang Xuanping, Committee Members Ge Leqin, Zhang Deyin, Jian Benyi, Yu Xianwen, Fukuda Fujixiong, and Yao Hui.

### Eight and a Half "He" of Rice Per Person for Seventh Term in Western Shanghai

It is learned that the allocation of rice for the 27th term to residents in the Western Shanghai district, totaling 2,150 bags of rice, has been prepared for sale by the joint sales office of the district public office. The rice will be sold simultaneously at 55 public rice shops throughout the district starting today (5th). It is also learned that due to the small bag size and insufficient "jin" weight of the rice, as well as the limited amount of rice left over from the previous term, the allotted amount cannot be fully met. Therefore, each person can purchase eight and a half "he" of rice per certificate (27th term), priced at 6.8 yuan. Sales will run from today until the 11th.

### Eighth District Land Tax Due by Deadline

### Jiaozhou Park Packed with People, Tung Wah-Kun Luen Match, Sun "Iron Leg" Scores Decisive Goal

The first major battle for the Group A championship between Tung Luen took place yesterday at Jiaozhou Park. Just after noon, fans began to arrive in droves. Before 2:00 PM, an order was given to tightly close the iron gates, causing a surge of people outside the venue. Both teams' players were also blocked outside the gates. Although the gates were briefly opened, there was no room to stand inside the venue, and the crowd outside broke through the barriers and rushed in, causing the venue's fences to be almost completely demolished! Order inside the venue could not be maintained. Under the protection of the military police, the players outside the gates were able to enter the park, and the match began with difficulty, delayed by half an hour from the scheduled time. It is estimated that there were no fewer than ten thousand spectators at Jiaozhou Park yesterday. As a result, the first half saw tight defenses from both sides, with no goals scored. In the second half, Tung Wah's Sun Jinshun scored a goal, giving Tung Wah the precious goal and the victory. The lineups for both teams:

Tung Wah

Zhang Banglun, Li Weizhuang, You Ren, Liang Shuye, Kuang Diaozhen, Zhang Lingen, Li Yao, Sun Jinshun, Dai Jing, Han Longhai, You Liang, Wang Xisheng

Kun Luen

Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Zheng Yongfu, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Yu Zhenyue, Li Yichen, Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua

Overview of the Great Battle

Yesterday's match saw both sides extremely tense due to the high stakes involved. Neither team was at their best, especially Zhang Banglun. Others such as Kuang Diaojing, Song Lingsheng, and Xu Wenkui also underperformed. Li Yichen had been out of practice for a long time and did not have any special performances. Li Yao was unable to find an outlet under Wu Qixiang's surveillance. Li Ning, Kuang Fu, Zheng Ying, Zheng Yongfu, and Huang Chunhua all had outstanding performances.

Shu Tang Injured

The great battle began under the guard of military police. Kun Luen initially had the advantage of playing with the wind. Tung Wah launched an attack towards the north, but the attack was intercepted. After several passes, Longhai swept a diagonal shot, which Liu Xianhan dived to save. Yichen returned the favor, and the same thing happened. At this point, Tung Wah's attack was at its peak. Kun Luen's Song Lingsheng adopted a three-man defense, holding on tightly. After 35 minutes, Liang Shuye was seriously injured and left the field while intercepting Gao Baozheng's advance. The match was also temporarily suspended for one minute. Tung Wah replaced him with Zheng Xisheng, assigned to the right wing, and You Liang was brought inside. Longhai replaced the vacated position. The first half ended with a double goose egg (0-0).

"Iron Leg" Blooms

After the intermission, the great battle continued with excitement. At this time, Kun Luen also switched from defense to offense. The strengths of both sides were evenly matched, and they rotated the attacks. A Yichen missed three consecutive close-range opportunities. This one mistake led to a major error. Tung Wah finally scored in the 28th minute when Sun Jinshun received a cross from Wang Xisheng and shot, scoring a goal for Kun Luen.

Kun Luen Protests

With Tung Wah scoring a goal, the fans cheered wildly. At the end of the match, Tung Wah won 1-0. It is rumored that Kun Luen will submit a written protest to the Football Association, requesting a replay based on the order on the field yesterday.

Economic Commentary

### The Fundamental Issue of Price Policy

There are two views on China's price policy: one is a low-price policy, and the other is to focus on obtaining materials, and some advocate high prices, causing debate. The raising of this kind of real issue is indeed the biggest challenge facing China's economy today. In terms of the meaning of price policy, it ultimately needs to increase agricultural production, and policy is just a plan to achieve the goal.

Generally speaking, farmers are relatively slow to respond, and agriculture is also full of inertia. Under China's social circumstances, especially now after the incident, considerable corrections must be made. Regarding farmers' production and consumption, income and expenditure, we should adopt a comprehensive perspective of the entire farm household economy, making appropriate adjustments to the prices of various agricultural products, and the proportion of various agricultural products should also be studied. These specific matters are extremely important, and the main conditions for procurement areas and procurement agencies should be considered urgently.

During the Greater East Asia War, the current task of the Chinese economy is the supply of agricultural products. After farmers sell their agricultural products, they must exchange them for daily necessities. The main purchasers are industrial products from cities, so the purchase price of agricultural products must be thoroughly compared with the prices of the industrial products they need. On the one hand, we hope that farmers will supply a large amount of materials at low prices, and on the other hand, we should supply farmers with low-priced industrial products. In addition to the rational integration of production equipment, the rectification and perfection of distribution agencies are also extremely important. This, like the Shangtonghui, etc., should be reviewed and considered at any time.

The balance of various prices between agricultural products and agricultural products, between industrial products and firewood products, should be comprehensively planned, and a price system should be established. Following this, the issue of price policy can be resolved. (Excerpt translated from the December 4th Continental New Daily)

### Financial Inspection Office Will Implement Audits on Various Banks and Money Shops

Since the Financial Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank implemented the inspection of financial institutions' business in accordance with the regulations of the temporary measures for the management of financial institutions promulgated by the Ministry of Finance, and the implementing rules, the promotion of inspections has been smooth. The financial institutions (reserve funds) are all prepared. However, the office, in view of the fact that in recent years, general small banks and money shops newly established in the city often engage in illegal operations and issue long-term promissory notes to transfer funds, and even fail to pay when the promissory notes are due, which seems to affect the entire gold industry significantly, therefore, in order to protect the people's assets and stabilize finance, in addition to formulating measures to ban the issuance of long-term promissory notes by money shops, which have been implemented since the 1st of this month, it has been decided to implement audits on the deposit and loan business of various financial institutions in the future.

### Various Guilds Notify Members to Declare Income Tax

The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance issued a notice stating that the income tax on profitable enterprises in the 30th year has been levied for more than a year, and most of the merchants have complied with the payment. However, there are still some who have delayed in filing, which is extremely negligent. In addition to sending officials from the bureau to urge payment, it also separately sent letters to various industry guilds to inform their members to truthfully report the amount of income tax on profitable enterprises in the 30th year as soon as possible. If those who have not paid in the 29th year should also report it together. After receiving the order, each guild has notified its members to report on the specified date.

### Hama North Boiled Water Shops to Distribute Coal in Four Grades

According to further investigations by a Shanghai News reporter yesterday, the flat coal for boiled water shops north of the Suzhou River is divided into four grades: A, B, C, and D.

### Introducing the Integrity Movement

— Chen Tianzhuo

Our country is now moving towards the road to revival. All administrative facilities must be improved, eliminate shortcomings, and ensure that people live and work in peace and contentment. Then can they enthusiastically support the government. In particular, the behavior of public officials in the revival administration must be closely monitored to prevent illegal corruption. Here are some suggestions for the authorities to adopt:

Establish a Supervisory Department: Establish a Supervisory Department in each region, which is above all agencies and directly under the jurisdiction of the National Defense Council or the Control Yuan. It specializes in monitoring the illegal behavior of public officials and establishes a people's collection box to adopt people's reports, suggestions, and accusations.

Integrity Drill: When the Supervisory Department receives a report from the people, it sends personnel to investigate or conducts drills at any time. This kind of drill is specifically for testing public officials, whether they are honest or corrupt, just like a terror drill or an air defense drill. It is carried out by the Supervisory Department, sending personnel in plain clothes. In this way, all corrupt officials, not knowing whether the comers are real or fake, even if they have a corrupt heart, will not have the opportunity to accept bribes. The actual political implementation will be effective.

The Scope of the Supervisory Department's Authority: The exercise of authority of the Supervisory Department is limited to monitoring the corruption of public officials and accepting cases of people accusing public officials. If it finds that a public official has acted illegally, it can revoke their position. As for violations of the law by the people, it is not handled, so that the authority is specialized.

Exemption Method: If a public official discovers that a person has violated the law or privately carries controlled goods and accepts bribes, the person can report this incident to the Supervisory Department. If it is true, the embezzled money will be returned to the original owner, and they will be exempted from punishment, or the sentence will be reduced. This seems to be a little harmful to public officials, but we must know that since we are public officials, we should handle official matters impartially. The purpose of suggesting this is to enable officials and workers to impeach each other.

Encourage Reporting: The Chinese people have always adhered to the principle of "not caring about the frost on other people's roofs," so even if there are illegal and unfair things, they do not interfere. Therefore, if public officials have illegal behavior, the people can report it to the Supervisory Department at any time. If it is true, a considerable bonus will be given to encourage them.

Authorize the Self-Governing Regiment: Once illegal behavior is discovered, disputes will naturally arise between the accuser and the accused, and even uncivilized actions and resistance will be inevitable. At the same time, we must consider that "apes cherish apes," which will make those who are right lose out in court. Therefore, we must authorize the Self-Governing Regiment to handle this matter.

Improve Treatment: There is no such thing as "a horse running fast without eating grass" in the world. Therefore, in the end, we need to talk about the treatment of public officials. To handle matters properly, it is necessary to ensure that the people doing the work can live a decent life, otherwise, even if they are kind, they will have to take risks due to the pressure of life.

British Strategy to Recapture the Southern Sphere

Therefore, England has been engaged in a war of regaining lost territory, trying to cooperate with the United States, but encountered the tragedy of "Arakan" and suffered a disastrous defeat. As a result of the Quebec Conference, Mountbatten was appointed as the supreme commander in that area and began a new Anglo-American joint operation. The area he is in charge of, as far as I know, is the operation from the Sumatra area to the Strait Settlements area and the Burmese area. We must pay special attention at this time. He is a naval vice admiral. From this one thing, it is not difficult for us to imagine what the enemy is trying to do, which is to recapture the Southern Sphere from the Indian Ocean.

In addition to the British advance from Basra and after the surrender, the task of the Mediterranean Fleet was not reduced by currency, and most of the Italian ships had already been captured. The former commander of the Mediterranean Fleet, now the chief of the British Naval Staff, Cunningham, will specialize in concentrating all his efforts in the Burmese and Indian Ocean areas to actively assist the various operations of the United States. Indeed, this situation is now unfolding before our eyes, and there are reports of it about to unfold.

The Japanese authorities understand this situation very well, and first use the tactic of individually destroying the enemy with aircraft. I think this tactic is correct. The individual destruction of the enemy, one of its current manifestations, is the acquisition of the great war east of Zhenzhushawan in Bougainville. I cannot help but be sincerely happy about this. The British and American fleets are pouring all their efforts into East Asia. The military situation in Japan is serious, because most of its main battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships have been sunk. The significance is very significant, and it can be said to be a great success. However, this does not mean that they have encountered a fundamental setback in their overall operations. They always attack, and if this route in the Solomon Islands does not work, they will take another route. It's just that their tactics have changed slightly, but they are always stubbornly and persistently coming to fight with Japan. From this, we can see the gradual shift towards the omnipotence of aircraft and the omnipotence of submarines.

### The Truth About the Japanese-American Negotiations

In early Showa 16 (1941), I took on the mission of opening up Japanese-American relations and went to Washington to take office as ambassador. Everyone knows that this negotiation was extremely difficult and would eventually fail. On March 8, I had my first meeting with Secretary of State Hull. From that day until the end, for ten months, just about this time last year, I already knew that the confrontation between Japan and the United States was due to the issue of assisting Chongqing, and I encountered a dilemma.

A Dying Patient and a Doctor

Around September 6, a few days before the Yaxie incident, I accompanied a secretary to meet with Secretary of State Hull and handed him the Japanese amendment to conduct consultations. After returning to the embassy, the secretary who had been there directly drafted a report on the situation of the meeting that day to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs in Tokyo. As expected, he used very tough language. In fact, just by looking at the content before and after that conversation, there was not a single sentence that could be considered that the US had any sincerity in this elimination. The path to establishing this negotiation was either compromise or surrender. There was no other way. However, I said this and the matter was over. I took up the task on my shoulder and reported with a pen in hand. Speaking of my mood at that time, it was like a doctor looking at a dying patient. There were no appropriate words to describe it other than this. For a doctor, isn't he constantly trying to prescribe medicine for a seemingly hopeless patient until the very end?

### Supporting Old-Age Assistance: Zhi Zhi Lay Buddhist Generously Donates Four Thousand Yuan

— Jing Wan

Honoring the elderly and raising people's "filial piety," for filial piety is the law of heaven, the righteousness of the earth, and the conduct of the people. People cannot do without filial piety. To practice filial piety, one must first honor the elderly. Filial piety is the foundation of establishing oneself and is the first of all virtues. Students enter and are filial, and leave and are fraternal. Is filial piety and fraternity the root of being human? Nowadays, we are highly promoting the eight virtues and emphasizing filial piety. To emphasize filial piety, we must first honor the elderly. This is the painstaking effort of advocating "old-age assistance."

Honoring the elderly is to respect the masses, not just to do good deeds and provide relief, but also to be a principle of conduct. The meaning of honoring the elderly is great. May our elderly not fail Heaven's mandate.

Respecting the elderly, Western sages, cultivating oneself and bringing peace to others, transmitting good fortune to assist the weak, and often prospering to relieve the poor, this is called mutual assistance. Heaven will surely help those who help themselves. The elderly especially value self-help. This old-age assistance has another meaning.

Honor my elderly and extend it to the elderly of others. All human beings must promote filial piety, then young and old will have order, and women and children will be suitable. From politicians, businessmen, and scholars to hawkers and footmen, all must promote filial piety and all should honor the elderly. This is why the Haiying Association is named. They all share the ambition of promoting filial piety and are unified and firm.

Yesterday, I received a generous donation of four thousand yuan from Zhi Zhi Lay Buddhist for the relief of poor orphans, promoting the heart of honoring the elderly and promoting the spirit of mutual assistance. I am very grateful. I also hope that all philanthropists from all walks of life will enthusiastically respond, generously donate, and not let any elderly person live alone, to benefit humanity. The merits are immeasurable.

### Appreciating Paintings at Cun Tian Ge and Giving Them to Mr. Hai Su

— Bin Qu

I don't know why, but I love to watch paintings. Whenever I encounter famous collections, I must go. Mr. Hai Ye is a friend of mine, and I recently got to see famous paintings from his Cun Tian Ge. I returned with great interest. I wrote a poem to give to him.

The heavenly wind blows Cun Tian Ge, Canghai came to Huabiao, treasures were transported back 20,000 miles, and the racks were full of rare and wonderful works. The smoke and clouds were dotted with wind and rain, and the flowing waterfalls fell upside down into the bright river. The mustaches and eyebrows in the book moved as if they were alive, and the hairpins and flowers and birds seemed to kneel and fly. The master of art returned to the country for the first time, and for a time the paper was returned to the capital. We have seen the strength of your pen, and it is powerful and fights with dragons. Sometimes pale flowers are dotted with a few strokes, and the strangeness is like a swallow skimming. Shi Tian's stone plate has turned into dust, and we see his talent again in writing hills and valleys. The distant axis sweeps across the Swiss mountains, and the layers of mist want to go up to the Fuchun Guo. The embellishment of the oil paintings increases the beauty, and the layers are even more detached. I have seen many famous scholars, and their talents are often weak. You alone crown the heroes, and hold ten thousand virtues. Wash away the powdery habits of Jiangnan, and the grandeur is created calmly. Talking with you about books, it is impossible to make progress, and the talent in your heart is naturally developed. You are tall and high-spirited, startling the audience, and when you talk about profound learning, the sky is vast. The heavenly wind blows my clothes, and the sea waves brush your hair. The lightning flashes, and the high mountains and the sea embrace their minds. The huge waves vent their great plans. The culture of the Central Plains is waiting to be revived, and we look forward to working hard in our lives, and the thousands of years will shine together.
