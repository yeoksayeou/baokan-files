### National Health and Hygiene Administration

The first National Health Administration Conference will be held in the capital today. The purpose of the Health Administration Conference is undoubtedly to strengthen the effectiveness of health administration, expand public health, and thereby promote national health. In our editorial on the 9th, we suggested that those guiding youth movements should first emphasize physical fitness training for young people. This is because the achievement of personal academic and professional pursuits depends on energy, and energy depends on a strong physique. If one's physique is weak and energy depleted, even with a wealth of knowledge, one will inevitably find it difficult to exert oneself fully and be of use to society, which is regrettable! This applies to individuals, and even more so to society and the nation. Therefore, the relationship between national health and national endeavors is extremely close and significant!

The promotion of national health lies in actively exercising and building physical strength to resist diseases, and passively adhering to hygiene to prevent diseases. Exercise and hygiene are equally important and should be carried out simultaneously without neglecting either. Exercise includes physical activities like sports. Hygiene, on the other hand, has a broader scope, involving clothing, food, housing, transportation, and all aspects of life. In short, hygiene is rationalized living. For example, clothing should be adjusted to suit the weather, eating and drinking should be moderate, living spaces should have good ventilation, and walking should be steady and safe. The principles are simple, but they are essential to health.

Personal hygiene is important, but public health is even more important. Public health is closely related to the public and is a social undertaking. Because it is a social undertaking, it is inseparable from the social environment and social organization. For example, epidemic prevention is a matter of public health. In a society where health knowledge is widespread, the public will automatically request or accept vaccinations, or comply with guidelines to eradicate disease-causing organisms upon a public announcement. However, in a society where health knowledge has not been widely disseminated, even with repeated persuasion, people will disregard it, and it cannot be implemented without forceful intervention. This can be seen in the municipal health authorities' annual summer vaccination measures. This means that in Chinese society, public health knowledge has not been widely disseminated, which hinders the implementation of public health measures. Therefore, we hope that health authorities will recognize and grasp this point, and constantly promote public health knowledge, especially in public places. At the same time, strengthen public health education and guidance in schools, in order to fundamentally popularize national health knowledge.

Health administration is the engine for promoting public health. Whether or not the measures are appropriate is critical to the future of public health. The most important principle of administration is to understand the social environment, assess needs, consider economic conditions, and one's own capabilities to determine an administrative plan that suits the current situation. Of course, a health administration plan should not simply cater to social realities without regard for theory. However, blindly emphasizing theory and copying administrative plans that are suited to different social environments is also completely unfeasible. For example, in the current wartime state, prices are high, and most people can barely afford coarse grains and vegetables. Yet, based on nutritional principles, promoting milk and bread would be an example of not fitting the social environment. Furthermore, we know that the implementation of any administrative plan requires talent and funding, and health administration is no exception. In this regard, we hope that the health authorities will be more mindful of reality and not seek quick success. It is better to decide on a practical and easily implementable ordinary plan and make it happen, make it effective, and gradually expand it. A plan based on profound theories and lofty goals, in the face of the current lack of talent and funding, is better not proposed if it cannot be realized.

The Health Administration Conference is just as important as other political and economic conferences. Our suggestions above, although not detailed proposals, are intended to emphasize this principle to the health authorities. The future of public health and the future of national health are at stake!

Correction

In yesterday's Weekly Review, paragraph two, line nine, the phrase "December 18th" and all subsequent phrases within the parenthesis should be translated as (i.e., the 18th of Brumaire, the day Napoleon launched his coup d'état – Yoshida's note). This correction is made.

### Japanese Military Achieves Glorious Victory in Four Naval and Air Battles off Bougainville Island; Three Enemy Ships Sunk, Two Heavily Damaged

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 14th. On the dawn of the 13th, Japanese naval air units fiercely attacked enemy mobile units in the sea south of Bougainville Island, achieving the following results: Sinking one enemy large cruiser, one cruiser, damaging one destroyer, severely damaging one enemy battleship, and one medium-sized aircraft carrier. Two Japanese aircraft failed to return. Note: This air battle is known as the Fourth Naval Air Battle off Bougainville Island.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 14th the glorious results of the Fourth Naval Air Battle off Bougainville Island. According to military experts here, the enemy fleet has repeatedly suffered defeats and heavy losses, and appears to be on the verge of collapse and retreat. At dawn on the 13th, a powerful enemy fleet with battleships, aircraft carriers, and destroyers was indirectly escorting a transport convoy and advancing north in the waters southwest of Bougainville Island. Upon discovering this powerful enemy fleet, the Japanese naval attack aircraft immediately launched an attack at around 3:00 AM, with torpedo bombers as the main force. They quickly flew over the enemy fleet, braving intense anti-aircraft fire to launch torpedoes, sinking one large cruiser, one cruiser, and one destroyer, achieving tremendous results. They then pursued the remaining enemy ships attempting to escape, and severely damaged one enemy battleship and one medium-sized aircraft carrier. Smoke was seen coming from the stern deck of the aircraft carrier, so it could not be confirmed that it had been sunk, but it is believed to have sunk. In this battle, the Japanese also lost two aircraft. The enemy attempted to supply the landing forces at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island, land subsequent troops, and destroy the Japanese air force at Rabaul, a strategic stronghold on the front line in the south. The enemy's attempts were thwarted by the Japanese military and met with four fierce counterattacks. Although it is extremely difficult to launch fighter planes at night, the Japanese naval aircraft, who had undergone intensive training, were able to overcome these difficulties and achieve this great victory with their courageous spirit and superb skills.

Japanese Army Aircraft Surprise Attacks in New Guinea and Burma

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:38 PM on the 14th: In New Guinea, Japanese army air units continuously attacked enemy airfields such as Machabu and Tenbi in the Ramu River and Megam River basins for four days from November 6th to 9th, and cooperated with ground units to intercept enemy aircraft, achieving the following results (including the results announced on November 8th): 59 enemy aircraft shot down (17 unconfirmed), and more than 120 enemy aircraft destroyed or set on fire on the ground. The Japanese side suffered 15 aircraft lost or failed to return. In Burma, Japanese army air units bombed enemy airfields in Imphal, India, and other places in eastern India on the 9th and 11th, achieving the following results: more than 33 enemy aircraft destroyed or set on fire on the ground, and three enemy fuel storage sites were hit and caught fire. The Japanese side suffered no losses.

Argentine Central News Agency from Kyoto, 14th - According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy Department announced on the 13th that Japanese air squadrons had bombed anti-Axis bases on the Ellice Islands and Noumea in the Pacific on the night of the 11th, causing damage to anti-Axis personnel and facilities.

### Japanese Torpedo Squadron Achieves Unprecedented Victory in Naval Warfare History

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - Japanese torpedo aircraft squadrons have recently achieved astonishing results in the waters off Bougainville Island since the attack on Pearl Harbor. In two air battles, they sank four enemy battleships, two aircraft carriers, and nineteen ships, and destroyed eleven enemy cruisers and other ships. This is an unprecedented victory in the history of naval warfare, proving the excellence of Japanese torpedo squadron technology. Torpedo aircraft are single-engine aircraft that carry aerial torpedoes under their wings to attack enemy battleships, aircraft carriers, cruisers, and other ships. However, torpedoes must be launched while skimming the surface of the sea and approaching the enemy ship. These attacking torpedo aircraft carry only one torpedo, and must release it at low altitude, as dropping it from high altitude will cause it to explode on the surface of the sea. Furthermore, in addition to ensuring a direct hit when launching a torpedo, excellent skill is required, venturing into life and death to sink an enemy aircraft carrier. Often, it is necessary to first engage with the enemy's escorting aircraft and shoot them down, and then be bombarded by the enemy's destroyers, followed by bombardment from enemy cruisers, before finally being able to attack the enemy aircraft carrier. At that time, it is even more necessary to overcome the ship's defenses, cannon fire, and the aircraft directly protecting the ship. If the target is a battleship, it will inevitably be bombarded by the enemy ship's flat-trajectory guns. Even if it is not hit by shells, it will touch water mines and explode, or be subjected to intense attacks from enemy anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. After passing through these difficulties, it is even more necessary to carefully launch the torpedo to complete the mission of sinking the enemy ship. From the above, it can be seen that sinking a battleship or an aircraft carrier is extremely difficult.

### National Health Administration Conference Opens in the Capital This Morning; Over 100 Proposals Received

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - The First National Health Administration Conference convened by the Ministry of Health has been in preparation and is now ready. It is specifically scheduled to grandly open at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association today (the 15th). Representatives from various regions have arrived in the capital one after another, and more than one hundred proposals have been received. The chairman of the conference is Lu Runzhi, Minister of Health, and the secretary-general is Lin Peng, Secretary-General of the Ministry of Health. It is scheduled that before the meeting today at 8:30 AM, the chairman will lead all attendees and observers to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects, and then hold a meeting at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 10:00 AM.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - In order to strengthen the health administration structure, understand the status of health facilities in various regions, and discuss various improvement plans, the Ministry of Health decided to convene the first National Health Administration Conference, inviting the heads of health departments in various provinces and cities, as well as health personnel from various regions. Since the national government returned to Nanjing, a separate health administration organization has not been established, and only a Department of Health was set up within the Ministry of Interior to handle health affairs. Later, the national government authorities, recognizing that health administration has a profound and significant impact on national health, and that it would be insufficient to establish an organization to promote it effectively, decided in April of this year to establish a separate Ministry of Health to restore the pre-war system. Subsequently, the relevant parties formulated organizational rules and actively prepared, and health administration has since gained further development. In June, the Executive Yuan meeting resolved to approve the special appointment of Lu Runzhi as Minister of Health. Since taking office, Lu has actively worked to promote national health administration affairs. At the same time, the Ministry conducted phased inspection plans to various parts of the country to understand the status of health facilities in various regions, as reference to promote the nation wide health administration. The areas inspected included Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and North China. While in North China, Lu also participated in the North China Medical Association meeting. After several consultations, the North China Medical Association decided to dissolve and change to the Beijing Branch of the Chinese Medical Association. By this point, the national health administration structure was unified. And at this time, when the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty has just been signed and our country is completely independent and autonomous, in order to share the responsibilities of the Great East Asia War and construction, it is especially necessary to have a strong physique. Therefore, the convening of this Health Administration Conference is of great significance. The scope of the conference includes health administration, medical management, public health, health education, disease prevention, health insurance, travel hygiene, and health statistics, but it emphasizes administrative structure and efficiency. Disease prevention and the training of health personnel are emphasized to unify and promote national health administration and ensure national health. Therefore, all parties attach great importance to and expect this conference. It is expected that after the completion of the conference, national health administration will have a landmark advancement, and it will also make a great contribution to national health.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The First Great East Asia Youth Leaders' Conference, gathering leaders of youth groups from China, Japan, and Manchukuo, opened here on the afternoon of the 13th. The conference yielded many achievements and has now successfully concluded.

The full text of the resolution is as follows: The magnificent achievements of the Great East Asia War and the unanimous awakening of the nations of Great East Asia have enabled the construction of the Great East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to progress actively. The Philippines has now gloriously achieved independence, and the opportunity for India's independence has also arrived. However, since the 400 million people of India have not yet been liberated, if this good opportunity for independence is missed, the liberation of all of Asia will be difficult to achieve. Indian youth, quickly take up arms and go to the battlefield to defeat your old enemies, Britain and the United States, and fight for the liberation and revival of all of Asia, and for the liberation of India. Representatives of youth groups from China, Japan, and Manchukuo gathered in Tokyo to hold the Great East Asia Youth Leaders' Conference. At this time when the youth of Great East Asia are becoming more united, on behalf of the general will of the youth of the three countries, we hope that all the youth of India will rise up together. We will move forward to achieve our common goal.

### British Troops Prepare to Accept Lebanon; Provisional Government Established

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to the latest news received here: Indian troops have surrounded Beirut, preparing to disarm the Senegalese indigenous troops of the French army and take over Lebanon. The means taken by the British in the Lebanese incident have become increasingly clear, so it is believed here that the French High Commissioner, Helu Shi, has no hope of resisting the British measures. The Near East Wireless Station, managed by the British, has become increasingly blatant in its accusations against the French authorities in Lebanon. The Turkish side believes that the background to the Lebanese incident is the British intention to drive the French out of the Near East.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Beirut, the Lebanese crisis has turned into an international one, as it is rumored that the public has demanded that Britain and the United States intervene based on the Atlantic Charter. Britain's situation is quite difficult. If it protects Lebanon, it will offend the French Committee. If it maintains neutrality and cooperates with the French, it will arouse the anger of all Arabs.

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to news received here: The Senegalese troops in Lebanon began to have serious clashes with British troops yesterday. It is said that the fighting occurred because British troops attempted to disarm the Senegalese indigenous troops patrolling the duties. The British Minister to Beirut, Spibia, had a third meeting with the High Commissioner of the French Government in Lebanon.

Ankara, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch from Cairo: The vice president of the Lebanese provisional government is French and the state coordinator is Dutch. The temporary government is located in Barjik, fifty kilometers away from Beirut, and all cabinet members who have not been arrested are serving in the temporary government.

Conflicts Continue Between Locals and French Troops

Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Beirut dispatch: The conflict between Lebanese locals and French rebels has gradually intensified, resulting in many deaths. It is also rumored that French rebels have occupied important streets in Tripoli, and the residences of Lebanese citizens have been looted or burned by rioters. It is believed that the Lebanese Minister of Defense, who was previously denounced by puppet officials of the French regime, commanded these rioters. It is also rumored that some Lebanese Christians, who have always hated the brutality of the French rebels, have risen up to clash with them.

Iraqi and Syrian Governments Decide to Provide Support

Istanbul, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to the official gazette published in Baghdad yesterday, the Iraqi government has instructed its acting minister to Syria to immediately meet with Lebanese leaders and other government officials, stating that Iraq will do its utmost to rebuild the Lebanese constitution.

According to a dispatch from Damascus, Syrian Prime Minister Jabri and Interior Minister Haval have made speeches, declaring their support for Lebanon.

### Philippines Prepares to Welcome Xian Yanquan's Surrender

Manila, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines has been established for nearly a month, and the foundation and security of the new country are becoming more solid. Overseas Chinese Xian Yanquan was sent to the Philippines by the Kuomintang before the war to promote resistance against Japan. He served as the propaganda minister of the Philippine branch of the Chongqing Kuomintang. Recently, he realized his past mistakes. He was deeply moved by Japan's new policies towards China and the lofty ideals of the Great East Asia Joint Declaration. He fled from Mount Samilkir in Bulacan Province to Manila on the 8th of last month and surrendered to the Japanese military police in the Philippines, cooperating in the construction of the New Philippines and the revival of East Asia, and was given a path to self-renewal. After regaining his freedom, Zeng expressed to people that he had misunderstood the Great East Asia War in the past. Recently, he had discovered Japanese policies towards China and the ideals of the Great East Asia Joint Declaration in Chinese newspapers in Manila, and realized the path that East Asian nations should take. All Chinese people should work together to realize Sun Yat-sen's ideal of Great Asia.

### Fierce Fighting Continues at Fortress West of Kyiv; 30 Soviet Divisions Concentrated on the Southern Flank

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters dispatch: Fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Kyiv, Chernigov, and Gomel areas. However, a major battle seems to be brewing in Krivoy Rog, as German intelligence has discovered that the Soviets have concentrated thirty divisions of troops there. The Soviets clearly intend to reinforce the central forces west of Kyiv, and also want to push their flanks westward, presumably because the Soviets fear their flanks are threatened. Soviet troops west of Kyiv are currently continuing to exert pressure on the Zhytomyr area, with fierce fighting taking place. There is also fierce fighting northwest of Kyiv. Soviet attacks on the south and southwest of the city have been repulsed, and German counterattacks have recaptured important positions. The Soviet attacks northwest of Krivoy Rog and north of Kremenchuk and Cherkasy the day before were aimed at pushing through their flanks, but the Soviet attacks on the north of Kremenchuk and Cherkasy have been halted. Soviet attacks north west of Chernigov have been renewed, but the battle situation has not changed significantly. Soviet attacks north of Gomel and north of Smolensk have been repulsed, and German counterattacks in the Nevel area are progressing smoothly. There is no change in the battle situation on the Crimean Peninsula. The Soviets are continuing to concentrate troops northeast of Kerch to receive reinforcements and supplies, but have been attacked by German aircraft and naval forces.

### Preventing Hoarding of Goods; Strictly Prohibiting Resale; Businesses Must Issue Transaction Receipts When Closing a Deal

Various municipal authorities in this city have never relaxed their efforts in managing prices. The price limits for standard goods that have been set in the past will continue to be enforced, and no one will be allowed to profit excessively. At the same time, efforts are being made to actively dredge the sources of materials and raw materials from various regions. Yesterday, a Shanghai News reporter learned from various trade associations that the authorities are paying close attention to the daily transactions of merchants. For any type of commodity supplied by a customer to a trading house, the trading house must sell the item to a firm that deals in such goods, and then the firm must display it in the bustling city for legitimate users to purchase. Resale is strictly prohibited. If trading houses trade with each other, or firms buy and sell from each other, there will be many layers of resale, which easily leads to adverse phenomena such as hoarding, speculation, and monopoly. On the one hand, they profit from each other, invisibly increasing the buyer's cost and raising market prices. Therefore, in order to thoroughly eliminate such illegal transactions, all trading houses, firms, and customers must set a price and officially close the deal for all goods sold or purchased. Both the buyer and seller must issue transaction receipts. The receipt should state the names of the firm, company, or factory of both parties, the name and quantity of the goods, the price, the date of the transaction, and the name of the person in charge. Each party should hold one copy, for future inspection. At the same time, when purchasing these goods, the buyer must ship the goods to the designated warehouse or cargo wharf within the stipulated time, without any deliberate delay or excuse. Once the deadline is exceeded, the seller can freely sell the goods to other parties, and the original buyer cannot stop it, but the payment may not be given, in order to distinguish between right and wrong, and avoid disputes.

### The Ideal Children's Band of Misery

— Bai Men

Rationalized Living

The residents of the orphanage live a rationalized life. Regarding their sustenance, Director Yao said, "In general children's welfare institutions, due to economic difficulties, they often cannot meet the standard material life of children. Our institution also has this extreme hardship. To keep children with a below-standard material life healthy, we absolutely use scientific methods for the management of clothing, food, and housing to strive for effectiveness. We also train children to use both their hands and minds, strengthen their bodies, and save expenses." As he spoke, he took the reporter to visit the kitchen. The first impression was its cleanliness and orderliness. Several girls were washing dishes and tidying up the fuel. A boy was busy by the noodle-cutting machine, preparing dinner. One could not tell that he was actually a little technician, not only able to make noodles but also able to repair machinery! Like a miniature Liangshan Marsh, this place has children from all social classes and various talented children with specialized skills!

The complex work of the residents' clothing, food, housing, and various other aspects is all under the leadership of the Child Welfare Service Corps, operated individually or collectively by the children. Even the infant department does not hire nannies, but only trains older girls to serve as little nannies, in order to develop the children's spirit of friendship. Even public affairs such as message delivery are entirely handled by the children. Therefore, the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute can be said to be the only children's welfare institution in Shanghai that does not employ laborers, thoroughly implements self-governance, and achieves ideal results.

In terms of diet, the entire responsibility lies with the Dietary Department of the Child Welfare Service Corps, which is divided into four sections. The cooking section is responsible for allocating kitchen staff and researching and guiding cooking methods. The accounting section manages petty cash accounts. The purchasing section goes to the vegetable market with teachers every day to buy vegetables. The storage section stores all rice, flour, oil, salt, fuel, and dining utensils. Currently, this department is also under the guidance of Ms. Wang Qing, a nursing staff member.

The third and fourth floors are the residents' dormitories. Most of the rooms are girls' bedrooms, while the boys' bedrooms only occupy a small portion. In each bedroom, there are only double-decker iron beds, all with white cloth sheets. Each person has a quilt and other bedding items. Bedroom cleanliness competitions are held regularly, so each person's bedroom door is adorned with a brightly colored ranking tag. Especially the cleanliness trophy hangs high, a source of great joy. Of course, boys seem to have little chance of winning the trophy.

Hygiene work is as valued as academics in the Child Welfare Education Institute. In terms of personal hygiene, the personal hygiene section of the Child Welfare Service Corps checks personal hygiene every day according to the hygiene creeds promulgated by the Ministry of Health. In terms of public hygiene, the public hygiene section is responsible for cleaning each venue twice a day, assigned by children by district. The section sends people to inspect the cleanliness of each venue every day and awards prizes for the competition.

The Service Corps has a medical section and a sickness reporting section. The former manages medicines and implements the ordinary treatments prescribed by doctors, while the latter takes care of patients, manages the sickroom, and performs ordinary nursing duties. All of these are guided by the care department, with staff responsible for guiding the residents in providing voluntary services.

They pay special attention to disease prevention, administering various vaccinations, cultivating hygiene habits, and paying attention to physical examinations. Nurse Li Shuying conducts a general check-up once a month, and a doctor is specially invited to conduct a detailed examination once or twice a year. If a sick resident is found, mild cases stay in the institute's special infirmary, cared for by the resident nurse, while severe cases are sent to epidemic hospitals, Guangci Hospital, Shanghai Children's Hospital, etc., where free medical treatment is available. The benevolent spirit of these hospitals is truly worthy of respect.

The Place Where Destiny is Transformed

Is there really such a thing as destiny?

However, at the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, facts are used to answer: Even if there is such a thing as "destiny," it can be transformed! Look! Those whom they take in and educate are all miserable children from various regions and social classes, without clothing or food, and thin and sick, almost unidentifiable as humans! Here are child brides and maids under the whip of hardship and suffering, here are street children, here are pitiful abducted children and lost children, here are orphans who have lost their parents and have no one to rely on, here are child refugees who have fled to Shanghai due to water and drought disasters, here are unfortunates who have lost everything due to the ravages of war, here are poor children whose families are too impoverished to raise and educate them, here are pitiful children abandoned by dysfunctional families, and here are even young offenders who have committed "crimes" out of necessity… Among them, maids and child refugees affected by the war are the most numerous. These miserable boys and girls, some as young as five or six, others as old as eleven or twelve, are all unfortunate children of school age, and some maids are even older, up to sixteen or seventeen.

Through the relief and education of the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute, they have all become neat, clean, healthy, and lively good children. The painful and hopeless imprints of their old lives of cruelty and inhumanity have quietly disappeared from their little hearts. Many of them have found new outlets upon leaving the institute. Some have found their way back to their hometowns, reuniting with their families. Some have found new homes, being adopted as sons and daughters. Some have embarked on the road to self-reliance, working in factories, shops, hospitals, and on the railway.

When the girls grow up, if young men from outside with clean families, sound character, and legitimate occupations seek to marry them, and the girls agree, a wedding can be held on their behalf according to certain procedures. Look! Isn't the reception room full of commemorative photos of residents holding weddings? Director Yao already has many "adopted sons-in-law"!

Director Yao said that the children taken in and educated by the institute, whether they return to their hometowns, are adopted and find new homes, are helped to find spouses, or are helped to find jobs and serve in society, all first undergo thorough investigation and careful study. Everything is done with a solemn attitude, and strict procedures must be followed in implementation. After leaving the institute, the institute continues to assume the responsibility of protection. Whether the residents return to their hometowns or find new homes, they must still come to the institute from time to time, and the institute often visits to maintain contact. Even the married girls are concerned about like mothers caring for their daughters, and are even welcome to bring their new husbands and children to linger at the institute. The care for the institute's residents serving in society goes without saying.

Further education is also one of the main outlets for the residents of the Shanghai Child Welfare Education Institute. Those who are suitable for academic advancement in terms of aptitude and character are fully assisted in their further education to seek advanced studies. It is said that there have been seven graduating classes from the Child Welfare Elementary School, totaling more than sixty students. Among them, twenty-five have continued their studies with the full assistance of the institute, having completed high school and junior high school programs. They are top students in various famous middle schools in Shanghai, which can be said to be a breath of fresh air for the unfortunate children.

When they enter the institute, they are miserable children without food or clothing, thin and sick, seemingly without human form. But when they leave the institute, they are all healthy, sensible, energetic, and ambitious new youths!

For the future of the Chinese nation, may everyone bless this ideal children's paradise of misery! (The End)

### Proposal to Levy an Education Surtax

— Zheng Yunying

The impoverished lives of educational workers are a well-known fact. If the authorities want to effectively provide relief, they must open up a fixed source of funds, and the author believes that levying an education surtax is one way to do it.

The collection of an education surtax was previously implemented by some county education bureaus in Jiangsu Province. Given the current tight financial situation of the municipal government, it may be worthwhile to implement it to provide relief for educational workers. The author believes that the targets of the levy can be all kinds of consumables, such as tobacco, alcohol, cosmetics, luxury goods, etc., as well as all entertainment venues, where an additional 5% or 10% surtax can be levied on tickets. Those who enjoy these things will certainly not feel that this little surtax is too harsh, while educational workers can use this considerable income to subsidize their lives and stabilize their livelihood.

As for the large donations initiated by social figures to relieve the lives of educational workers, and the 500,000 yuan subsidy provided by the education authorities to supplement educational workers, these are just drops in the bucket and not a fundamental solution.

Levying an education surtax to increase the salaries of educational workers will stabilize the lives of educational workers, and the problem of the authorities raising large sums of money can also be solved. Why not do it, killing two birds with one stone! (Moved by Assistance for Education)

### The Livelihood Problems of Baojia Officials

— Beibei

Now that the administration of Shanghai is gradually becoming unified, the Baojia organization urgently needs to be improved in order to assist in the advancement of government affairs and make up for the shortcomings of the police force. Recently, the Ministry of the Interior issued an order that local Baojia committees are responsible for supervising and guiding mass movements in the future. The deployment of Baojia work is also becoming increasingly important, and while personnel adjustments and ability evaluations for Baojia officials, who are key cadres, are certainly essential, improving their livelihood is also a matter of urgency. As the saying goes, "Only with a stable life can there be stable work." If we want to increase work efficiency, the self-motivation of local officials, and the training of "spiritual life" are certainly the most important. However, ensuring a reasonable level of "material life" so that they can work with peace of mind and fulfill their duties is the second most important thing. Otherwise, their spirit and energy will be diverted from service to the pursuit of food and clothing, and it will be difficult to achieve good results in increasing work efficiency. Furthermore, if those in difficult circumstances are forced to use their positions for personal gain, it will be difficult to avoid. In essence, this is an abnormal phenomenon caused by an unbalanced social system!

The development of any undertaking—and Baojia is certainly a social undertaking—requires good cadres. Cultivating good cadres is not easy under normal circumstances. In this extraordinary period, there must be timely plans and practices in both guidance and work. The increasingly severe livelihood problems that are forming today affect everyone's hearts—especially those of low-level cadres, such as elementary school teachers, junior civil servants, and Baojia officials. They are almost constantly suffering from the hardships of life, which increases the pain of their work and reduces their energy for the undertaking.

It is not an exaggeration to say that a sound Baojia system can directly and indirectly assist in the sound governance of Shanghai. Improving the living standards of Baojia officials so that they can fulfill their duties is a key strategy for a sound Baojia system. As a citizen, I express my infinite sympathy for the serious livelihood problems of Baojia officials who work tirelessly for the public every day. I have written these "petition-like" words, appealing to the enlightened Baojia authorities, hoping to arouse a motion for relief.

### Paper Industry Control Association Adjusts Related Departments, All Paper Mills Step Up Production

Paper and raw materials for paper have a great relationship to culture, so in order to adapt to the wartime system and save unnecessary consumption, it is necessary to control them. The establishment of the Central China Paper Industry Control Association (tentative name) is to concentrate paper and then meticulously allocate it. In order to further establish the control mechanism, the Control Association is adjusting related parts and investigating the current situation of the paper industry in Central China. According to the recent paper consumption in the Central China region, except for the Wuhan area, about 60,000 to 70,000 tons are needed, but the production volume is only 50%. The Japanese paper mill produces 3,700 to 3,800 tons, and the Chinese paper mill produces 2,700 to 2,800 tons, so the production department needs to be encouraged and promoted. According to Japanese newspapers, paper mills in Central China are now actively increasing production. Tianzhang Paper Mill pays great attention to printing paper. Jiangnan Paper Mill has begun to make paper with reed poles, and the results are quite satisfactory. China Paper Mill is increasing capital. Other Shanghai paper mills, Hualun Paper Mill, etc. are stepping up their efforts to make paper in Central China self-sufficient.

### Speculators Find it Difficult to Operate, Many Change to Other Industries

The market conditions of various industries in this city are still quite stable, and the overall financial situation has not changed significantly. However, credit is tighter. Fortunately, the Central Reserve Bank has properly allocated it, and it has gradually become active. According to reporters' inquiries yesterday, a small number of merchants in this city have engaged in speculative transactions in a single-minded way. Although they have made a lot of profit, the authorities have not relaxed their management of prices. Therefore, some merchants have suffered serious threats, and recently they have found it difficult to operate and have changed hands. Or they have changed to other industries, but their daily transactions are still very light, and there is a lack of people asking about all spot goods. As for industry, there is not much progress. However, small-scale production is very active. For the sake of smooth promotion, they have posted announcements to recruit skilled male and female workers. As for the raw materials needed to make goods, they are purchased sporadically, or they are automatically purchased from the production area and applied here. It is said that the authorities pay close attention to these small factories and will find ways to assist them to make high-quality products and increase the bargaining chips for the supply of goods on the market.

Financial Stability Last Week, Daily Necessities Stopped Rising and Turned Flat

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai were still stable last week. Finance was stable, and commodity prices fell to normal on a daily basis. Especially after the Hua Merchants Securities Exchange officially resumed trading, the market saw a prosperous scene. In terms of finance, the posted prices of pure silver and customs gold were still fixed and rarely changed. Because the market's need for funds was relatively strong, credit was slightly tight. The interbank interest rate was listed at 17% last week. The rice industry unified drama will actively buy rice and grain, and is expected to fully distribute it at a lower price. Daily food is also gradually implementing the cooperation system, and the market price has stopped rising and turned flat.

### Business Summary

Fu Hong The goods arrived before and after were gradually increasing, which was not very suitable for sales, resulting in a sharp drop in market prices, not only unable to guarantee capital, but also wasting money. Therefore, the area is rare, and the price is relaxed. However, the weather is getting colder now, and the identity is drier than before.

Dried persimmons After seeing the new products in the production area, the price has risen sharply. The degree of increase has doubled since the beginning of the market. Because there are too many defenders, it has created a situation of frequent mistakes. Although there are a few shipments here, they have not yet arrived. It is expected that they will be listed soon.

Black melon seeds In the past, there were very few goods received, and the market price did not rise. However, they have gradually arrived, and there is no shortage. The price has returned to normal. The price of small and medium grains has dropped by about 10%. It is said that the production price has also dropped slightly.

### Great East Asia Victory Wings: Sergeant Anabuki's Air Combat Diary

This is Sergeant Satoshi Anabuki's magnificent air combat diary. He is a brave warrior from the Youth Aviation Corps. On October 8th, over the Bay of Bengal, he single-handedly challenged thirteen enemy aircraft, including new enemy fighter and bomber aircraft, and shot down five enemy aircraft, three B24s and two P38s. He returned to base despite suffering his fifth injury since the start of the Greater East Asia War. He has flown nearly a hundred sorties over the areas of Patang, Malaya, and Burma. Enemy aircraft seized by these "terrifying" claws number as many as thirty-four. This fighting spirit is a manifestation of the spirit of the Youth Aviation Corps and is the true face of the invincible "Army Air Force." Sergeant Satoshi Anabuki is currently in the 〇〇 Army Hospital, nursing an injury to his left finger. The supreme commander of the army in Burma praised his extraordinary actions, emotionally saying, "Rising up repeatedly after suffering injuries, this spirit of fighting to the end is the spirit of relentless attack. Anabuki is truly a good lad!" Sergeant Anabuki is a bright and outstanding young man. He hopes to shoot down one hundred enemy aircraft and is known as "〇〇 Anabuki," greatly feared by the enemy air force. The following is his diary:

February 9th: After receiving intelligence that nine enemy aircraft had taken off from the Lemaire and Kavka airfields, we immediately scrambled two squadrons. We discovered the enemy aircraft west of the Maliwon Rice Mountains. I only joined the battle over Koraishitol Island. Because I was a little late, I was unable to strike an enemy P40 head-on, only attacking a P40 attempting to flee south from behind and above. With one strike, I set its fuel tank on fire, and it crashed south of Koraishitol Island. During my second attack, I flew parallel to the enemy aircraft and struck again, finally shooting it down. In this battle, our squadron shot down a total of five enemy aircraft and severely damaged four.

〇月〇日: Transferred to Burma to attack Tinsukia.

January 25th:

The 〇〇's large formation soared over the great plains of Burma, bravely flapping its wings, crossed the 3,000-meter Arakan Mountains, and advanced towards the Tinsukia airfield. This was a grand and magnificent sight like clouds and rosy clouds, a grand aerial expedition, the likes of which we had never seen. The airfield was completely destroyed, and a hazy black smoke obscured the sky of Tinsukia, completely suppressing the enemy. I was assigned the task of providing air support, and together with Lieutenant Yamamoto, we guarded the northwest of the airfield. We spotted a Curtis P40, immediately attacking it. The enemy aircraft spun to the right, and I certainly did not miss this opportunity, quickly delivering a second strike. Gasoline spewed directly from near the root of the enemy aircraft, and the fuselage plunged vertically, finally crashing to the ground—shooting down one aircraft. Taking advantage of the situation, I made a super-low-altitude flight of 〇〇 meters over the smoke-filled enemy airfield, carrying out a ground attack on a surviving P40. Passing through intense anti-aircraft fire, I again attacked the P40 and anti-aircraft gun positions with a super-low-altitude flight, completely destroying one P40.

February 〇th (Chittagong Attack): After arriving over Chittagong and bombing the enemy airfield, as we were about to fly back, we were attacked by an enemy Hurricane. Without hesitation, I engaged in combat, immediately scoring a hit. The enemy aircraft spun downward and crashed rapidly in the area between the city and the airfield, burning to ashes.

December 〇th (〇 spotted a large formation of fourteen enemy bombers over 〇〇): "Too late!" I thought to myself. "Turn!" I shouted, my body already jumping into the aircraft, stepping on the throttle, and pulling the control stick. As I was taking off, the aircraft was already hit by enemy shrapnel. I ignored it, only intending to take off with the squadron leader's aircraft, and then the two of us would intercept them. During the ascent, I saw one enemy aircraft hit by our anti-aircraft fire and falling in flames, which made me feel a hundred times braver and desperately pursued. The enemy aircraft were divided into three layers: six Hurricanes below, six P40s above them, and five Blenheims on top. I fired at the left engine of the fourth Blenheim, causing it to burst into flames and plunge downwards. Just as I was about to attack the third aircraft, I was suddenly attacked by a P40. I immediately engaged in combat with it and quickly shot it down, and then returned in triumph.

December 〇〇th (Feni Attack): December 24th (Intercepting Enemy Fighters Over 〇〇): Over 〇〇, six Hurricanes attacked. My aircraft took off a little late, and because I forgot to step on the throttle, the speed was also a bit slow. I struck the enemy aircraft from the side, causing it to burst into flames and plunge downward. I further forced an enemy aircraft to crash-land in flames on the island of the Irrawaddy River. I saw an enemy pilot crawling out of the river and immediately notified the ground troops. Soon, the pilot raised both hands and became a prisoner. After interrogation, it was discovered that he was a major. All the attacking enemy aircraft were wiped out. How exhilarating! The squadron leader shot down one Hurricane, Sergeant Major So shot down two, and Sergeant Anabuki shot down three. What a thriving Nakazaki squadron!

December 〇〇th (Attack on Yunnan Station Airfield): Because refueling was five minutes late, I stepped on the throttle to catch up with the main force. I flew over the Nu River and crossed the Mekong River, but still could not catch up. Helplessly, I had to return and sadly welcome the New Year, unable to help but miss my hometown.

January 〇〇th (Flying to Yunnan Gathering Field, Bombers Showed Great Skill, Bombing the Airfield to Pieces): Among the fifteen enemy Curtis P40s, six rose, but after being attacked, they flew back. I chased after them and struck again, immediately trailing a white smoke, plunging downward.

〇月〇〇日 (Air Battle Against Bombers Over Rangoon): "Three enemy aircraft are approaching over the 〇〇 ocean!" After receiving the report, I bravely took off. After six rounds of intense battle, I shot down one Vickers Wellington bomber. As I was about to attack another, I suddenly fell into a state of unconsciousness, descending straight down to 250 meters above the sea before regaining consciousness.

January 〇〇th (Combat with B24 Over 〇〇): In the sky above the 〇〇 area at the mouth of the Rangoon River, seven black dots circled and soared, which were the enemy air force's proud Consolidated B24s. I attacked the third enemy aircraft in a formation of three in front, causing it to emit smoke. But it still wanted to escape, so I went after it and struck again. It then trailed a white smoke, remaining behind the formation. Giving it a final strike, it suddenly spewed black smoke, with its entire right wing engulfed in flames, and began to fall towards the ground. Originally, I wanted to chase the second aircraft, but unfortunately, both gasoline and bullets had run out, so I had to withdraw.

March 〇th (Participated in the Cox's Bazar Attack): I shot down two Hurricanes.

March 〇〇th (Pada Airfield Attack): Shot down two Hurricanes.

April 〇〇th (Duhazari Attack): Shot down one Hurricane.

April 〇〇th (First Imphal Attack): Three Hurricanes and my one aircraft engaged in a duel. As a result, I shot down two, and another was also damaged. All of our aircraft returned. In this battle, our side achieved the glorious record of shooting down fifteen enemy aircraft. Our fierce advance cleared out all enemy aircraft, and the triumphant song resounded with our unparalleled might!

April 〇〇th (Second Imphal Attack): Shot down two P36s, one of which spewed white smoke in the first round and crashed upside down.

April 〇〇th (Kunming Airfield Attack): Engaged ten P40s and shot down one.

May 〇〇th (Cox's Bazar Attack): Shot down one Hurricane. The Hurricane that crashed into the sea left only a trail of bubbles.

May 〇〇th (Second Kunming Attack): In this long-awaited attack, the opponents were all elite from the US Air Force! Of course, there were many enemies. Let's do it! After attacking twenty enemy giant aircraft four times, we suffered a chase attack by more than forty Curtis P40s. The battle was so intense that both sides began a melee. I scattered the enemy aircraft and conveniently rescued two friendly aircraft. After fighting fiercely for so long, I made about seven enemy aircraft emit white smoke, confirming that three had been shot down, but my beloved aircraft did not suffer a single bullet. All the ammunition I brought was used up.

May 〇〇th (Participated in the Chittagong Attack): Shot down one Hurricane.

May 〇〇th: Engaged more than ten Hurricanes and shot down two over the Bay of Bengal.

October 8th (Intercepting B24s and P38s Attacking Rangoon): Fought thirteen enemy aircraft with a single aircraft. Crashed three B24s and two P38s. My beloved aircraft was injured and forced to land. I survived to return to base on the third day. I was shot in the left finger. After being hospitalized, the 〇〇 unit commander personally came to express his condolences and explained the battle tactics. It was an honor! Whenever I think of this, I am even more determined to fight. The supreme commander of the army in Burma also sent an adjutant to express his condolences and bestowed a folding fan, for which I am immensely grateful. I only hope that my finger injury will heal soon, so that I can fight bravely in the air and repay his kindness. The supreme commander of aviation in the Southern Area also sent a congratulatory telegram, saying, "Respectfully saluting Sergeant Anabuki of your unit for his illustrious military exploits." (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun)

### A Petty Officer Shoots Down Ten Enemy Aircraft in One Day

Extraordinary Achievement in the South Pacific Air War

Takeo Okumura, a young naval aviation petty officer who came from the Youth Flying Corps, achieved the glorious feat of personally shooting down ten aircraft in one day. On September 14th, in the Solomon Islands area, where the battle situation was extremely fierce, the Japanese naval aviation unit in the Poin region intercepted more than 240 enemy aircraft that came to attack, and, in cooperation with ground fire, shot down sixty of them. The Japanese side also lost a total of five aircraft that did not return after exploding. On that day, Petty Officer Okumura, who was active and energetic, was awarded a white-sheathed military sword engraved with "Outstanding Military Merit" by the commander of the 〇〇 fleet. How was this glorious record of shooting down ten aircraft in one day achieved? The reporter interviewed the warriors who fought alongside Petty Officer Okumura that day and learned the details of the air battle that day:

Shooting Down One Aircraft Right Away At 6:30 AM, after intelligence of an enemy aircraft attack arrived, 〇〇 fighter planes immediately took to the skies. After patrolling for thirty-five minutes, a large enemy formation was spotted at a long distance towards Joysole Island, and the interception battle began. The weather was clear and calm, perfect for air combat. The enemy consisted of eleven Consolidated B24-type aircraft and thirty fighter escorts, unfolding a fierce air battle. Petty Officer Okumura shot down a first Sutherland ski, and the enemy fighters were gradually shot down by our naval aircraft, seven in total. After the fighters were cleared, only the large aircraft remained. Our 〇〇 aircraft simultaneously attacked one of the enemy large aircraft. Petty Officer Okumura hit the first one. While escaping, he pursued at full speed for twenty minutes, until the enemy aircraft was forced to close and fired upon, being hit by more than a dozen bullets and crashing in flames.

The Enemy Aircraft Had Already Fled Far Away

At 8:00 AM, when the lookout spotted the enemy aircraft, a蓬蓬 sound was heard, and simultaneously, it sounded like ten thousand thunderbolts were exploding, as they bombed our aircraft on the runway. Without waiting for the bombs to fall, the aircraft immediately took off, but it was too late. Twelve enemy 康〇里-type aircraft and thirty fighter aircraft had already fled far away.

At 8:40 AM, because the enemy had already fled, and while feeling extremely frustrated and planning to land, a signal came from the ground to "Postpone Landing." Immediately, he became a hundred times more energetic and stood by in anticipation, but the enemy did not come. "Isn't this a waste of effort?" Just as he was feeling tired and wanted to land again, another signal came to "Postpone Landing." "Okay, this time it must be," he waited in anticipation. They came, they came! At an altitude of 6,000 meters, more than forty Belle and Grumman type aircraft came in a large group.

The enemy and our side both had fighter aircraft, and the Belles and Grummans were both formidable enemies. But ultimately, they were no match, as they engaged in combat like swallows for thirty minutes. Falling, falling, more than half of the enemy aircraft, twenty-two in total, fell into the South Sea, feeding the fish. Among these, Petty Officer Okumura shot down two Belle types and one Grumman type.

Encouraging Each Other and Registering Again

Our 〇〇 aircraft landed at the base from time to time due to fuel shortages, and Okumura became anxious. His comrades encouraged each other and leaped into their aircraft.

The ground maintenance crew shouted, "Please don't fly above 〇〇 meters!" They were worried that there would be no 〇〇 Li. In the aircraft, he ascended into the sky and waited. Ah! There were too many, too many! Enemy carrier-based bombers and fighters filled the sky, totaling fifty carrier-based bombers and sixty fighter aircraft. "Very good, the more the better!"

A total of fifty-four aircraft were shot down. Our 〇〇 aircraft broke into the midst of several times the number of enemies, and those in its path fell. Those that fell were all enemy aircraft. After thirty minutes of air combat, five carrier-based aircraft were shot down, and fighters fell. A total of one carrier-based aircraft and four Grumman types.

Petty Officer Okumura's outstanding record includes four 〇〇 in the China Incident. Adding the ten from this day in the Greater East Asia War, the total is forty aircraft, for a total of fifty-four aircraft.

The Commander Said:

There are many records of shooting down many aircraft over a long period, but the record of shooting down ten aircraft in one day is unprecedented. In the blistering heat and the pestilent rain of the Pacific, Petty Officer Okumura's vigorous fighting spirit and strong physique are admirable. The daily and nightly air battles are all fought by these young air force warriors. As Marshal Yamamoto said, "Now is the era of young people." Petty Officer Okumura's extraordinary actions are due to his calm and decisive personality, continuous training, and repeated combat experience. It is hoped that all those who aspire to be air force warriors will have this spirit and physique. (Translated from the November 3rd Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Living Among the Laborers

— Zu Ren

Drained of energy by the machines, sucked of blood and sweat by life—this is the meaning of labor: like a dream. But, it is not a dream. I have been making a living in the machine circle for six years now.

Organic human flesh and blood and energy, combined with the power of machinery, form the throbbing and roaring within the machine circle. I live silently within this circle, where every minute is governed by throbbing and roaring.

The humans here use their physical and mental strength to control the function of the machines, so that they can exert the highest productive capacity. But, the machines also suck the blood and sweat of humans to supply their functional consumption—it is always this kind of cycle. Every year, every month, every day, every hour, there is no season, and no climate. It does not stop, nor does it change.

A bolt of cloth is produced on the machines, but: the function of humans can never catch up with the excellent machinery. Thus: the people active in this circle become thin and emaciated, one by one!

The humans who do this kind of work that consumes machines and is also consumed by machines are the so-called laborers—a kind of people who sell their labor.

This kind of people who sell their labor was completely unfamiliar to me when I was in school. I only knew that there was this kind of people existing in the world! Of course: at that time, I was completely immersed in the desire to obtain academic credits. I had no time to explore everything about these humans whose destinies were different from ours. Moreover: at that time, I would never have thought that in the future, I would live closely with these humans that I had ignored and for a long time, with a history of more than six years!

Facts often disappoint ideals! Not at all false, it has been six years, and I have been living among the laborers.

Every day, when the hand of the clock points to the number seven, a group of laborers who have not yet shaken off their sleepiness are swallowed up by the two dark factory gates. At this time, they should begin to sell their labor. Yes, another day of work has begun…

Rushing into the factory, the yarn spindles and looms, under the skilled management of this large group of laborers, emit heavy, rough, monotonous roars, like this, until the night pushes darkness into the factory, only then does it stop its noisy clamor.

The air in the city is certainly filthy, but: take a look inside the factory. Grains, wool scraps fly, forming a thin mist like the one on the streets in the morning, blurring even the sunlight. The laborers work diligently in this filthy air, unaware of what hardship is.

You say: Working in this kind of filthy air is extremely detrimental to "nutrition," right! Yes, fresh air is a necessity for every organic human. Although this element of nutrition does not require spending money to purchase, and can be enjoyed freely, in the factory, enjoying fresh air is an extravagant hope. "Nutrition" is certainly needed, but: talking about excellent "nutrition" to a group of hungry people is no different from an emperor in a famine year saying to the hungry masses, "Why don't they eat meat porridge?"—it is generally unreasonable.

Yes! Air will never be as serious as the bread problem, in the minds of ordinary laborers. Otherwise, why is there only a demand for increased wages, and never a call for fresh air!

For the sake of life, they obediently subordinate everything they have to a strange, controlling chain. They have lost their autonomy, and life has become their master. They follow it, obey it: life makes them forget hardship and weariness.

Thin and emaciated! Sick! But: life is still strictly whipping them, so that they dare not stop for a moment to catch their breath. They are drained of energy by the machines and sucked of blood and sweat by life—the meaning of six years of labor.

Humans are drained of energy and sweat, to exchange it for the reward of the lowest living standard. This is a tragic transaction, but: for the sake of survival, our poor group of laborers is breathing in this kind of transaction:

The transaction of ordinary goods and values generally always has the value of the goods and the price equal. But ah! In my living circle, I see groups of laborers who have exhausted their blood, sweat, and energy, but: the reward! It is not even enough for the warmth and sustenance of a family. I do not believe that the price of human flesh and blood and energy is so low.

This kind of cheap sale of blood, sweat, and energy is a human tragedy, but there are really many of these tragedies performed by humans in the world!

Is labor really sacred! I often think.

### Paulownia Leaves

— Sun Tiecheng

The paulownia leaves in the courtyard are falling again, accumulating a thick layer in the past few days. The children are all gathered under the half-bald sycamore trees, picking up paulownia leaves. It is said that the leaf stems can be used as ink. Since I am idle, I also want to learn the children's games and try it. As soon as I step on the dry and yellow leaves, a series of ear-piercing and somewhat mournful cracking sounds are emitted, which makes people think of the magnificence and passion of youth when they were stirred by the breeze and played a magnificent and enthusiastic youth rhapsody. But now youth has become the past, and reverie has finally become reverie, gently blown away by the autumn wind, leaving only a desolate and dying funeral song. In a few more days, there will be no sound at all. Unless it was a particularly great person before, perhaps a child will see the greatness of its leaf stem and be forced to think of its greatness before, and say, "It used to be a surprisingly large leaf!" However, the past is the past, what about now? Picking paulownia leaves is indeed a very interesting game. The thicker and stronger it grows, the better the material, which is everyone's goal. If several children discover an outstanding big paulownia leaf at the same time, there will definitely be a conflict for the same goal. This is also something I have often seen.

I only picked five or six branches, but I gradually developed special and ridiculous feelings about the color and wormholes of the paulownia leaves on the ground. Gray means old age and death, which is natural and there is no need to feel sorry for it. Yellow means "great ambitions unfulfilled before death," which is regrettable. Green means premature death, which is innocent and most regrettable. Wormholes are more interesting, and can even be said to be more meaningful. Each one has its own appearance. The lines of the wormholes symbolize its past history: deep, shallow, thick, narrow, long, short, indicating the degree to which it has been eaten by worms, where it started to be eaten, where it ended up being eaten, and why it ate this one and not that one. All of these have research value. According to my ridiculous, childish observation, the reasons why it was eaten by worms are nothing more than two points: one is weakness, and the other is strength. From this, it can be seen that Confucius's doctrine of the mean does have some truth, no wonder the Master's teachings are used by many scholars as mouthpieces.

After picking for a while, my hands are full of them. Many of them have been eaten by insects. I guess that its life, in addition to sprouting, growing, maturing, and then being eaten by insects and dying, probably has not done anything else. Silently born, silently died, that's all.

Back in the study, I tested the leaf stems one by one, but they all failed. The ink marks on the inkstone were all wiped off, but there was still no success. In anger, I threw the leaf stems out the window and told the children not to bother. But one child said loudly, "Ink can't be used, but it can be dried and used as firewood." So they are still happily continuing to work, but no longer picking, but grabbing.

Doesn't it become "walking" then? What isn't a road that can be walked on? ××× Of course, there is no easily walkable road. Even a goat path cannot be seen. However, finally, I raised my scarred feet on the sharp and angular rockslides and began to step on the first step…

### Football League Division One, First Act: Commentary on the Police vs. Overseas Chinese Match —Police: Strong Offense and Defense, Imposing Presence— —Overseas Chinese: Sudden Loss of Form, Disorganized—

The Shanghai Football League Division One match, originally scheduled to begin the previous week, was thus postponed. Last weekend, there were originally three matches, but Heaven was not kind, and yesterday's rain continued all day. Two exciting matches were again postponed due to rain. Of the remaining Saturday match, the Police easily defeated the Overseas Chinese, winning by a large margin of five to one, beyond expectations. Here is a brief account of the battle and a commentary on the skills of both teams.

The two teams met at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 p.m. on the 13th. Although the weather was sunny that day, the wind was strong, which inevitably affected the battle. As fans had not seen a match in a long time, they were happy to watch from the sidelines, with no fewer than seven hundred people, making for a lively atmosphere.

Account of the Battle

When the time arrived, the two sides lined up, the Police positioned to the south with the wind at their backs, and the Overseas Chinese to the north against the wind. Therefore, as soon as the battle began, the Police launched attacks one after another, and the Overseas Chinese formation was dominated by Police players. The two inner midfielders were busy trying to cope, but to no avail. In the twentieth minute, Huang Mao was the first to break through the net. After that, the Police's offensive became even more intense. The Overseas Chinese, disadvantaged by the wind, had their entire team scattered like sand. Let alone attack, fifteen minutes before the end of the first half, Huang Mao took advantage of an opening to score another goal.

After the break, although the Overseas Chinese had the help of the wind, they still seemed powerless. The Police players, especially the strong ones, fought even more bravely. Soon, Huang Mao scored a third goal. The Overseas Chinese players looked at each other in dismay, and a desperate struggle was inevitable. Fa Fanxiao suddenly raised his arm and shouted, and the whole army launched an attack. After a long melee, the Overseas Chinese got a chance to take a corner kick. The right forward took the kick and successfully used the wind to score a goal, making it 1-3, showing a slight improvement. Unexpectedly, this good moment passed quickly, like a flash in the pan. Afterwards, it became the Police's show again, with Quelunzifu scoring first, and then Huang Mao sealing the victory with a score of 5-1. The Police were the first to sing a victory song.

Commentary on the Police

The entire team relied on their strong physiques. When attacking, they watched the ball's landing point, and their five forwards advanced rapidly, which was very sharp and effective. The wingers were well-positioned, and their dribbling was all above par. As for shooting, apart from Huang Mao, it was still a bit weak. The midfield line was able to retreat to defend and help with the attack. Because of the weakness of the two wings of the Overseas Chinese team in this battle, they appeared particularly active. Tiefunini's marking of Fa Fanxiao in front of the center was an undeniable contribution. The two fullbacks, Luosai'er, were full of energy and well-positioned, and ran quickly. Ke Detuo seemed inexperienced, with errors occurring from time to time. If Fu'en had been playing, they would inevitably have lost some presence. Judging from this, they did not seem as experienced as Lianyi and Li Wu. Goalkeeper Fu Keni did not have much to show.

Speaking of individuals, Huang Mao (Robert Stoff) was as fierce as he was three years ago. His speed of advance was difficult to predict, and his skill in attacking the goal was especially difficult for the goalkeeper to defend. However, his turning ability was no longer as flexible as it used to be. The left winger, Quelunzifu, was not as fierce as Yuan Kuntian, but his steadiness also surpassed Yuan. The right winger, Li Ming, was a sprinter, and his dribbling and passing showed considerable skill. It was a pity that he lacked experience. Given time, he could become a great player. The rest of the players were all in normal form, so there is no need to say more.

Commentary on the Overseas Chinese

The Overseas Chinese attack adopted a W formation, which had been quite successful in the past. I still remember the three draws between St. Francis and Eastern. With the replacement of Fu'en with Fa Fanxiao, the offensive could not be said to be weak. However, this battle was a major departure from the norm. The center forward got the ball and passed it to the wings, but neither winger could do anything with it, causing the two inner forwards to work in vain, resulting in a disjointed attack. The three midfielders were still able to supply the front line, and their marking was also diligent. However, Weiketai was helpless against Huang Mao. The two fullbacks were veterans with plenty of experience. Seeing Huang Mao's speed, they used their position to stay in front of him, causing him to be offside. Indeed, drawing the forwards offside was one of their tactics. Huang Mao was offside many times in this battle, which was commendable. However, Ka. Ka constantly used guards, which was a fatal flaw, because the ball would reach Huang Mao first, creating potential danger. This was a lack of adaptability. Goalkeeper Mali. Te was not a top player and was careless in his response.

Speaking of individuals, the most commendable player in this battle was right midfielder Mo Erfo, who ran all over the field and made successful saves. Kaloliequ contributed more than he erred and should not be blamed for the loss. None of the five forwards were commendable. Fa Fanxiao was effectively marked by the opponent, but after getting the ball, he passed it to the wings, which ultimately led to nothing. Being isolated and helpless, a hero was at his wits' end and could only be seen wandering around the field. The right winger, Bola Ge, lacked experience and was slow in his movements. If he had been replaced by Fu'en, there would have been at least two chances to score into an empty goal. Was Bola Ge useless? Did his direct corner kick into the net, breaking the duck egg, slightly reduce his guilt? Left winger Kaposi Ting was also slow and clumsy and could not coordinate with the midfield, which was also a manifestation of the abnormal state after the loss. (Mei Bixian)

### Ping-Pong Practice Methods: A Guide for Beginners

To ensure that everyone has a healthy body, we must pay attention to sports. Therefore, promoting sports is one of the most important conditions for making the body healthy. The more we use our bodies, the more developed they become. But some sports make the body develop in a distorted way. Ping-pong is a sport that develops the whole body evenly. Not only is the whole body exercised evenly, but it also requires "turning the mind." It is a sport that uses both hands and brain, so it is especially worthy of our promotion.

Knowing the importance of exercise, many people can make a preliminary attempt, but not many can persist. The reason is probably because they don't understand the methods of exercise and don't get the real fun of exercise. Some people cannot abide by the rules of the sport and get along with others. Playing as if in a play is of no help to the health of the body. Therefore, it is very important for us to promote table tennis. And it is especially important to seriously study "Ping-Pong Technique" so that beginners can get a stepping stone and those who are proficient can get more opportunities to learn from each other.

The Way of Offense and Defense

Because few people talk about "Ping-Pong Technique" on weekdays, it is really like a twenty-four history. Where do you start? The author is not talented, so I will write down some of the methods I have used to study ping-pong for more than ten years for the reference of comrades from all walks of life.

There are many ways to play ping-pong, but they can be roughly divided into two types: one is "blocking," a defensive ball that is cut. The other is "smashing" and "pressing," an offensive ball. Beginners should first lay a solid foundation in defense. That is, when competing with others, they should first defend and maintain their position without losing, and then look for opportunities to attack.

There are many ways to defend. The first thing to do is to practice "close blocking." Regardless of whether the opponent's ball is a light block or a heavy hit, the practitioner should return the ball with the most sincere attitude, just trying to hit it a few more times to extend the practice time. With this kind of attentive practice, after a certain period of time, experience will gradually increase, and the nature of the ball will become clear. No matter what kind of hard ball it is, you will have the ability to respond to the situation. Then practice "long blocking" and "cutting." After practicing various techniques, practice "light smashing." Although this "light smashing" does not have much power, it is more powerful than cutting, and can prevent the opponent's fierce attack or vicious cut, and can make the incoming ball more accurate and not hard. After the practice of "light smashing" has a considerable degree of certainty, gradually increase the power of the smash under the condition of accuracy, to achieve the stage of fierce attack and hard hitting.

"Close blocking" is the basis of "cutting," and "light smashing" is the basis of "fierce attack." So, to practice the ball, you must first practice defense. To defend, you must first practice "close blocking," "long blocking," and "cutting." After practicing these well, you can further practice "light smashing" and "fierce attack." This method is like building a house. First, you must lay a solid foundation. If the roots are deep and firm, there will naturally be very little danger.

Three Stages

From the process of learning ping-pong, it can be divided into three stages. Each stage has a goal that should be worked hard to achieve.

Beginner Stage: You must concentrate all your energy on the point of the ball. That is, the position where the ball bounces on the table, the ball speed, the soft ball on the racket, about one-half faster than before, the rotation speed of the ball, the direction of the ball, etc. After the ball hits the table, you can get the direction of the ball. At the same time, pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the racket. Hitting the ball in the middle of the racket is very difficult. But the reaction of the middle of the racket is the strongest. And various hitting methods can also be correct. The reaction force on the west side of the racket is reduced, and it is difficult to grasp various hitting methods. So, in the beginner stage, pay close attention to the ball, and at the same time pay attention to hitting the ball in the middle of the racket.

In this stage, it is not appropriate to imitate skilled ping-pong players to hit the ball, and to hit hard balls indiscriminately. Pay attention to not touching the net and not going out of the table. Fully restrain the ball. Hit the ball within one foot of the baseline. And you must first practice the hand holding the racket in front of your body. Second, practice the hand holding the racket back. After learning these two methods, you can practice hitting the ball sideways.

After each return of the ball, be prepared to return the next ball. Because only by being prepared at all times can you cope with the situation at any time. Otherwise, you will be attacked unexpectedly and be at a loss.

If you can hit the ball almost every time in the middle of the racket, and you can hit the opponent's table almost every time, then you can be considered to have completed the first stage of the course.

Training Stage: In this stage, you should pay attention to correcting your weaknesses and practicing various hitting methods. If you have one less hitting method, you have one more flaw, and the opponent has one more chance to win. And you must know how to save energy. You should attack when you should attack, and you should defend when you should defend. Don't defend or act recklessly. Be quick to respond for a long battle.

In addition to this, you should also pay attention to the opponent's movements. Because if you understand the opponent's movements, you can predict the direction of the opponent's return of the ball. There are roughly the following points to observe:

1. The opponent's wrist, racket, and body posture when hitting the ball;

2. The position of both you and the opponent and the hitting posture;

3. The position of the opponent and the ping-pong table;

4. The position of the racket;

5. Research the opponent's habits and commonly used strategies.

If you can pay attention to the above points, then it is not difficult to predict what kind of ball the opponent will hit.

In this stage, you must not only correct your weaknesses, practice various hitting methods, and pay attention to the opponent's movements, but also train your hands and feet. Training your hands is an important thing. But when hitting the ball, if your feet don't help actively, you won't succeed. To cope with the opponent's attack in any direction, you must have a flexible response. This kind of all-round skill depends on the activity of the feet.

Proficiency Stage: You should already have a very good understanding of the principles of playing the ball, and you also play the ball very well. You are also used to various common movements. So, in this stage, ping-pong players look at the table with a flat eye, and make more observations in front of the enemy to make the final correction of their return of the ball.

The eye is the representative of the heart. Skilled ping-pong players don't pay attention to watching the ball, but measure the opponent's table to determine the direction of their return. Therefore, many skilled ping-pong players observe the opponent's eyes to judge the direction of the opponent's return. However, this kind of decision is also easy to be deceived. Some people focus their eyes on a certain direction, but hit the ball in the opposite direction. This kind of hitting method is easy to confuse the opponent and make it difficult to cope with.

There is no fixed and easy method for hitting ping-pong. It all depends on the individual's flexible use. It all depends on being enthusiastic and skillful. For example, if the smashing and pressing balls are sharp, rapid, and stable, the effect is often not very great. If the smashing ball is spinning and the pressing ball is cutting, then the person returning the ball must not only carefully observe the direction of the ball, but also carefully observe the direction of the ball, because the direction of the spinning ball after hitting the table will not necessarily be the same as before hitting the table. The cutting ball is even as light as a feather, making it elusive.

In short, although ping-pong is a small skill, its interest and mystery cannot be exhausted. Sometimes it is not something that can be conveyed by pen and ink, but depends entirely on one's own experience. (End) Chen Linsheng
