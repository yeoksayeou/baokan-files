### We Anticipate August 1st

—And Hope the French Government Will Swiftly Make a Clear Statement

August 1st, the August 1st we are anticipating, will be the day when the Republic of China begins to realize its complete sovereignty, the day when the ideal that the people of the whole country have been yearning for day and night for a century will be realized! Because according to the agreement signed in Nanjing on June 30 this year between China and Japan for the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, the Shanghai settlement, a base that has damaged our country's sovereignty for a century, will be officially returned by Japan! This is a summary of China's century of humiliation, and at the same time, it is the beginning of a glorious history of Sino-Japanese cooperation in building a new East Asia. However, today, we still cannot but feel regret that the French government has not yet made a clear statement on the promise to return the French Concession in Shanghai, that is to say, at a time when our friendly nation Japan is earnestly fulfilling all its promises to respect our country's complete sovereignty, the French government has not yet determined the date for the return of the concession. This is obviously a shadow in the minds of the Chinese people and in the eyes of the international community, and we hope that the French government can quickly dispel this shadow!

The existence of the French Concession is also a great humiliation in the minds of the Chinese people. Now that the International Settlement has been returned due to Japan's friendly cooperation, only the French Concession continues to exist. We believe that this will leave a bad impression on China and its people by the French government, which will be impossible to eliminate, and will not be a blessing for Sino-French relations. From the country's standpoint, it is indeed as Mayor Chen of our city said: "If the administrative power of the French Concession is not returned for a single day, the administration of Shanghai will still not be complete, and the administration of China will not be complete." This will inevitably lead to serious obstacles for China, which is moving towards independence and autonomy. Therefore, we hope that our government will quickly conduct concrete consultations with the French authorities and urge the French government to fulfill its promise. We look forward to the realization of the return of the French Concession in Shanghai by August 1st at the latest, as Premier Wang has said.

From the perspective of French interests, after careful consideration, we feel that there is no need to delay the return of the French Concession at all. On the contrary, it should be returned quickly. France today is in a very difficult situation and is also moving towards a new life, seeking to restore its past glory and rebuild its important position in the international arena. The first step is to establish international prestige, fulfill its promises to China, and return the Shanghai Concession, and to achieve this by August 1st at the latest. This will not only greatly enhance the prospects of Sino-French relations, but also the feelings between the Chinese and French people. From the current international situation, the righteous people of the world are preparing for a decisive battle to defend truth and defeat Anglo-American hegemony. France, which has the glory of three revolutions, will naturally be an important member in this great decisive battle and will not want to abandon its divine duty. Therefore, in order not to let Japan monopolize the limelight, it should quickly implement the return of the Shanghai Concession to show its determination to cooperate in promoting justice. This is not only the expectation of China and the nations of East Asia, but also the common expectation of every righteous person in France.

For the sake of this glorious day of August 1st, which is not only the prelude to the future international morality and new order of China alone, we hope that the French authorities will take a long-term and broad view, and implement the return of the French Concession in Shanghai at the same time on August 1st, and hope that the Italian government and others can emulate Japan and make similar statements one after another! So that China's complete sovereignty can be fully realized, and China can achieve success in the process of independence and autonomy. This is not only China's glory, but also the glory of all friendly nations! Therefore, we look forward to August 1st, which is the beginning of the construction of a new East Asia and a new world order!

Commentary

### Turkey Firmly Adheres to Neutrality

After the end of the North African war, Britain and the United States raised the banner of invading Europe and, as usual, used the old trick of intense psychological warfare, making great publicity through radio, news, and the activities of the Fifth Column. Turkey has always been used as good material for propaganda. Since the Axis forces withdrew from Tunisia, various sensational news about Turkey has been spread. For example, "Turkey has decided to abandon its neutral attitude and adopt a non-belligerent attitude," or "Turkey has decided to open the British and American Soviet routes through the Dardanelles Strait," or "Turkey will soon join the war on the side of Britain and the United States," or "British and American air forces will bomb Romanian oil fields from Turkish air bases," and so on. Recently, while traveling to and from Berlin, this reporter briefly stayed in various Balkan capitals such as Sofia, Bucharest, and Budapest. The people I came into contact with there seemed particularly concerned about Turkey. Needless to say, if Turkey is engulfed in war today, it will inevitably spread to the Balkans immediately. That is why the Balkan countries pay special attention to Turkey's movements. When judging the current situation, the observations of people in the Balkans seem to be more sensitive than those of us in Turkey. I felt like I was wearing very strong tinted glasses there.

Therefore, we cannot but recognize the truth that the enemy is using Turkey's name for propaganda in the Balkans. The arguments heard in the Balkans are probably all the enemy's fabrications or something similar. In response to this propaganda, the entire Turkish nation only hopes for the preservation of its own country. Therefore, it will absolutely not enter the war voluntarily. Britain and the United States are indeed paying considerable attention to strengthening the military in the Balkans. The intention of Britain and the United States to instigate Turkey is not to make Turkey have direct military cooperation in the war against the Axis powers, but to prepare for future or potential events.

Therefore, in the eyes of Britain and the United States, Turkey's value lies not in seeking military cooperation. If Turkey stands on the side of Britain and the United States, it is only being used as a means of "posing" against the Axis powers. In the eyes of Britain and the United States, Turkey has not yet reached the point where it can be of great use.

Britain and the United States have already fully utilized Turkey as a means of "posing." However, the tension in the Balkan countries today is not only focused on Turkey. They anticipate that the enemy will attack in Thrace, Greece, and along the Adriatic coast, and are therefore considering contingency plans.

As for Turkey itself, it remains extremely calm, and the deployment of troops seems to be the same as before. No new mobilization seems likely to be implemented. Since mid-May, Turkish warships have deployed a maze, and the lights of the Black Sea coast and the Bosphorus Strait lighthouses have been extinguished, which has attracted considerable attention. But isn't Turkey taking a precautionary measure to avoid getting caught in the crossfire, anticipating that the Mediterranean war is about to come?

Therefore, no large-scale military activities are about to occur in Turkey. Economically, taxes have only been increased a few times to maintain military spending, and prices also tend to rise. However, the expression of the people is extremely calm, trusting the repeated statements of government officials to maintain neutrality. The possibility of Turkey joining the war is not a daily topic for the general public. (Sho: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, June 28)

### Imperial General Headquarters Announces Battle Situation in the Rentaba Island Area: Imperial Army Air Force Demonstrates Power

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on the 1st: (1) On the morning of June 30, a strong enemy force consisting of transport ships, cruisers, etc., was discovered in the Rentaba Island area of the Solomon Islands, and part of it landed on the island. (2) The Imperial Navy Air Force has bombed the above-mentioned enemy forces several times, sinking or destroying a total of six transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer, and shooting down a total of 31 enemy planes. (3) The Imperial Army and Navy forces in the area are continuing to fight in close cooperation.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here, Japan and the United States have been engaged in fierce battles in the South Pacific since August of last year. During this time, the Japanese Navy Air Force in the area has not allowed the enemy to make any moves, and any moves by the enemy have been crushed by the Japanese army, especially since the air battle in Longa Bay. The battle situation has become even more intense. Japan and the United States are both fighting with all their might, and the future battle situation is not difficult to imagine. On the morning of June 30, the United States suddenly appeared south of Munda Island in New Guinea. At that time, a transport fleet composed of more than a dozen ships was escorted by cruisers and destroyers, and a strong air force was on alert in the sky. More than 100 landing craft landed from the north to south coasts of Rentaba Island, about 10 kilometers south of the western coast of New Guinea Island. After the Japanese air force discovered them, it immediately took the opportunity to launch a large-scale surprise attack, broke through the enemy fighter formation, and heavily bombed the enemy transport fleet, sinking or destroying six enemy transport ships, three cruisers, and one destroyer. It achieved tremendous results. However, part of the enemy forces have already landed, so the Japanese Army and Navy forces in the area are currently engaged in a fierce battle with the enemy. It is expected that the Japanese army will thoroughly annihilate the powerful American operations.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – On the morning of June 27, anti-Axis aircraft, including mutual-type bombers, Douglas bombers, Northrop bombers, and Curtis fighters, totaling 50 aircraft, attacked Kolombangarra Island. Eight were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. On the afternoon of June 28, anti-Axis aircraft, consisting of a joint formation of 68 fighter-bombers, including unified "B24" type, Curtis "P40" type, and Douglas "FBD" type, attacked Isabel Island. The Japanese ground forces immediately countered, resulting in the shooting down of three "FBD" types.

Japanese Aircraft Bomb Darwin Harbor Vigorously

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to an anti-Axis bulletin relayed from Melbourne: Japanese bomber formations, under the escort of fighter planes, attacked Darwin Harbor again yesterday, as well as Milne Bay in New Guinea. The damage and casualties suffered there were quite extensive. The bulletin stated that six anti-Axis aircraft were shot down during the aerial combat over Darwin Harbor.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) – German News Agency military reporter Hans Ribbentrop declared: The recent Japanese army's aerial attacks on the military facilities of Darwin Harbor in northern Australia may be a harbinger of new developments. Japan, an allied country in East Asia far from the European battlefield, is now taking decisive action, as can be seen in the recent heavy bombing of Darwin Harbor. This is the first large-scale operation of the Japanese Army Air Force. From this fact, it can be judged that Japan's offensive against Australia has made very good progress, and a major undertaking may be imminent, or it may be the beginning of a new stage in the Pacific War.

### Chairman Wang Visits Suzhou to Participate in the Second Anniversary of the Pacification Campaign; Suzhou and Wuxi Hold Grand Celebrations

Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, in view of the fact that the pacification work originated in Suzhou, made a special visit during the second anniversary of the pacification campaign. This is his fifth inspection of the pacified area, and his fourth visit to Suzhou. Accompanying personnel included Chen Chunpu, Secretary-General of the Executive Yuan, Ye Peng, Minister of the Army, Zhou Jiangxiang, Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs, Chen Changzu, Lieutenant General Adjutant to the National Government, Zhai Manyun, Director of the Executive Yuan Pacification Affairs Bureau, and the two friendly Japanese, Chaisan and Teraoka. The Chairman departed from the capital at about 4 PM on the 30th. When passing through Zhenjiang, Yuan Shu, Director of the Zhenjiang Area Pacification Campaign, received orders from Governor Li to board the car and accompany him. Along the way, many people from various counties held flags to welcome him. The special train arrived in Suzhou at 7:49 PM. Governor Li, along with civil and military officials, greeted him at the station. After the Chairman alighted from the train and exchanged greetings with Governor Li and other welcoming personnel, he entered the city in a special car. Along the way, people held flags and shouted "Long live Chairman Wang!" The situation was extremely enthusiastic. Upon arriving at the headquarters, Governor Li led the directors of various departments and the magistrates of various counties to pay their respects in shifts. At 8:20 PM, Governor Li held a banquet for the Chairman at the headquarters. That evening, the Chairman also issued a declaration for the second anniversary of the pacification campaign. At 8:30 AM on the 1st, the Chairman listened to Governor Li's report at the headquarters. From 8:55 AM to 9:55 AM, he listened to the reports of the stationed friendly Japanese generals. At 1:00 PM, the Chairman personally visited the Pacification Memorial Hall in Gongxiang and attended the Jiangsu Province Third Anniversary of the Pacification Campaign Celebration Conference.

Chairman Wang Delivers an Address

Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, personally attended the second anniversary celebration of the pacification campaign in Suzhou Province today and delivered an address. All the attending representatives listened respectfully and were greatly inspired. The key points of the Chairman's address are respectfully recorded as follows: The pacification work began on July 1, 1941. During the first anniversary of the pacification campaign last year, I said that the purpose of the pacification work is first to promote national peace and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Now, on the occasion of the second anniversary, our country has already participated in the Greater East Asia War in order to strive for the revival of the Chinese nation and the liberation of East Asia. Over the past two years, we have received much assistance from our friendly nations, as well as the efforts of our pacification work colleagues and the people. I would like to express my deepest respect and gratitude here. Since the beginning of the pacification work, only ten counties in Jiangsu were initially designated to be held first, which means that a small part of the region should first be used as a model for the whole country. Now the pacification work will spread throughout the country. The pacification campaign in Suzhou Province has continued from the first phase to the fourth phase, and has expanded to the southeastern region of Lake Tai, the Zhejiang region, and the Shanghai region. The pacification work has been successively launched in Hubei, Anhui, Guangdong, and other provinces. The North Jiangsu region has also returned to Jiangsu due to the pacification campaign. Therefore, the scope of the current pacification work is vastly different from its beginning. Therefore, the Pacification Committee has changed its structure due to factual needs, because the pacification work is general, not special, and permanent, not temporary. However, in the past, some people thought that the pacification work only needed to be the responsibility of the Pacification Committee. In fact, the pacification work must be done by the whole country, and all departments should supervise and cooperate together. The division of the pacification work to the Executive Yuan is also meant to be this way. China is an agricultural society and has not yet entered an industrial society. The purpose of the pacification campaign, as the name suggests, is to focus on the countryside, because farmers are the producers of China. Since the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, the most important task in our country is to increase production. To increase production, we must first protect the producers with all our strength. If the countryside is stable, the farmers will be able to cultivate with one heart and one mind, so that the harvest will be abundant, contributing to the Greater East Asia War and guaranteeing social security, which is also to guarantee the safety of the producers. With all my heart, I offer a heartfelt blessing to the second anniversary of the pacification campaign.

Chairman Wang's Declaration

Suzhou, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Supreme Leader, Chairman Wang, in view of the fact that the pacification work originated in Suzhou, made a special visit during the second anniversary of the pacification campaign, and issued the following declaration for the second anniversary of the pacification campaign: This month's 1st is the second anniversary of the Jiangsu Pacification Campaign. I have come to Suzhou today to offer my heartfelt prayers. In the two years since, I have inspected the pacification zone five times, and each time I have felt there was progress. Thanks to the generous assistance of the friendly military authorities, and the untiring efforts of Governor Li and his subordinates, we have been able to achieve these results. I would like to express my deepest respect here. Tracing back to July 1, 1941, the beginning of the pacification campaign, it was based on the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building; and last year, it further progressed to contributing to the Greater East Asia War during the Greater East Asia War, fulfilling the responsibilities of the rear, so that the soldiers on the front lines of the Greater East Asia War would have no worries about the rear; and this year, it has further participated in the Greater East Asia War, from the spirit of sharing weal and woe, to sharing life and death. At this time, the so-called pacification work, such as guaranteeing social security, should pay attention to the purpose of protecting Chen’s social security. In maintaining the order of the rear of the Greater East Asia War; such as increasing production, we should pay attention to the purpose of production, so that the needs of the Greater East Asia War can be constantly supplied from the rear. From this point of view, to guarantee social security, we must cherish and guarantee those who guarantee social security, such as soldiers, police, and civil servants; to increase production, we must cherish the producers, such as farmers and workers, so that we can show each other the spirit of love and sincerity, and put into practice the solidarity of sincerity. Those who want to love their country will love their neighbors, and those who love East Asia must love each other as each and every person. To guarantee social security and increase production, in the near future, is the purpose of the pacification campaign; in the long term, the significance of participating in the Greater East Asia War also lies in this. I would like to offer my best wishes to the Jiangsu Provincial Government and the people with the meaning of reviving China and defending East Asia. And I would like to wish the second anniversary of the pacification campaign, giving the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and nation-building, and participating in the Greater East Asia War, the greatest significance and expectations. Wang Zhaoming, July 1.

In order to strongly perform its duties, the committee plans to establish an administrative bureau and a Shanghai office. All organizational regulations and important candidates have been resolved and passed by the Executive Yuan meeting.

Therefore, the Ministry of Industry has submitted a request to the Executive Yuan to forward the organizational regulations and organizational outline of the Central and Local Price Countermeasures Committees to the National Government for formal abolition.

### Secretary Matsudaira Broadcasted Last Night

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Secretary Matsudaira of the Japanese Embassy in China gave a radio speech on the 1st at the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Thoughts on the Recovery of the Shanghai International Settlement."

### Revolt Occurs in Gansu; Hu Zongnan Appointed Commander of Suppression

Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – Gansu Province, located in the northwest region, is now an important northwest stronghold of the Chongqing side. However, a large-scale anti-Chiang revolt suddenly occurred in the province under the instigation of a political secret society. The Chongqing side's work of developing the northwest region has therefore been suspended, causing a great blow to the strength of the war of resistance. In January of this year, 8,000 Hui Muslims in Lintao County, south of Lanzhou, suddenly revolted in resistance to Chongqing's administration. Thereupon, the political secret society Gelaohui, which has hidden power in the northwest region, took the opportunity to rise up and incite the revolt. They advocated overthrowing Gu Zhenglun, Chairman of the Chongqing Gansu Province, gathering more than 100,000 people. Led by Ma Fupu, formerly of the Hui Muslim army of Ma Buqing, they formed eight detachments of the "Fushan National Salvation Army." They gradually expanded their power, and by March, they occupied the city of Linxia. In April, they appeared from time to time on the Xilan Highway, attacking and burning Chongqing's liaison vehicles and civilian cars, and occupied major counties in Gansu Province such as Lintao, Yuzhong, Lintan, and Dingxi. By early May, they had cut off the transportation between Lanzhou and Xi'an, and the situation had expanded. The Chongqing side initially paid little attention to it, but was greatly alarmed at this point, and appointed Hu Zongnan, commander of the 34th Army Group of the Chongqing side, as the commander-in-chief of the suppression, in order to quell the revolt by force. Zhu Shaoliang, commander of the 8th War Zone of the Chongqing side, was ordered to be responsible for pacification and recruitment, but there is still no hope of quelling this revolt, and the situation seems to be expanding day by day.

Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – A pro-Chiang revolt suddenly broke out in Gansu Province. Tens of thousands of Hui Muslims, under the command of the Gelaohui, led by the Hui Muslim general Ma Fushan, have captured various key areas of the Minshan Mountains (from the southern part of Lanzhou to the Sichuan Province border, and the central part of Gansu Province in the north) and are confronting the Chongqing army that has been dispatched to suppress them. Although this rebel army is ostensibly guided by the Gelaohui, judging from the way it conducts propaganda to the masses, or the communist guerrilla tactics it adopts when occupying various Chongqing government agencies, and the fact that the Chongqing army forcibly blockades the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia border area whenever a revolt occurs, it can be seen that there must be communist troops secretly active within it. The general public attaches great importance to the revolt in the area.

### North China Decides on Flood Prevention Measures

Beijing, 1st (Central News Agency) – The fundamental policy for this year's flood prevention measures in North China was decided by the standing committee meeting of the North China Political Affairs Committee on June 21. Meticulous flood prevention works will be arranged from July 1 to September 10 in order to ensure complete flood prevention. Therefore, a flood prevention committee general meeting has been established, with Mr. Zhu Shen as the chairman. Flood prevention committee branch meetings have been established in seven cities, including Beijing, Tianjin, Jinan, Baoding, Shijiazhuang, Taiyuan, and Kaifeng, subordinate to the general meeting. The flood prevention committee general meeting has also organized a secretariat composed of relevant officials from various agencies, such as the General Construction Department, the Japanese military, and the Japanese embassy, attached to the committee, to be responsible for the day-to-day promotion work. Rain measurement stations and river water volume measurement stations have also been established in various key areas of North China to seek comprehensive measures.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Announces Personnel of the Embassy in China

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry announced on the 1st that Sanrin Sekimori, Third Secretary of the Embassy, and Shinjiro Tomura have been appointed Second Secretaries of the Embassy of Japan to the Republic of China. Male Diplomatic Officer Mori Tomio has been appointed Third Secretary of the Embassy of Japan to the Republic of China, and Takeki Taniuchi, Consular Officer, has been appointed Consul in Shanghai.

### Comments from Japanese Newspapers Regarding the Return of the Shanghai International Settlement

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: The "Hochi Shimbun" here published an editorial yesterday titled "The Return of the Shanghai International Settlement," stating the following: Among the special rights and interests established by European powers within Chinese territory, the one that causes the most pain to China is the existence of the settlements. These settlements have their own administrative, taxation, police, and judicial powers, becoming states within a state. The most complex and largest of these settlements is the Shanghai Settlement, encompassing both the International Settlement and the French Concession. These two have become bases for European and American powers to invade China and the source of their political conspiracies. Retrieving the settlements is one of the main goals of the Chinese national movement. Since the Greater East Asia War is a war of liberation for all of Greater East Asia, it naturally includes the liberation and independence of China. Therefore, defeating Britain and the United States, cooperating with the National Government, and retrieving the settlements is one of the goals of the Greater East Asia War. On the occasion of the National Government's return to the capital on March 30 of this year, Japan first returned the exclusive concessions in Tianjin and Hankou. Now, further demonstrating its determination to assist China, it is implementing the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, handing it over to the National Government. This action is Japan fulfilling its promise to aid China. In the past, the real power in the Shanghai International Settlement was held by British and American forces, but this influence has now been completely eliminated. It is expected that other related countries will also adopt the same policy as Japan in the future. Therefore, from China's perspective, after the Shanghai Settlement is retrieved, the invasion by European and American powers can be brought to a complete end, and China's strength can be substantially enhanced. The complex administrative phenomena of Shanghai in the past can be eliminated. Looking ahead to the future development of Shanghai, it is hoped that with Japan's cooperation, the National Government will completely retrieve Greater Shanghai, transforming this metropolis into a major base for the reconstruction of China, shouldering the significant task of being the central base of Greater East Asia.

### Ambassador Cai Visits Minister Aoki

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Our country's Ambassador to Japan, Cai Peishi, visited both Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the Minister of Foreign Affairs at 2 PM on the first day to express his gratitude for the goodwill of the friendly nation of Japan, as the signing of the Shanghai International Settlement return agreement was completed on the 30th. He also engaged in various cordial talks, it is said.

### Churchill Predicts Major War Before Autumn, Warns People Against Overly Optimistic

Lisbon, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to London sources, Prime Minister Churchill stated in a speech in London yesterday, predicting that before autumn, there will be major wars in the Mediterranean and elsewhere. The Prime Minister also warned the people not to be overly optimistic, saying, "Military actions are first governed by risk and fate, and should never be overconfident. Any major war on land and sea must be organized over a long period of time, especially wars requiring the cooperation of more than two countries. What I can say today is that before the leaves fall in autumn, there is a high possibility of major wars occurring in the Mediterranean and elsewhere." In his speech, the Prime Minister stated that Britain would never accept any compromise in this war. The Prime Minister also mentioned the losses of Axis submarines in May and said that the ships built by Britain in June had exceeded those sunk by Axis submarines. He also stated that air raids on Germany and Italy would be intensified.

### Axis Powers Still Hold Air Supremacy in the Mediterranean, Significant Obstacle to Anglo-American Invasion of Europe

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency Air Force correspondent Zibelin declared: British Prime Minister Churchill's statement that there would be fierce battles in the Mediterranean and elsewhere before the end of autumn comes at a time when the air war situation in the Mediterranean is changing. When Tunisia was first occupied, there was only a unilateral air offensive launched by Britain and the United States against Italy. But recently, the situation has changed, and the Axis air force has now begun to take the offensive. The difficulties faced today by the Anglo-American forces stationed in North Africa in terms of reinforcement and supply are the same as those previously encountered by the Axis forces. The transport of supplies to the anti-Axis forces in Algiers and Tunisia must pass through the most active area of Axis submarines and aircraft in the western Mediterranean. Fighters provide cover, but they are still frequently sunk by German and Italian aircraft. Since the occupation of Pantelleria Island, a considerable number of Anglo-American ships have been sunk. The loss of these ships indicates that the German and Italian forces hold air supremacy in the Mediterranean, and it is a significant obstacle to Anglo-American plans to invade Europe.

### Gibraltar Port Dynamics, Frequent Ship Traffic

Madrid, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to Maritime News Agency's Larinia dispatch: There is still intense military activity in the port of Gibraltar. Yesterday, a convoy of twenty-five merchant ships left the port and headed towards the Mediterranean. At the same time, another similar convoy arrived from the Atlantic Ocean, all ships fully loaded with military supplies, with approximately one hundred crew members on each ship. The convoy was protected by a strong British fleet. Currently anchored in the port of Gibraltar are the British battleships "Nelson" and "Rodney," the aircraft carrier "Courageous," and twelve British destroyers. Two French destroyers are also present. Yesterday afternoon, three British destroyers and one British submarine arrived at Gibraltar from the Mediterranean.

Madrid, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: According to Algeciras sources: A 12,000-ton cargo ship docked in Gibraltar caught fire yesterday, and the flames could be seen from a distance.

### Netherlands Front, Tension Rises Again, Soviet Attacks Thrice Unsuccessful, Sevastopol Port Becomes Axis Fortress

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: A German News Agency correspondent on the Eastern Front reports: The fighting on the Eastern Front on Tuesday was local in nature. In the Kuban bridgehead area, German grenadiers launched several fierce attacks in the marsh area, completely destroying several Soviet positions. Many Soviet soldiers were captured or killed, and a Soviet reserve counterattack was repelled. The captured positions have been incorporated into the German front line. In the area around the Kuban bridgehead, a Soviet unit attempted to cross the river. However, they were discovered as soon as they launched the attack, and German artillery accurately sank four of their boats. In the Novorossiysk area, a Soviet reconnaissance team advanced under the cover of artificial fog, but was repelled by German mountain troops before they could succeed. On the river near the mouth of the Kuban River, two Soviet motorboats were forced to retreat by German coastal artillery, one of which was hit and caught fire. On the central bank of the Donets River, German artillery effectively bombarded Soviet positions, silencing three Soviet artillery positions. In the central war zone, German artillery bombarded Soviet concentration points near Velikiye Luki and Velizh, forcing the Soviet army to abandon their plans to regroup. In the northern sector, the main activity was German artillery fire. Long-range artillery hit a Soviet supply train, causing it to derail and catch fire. On the Finnish front, Soviet forces launched several attacks on German positions in the Lokhi area. The fighting was fierce, but the Soviet forces failed to break through the German barbed wire obstacles. German heavy weapons inflicted heavy casualties on the Soviet forces, completely annihilating four Soviet companies. Finnish troops also inflicted damage on Soviet forces in the nearby area. Soviet attempts to retake positions lost in recent days were unsuccessful. The Soviet forces attacked three times, abandoning large numbers of dead and wounded before retreating.

Berlin, 1st (Telegram): According to Maritime News Agency, the port of Sevastopol has now become an Axis fortress in the western Black Sea, facing the Kuban bridgehead fortress in the east. The People's Observer newspaper states that the port of Sevastopol has now been restored to its fortress status to prevent the Soviet Union from invading Crimea and Ukraine, and as a springboard to capture the Taman Peninsula.

### Anti-Axis Air Force Atrocities, Cologne Cathedral Destroyed by Bombing, Germans Angered, Vow Retaliation

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: The German News Agency reported yesterday, based on reliable sources: As of May 23, 1943, a total of 133 churches in Germany had been destroyed by bombs, and another 494 had been severely damaged. In Cologne alone, 31 churches have been completely destroyed, some of which have more than a thousand years of history.

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: After the bombing of Cologne Cathedral by the anti-Axis air force, the atrocity of indiscriminate bombing has reached its extreme. The German people are all determined to retaliate. Sources revealed on June 29 that the German side would organize an air force retaliation unit, saying that the Anglo-American belief that indiscriminate bombing could cause the German people to lose their will to fight is a fallacy. The German people are not shaken by their psychological warfare tactics, and their inhuman atrocities have only aroused the indignation of the German people. The national outrage has reached its peak with the bombing of Cologne Cathedral, the most revered church by the German people, on the evening of the 28th.

Rome, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: It was learned here last night that the Syracuse Cathedral in Sicily had been severely damaged by a low-altitude attack by British and American aircraft. The cathedral was built in the 5th century BC, originally as a Doric temple, and was converted into a church in 640 AD.

Pope Expresses Regret to Germany in Telegram

Rome, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: Pope Pius XII sent a telegram to the Holy See in Berlin, expressing his deep concern about the destruction of Cologne Cathedral and instructing the Holy See in Berlin to convey the Pope's condolences to the Cologne Church authorities. After the bombing of Cologne Cathedral, the Vatican's representative in Germany reported the general situation to the Vatican. Once a detailed report of the damage is prepared, it will be submitted to the Holy See. Vatican officials often compare Cologne Cathedral to Milan Cathedral. When Pope Pius XII was still serving as the Holy See in Berlin, he called the cathedral the most precious building of the Church outside of St. Peter's Basilica.

### Evacuation of Women and Children from the Ruhr Area

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) Telegram: Maritime News Agency reports: Red Cross trains have begun evacuating women, children, and the elderly from the Ruhr area.

Each train also has a military kitchen attached, carrying all the necessary food for the entire journey. Evacuees who need baby clothes and feeding bottles can request them from the administrators.

### The Food Problem of Britain and America (2)

Britain

Lloyd George, the British Prime Minister during the First World War, warned the government in 1937: "During the last war, the war front that brought Britain closest to collapse was the food front. Germany, Austria, Bulgaria, and Russia were defeated because of a lack of food. Britain almost fell before they surrendered." However, this warning did not awaken the complacent dream of the British ruling class, who were satisfied with relying on maritime dominance and colonies. After the outbreak of this war, Britain's food policy relied on overseas imports and the maintenance of storage, with domestic food production only used to supplement it or as a backup in case of emergency. This state continued for two years. During this period, although the necessity of increasing domestic food production was repeatedly raised in various forms of proposals, the Chamberlain Cabinet consistently refused to give it serious consideration. They took this war lightly, believing that as long as the British Navy was intact, they could eat food transported from overseas. However, in 1941, the number of ships sunk by submarines increased daily. Due to the expansion of the European front and the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they deeply felt the pain of ship shortages. Britain had no choice but to begin to put all its efforts into increasing domestic food production. The names of Agriculture Minister Peterson and Food Minister Woolton frequently appeared in newspapers.

However, for British agriculture, which had been treated as a stepchild by profit-seeking capitalism for a century and was declining daily, it would be a miracle if it could suddenly recover the productivity needed for this great war. In the past two years, Britain had only prepared militarily and was still dreaming about increasing food production. This miracle will not be realized for the time being.

Britain's first major production increase measure was the land development plan. Therefore, a development incentive fund was used to dispatch the so-called "agricultural army" to various places, and the prices of agricultural products were raised to guarantee agricultural profits. As a result, according to official statistics, the cultivated area increased from 13 million acres in 1939 to 18 million acres in 1942. That is, during these four years, the cultivated land was expanded by five million acres. The area of cultivated land in Britain had been decreasing since 1871, falling from 18 million acres to 13 million acres in 1939. The current expansion is only a restoration of the original state, and cannot be said to be a large increase. However, the population during this period increased from 26 million to 46 million, and most of Britain's cultivated land is used to cultivate feed for livestock and other purposes. For example, in 1939, only 28% was used for cultivating grains. Moreover, of the total value of British agricultural products, 270 million pounds, seven-tenths were livestock and livestock-related agricultural products, and most of the feed for livestock was also imported from foreign countries. A certain British economic theorist once lamented: "British agriculture is a small business, and British farmers have forgotten farming."

The government is now catching up, expanding the wheat cultivation area. It is planned to expand the new wheat cultivation area by 600,000 acres this year, and 1 million acres are planned for expansion this year. Whether British agriculture can adapt to this new situation is a major question.

The second major production increase measure is to promote agricultural mechanization. The total number of tractors before the war was said to be 52,000, and now it has increased to 120,000. However, no matter how much mechanization is promoted, there is doubt as to whether the foundation of British agriculture has the conditions to utilize these machines. From the perspective of the whole, British agriculture is a large capitalist enterprise with more than a million people participating in production. The internal structure and the level of technology are still underdeveloped departments in Britain. Most of the farms are operated by those with less than 50 acres, and 85% are small operators with less than 150 acres. These small operations average three to four agricultural laborers, use low-level technology, have no access to financing, and are completely dominated by large landowners such as churches and bankers. Therefore, even if the number of tractors is greatly increased and the prices of agricultural products are raised, and it is boasted that "if there is mass production, there will be more than enough," these small operations do not seem to be interested.

### North China Relief Association Held Regular Meeting Yesterday

The Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association held its fifth executive committee meeting at 4 PM yesterday in the auditorium of the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce. Those in attendance included Wen Lanshi, Yuan Lvdeng, Li Sihao, Lin Kanghou, Sun Mingqi, Guo Shun, Zhuang Yunqing, Chen Binhe, Xiang Kangyuan, Li Tianzhen, Chen Dongbai, etc. Yuan Lvdeng chaired the meeting.

Chairman's Report

First, the chairman reported on the donation situation for the past week (from June 25 to June 30), and the fundraising progress in various circles. The association has now received a total of RMB 4,525,098.30 in donations (according to reports from various collecting banks).

Discussion of Proposals

The discussion of various proposals then began, including: (1) For the venues of various charity sales and performances, the association will send personnel to supervise the copying of the accounts. Whether the venues have turned in all the funds to the designated collecting bank and how to verify and organize the matter for a resolution. It was resolved: Send a letter to the venues of the various charity sales and performances, requesting them to report the receipt number of the funds turned in to the bank to the association, and to urge them to quickly settle any uncollected funds. (2) Previously, the association notified the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Chamber of Commerce to forward letters to various guilds to encourage donations for emergency relief. Apart from a few reports to the association, the rest should be re-emailed for a resolution. It was resolved: Send a letter to the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and the Joint Chamber of Commerce to request them to find ways to expedite the collection. (3) Whether the association should set up a procurement team for the purchase of food to be solely responsible for the procurement, for a resolution. An explanation was attached: The purchase of miscellaneous grains was previously referred to the Joint Chamber of Commerce to handle through the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Guild. However, the process of repeated requests and entreaties not only wasted time, but also failed to assign responsibility, which would be more effective if a procurement team were added. It is proposed to appoint a leader from the Miscellaneous Grain Industry to take charge, which is easy and efficient. Whether this is feasible is submitted for a resolution. It was resolved: To postpone the establishment, and to appoint two design committee members to take charge of procurement and transportation.

Buddhist Association Fundraising

The Buddhist Association and other organizations in this city responded to the North China drought relief efforts by establishing the Shanghai Buddhist North China Drought Charity Relief Association on June 8 to plan for relief. After deciding on a fundraising target of 600,000 yuan, donations were enthusiastic, but the amount still fell far short of the target. It is still necessary for Buddhists in this city to continue their efforts to recognize donations and solicit donations based on the principles of compassion and generosity, so as to gather more strength, so that the disaster victims in North China can receive more benefits. In addition to the Jing'an Temple office, the association's collection point also has the Jinkang Bank on Museum Road as an agent for collection.

Shen Bao Cup Charity Donation

The Shen Bao Cup North China charity donation received by this newspaper yesterday included: the Shanghai Chinese and Foreign Department Store Industry Association: 1,000 yuan, Ding Jiwan: 400 yuan, for a total of 1,400 yuan in reserve certificates. The remaining balance is 192,500 yuan.

### Prosecutor's Office Changed to Procuratorate, Shanghai Court Ordered to Handle

All Chief Prosecutor titles have been changed to Chief Procurator. Those belonging to the urban area are called the Shanghai Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Ma Chang. The French Concession is called the Second Special District Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Shen Wenjie. The International Settlement is called the First Special District Local Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Zhang Zongru. At the same time, the Shanghai Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Court also divided the procuratorial powers. The International Settlement is called the Second Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Hu Yigu. The French Concession is called the Third Branch of the Jiangsu Higher Procuratorate, Chief Procurator Shen Wenjie.

### Wang Weisheng Takes Over as Shanghai Postal Administration Director

### Grain Procurement and Sales Office Ordered to Close and Hand Over

It is learned that after the office was ordered to close, it has submitted all documents to the Ministry of Food and handed them over to the Shanghai Office for handling.

### Fourth Phase Oil for Both Settlements to be Sold Soon, Special Sugar Allotments to be Distributed Continuously

The fourth phase of oil sold by household based on house donation tickets in both settlements and the northern districts has been processed for pick-up by the Edible Oil Wholesale Office. A portion has been distributed to the various oil firms and then to the various retail oil shops, and is expected to be sold soon within days. The quantity, price, and methods are the same as the previous phase.

In addition, the fourth phase of household sugar in this city began to be sold universally on the 26th of last month, with a deadline of the 7th of this month. As for the special allotments of sugar required by various industries for business purposes, they have also been distributed successively. However, due to procedural relationships, businesses in various industries must immediately process the exchange of vouchers, pay the money, and pick up the goods after receiving the notification slip from the office. A burlap bag fee of 100 yuan per bag must also be paid.

### Public Concession: Review of Administrative Structure

The Shanghai Public Concession. Initially, during the period of Land Regulations, it was a British concession. Based on the Land Regulations, a public concession administrative structure was organized. The following is a comparison between its administration and that of the concession after the Greater East Asia War:

Municipal Council

The highest administrative organ of the Public Concession was the Municipal Council. In the past, it was composed of fourteen members, divided by nationality as follows: five Chinese, five British, two American, and two Japanese. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American representatives have completely withdrawn. Now, it consists of three Chinese, three Japanese, one German, and one Swiss member. In the past, Britain, with five council members, often controlled the position of the chairman of the Municipal Council. Important positions within the Public Works Department (工部局) have also been entirely occupied by Britons for a century. Regarding the administration of the concession, the British and Americans consistently engaged in fierce struggles when their interests clashed. However, the British often prevailed, so the administration of the concession was completely dominated by British intentions, and the Public Works Department (工部局) almost became a British administrative organ. Most noteworthy is the issue of the Land Regulations. According to the revised provisions, approval was required from the diplomatic corps and the Chinese government. However, a supplement to the Land Regulations stipulated that it did not require approval from the Chinese government; only approval from the consular body or diplomatic corps and the foreign taxpayers' meeting was needed for the Municipal Council to arbitrarily decide and implement. This supplement not only had the same effect as the Land Regulations but also had a significant impact on the lives of ordinary citizens. Although the regulations provided for a system of supervision by the ratepayers' meeting over the powers of the Municipal Council, in reality, very few people attended the ratepayers' meeting, and those who did were not enthusiastic about the matters discussed, resulting in the Municipal Council's autocratic administrative power, which was difficult for the public to bear at the time.

Specialized Committees

To fully implement matters under its administration, the Municipal Council could appoint committee members at any time from among the council members whom it deemed appropriate, thus establishing specialized committees. These committees were divided into the Finance Committee, Personnel Committee, Public Works Committee, Health Committee, Education Committee, etc. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, committees such as the Civil Defense Committee, Industrial and Social Welfare Committee, Baojia Committee (保甲委員會), and Materials Control Committee were also established, fully utilizing their functions.

Public Works Department (工部局)

Under the control of the Municipal Council: The Public Works Department (工部局) was responsible for executing practical affairs. Its administrative affairs were originally limited to the construction of concession roads, the design of buildings and public gardens, etc. Later, it gradually decided to manage administrative affairs in various aspects. Fearing suspicion from the Chinese people if it changed its name to something resembling the management of all administration, it still retains the name of Public Works Department (工部局). Before the war, the Public Works Department (工部局) had about seven thousand employees, of which about one thousand were foreigners. Senior members were mostly British and American. According to the Land Regulations, the Public Works Department (工部局) was under the control of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, but in reality, it was a trinity of power, consisting of the Chairman of the Municipal Council, the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, and the Director of the General Affairs Bureau. The heads of each department were British, thus losing the meaning of a public concession and almost completely becoming a British concession.

Taxpayers' Meeting

The Taxpayers' Meeting was the decision-making body for the concession administration. Its employees had to have certain qualifications and had the right to elect members of the Municipal Council. However, the qualifications for being elected as a member of the Municipal Council or for being a taxpayer were considered inappropriate, requiring wealth. As a result, more than half of the council members were British and American, subject to the supervision of the consular body and diplomatic countries. In fact, the concession authorities in the past acted completely independently. The above is an overview of the Shanghai Public Concession. Therefore, it is no exaggeration to say that the Shanghai Concession of the past was a British overseas relationship. From this, it is not difficult to imagine how they used the concession as a base to exploit China. Therefore, the concession was indeed a major stain on China's history for a century, but now Japan has first settled the unequal treaties imposed on China by the enemy Britain and America and returned the concession to China.

Economic Circle Translated Articles

### Comprehensive Economic Measures

Since the implementation of Japan's new policy towards China, the work of establishing China's autonomous economic institutions has proceeded quite smoothly and has already achieved considerable results. The organizations of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) and the Foodstuffs Cooperative Association (食糧聯營社), etc., have also been reorganized. In the near future, epoch-making progress can be expected. However, we still cannot help but worry about this, frankly speaking, fearing that these organizations and their activities may fall into the danger of isolation.

To cite specific facts, for example, in order to smoothly operate the Commercial Control Association (商統會) organization and fully exert its performance, it must at least maintain full coordination with various measures of financial control. If the policies of the two lack connection, then the organization of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) will still not be effective.

The operation of purchasing organizations and distribution organizations must also be closely linked. If purchasing is the responsibility of the purchasing organization and distribution is the responsibility of the distribution organization, this mechanical approach will not achieve great results. If the exchange of resources is so difficult, then the release of materials must be even more cautious. Is there such preparation in the current purchasing and distribution relationship? No material, even a piece of cloth, should be released casually without a relationship. From this point of view, the integration of purchasing and distribution must be given serious consideration. (Excerpt from Da Zhong Xin Bao 大降新報)

### Examination Committee for Workers to Japan Established, Realizing Sino-Japanese Human Resources Exchange

In order to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War and implement Sino-Japanese human resources exchange, people from the Sino-Japanese business community in this city have specially organized the Examination Committee for Workers to Japan. The Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, Japanese Chamber of Commerce, Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce, Continental News (大陸新報), and Shen Bao (申報) five groups jointly organized the examination affairs for Chinese technical workers to Japan. After a long period of preparation, the committee was established. The committee members include Wen Lanting (聞蘭亭), Yuan Ludeng (袁履登), Lin Kanghou (林康侯), Chen Shaowei (陳紹嬀), Chen Riping (陳日平), Wu Huanru (吳桓如), and Chen Binhe (陳彬龢) on the Chinese side, and Aoki Setsu, Takeuchi Fumin, Funatsu Tatsuichi, Hata Hiroshi, Komuro Takeo, Osaka Yoichi, and Yoshida Toyu on the Japanese side, all of whom are well-known figures in the business community of this city. Regarding the examination of technicians, the committee stipulates three important principles:

(1) Anyone who volunteers to work in Japan must pass a technical examination and a physical examination.

(2) The minimum living expenses for family members (based on the price level of the place of residence) will be paid by the Chinese commercial bank designated by the committee twice a month.

(3) When people go abroad, the insurance company established in China designated by the committee will provide insurance for them.

Currently, the first phase of the committee is mainly recruiting skilled carpenters and apprentices who volunteer to learn carpentry (details will be published in various newspapers tomorrow). The office is temporarily located on the fourth floor of the Xingya Building (興亞大樓) at 12 Bund, Shanghai Federation of Industry and Commerce.

### Two Cultural Groups Telegraph Congratulations on the Return of the Concession

To Chairman Wang Jingwei (汪精衛) of the Nanjing National Government: We are delighted to learn that our friendly nation, Japan, has returned the Shanghai Public Concession and has already signed an agreement with our government. After hearing the news, we are extremely excited. For a hundred years, Britain and America have used the concession as a base to deprive us of our rights and restrict our freedom, which we speak of with hatred. Now, our friendly nation, Japan, in addition to expelling the aggressive forces of Britain and America, has also returned the concession, showing its deep respect for our country's independence and autonomy. Your leadership and struggle are particularly admired. We will certainly strive from now on, work together, and complete our mission.

In order to prevent accidents, the Baojia authorities (保甲當局) of the French Concession have recently notified the heads of households within the concession that they should strictly handle the procedures for applying for and reporting changes in the population within the household, and ordered the heads of households to conduct investigations. Whether the household registration of tenants (attached households) is consistent. If there are false reports by the attached households, the head of household should be responsible for urging them to voluntarily report to the police station. If they do not accept the advice, the head of household should immediately report them to the authorities; otherwise, the head of household will be subject to joint punishment.

### The Fifth Shen Bao Scholarship: Many Students Apply, Current Funds Insufficient, Hope for Continued Donations from All Sectors

Yesterday was the first day for the distribution of application forms for students of all levels for the fifth Shen Bao Scholarship. Students of all levels braved the light rain and came to collect application forms with the hope of continuing their studies. In total, there were more than 1,000 former students who had received scholarships from this newspaper, and more than 2,000 new students who applied for the first time. This year, the number of students applying for scholarships is expected to exceed 10,000. Judging from the existing funds of this newspaper, it can only help 2,000 people, which is still insufficient. This makes it difficult for the staff of this newspaper to allocate the funds. Therefore, we must once again appeal to people from all walks of life, hoping that they will continue the spirit of the past, cultivate talents, and donate more so that the scholarship work of this newspaper can proceed smoothly and reduce the suffering of poor students who cannot afford to go to school.

### Western Doctor Files Lawsuit, Seeking Recovery of Surgery Fee, Operation Performed Without Defendant's Consent

Western doctors Czech Korlich and Italian Mi Yeli, through their lawyers, filed a lawsuit in the Civil Court of the Second Special Court against Zhou Yuzuying (周郁祖英), a 33-year-old local woman residing in Room 15, 2nd Floor, 652 Avenue Joffre (霞飛路), seeking to recover medical expenses of 5,500 yuan. Yesterday, during the hearing, the plaintiff's lawyer stated that the defendant's husband, Zhou Hanliang (周漢良), was hospitalized at Dahua Hospital (大華醫院) in February of this year due to intestinal disease and underwent surgery by the plaintiffs. As a result of the severity of the illness, he died, and the defendant refused to pay the outstanding surgery fee, for which they requested full recovery. The defendant Zhou Yuzuying, represented by Yan Yingwu (嚴英武) and Sun Qimin (孫其敏), argued that the plaintiffs did not determine the condition of the defendant's husband through X-ray diagnosis and performed the operation without authorization, resulting in an accident. Moreover, the defendant's consent was not obtained beforehand, and the two plaintiffs were clearly negligent in their work. They should have filed a criminal lawsuit against the two plaintiffs. Because once reported, an exhumation and autopsy would be necessary, causing unrest to the deceased, the defendant was unwilling to file a lawsuit. As for the surgery fee claimed by the plaintiffs, the defendant did not agree to it and should not be responsible. The court ordered the debate to end and set a date for sentencing.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force Reporting Minister Samon's Inaugural Remarks

The Reporting Minister of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, Samon (三品), has issued the following inaugural remarks:

I have been appointed to the position of Reporting Minister of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China. As I am a soldier, I hope that everyone will provide guidance and assistance in the future.

From the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, the handling of the mainland problem is not only a major undertaking for China and Japan, but also the largest undertaking in the Greater East Asia region.

The unification and construction of the new China is a major key to completing the Greater East Asia War, and it is also a decisive initiative for the future of the world war. If our Japanese initiative in the war of force and China's great power in the war of politics are integrated with the innovative and historical concepts of the Greater East Asia, I believe that the truly glorious "Orient" will surely appear in the brilliant posture of world history.

The new treaty that has unfolded before our eyes in recent times is the foundation for establishing an eternal and unchanging moral spirit between China and Japan, and I am convinced that this new treaty is an immortal "world charter" that points the new direction for the history of all mankind. I hereby express my full gratitude and look forward to the people of China joining us to usher in that glorious day.

### The Financial Industry Values Production: Implements Low-Interest Loans

Since the National Government announced the implementation of the wartime economic policy program, the internal organizational structure of the National Commercial Control Association (全國商業統制總會), the joint association committees of various industries, and the control mechanisms of trade associations have been largely completely adjusted and are ready to begin the autonomous control work of commerce immediately. It is understood that in addition to focusing on the control system of collection, distribution, transportation, and sales, the association also emphasizes how to increase production. Currently, various financial institutions in this city, under the guidance of the Central Reserve Bank of China, are striving to invest in agricultural loans. The interest rate issue for production funds allows production enterprises to fully develop. It is heard that recently, the interest rate for wheat loans released by the Central Reserve Bank to the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications is 7%, while the interest rate released by the Central Bank and the Bank of Communications is 8%. In addition, the Bank of Communications' agricultural loans, which belong to the agricultural development banks under a certain percentage, and for individuals developing agriculture, are generally around 1.2%, which is much lower than the market interest rate. It is expected that there will be significant gains in agricultural production in the future.

### National Economic Council Decides to Establish Economic Research Institute, Setting Up Five Working Groups

The proposal to strengthen national savings and establish an economic research institute, passed by the Second Plenary Session of the National Economic Council (全國經濟委員會), is a comprehensive economic survey work. At the juncture of implementing the wartime economic policy program, it is particularly important work. Therefore, the National Economic Council is actively preparing to carry out the organization, which can be realized in the shortest possible time. It is understood that the main task of the institute is to lead public and private economic survey research institutions, scholars, and experts to conduct surveys and research on the national economic situation according to certain guidelines. The organizational system, under the director and deputy director, in addition to a deliberation committee and a secretary-general, is divided into five groups: finance group, transportation group, agriculture and mining group, industry and commerce group, and food group, to manage all survey and research work. It is also said that it can entrust groups or individuals to investigate.

### The Shanghai Economy After the Return of the Concession: Mr. Inagaki's Talk

Inagaki Noboru (稻垣登), Director of the Materials Control Department of the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, recently gave a speech on the topic of "The Return of the Concession and the Future of the Shanghai Economy." The main points are as follows: 1. Since the return of the Public Concession, the government's economic policies can be implemented more smoothly, and at the same time, China's wartime economic system can be quickly strengthened and promoted. 2. In the past, the legal power of the Public Works Department was very weak, so the guiding policies of the Chinese and Japanese authorities had the regret of scratching an itch from outside the boot. After the return of the Concession, this regret can be completely eliminated. 3. From other aspects, the abnormal prosperity of the Concession has gradually subsided. The so-called war profiteering color has disappeared, but it is a big mistake to say that this is a phenomenon of the decline of the concession economy. It is actually an inevitable phenomenon of transition to sound prosperity. After the return of the Concession, the previous semi-free economy will be reformed. In fact, today is the best time for reform, which is expected of the decision-makers and the awakening of economic people. 4. The relationship between the Commercial Control Association (商統會) and the municipal government is very close, so if it does not receive the protection and assistance of the municipal government, the policies of the Commercial Control Association (商統會) cannot achieve full results. The matter is obvious. 5. The return of the Concession has no adverse effects on the people. Measures such as the food problem, price control problem, and the distribution of people's livelihood materials can be thoroughly promoted, so it can be said that it will improve even more. 6. In short, if there are politicians with the correct understanding of the above ideas and economic people who actively devote themselves to public welfare, working together in harmony, Shanghai can be built brightly.

### Rice and Grain Cooperative Starts Work Yesterday

### Osaka Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds 11th Regular General Meeting of Councilors, President Aoki Delivers Speech

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry in Shanghai held its 11th Regular General Meeting of Councilors on the 30th at the Japanese Club. First, President Aoki delivered a speech, followed by the commencement of business discussions. The Secretariat then reported on the outline of business operations for the previous year and the summary of the financial accounts. The original plan for the disposal of the previous year's surplus was also approved. The content of President Aoki's speech is recorded below:

Looking back on the past year, not only were Sino-Japanese relations what they were, but China itself, or the Chamber of Commerce and Industry, experienced a year of so-called repeated turmoil and many changes. Regarding Sino-Japanese economic relations, the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry on November 1st last year and the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China on January 9th this year, and the subsequent establishment of a new economic policy towards China, are worthy of significant mention. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry aimed to unify the multi-headed nature of imperial institutions in China and to realize the centralization of policy implementation. Needless to say, it also hoped to resolve obstacles in Sino-Japanese relations, especially in the economic sphere, to establish the natural relationship between China and Japan, and it was a precursor to the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China on January 9th this year. This is a historically significant fact. The comprehensive adjustment of Sino-Japanese relations began on January 9th this year with the major shift in Japan's diplomacy towards China, marking the first step towards realization. In the economic sphere, the new economic policy, centered on the National Commercial Control Association and the soon-to-be-realized China Trade Federation, is being concretely promoted. According to Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet on the 15th of this month, the Japanese government plans to take further steps to fundamentally revise the Sino-Japanese Treaty. This, along with the upcoming return of the Shanghai International Settlement, serves as clear evidence of the imminent leap forward in Sino-Japanese relations. All of these developments were unimaginable a year ago. Such heroic and grand policies have a profound impact on politics, economy, diplomacy, culture, and China policy, as well as direct and indirect effects on Japanese residents in China. As we are all well aware, we in the business community are determined not to make sacrifices in establishing a new Sino-Japanese relationship and will actively complete national policies. It must be particularly emphasized that the shift in Japan's diplomatic and economic policies towards China, which has been gradually unfolding since January this year, does not mean that Japan is retreating from China. Its purpose is to establish a permanent system of coexistence and co-prosperity between China and Japan, not an economic retreat from China. The goal of Japan's transformation of its economic policy towards China is to revitalize China's economy and establish a new Chinese economic system to realize common ideals. To understand the current economic situation in China and the true future state of the Chinese economy, two key elements are necessary: First, it must be clearly recognized that China's economy, with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War as a turning point, has shifted in qualitative terms from a trading China to a producing China, and at the same time, it has had to shift from dependence on the economies of Europe and America to the East Asian Co-prosperity Economic Sphere. Second, China, which has long been called a quasi-colony of Europe and America, has been deeply dependent on Europe and America economically, but now this has been completely severed. Therefore, its own industrial revolution, and the changes that promote industrial revolution, are the only paths. This inevitability should also be clearly recognized. Unless the concept of industrial revolution is followed, China's economic self-sufficiency and the modernization of the Chinese national economy cannot be achieved. Therefore, Japan's various economic policies towards China and in China after the diplomatic transformation are carefully planned to fit this grand goal, and at the same time, they must be promoted in accordance with this direction. If we briefly describe the direction of the new economic policy, at least the following points are noteworthy: First, first establish the common goal of building the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. Second, leap from the confrontational and antagonistic character that has been extremely prone to disputes to the path of collaboration and cooperation. Third, thoroughly recognize that the revival of China's economy is the basis for Sino-Japanese co-prosperity, especially the active cooperation of the Shanghai financial community, the nerve center of the Chinese economy. This is an indispensable requirement. Fourth, the transformation of the new economic policy, which is sufficient to meet the above requirements, is possible not only from the moral and political aspects, but also from the economic aspect. China and Japan have reached a consensus. This principle is not purely theoretical. The organization and practice of the National Commercial Control Association, the concrete expression of the new economic policy towards China, have already been put into practice. This is a common requirement in all economic fields such as finance, industry, commerce, trade, and agriculture, and at the same time, it is a requirement for political and diplomatic aspects. In a sense, it also includes military requirements. This is an important principle that cannot be ignored when implementing economic policies towards China. When revitalizing the new Chinese economy, the above principles and the industrial revolutionary nature of the Chinese economy must be clearly recognized. This is the greatest basic requirement for revitalizing the Chinese economy. Shanghai is the central nerve of the Chinese economy. If Shanghai's economy cannot be revived, then the revival of the Chinese economy is hopeless. Therefore, building Shanghai's economy can be called revitalizing the entire Chinese economy, and it is no exaggeration. Recently, this Chamber of Commerce and Industry established the Economic Shanghai Construction Committee. Relying on the cooperation of everyone and authorities from all walks of life, we are actively examining it. This committee, together with the Sino-Japanese Problem Committee and the Japanese Business Countermeasures Committee, is working as a trinity to build the Shanghai economy. The reason for this is because the national construction of the Shanghai economy is so important. Shifting our gaze beyond China, the internal and external situations are extremely significant. In Japan alone, we are continuing to fight bloody battles to establish an invincible and undefeated posture. The actual situation is fully expressed by various decisive economic policies, the 81st Decisive Battle Diet held in the spring, and the currently convened 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. Japan's decisive economic policy is concentrated on the five major industries of iron, coal, light metals, ships, and aircraft, laying a solid foundation. As everyone knows, this strong Japanese decisive economic system is increasingly entering the iron wall of preparation due to the "Enterprise Consolidation Funding Measures Law" passed by the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet. According to Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi's explanation in the Diet, the enterprise consolidation stipulated in the law is different in nature from the enterprise consolidation taken in the past due to insufficient materials. This time's enterprise consolidation is actually "enterprise consolidation implemented due to increased production capacity." Therefore, this consolidation is not like the previous consolidation, which only focused on the reorganization and integration of light industry. It extends to the required parts of all fields of industry. Each required industry will be classified according to its nature into startup, maintenance, transfer, suspension, and abandonment in order to achieve the following purposes and complete sufficient preparation: (1) Transfer of equipment, (2) Distribution of labor to important industries, (3) Recovery of scrap iron. This is an unavoidable requirement to strike down England and America. At this time, an important event for us in the Shanghai financial community is that this kind of enterprise adjustment in Japan also has a major relationship with the Chinese economy. According to Minister of Commerce and Industry Kishi's explanation in the Diet: "China is currently focusing on the restoration and replenishment of cotton mills in China. In addition, the second and third transfers of retained equipment are also being actively promoted." That is, the transfer of light industry to China is currently being actively planned. Under the Sino-Japanese comprehensive plan, a new era of building a new Chinese economy has finally arrived. We in the Shanghai financial community deeply feel that our mission and responsibility are becoming increasingly important. Japan's decisive battle economy is now moving towards an invincible system. Furthermore, under the comprehensive economic cooperation between China and Japan, the progress of Shanghai's economic construction can be expected. Under great power, relying on the wise strategy and bravery of the imperial army soldiers, and the firm unity of 100 million citizens, Japan is increasingly establishing an invincible and undefeated solid陣. We, the people, can only express our gratitude. At the same time, we express our heartfelt gratitude to the heroic spirits who died for the country and the soldiers of the imperial army, and vow to take the hearts of the soldiers on the front line as our own, and to work even harder to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation in order to complete the important task of the current situation.

### The Popular Literature We Need

— Dongfang

Our country's literature has moved from difficult and obscure classical Chinese to easy-to-understand vernacular Chinese, which has spread literature to all classes. Originally, it was inevitable that popular literature would have a large number of readers, because most readers are middle and lower classes with relatively low knowledge. Writing in a profound and obscure way can only be studied and savored by a few people, while easy-to-understand writing is what the masses welcome.

How can we define easy-to-understand? To determine this standard, we must first see what is being written, and we cannot decide in general terms. For example, if it is a literary work, then we must use "literature" to set the standard for easy understanding. Literary creation is entirely a concrete and vivid description of images. Here, we must abandon those unclear fantasies, abandon those distorted morbid psychologies, and not use profound and abstract terms. We must be realistic and directly and clearly express reality. In literary creation, being able to do this can generally achieve the goals of "easy to understand" and popularization.

Theoretical articles are more difficult. Here, the application of various difficult academic terms and new terms cannot be avoided. Moreover, the purpose of theoretical articles is to instill some theories in readers, some universal laws that run through the roots of individual events, and correct concepts and correct terms are needed. Therefore, it is impossible to avoid using various difficult academic and new terms.

There may be authors who deliberately use new terms to show off novelty, but this is not very common. Most people still seem unable to fully utilize them, resulting in the terms becoming rigid and difficult to understand. To write a theoretical article in a popular and simple way does not mean abandoning the application of all terms. We should strive to utilize terms, which is the correct path. Because the purpose of popularization is not only to make the public understand, but also to instill in the public some richer knowledge and scientific literacy, and to improve the level of the public. Therefore, the popular literature we need: in terms of creation, we must boldly and clearly write about reality, avoid unnecessary fantasies and descriptions, and avoid the application of abstract terms; and when writing theoretical articles, we must utilize terms, use simple explanations, and make them vivid and easy to understand.

### Grasp the Present

— Jieying

In this current period, everyone feels that the present life is too difficult. So many people recall the past. Everything in the past is very beautiful and very sweet in their minds; at the same time, many people are dreaming about the future, dreaming that the future will bring them happiness.

However, "the past cannot be chased, and the future cannot be relied upon." What is the use of recalling and dreaming? Everything in the past has become the past, and the past will never return to the present. And where is the future? And what is the basis for believing that the future will definitely bring happiness?

The future is embodied in the present, the present moment. Seconds gradually become the past, and the seconds of the future are gradually coming to the present. The past is over, dead; and what about the future? The future is alive, but it is also empty. Only this present is real, is true. If we want to be happy, if we want to be happy, memories and dreams cannot provide us with anything. Only the present. Only by working hard in the present can we create happiness.

### Thinking and Doing

— Wentian

There must be a close connection between "thinking" and "doing". They cannot be separated too far. Just "thinking" without "doing" is close to "dreaming"; just "doing" without "thinking" will lead to "recklessness". "Dreaming" and "recklessness" cannot achieve any cause.

The "brain" must be clear and the "hands" must be diligent and conscientious, each fulfilling their duties and cooperating harmoniously. Any difficult problem can be broken through and success can be achieved.

If one acts and behaves with the public interest as a prerequisite and one's own conscience as a guide, one will not do evil, reverse black and white, and be spurned by others.

Do not despise others, and do not take others too seriously. Do not boast about oneself, and do not underestimate oneself.

Put success or failure aside, stand tall, have nothing to be ashamed of, be courageous and not hesitate, then there is nothing that cannot be done in the world.

### Review of "Song of Rejuvenation"

— Luguang

It is a great honor to see the performance of "Song of Rejuvenation." In the barren art world, this is a good harvest. From "Song of Rejuvenation," we can clearly know that Chinese films have a bright future, because the old ones are old and useless, but the new ones? Truly, "the younger generation is to be feared."

"Song of Rejuvenation" tells the story of an artist's experience in the theater movement from beginning to end. It has reality, so under the extremely strong human touch, every scene deeply touches the hearts of the audience. The second half, starting from Liu Qiong's drunken foot-dragging, shows even more clearly the plight of the pitiful artist. Unfortunate!

There are plays within the play, with "Camellia," "Romeo and Juliet," and "Song of Rejuvenation" performed on the stage of a drama. Because the actors have experience in stage plays, the excellence of the performance is the most exciting part of the whole film. At the same time, the editing is concise, with no dragging.

If we were to find shortcomings, then the ending needs to be discussed. Because the film is ultimately a work of art, it cannot excessively cater to "business." Happy endings and other things have disappeared in the progress of the times.

Liu Jian's acting skills are impeccable. Hu Feng has also broken previous records. Tian Jun hopes he will work harder! The scenery and lighting can all be rated highly.

### Random Notes from the Film City

"Love Threads in a Singing Gown" went to Hangzhou last month on the 27th to shoot outdoor scenes. Mei Xi, Tong Zhiling, and others made a large and imposing group, adding a lot of color to West Lake. After the start of filming for "New Life," the work is extremely tense. Director Gao Lihong works day and night, and assistant director Yuan Lei became ill due to being too busy.

Yue Feng's new work, "Life and Death Robbery," has already passed the script and began to build sets in the First Studio on the 25th. Filming officially began on the 28th. The male and female leads were originally planned to be Gao Zhanfei and Yuan Meiyun, but now that Gao Yuan has another new work, it has been changed to a collaboration between Shu Shi and Hu Feng.

Zhu Shilin's work after "Good Night, Flowers and Moonlight" is "Second Generation". The male and female leads have been decided as Liu Qiong, Lv Yukun, Yan Jun, etc. Recently, Zhu Shilin is rushing to write the script and will start filming in the Fourth Studio after "New Life."

He Zhaozhang's new work, "Peach Blossom Pool Water," has already started filming in the Second Studio. The main actors are Zhou Manhua, Yan Hua, and Xu Li.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

"I definitely won't! I've worked so hard to raise it until today, and it's just starting to lay eggs. I won't!" Xiu Bao shouted resolutely.

"Damn it! No way! Our commander wants to eat chicken, how can we disobey! Don't even mention eating your chicken, we can take your lives, and you can't disobey! Hurry! Hurry! Don't delay my official business!" This little fellow in gray cloth said bluntly that he had to have it.

"Please take care of us, sir! It's our laying hen. We really rely on it to make a living. I'm willing to give you some of the eggs from our house. Please take care of us, sir!" Ah Kun begged in a pitiful tone. He was determined not to let them take away the chicken that they relied on for a living, insisting and blocking them.

"Okay! If you won't give it, you won't give it! Just wait and see!" The little fellow in gray cloth expressed his displeasure and left.

"Dad! My laying hen. How can we let them eat it for nothing? Tomorrow we'll have four more eggs. I want to save one egg every day. When it stops laying eggs (when the chicken stops laying eggs), I can exchange it for a floral cotton jacket material. I'll have it made and wear it for the New Year, Dad! You'll let me, won't you!" Xiu Bao was relieved and happily chattering to Ah Kun.

"Oh! Okay!" Ah Kun was over fifty years old after all, and he knew a little about the ways of the world. He thought that even though it was said to be peaceful now, "just wait and see" always meant trouble later on. He felt a little uneasy in his heart.

After dinner, Xiu Bao went to bed first. Under the dim light of a lamp, Ah Kun sat at the table and said to his wife, "There are so many ×× teams these days, going back and forth. This time it's Zhang's unit, that time it's Wang's unit. Donations for bedding, donations for shoes and socks, donations for cigarettes, donations for liquor. We country people are exhausted. If they can't eat our chicken today, they'll probably come again tomorrow. What can we say!" Ah Kun's wife listened and didn't understand much, remaining silent and sighing along with him.

Bang! Bang! Bang! Suddenly, there was urgent knocking on the front door of Ah Kun's house, followed by shouts outside the door: "Open the door! Open the door! Hurry!" Ah Kun was very frightened and trembling as he went to open the door. Six or seven people in gray cloth rushed in. The first one was the little fellow who had come to catch the chicken earlier.

"Speak up! Hand it over quickly! You have a gun in your house! A gun! You're no good! You're in league with the communists!" The people who came shouted all at once, chattering noisily. One grabbed Ah Kun's clothes, and then slaps and fists rained down on Ah Kun like raindrops.

"No...no...no gun...I'm a farmer, I wouldn't be in league with the communists!" Ah Kun said tremblingly.

"Take him to the headquarters for questioning. We'll give him a heavy punishment. He's trying to deceive us! Go! Go! Go!" One of the people in gray cloth said this, pointing to the one who was pulling Ah Kun's collar tightly.

"Search the house first! Maybe he hid the gun!" Another said, so two or three of them rushed into Ah Kun's bedroom. But Ah Kun's house was originally bare and empty. There were no clothes or old clothes worth their attention. There was only a silver chain and a silver lock, which Xiu Bao's in-laws had given when they were engaged. They finally appreciated it and took it away.

"Go! Go! Go! Take him to the headquarters for questioning!" So they pulled Ah Kun by his collar and went off in a hubbub. (2)
