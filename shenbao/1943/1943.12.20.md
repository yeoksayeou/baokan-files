### Conserving Electricity

Recently, the two power companies in Central China and Shanghai have, due to difficulties in sourcing coal and in order to practice wartime living, stipulated measures to restrict electricity consumption. We advocate that, apart from production enterprises and social service undertakings that must maintain their minimum electricity needs, the restrictive measures should be thoroughly implemented.

Yesterday, the municipal government of this city also formulated four measures for conserving electricity, to be implemented from January 1 next year. We observe that the four measures formulated by the municipal government are, in principle, absolutely well-intentioned and should be earnestly implemented. We hope that related shops and entertainment venues will start implementing them immediately, without waiting until January 1 next year, and will voluntarily comply with conservation, without the need for forced restrictions. At the same time, we hope that the municipal government will not only formulate conservation measures but also enact restrictive laws, with penalties for violators. We must not only use persuasion to conserve electricity but also enforce it.

Furthermore, regarding the lights-off time in the measures formulated by the municipal government, we believe that it can be advanced further, especially for entertainment venues such as amusement parks, theaters, dance halls, and tea houses. Even if they are not completely abolished during wartime, their hours should be shortened as much as possible. Those who are busy with work during the day must have sufficient rest at night. Although entertainment can reduce and restore fatigue, excessive indulgence will inevitably be mentally and financially draining, and a waste of time. Therefore, restricting the business hours of entertainment venues not only saves electricity but also saves people's energy and money. In this time of war, its significance is even greater.

### Christmas and Winter Relief

The annual Christmas holiday is fast approaching. According to custom, believers will certainly celebrate by exchanging gifts and decorations, and even non-believers who are fashionable will take the opportunity to have fun and party all night. General stores and entertainment venues will be especially creative in attracting customers.

However, this year's situation is different. We know that the Greater East Asia War has entered its third year, and China's participation in the war is approaching its first year. We are getting closer and closer to the decisive stage. In this tense era, we must greet this extraordinary time with extraordinary emotions and actions. All extravagant customs and conventions must not be continued. This year, for Christmas, we hope that believers and non-believers will all abolish customs, not exchange gifts, not revel, and that stores and entertainment venues will also abolish and reduce consumption-inducing business methods to practice the extraordinary life of wartime.

We respect religious freedom, but we also oppose using the holiday to revel and spend lavishly during this extraordinary period.

For this year's Christmas, we would like to propose two things that we hope Christians will implement, and that non-Christians can also implement, in order to jointly express remembrance:

First, to strictly practice thrift and abolish customs, save all the expenses for preparing gifts and entertainment, and donate them to winter relief.

Second, to commemorate Christmas with compassion. During this severe winter, our suffering compatriots are in urgent need of relief. Enthusiastically donate to winter relief, which can relieve the suffering of our compatriots, is the best expression of commemorating Christmas.

They dispatched 14 infantry divisions, two major tank regiments, and one artillery division to fiercely attack German positions, posing a great threat of encirclement. In two days, Soviet troops attacked 34 times, losing as many as 65 tanks. The intensity of the fierce battle is not difficult to imagine. Military experts believe that the focal point of the battle is in the southwest of Nevel, which was originally a line of sight, but has recently formed a winding shape due to mutual advances and retreats. German commanders believe that the southern defenses need to be slightly withdrawn, and after a counterattack in the north, the Germans have made progress. There have been major battles near Keguo, Zhuo, and Cherkassy. The focal point of the battle is north of Kirovograd. The Germans believe that the swift German counterattack has prevented the Soviet army from gaining time to develop its military according to its planned plan.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency) Haisong News Agency reports: Although the forests along the Nevel area hinder the battle, fierce fighting is still ongoing there. German military sources say Soviet troops are using aircraft, artillery, and tanks to assist the offensive, apparently to push back German troops near the highway leading south to Nevel.

### Military Police Clash in Front of the Gong Wu Stage Leads to Bloody Tragedy; Tax Police Regiment Thoroughly Investigates the Truth

A Central News Agency report states that at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday, a clash occurred between military personnel and police in front of the Gong Wu Stage on Great Shanghai Road in the Eighth District of the city, resulting in a bloody tragedy. Ten officers from the Taishan Road Precinct were killed or injured, and the police defense section chief, Ji Jingyang, also died in the line of duty. More than ten soldiers from the Central Tax Police Regiment were also injured. Details of the situation are as follows:

The Main Cause of the Incident Was Provocation

The main cause of the incident was that a portion of the Central Tax Police Regiment, stationed in the South City district, went to the Gong Wu Stage in the Eighth District to watch a play on the 18th. A dispute arose over ticket purchases, almost leading to a major incident. Upon learning of this, the Taishan Road Precinct immediately dispatched a large contingent of police officers to the scene to suppress the situation. They took the offending soldiers to the precinct and subsequently released them. Afterwards, the Tax Police Regiment commander, Luo Junqiang, and deputy commander, Xiong Jiandong, upon learning of the incident, were conducting a thorough investigation. Unexpectedly, a small number of soldiers, feeling aggrieved by their detention, rushed to the Gong Wu Stage at around 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon to provoke a fight, leading to the tragic bloodshed.

Attempt to Suppress Leads to Bloodshed

The soldiers who instigated the trouble were part of the Second Battalion of the Tax Police Regiment. They departed from the South City area at approximately 1:00 PM yesterday afternoon, entered the Eighth District through various iron gates, and gathered in full battle gear in front of the Gong Wu Stage on Great Shanghai Road. They began by surrounding the Gong Wu Stage and dispersing pedestrians. The Taishan Road Precinct received a report and, fearing a worsening situation, sent police defense section chief Ji Jingyang with officers from the reserve squad to attempt to suppress the unrest. However, as soon as the police arrived, the conflict erupted. In an instant, gunshots rang out, and the surrounding area descended into chaos as pedestrians scattered. In a matter of moments, several people lay in pools of blood in front of the Gong Wu Stage. Twenty minutes before the tragedy, Zhang Shankun, the manager of the Gong Wu Stage, noticed soldiers loitering near the entrance and, sensing something amiss, immediately called Deputy Commander Xiong Jiandong. Xiong, upon learning this, immediately drove to the Gong Wu Stage with five guards, attempting to prevent the incident. However, as soon as Xiong's vehicle arrived, the shooting started, and he was unable to stop it.

Both Military and Police Suffered Casualties

After the incident, shops near the Gong Wu Stage, unaware of the true situation, closed their doors and ceased operations. The Taishan Road Precinct immediately dispatched ambulances to transport those lying in the blood to Guangci Hospital for treatment. A total of five police officers were killed at the scene, two were arrested, and several were injured. Stray bullets injured two passersby. Ji Jingyang, the police defense section chief of the Taishan Precinct, who was about thirty years old, unfortunately died in the line of duty. It is reported that Ji had been married only recently and left behind an elderly mother and a weak wife. The tragedy is especially devastating. On the Tax Police Regiment side, ten soldiers were also injured and were immediately sent to the Central Police Hospital for treatment by the Tax Police Regiment. A Central News Agency reporter learned from the Taishan Road Precinct yesterday that the police officers killed were numbers 125, 56, 833, 220, and 121. The two officers arrested were numbers 52 and 15. Although the other injured officers were being treated, half of them sustained severe injuries.

Municipal Authorities Issue Statement

The municipal authorities issued a statement regarding the military-police clash in the Eighth District yesterday: "The previous evening, soldiers from the Tax Police Regiment went to the Gong Wu Stage to watch a play. A minor dispute arose over ticket purchases and seating arrangements. Efforts to resolve the matter at the police station were unsuccessful, leading a few troublemakers to take advantage of the situation. They gathered their comrades on the occasion of their regular Sunday leave, using the pretext of military drills to bring weapons and provoke a fight. At that time, Zhang Shankun, the manager of the Gong Wu Stage, invited Xiong Jiandong, the deputy commander of the Tax Police Regiment, to personally suppress the situation, but the disaster had already begun. The soldiers, both military and police, who died or were injured, are estimated to be about ten each. Two passersby were injured, which is extremely unfortunate. However, this incident originated from provocation and has no other implications. The police immediately intervened to block traffic and stop the violence, and order was restored after one hour. The soldiers who caused the trouble will be punished according to the law."

Tax Police Authorities Issue Statement

The Tax Police headquarters issued a statement regarding the military-police clash in the Eighth District yesterday: "Regarding the incident in which soldiers from our regiment caused a major misunderstanding due to the purchase of tickets for a play, leading to a clash between military and police, the general course of events is as described by the municipal authorities. This unfortunate incident is deeply regrettable, and we are particularly concerned about the alarm caused to the citizens. The authorities in charge of this regiment have telegraphed the relevant authorities to request punishment and will investigate the soldiers involved and punish them according to the law. The units stationed in Shanghai have been strictly ordered to restrain themselves and prevent further disturbances."

Anhe Steamer Encountered Another Danger

It has also been learned that another steamer narrowly escaped sinking at Xinkang on the 14th of this month. The "Anhe" steamer of the China Steamer Company arrived at Xinkang at 2:00 PM on the 14th of this month. Thirty to forty small boats carrying passengers swarmed the ship's sides, causing the ship to tilt dangerously. Fortunately, Allied warships anchored nearby sounded the alarm, allowing the ship to safely return to Shanghai. It is hoped that the relevant navigation authorities will pay attention to the recurring dangers involving this steamer and take appropriate precautions to ensure safety and protect lives.

Statistics on Casualties from the Huatai Disaster

According to the above statistics, the number of missing persons is approximately 700-800.

Crew Members Recount the Disaster

According to Zhang Qing, the second mate of the ill-fated Huatai steamer, who was rescued, the course of the ship's disaster was as follows: "The Huatai was running between Shanghai and Xinkang for the 56th time. It arrived at Xinkang at 6:30 PM on the 9th. At that time, each passenger carried an average of a dozen empty kerosene cans, two or three empty bamboo baskets, seven or eight cans of peanut oil, two or three packages of lard and provisions, and large bamboo baskets. It departed from Shanghai at 11:00 AM on the 8th with 17 pieces of cargo and 574 passengers. 30 passengers disembarked at Shiyiwei, without unloading cargo. At Zhanghuanggang and Xinshenggang, 15 pieces of cargo were unloaded, and 115 passengers disembarked. At Xinkang, 459 passengers disembarked. Along the way, 100 cans of peanut oil, 3-4 dan of peanuts, and 1-2 cages of chickens and ducks were loaded, along with 230 passengers. An unexpected incident occurred: it ran aground at Shiyiwei, delaying departure by approximately three hours. Also, after departing from Zhanghuanggang, two gunshots were heard from the right bank, and someone on the shore waved a flag ordering the ship to stop, but it was ignored. The disaster occurred at 6:00 PM on the 9th when it arrived at Xinkang. Two boxes of wool blankets were unloaded, along with 459 passengers. Then the ship tilted 80 degrees and sank."

It is reported that the first batch has already been loaded onto civilian boats along the waterway and is expected to arrive today.

It is also reported that the grain management authorities will make every effort to adjust the distribution amount of household rice to meet the legitimate needs of the citizens.

Authorities Convene Seminars for Various Industries

Last week (from the 13th to the 19th), the average price of all goods was raised by eight or nine tenths again. Among them, food and fuel, essential goods for people's livelihood, had the highest price increase. Secondary goods were also increased in price, stimulated by the high prices of the above two items. Recently, in order to understand the situation of various industries and obtain reliable data, the authorities have repeatedly convened leaders of various industries to hold seminars. In addition to earnestly advising compliance with business ethics, they also discussed how to stabilize the prices of goods in those industries and inquired about the current sources and transportation methods of those items.

### Tree Branches and Charcoal Allowed to Be Freely Moved into Shanghai Area; No Need to Apply for Permission from the Commercial Control Committee

The National Commercial Control Headquarters, according to the Shanghai tree branch industry, which is unable to transport tree branches and firewood purchased from Zhejiang province, requested the issuance of a transport permit to facilitate business. The reply was as follows: After investigation, tree branches and firewood are not included in the Temporary Regulations on the Movement of Wartime Materials. It is not necessary to apply for permission from this committee to transport them into the Shanghai area. According to the Xingyue Business Firm, it is also unnecessary to apply for permission to collect charcoal and firewood from Shaoxing, Ningbo, and other places in Zhejiang, and Jiaxing for transportation to Shanghai. The reply was as follows: After investigation, materials such as charcoal and firewood can be moved into the Shanghai area from Shaoxing and other places without the permission of this committee.

### Old Title Deeds Should Be Exchanged for Land Practice Certificates Promptly

A Central News Agency report states that the Land Administration Bureau began to measure land by household using the latest methods starting in 1927. All old land sections that have been surveyed were announced successively starting in 1930, exchanging land practice certificates and collecting miscellaneous military evidence. These land practice certificates have detailed and accurate diagrams. Even if the actual land boundaries are unfortunately obliterated, the Land Administration Bureau can verify them according to the diagrams. There are now many citizens who use old title deeds for buying and selling, which not only makes their property rights uncertain but also provides no protection if they are deceived. Therefore, according to the Land Administration Bureau, only the land practice certificate can be used to transfer registration in the areas that have been announced for exchange. The land practice certificate should be exchanged with the Land Administration Bureau before purchasing. For the exchange procedures, the land tax and compliant grain claims should be submitted to the Land Administration Bureau. After the bureau reviews and confirms that there are no errors, it will issue a draft of the surveyed land topographic map. The owner can proofread it themselves. If they deem it correct, they should sign and seal it and return it to the Land Administration Bureau. The Land Administration Bureau will then issue the land practice certificate.

### Inspection of Financial Offices to Standardize Accounting Subjects; Meeting of Banks and Financial Firms to be Convened for Discussion

The names of accounting subjects used by various financial institutions in this city are not standardized. Some have the same name but different meanings, and some have the same meaning but different names. This not only affects the efficiency of operations but also hinders the unified management of finance. The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of this, specially conducted a detailed study of the names of accounting subjects adopted by various financial institutions, compiling statistics over several months. A draft has now been prepared, and it is scheduled to convene a meeting at 1:00 PM on the 21st of this month with experienced accountants from some banks, financial firms, trust companies, and savings banks in Shanghai to discuss and exchange opinions, with the aim of standardizing the names of accounting subjects. It is reported that the standardization of the names of accounting subjects in financial institutions will make a great contribution to the development of finance in the future.

### New Central Reserve Bank Address to Be Moved in Spring

The former Bank of China Building at the intersection of Renji Road on the Bund is now being used as the new address of the Central Reserve Bank.

### Using Reeds to Produce Paper in Large Quantities

The paper, a key item for the cultural sector, has seen prices rise continuously in recent years due to intermittent sources, causing panic and a shortage. However, this phenomenon is expected to end, as paper mills in this city are able to become self-sufficient by using reeds from around the Yangtze River as raw materials. The quality is also very good. For example, the Jiangnan Paper Mill uses this kind of papermaking raw material to produce more than ten tons per month. It is now known that the Dongyang Paper Company also intends to adopt this method. There is a large amount of these reeds along the Yangtze River. Therefore, the fear of paper shortage will soon change, and the black market price is expected to decrease.

### Financial and Industrial and Commercial Situations All High Last Week; Authorities are Actively Investigating

The financial, industrial, and commercial situations in Shanghai City were still stable last week, but due to the absorption behavior of investors and the resurgence of speculators, trading became increasingly active in secret, and illegal market prices rose indefinitely. Prices of various daily necessities, such as rice, grains, oil, sugar, and fuel, all increased in a straight line. This change stimulated people's livelihood and caused daily unease. Fortunately, the authorities are paying close attention, actively investigating the reasons, and formulating restrictive measures for company capital increases and value increases, cracking down on market manipulation and market chaos. The various control agencies are actively seeking ways to unblock the supply and demand of daily necessities.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Common Red Dates: Recently, the source has slightly decreased, and the status is flatter than before. The cost has increased, so the asking price of the customer has gradually increased. Yesterday, I heard that a good batch was opened from 50 yuan to 100 yuan, but the market was flat, and Zhu Guoang was still there. At the same time, Tianjin Beichen Dusheng Red Dates, which are especially high, are even tighter due to the scarcity of goods.

Longkou Noodles: Wire noodles and dry winter sales have been launched, and the cost of foreign transportation has increased. Therefore, the Shanghai market has also increased accordingly. The degree of increase has been close to 10%. It has been found that the conversion of ordinary goods is weak, only a slight increase.

Jinshan Branches: Before, due to sluggish conversion, they would fall back by more than 10%, but the source is very difficult, and the inventory is not thick. In addition, the actual sales have become active in recent days, and the price has become tight again. The current market has returned to its original state and has the potential to become tighter again.

### Brief News

The Ningbo Road China Industrial Bank had an original capital of 6 million yuan. Now, in order to comply with the Ministry's order to increase the capital to 10 million yuan, all the increased shares have been fully paid. Yesterday, a shareholders' meeting was held at the New Capital Hotel to report on the progress of the increase, amend the articles of association, and re-elect the directors and supervisors. 锡彤, Zhang Weiruyi, and 19 others were elected as directors, and Jin Caisheng, Lin Kanghou, and 5 others were elected as supervisors.

### Future Pacific Strategy

Hanson Baldwin, the military reporter for the New York Times, recently inspected the Pacific and Asian battle lines and returned to the United States. He wrote an essay on Pacific strategy, which won the Pulitzer Prize for journalism. This essay, unlike the empty pronouncements of U.S. Navy Secretary Knox, carefully examines the future direction the United States should take in the war against Japan, suggesting the future direction of American strategy against Japan, which is quite noteworthy. New Strategic Theory

New Strategic Theory

Baldwin began by saying sharply: "The United States openly claims to believe that the Chongqing government is gradually gaining victory, which is nonsense." He then reviewed the attacks on Japan from the mainland, with his views as follows:

"The general American belief that the morale of the Chongqing army is good is entirely due to the completely false impressions given by reports from missionaries stationed in the Chongqing area, the Chongqing relief fund movement, and propaganda films. We cannot overlook the weaknesses of the Chongqing regime. China, in general, is not the China we commonly imagine; it is merely a geographical concept. The Chongqing regime cannot win against Japan, nor will it win in the future war against Japan. The army has not won in battle but has failed. Japan has not been defeated in China. Japan has not only won in the war but has also gained valuable experience in the war against Britain and the United States. The war communiqués issued by the Chongqing regime are of little value. If the Japanese army had truly lost half the number of troops that Chongqing claims, Japan would now be feeling a shortage of troops.

Chongqing's Isolation

Of course, supplying weapons to the Chongqing regime is necessary, but under the Chongqing regime, there is no army that can truly be called an army. Most of the troops are poorly trained and lack the ability to use modern weapons. They need long-term training and courageous commanders. On the other hand, Japan controls all the bays and transportation routes in China, and has seized the most important mineral resources in North China, so Japan's economic position has also been strengthened. In short, even in the future, it is impossible for the Chongqing army to drive the Japanese army out of China. If Britain and the United States want to fight a decisive battle against the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, they must supply China with a lot of weapons, other military supplies, and troops. To win a victory against the Japanese army on the Chinese mainland, we must station a large army in China and build many large airfields to bomb the Japanese mainland. Not only must we train a large number of Chongqing troops who are truly like an army, but the British and American armies themselves must also send a large number of troops. However, the problem here is resupply, which can be seen as a difficult problem to solve. The area now under the Chongqing regime is completely isolated from the world. There is no other way than to cross the Himalayas from India by air, and the difficulty can be imagined. Airplanes must carry enough gasoline for the return trip. There are very few airfields there, and they are often hampered by seasonal winds. Although the U.S. Air Transport Command and China National Aviation Corporation operate the air route to Chongqing, their transportation capacity is reduced by one-third compared to the previous Burma Road, and they can only transport an average of 200 tons per day. Even if the transportation is gradually increasing, assuming it can reach three times the amount of the Yunnan-Burma Road at the time, it would not be enough to resupply the large army that Britain and the United States expect to have on the Chinese mainland. Each division needs 1,000 tons of military supplies per day in battle. To isolate Japan from the mainland, it is necessary to recapture all of China's ports. To bomb the Japanese mainland and drive the Japanese army out of China, the anti-Axis forces must have a large army and a large-scale air force in mainland China. Therefore, recapturing Burma is of great significance."

The Issue of Resupplying China

Moreover, Baldwin is pessimistic about the issue of resupplying China. In his view, "The reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road is a major problem." That is to say, the reopening of the Yunnan-Burma Road cannot solve the problem of resupplying Chongqing. No matter how it is done, the transportation volume of the Yunnan-Burma Road can at most be increased by two to three times, which is not enough to resupply the expeditionary force with the aforementioned mission. In addition, all the ports that can load and unload 1,000 to 2,000 tons per day are in the hands of the Japanese army, so Baldwin said: "It is impossible to recapture these ports unless a large-scale amphibious operation is carried out at the same time." He concluded:

"To defeat Japan, it is necessary to break through by land and sea at the same time. Japanese fortresses must be attacked simultaneously from Australia, the Solomon Islands, the Aleutian Islands, India, and Chongqing. However, the main offensive route should be a westward advance operation with Hawaii and Midway as bases, first directly attacking the heart of Japan. There is no need for the Chongqing army to play a decisive role. The United States should bear the entire task of winning the Pacific War."

The US fleet directly attacking the heart of Japan from Midway, with the existence of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific, is not worth worrying about. However, the main points of Baldwin's essay are worth noting:

First, he exposes the illusions of the United States regarding Chongqing's anti-Japanese strength and explains that its optimism is groundless.

Second, the important conclusion points out that the naval and air forces will determine the victory or defeat of the Greater East Asia War.

Moreover, the result of Britain and the United States increasing materials and technicians to Chongqing will encourage the enemy's activities against the Japanese army in Burma and Yunnan. Finally, regarding the targets of the British and American amphibious operations against Japan, the Berliner Tageblatt cited (1) the Malay Peninsula and Sumatra, Java, which have long coastlines; (2) Rabaul; and (3) Midway Island. It also predicted that a decisive naval and air battle would be launched near these three locations. (Translated from the December 2nd issue of the Western Japan Daily News)

### The Hell of the World: A Visit to the Southwest Pacific Front

Rainy Night on the Front Lines

When we flew to the location, it had just rained heavily, so the area outside the runway was completely like a mud swamp. Fortunately, Major General Patch, the commander of the local army unit, sent a small military vehicle, so we sat in the car and drove to his headquarters. The so-called headquarters was just a camp set up in a remote valley. It was not far from the airfield.

The Pacific War being waged in Guadalcanal and New Guinea is completely different from the previous Great War that I experienced. Here, there is no pleasure of going to Paris, and the generals do not have luxurious castles to live in or comfortable cars to ride in. As for the general maintenance personnel, they are working barefoot.

This was the beginning of the rainy season. On this island, the rainfall during the rainy season is said to exceed 50 centimeters, so everything, including tents, clothes, and leather shoes, is soaked in rainwater. Malaria and dysentery take this opportunity to wreak havoc. Commander Patch was also sleeping in a hammock in a camp. He was wearing a wide shirt without shoulder straps (Gumqer).

Although I don't intend to boast, I also consider myself a tactician, but I feel that it is very doubtful whether this kind of operation carried out on such a isolated island can be repeated in another location. The price is too high! And it is also a very time-consuming operation! The value of such an isolated island cannot be equal to the life of a single Marine. However, we fought there and secured it as an air base, ensuring the sea transport line to this island. From a long-term perspective, the cheapest way is to mobilize sufficient troops and break into the chain of islands held by the Japanese army, and take three or four airfields in one fell swoop. If this operation is adopted, then I can use more airfields, and as a result, the attack power can be quickly concentrated, right? Moreover, if this kind of posture can be established once, then it will be much easier to threaten the Japanese army's supply line.

The night I stayed on Guadalcanal Island was a night of incessant heavy rain. The sound of raindrops hitting the tent, and the sound of mosquitoes, made it impossible for people to sleep for a moment. The front line was only two or three miles away, and the sound of cannons and machine guns was clearly transmitted to the eardrums, but because of the rain, I did not experience the taste of Japanese bombing.

Things Are Different Now

The next morning, it looked like the weather would clear up, so I returned to the base by the same route. Although the visit to Guadalcanal ended without incident, the crew of the "Flying Fortress" that carried me back, as well as the soldiers it carried, all had various experiences. Several had been forced to land at sea by fifteen or sixteen Japanese fighter planes and had managed to find their way back. Indeed, the air war in the Pacific can be said to be the most intense battle. It is no longer surprising for the crew of a heavy bomber to fly continuously for ten or twelve hours in enemy airspace, and they are attacked by Japanese planes both coming and going. Therefore, they are very nervous and fatigued. The officers piloting heavy bombers are young men of twenty-three or four years old, and the gunners are even younger, mostly young men of nineteen or twenty years old; this surprised me very much.

In the Four Power Line of twenty-five years ago, such a thing did not exist. At that time, pilots went into battle with a sense of chivalry. They could eat fine food as much as they wanted. They also had plenty of rest. It was an unwritten rule that no pilot who was unable to fly could attack, and both sides abided by it. In this war, such a "fairy tale" does not exist at all.

The More, the Better

After this inspection trip, I want to ask again: Have we fulfilled our responsibilities? No matter where I go, I hear local troops asking for more of various things to be sent to the front lines. More planes, more tanks, more cannons, more ammunition, more medical supplies! To them, they cannot understand why the wealthy United States does not send them more things to use.

Here, I want to repeat what I said before, that is: If we can take the troops back from the world's number one land of contribution, and call the soldiers to work in the factories, and replace the factory workers, and order them to go to this front line full of dirt, pests, epidemics, and fierce Japanese attacks, then production will definitely increase. I'm afraid production will double in a month! Saying this may be called "an enemy of labor," but if you see the actual situation in New Guinea and Guadalcanal, you will know that wages, working hours, old-age pensions, etc., are not worth calculating. If we do not win in this battle, we will only be defeated! If we do not produce, then there is no doubt that we will lose! (The End) (Translated from the December 2nd issue of the Asahi Shimbun)

### Frontline Sketch: Fighter Planes Return

In response to the enemy who comes for guerrilla air raids every night, we openly use a large formation of 〇〇 planes to bomb the 〇〇 enemy base during the day. Now those planes are returning one after another. In front of a simple camp at a certain airfield, a staff member is reading the tail numbers of the planes that landed in order and marking them on the blackboard to see if there are any planes that have not returned. Except for the command plane, all the planes have returned safely.

"What about the commander's plane?"

The last pilot to land said:

"The commander is currently engaging with enemy planes in the rear."

"At 〇 o'clock 〇 minutes, we broke in and shot down 〇〇 planes, and our side was hit by several planes."

The young and excellent warrior who escaped from the line of death with bloodshot eyes answered faintly. "As long as the rear is stable, we will win the war." The words of Staff Officer 〇〇 can be fully experienced. (Yasuo Kobori) (Translated from the Asahi Shimbun)

### Amahs

— Hawk

Mr. Zuo decided to find an amah.

He said that in this day and age, it is appropriate to be economical in everything, especially since we are now promoting a thrift movement, and besides, the procedures for registering a household are extremely troublesome, and besides—one more besides!—everyone knows that rice is so expensive now!?

But our master is determined to find one. More than a thousand silver dollars a month, for a couple, using an amah should not be considered extravagant, right? Could it be that the wives of those who advocate thrift are really doing everything themselves?

What's more, Mrs. Zuo's waistline is gradually getting thicker. It is said that she is in the first month of her pregnancy, so Mr. Zuo must find an amah in case the pregnancy is disturbed. Mr. Zuo is in his thirties and still doesn't have any children! Although the saying "There are three forms of unfilial conduct, and the worst is to have no descendants" is outdated, he certainly hopes to have a few little angels in his spare time.

Mr. He "introduced" an amah, who was in her thirties, but after three hours, she left. The reason was that she got news from the mistress that it was rare for her to come back to serve again, and the master did not like to socialize or give gifts very much.

Mr. Zuo sighed:

"Does she want me to entertain guests for her every day?"

His wife was sweeping the floor, slowly lifting her stout waist:

"Forget it! I'll just do it myself."

"No way!" The master was almost furious: "Under no circumstances can you continue to work! Spending a hundred or eighty dollars is a small matter, what if you hurt your body?—I'll find someone else tomorrow!"

The next day, Mr. Zuo went to find someone else. Thank God, he found someone quickly at a broker's shop. She was just from the countryside, and the wage was to Mr. Zuo's liking.

When she arrived home, his wife also felt that she was very satisfactory. After all, the Jiangbei amah was just from the countryside and did not seem to understand the Shanghai situation very well. She neither gambled nor played mahjong, and did not like to socialize very much, which made the master and mistress even more satisfied. What made Mr. Zuo and his wife satisfied was that the amah did not have the bad habits of ordinary Shanghai amahs and did not stand at the door to chat with people from other families. Mr. Zuo and his wife felt that this was the best thing.

She could endure hardship, was willing to work, and was not lazy. Without exaggerating, she was a good amah.

The good amah worked for three days and took half a month's wage to leave. The reason was that Mrs. Zuo discovered that the amah had only been there for three days, and half of the rice in the jar was gone. Under pressure, she told her husband.

Mr. Zuo was shocked.

"Good heavens! Is the rice stolen!?"

"People from the countryside have big stomachs after all," his wife explained, and gave an example: "We used to have an amah who ate three liters of rice per meal."

"We'll eat cornmeal tomorrow. We'll eat sweet potatoes, we'll eat..." the master said angrily.

"Isn't it the same?" his wife said with a bitter face, "You can't make her stomach smaller!"

After discussion, for the sake of rice and for the sake of the future child's food, they asked the amah to find another job. Although the amah was good, they couldn't afford so much.

During this time, Mr. Zuo was finally satisfied.

Mrs. Yu was truly a friend in need, and she even personally brought the amah. This made the master and mistress extremely grateful. The new amah did not say a word and only did her work, which was almost as good as the Jiangbei amah.

In the evening, the master and mistress noticed the new amah eating without discussing it beforehand. As a result, they were surprised to see that she only ate one bowl, only one-third of what Mr. Zuo ate. The master thanked God, the wife was relieved, and went to knit a wool sweater for the future little angel.

The next day, a man brought a seven or eight-year-old child to look for the new amah. The wife saw the amah tell her that it was her husband and child. The husband had no business to do, and the child was sick.

The amah's husband and child ate dinner here.

"You should go find something to do!" the wife said with concern.

"Tell him to come less often!" the master called to his wife to tell her, "Rice is so expensive, I can't afford to supply it!"

The wife was kind-hearted and didn't say anything, but they didn't come again after that. However, the amah didn't seem to be working very hard, like a deflated balloon.

One day, the amah's husband came alone and, after discussing for a long time in the kitchen, the amah hurried upstairs.

"Master... Mistress...! I have... something..."

"Hmm?" The master was writing a letter and looked up.

"I... my... man... came again,... he said... he plans to partner with someone to do a small business... selling deep-fried sweet potato cakes... probably two hundred dollars per person,... he has only collected one hundred, and there is still one hundred... just one hundred..., master, mistress,..." the amah said a lot in a hurry, smiling ingratiatingly, with a red face.

"Is it reliable and can you make money?" the wife asked.

But the master said categorically:

"I don't have any extra money! And... and..."...

The amah almost knelt down. She said with a crying face that if the master and mistress did not help, her father and son would starve to death. The man had been out of work since the factory closed down half a year ago. This time, this time,...

"This time, it's finally... finally a good opportunity, just two hundred dollars,..."

The master frowned and went out.

In the evening, Mr. Zuo came back, and the wife opened the door and hurriedly told her husband that the amah had run away.

"Run away!" The master was shocked.

Then the wife moved her stout waist and hurriedly told her husband how the amah had begged bitterly, and how she had gently and tactfully asked after he left, and finally gave her fifty dollars, but the amah still seemed to be not enough, and finally, somehow, the amah disappeared.

"I thought she went to buy something, but when I checked..."

"What's missing?" Mr. Zuo interrupted her.

"When I checked, your four-pocket pants that were drying on the drying rack were gone, and the watch that you forgot to take out was also gone,..."

Mr. Zuo fainted and fell into a chair.

Over there, the wife lowered her head apologetically, her eyes falling on her bulging belly.

### Lamp Talks

— Yi Yi

How suitable it is to chat under the yellow light; especially on this early winter night, it is like a young widow, full of sorrow, deeply cherishing sadness, in the cool air, a layer of misty light sorrow covers people's hearts: so the poet's pen writes poignant poems; the musician's strings play melancholy tunes; even ordinary chats under the lamp contain endless emotions.

"The lamp light has shone on our gatherings many times, but they are all elusive traces of the past. Tonight's conversation will add another page to the book of memories tomorrow. Life is too uncertain!"

"Tomorrow is so vague, and next year we may be scattered all over the world, or we may be a pile of white bones. Life is too empty!"

"Open your eyes, and the night has passed; close your eyes, and another day has passed; between opening and closing, childhood has slipped away, youth has passed, and in the end, there is only a pile of yellow soil left. Life is too short!"

"Who can make time stand still and life last forever, so that our gathering tonight can be endless?"

"But rather cherish broken jade than value whole tiles; Confucius lamented over Yan Hui's death at the age of thirty-three, saying, "How virtuous Hui is!" It is better to live a thousand years, grow old, and rot like grass and trees; therefore, although long talks are held all day long without mentioning righteousness, they are not as good as occasional meetings, where we encourage and exhort each other."

"Unfortunately, even if we create great achievements, what will be the result? "The great river flows eastward, washing away the famous figures of a thousand ages," who can escape the grasp of death?"

"Although no one can escape death, the cause they created and the spirit they manifested are still praised by later generations; otherwise, after thousands of years, who will know that you ever existed in this world?"

"Therefore, I feel that if life cannot leave a fragrance for a hundred ages, it should leave a stench for ten thousand years; otherwise, it is too ordinary!"

"No, that's wrong. Since ancient times, how many rebellious officials and traitors have committed evil and harmed the country and the people by relying on this saying; if a person's life cannot benefit the world, at least it should not harm others; personal fame is a small matter; the public interest is a big matter; therefore, if you cannot leave a fragrance for a hundred ages, then die mediocrely!"

I was doubtful and solemn; I understood the meaning of life and the gains and losses of death.

### The Second Long-Distance Race: Deaf Person Lou Wen'ao Wins the Championship; Top Three Break the Previous Record

The second annual citywide open long-distance race, organized by the Municipal Sports Association, began at 8:00 AM yesterday in front of the Municipal Government on Rue du Consulat (Bai Linan Road). The route went from Rue du Consulat to Avenue Haig (Zhen De Road), then turned into Jing'an Temple Road, followed by Route Maréchal Joffre (Ma Huo Road), Weihaiwei Road, Avenue Foch (Fu Xu Road), Route Tenant de la Tour (Ge Lu), Hongqiao Road, and finally entered Route Kaufmann (Kai Shi Road) before returning to the Rue du Consulat finish line. The entire course was 13,510 meters long, exactly the same as the first race. Yesterday morning, the weather was not sunny, and the fog was very heavy. When the reporter left his residence at 7:00 AM, he found the road quite slippery and difficult to walk on, and the fog was very thick. Even at a distance of thirty steps, it was difficult to see faces clearly. On the sidewalks, traces of people were few and far between. At that time, the reporter thought that the long-distance race would be canceled because of this, and the results would inevitably be affected. However, upon reaching Rue du Consulat, a crowd of people was already packed tightly. The grand scene was indeed not affected. As a result, the scores exceeded expectations, with the first, second, and third places all breaking the previous champion's record.

Sixty-One Participants, Forty-Six Started

A total of sixty-one people participated this time, but at the pre-race roll call, only forty-six actually arrived. Fifteen people were absent, presumably due to unforeseen circumstances that prevented them from participating, which is understandable. In the end, forty-two people reached the finish line. Only four people gave up halfway, either due to cramps or lack of strength. Nevertheless, this phenomenon is already commendable.

Deaf Person Lou Wen'ao Took the Lead from the Start

At precisely 8:00 AM, the starter Chen Yuze fired a silver pistol, and ninety-two swift feet took off together. They rose and fell, forming a long, serpentine line. The initial burst at the start was truly exciting to watch. People were jostling and pushing each other, making it impossible to tell who was in the lead. The reporter rode his bicycle back to the intersection of Route Tenant de la Tour and Jing'an Temple, where the spectators were craning their necks to look into the distance. They saw Lou Wen'ao taking the lead, his legs moving like flying. He focused on pushing forward, and the spectators applauded, to which Lou responded with a slight smile. Following him were the veteran Wan Jinsheng, then the Japanese runners Manuyama Ichiro, Mabuchi Kichiji, and Sun Zhifang, vying for position, each unknown to the others. The procession surged forward, receiving applause from the spectators along the way.

Chasing the Runners Through the Fog, Observing Their Positions

Throughout the race, Lou Wen'ao never looked back. The deaf man ran like an old horse who knows the way, both fast and steady. By the time they reached Route Maréchal Joffre, the Japanese runner Manuyama Ichiro and Mabuchi Kichiji were full of ambition. Meanwhile, Qian Zhenxing was also closely following them, refusing to let go. On Route Tenant de la Tour, Lou Wen'ao was still far ahead, with the second-place runner more than three hundred meters behind. At this point, Mabuchi Kichiji seemed to be losing strength, while Wan Jinsheng was gaining momentum. Manuyama Ichiro and Sun Zhifang were fiercely competing for position. The Japanese runner Kanamura Norio was gritting his teeth in the crowd.

Counting Heads at the Finish Line: Deaf Person Shows Promise

The reporter took a shortcut to the finish line ahead of the runners, where there was already a large crowd, all watching to determine the final outcome. Before 9:00 AM, Lou Wen'ao straightened his chest, looked back to see that no one was in sight, and with one final burst of energy, set a new record, crossing the finish line in 57 minutes and 25 seconds. This broke the previous record of 59 minutes and 8 seconds set by the "Monkey King" Zheng Lin. In the heavy fog and slippery streets, it was truly a triumphant achievement. Wan Jinsheng finished four hundred meters behind him in 58 minutes and 23 seconds. The third-place finisher, Sun Zhifang, finished in 58 minutes and 45 seconds, making a great effort to catch up to the veteran Wan. The fourth place went to the Japanese runner Manuyama Ichiro in 59 minutes and 27 seconds. The fifth place went to Mabuchi Kichiji in 59 minutes and 45 seconds, about two hundred meters behind the previous runner. The sixth place went to Hara Hiroshi in 61 minutes and 43 seconds. The seventh place went to Qiu Xingqing in 61 minutes and 56 seconds. The eighth place went to Qian Zhenxing in 62 minutes and 24 seconds, who had nimble feet but couldn't keep up the speed. The ninth place went to Jiang Xin Xinwu, who finished in 63 minutes exactly, swaying as he ran. The last prize winner was Wang Zhiyi in 64 minutes and 53 seconds. The Japanese runner Kanamura Norio, realizing he had failed, reached the finish line in eleventh place, earning a commemorative medal but no prize as the first non-prize winner. After that, the remaining runners trickled across the finish line, totaling forty-two in all. The other four participants vanished without a trace.

After the race, Ma Moufang presented the awards, and in the midst of the cheers, the deaf person Lou Wen'ao could only smile and not speak. The reporter then hastily departed. (By Bi Mou)

### Wrestling Competition: A Rare Spectacle in Shanghai; Tong Zhongyi's Archery is Divine

The wrestling competition, jointly organized by the Zhongqing and Jingwu Sports Associations, was held at 7:30 PM on the 16th (last Thursday) in the gymnasium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. This type of competition is a first for Chinese participants. The reporter was invited by Mr. Liang Zhao'an, director of the Zhongqing Sports Association, and gladly attended as an observer. However, as an amateur in this field, the reporter did not dare to make any comments, but only recorded the grand occasion.

By 7:30 PM, the area in front of the gate was already packed with spectators, all eager to see this new and interesting event. The reporter's seat was particularly comfortable, offering a high and unobstructed view. There were over a thousand guests, making for an exceptionally lively atmosphere. There were very few female guests, which suggests that the sport has not yet deeply penetrated the general public. Considering this achievement, it can be recognized as a focal point for continued efforts to promote the sport in the future, which will certainly have a bright future.

In the wrestling competition, Jingwu defeated Zhongqing. It is said that Jingwu has a long history under the training of Tong Zhongyi, while Zhongqing's level is lower. Therefore, despite their best efforts to resist, they inevitably lost. It seems that Yang Moushou of Jingwu has deeply mastered the secrets of the sport, easily defeating She Youyang of Zhongqing, who did not show much strength.

Next was a martial arts performance, where real swords and spears were used, and the performers leaped and flew, dazzling the audience, who responded with thunderous applause.

After that was the "mud loach" wrestling. In this form of wrestling, the participants do not wear shirts, exposing their bodies to fight. Without clothing to grab onto for leverage, only those with true skill can perform well. Jingwu students demonstrated the technique, with those who were like contestants in a tournament came to the stage one by one. It demonstrated skills, also included comical antics, eliciting laughter from the audience.

Finally, Tong Zhongyi performed ancient archery. Tong's reputation has long preceded him, and admiring audience members were eager to see Tong perform. His arrows flew like shooting stars, with almost every shot hitting the target. He hit seven out of ten shots. It is said that under the bright lights, he could have hit nine out of ten shots. The entire audience cheered, and the grand event concluded.

It is believed that this competition and performance have significance in promoting national essence, and it is hoped that continued efforts will lead to greater achievements. (By the Thin Reporter)

### Current Situation of Western Youth Basketball: Hualian Stands Alone; The Liu Family Team Lost to Dongfang; Monac Defeated by Tongren

In Group A of the Western Youth Basketball League, only three teams, Hualian, Huanan, and Monac, maintained undefeated records last week. However, after the games played last Wednesday, only Hualian remained undefeated. Logically, in terms of strength, Hualian is the most dominant. However, there are still many strong opponents ahead, and Huanan and Dongfang both have formidable forces. They must be cautious and prudent in their approach to ensure smooth sailing, which is what the fans hope for. Strive to do your best, Hualian! A brief description of last week's games is listed below:

Huanan Triumphs on Monday Night

The first game was between Renyu and Dahua. The latter has been trained day and night by the elder Lu Zhen'en recently, and his basketball skills have been improving rapidly. The only shortcoming is that he cannot completely control his temper. Renyu, the veteran, still shows his prowess, but his shooting accuracy is lacking, so he only narrowly won by a score of 36-30. The second game was between Huanan and the Oil Team. Both teams are rising stars, and the game was extremely intense. Huanan ultimately prevailed due to their superior skills and endurance, defeating the up-and-coming Oil Team by a score of 37-29.

Hualian Plays Fiercely in Two Games on Wednesday

The first game was between Hualian, who defeated Giant last week, and the Three-Losses Team, which is full of old and weak players. The strength difference was significant. The Three-Losses Team was like a car that had derailed, while Hualian was like a sharp turn. Kong Guangyi and Qu Xijiong were like entering a no-man's land, while Mou Xuechong and Wu Chengzhang were comfortable and effective. They easily won by a score of 76-21, the most lopsided score in Group A this season. The second game was between the home team Giant and Amateur. Amateur was frustrated and unable to achieve their goals, partly due to the incompleteness of their lineup. Tao Shaosheng wanted to rally but could not find a way. Therefore, Amateur lost again by a score of 29-54, and Giant earned two points.

Both Strong Teams are Defeated in Friday's Games

That night, the atmosphere in the basketball hall was particularly intense. Both of the undefeated teams were defeated. Dongfang showed their prowess, and A Bao had a point. The Xuan Family Team fought bravely, and Xuan Jun showed his skills. The fans applauded thunderously. The Western Youth basketball hall has been particularly lively this year.

Since unfortunately losing to Tongren, Dongfang has learned from their mistakes. This time, they had the support of Gao Baosheng, Xu Wenkui, Wang Jinghu, Zhang Shaoxiang, and Bao Songyuan, the five tigers. Although Huanan's momentum was strong, their experience was lacking. A Kui and A Bao were able to do as they pleased, and Dongfang's future is looking brighter. Huanan suffered their first defeat, with a score of 41-27.

Tongren played with great spirit last week, capturing Dongfang and becoming a team that cannot be underestimated. Monac's record has not yet shown results, and with the planning of Giant's triumphant Milov from the sidelines, they are not an ordinary team. However, the Xuan Family Team lived up to the encouragement of the crowd, relying on Zhang Banglun's bravery and Xuan Jun's left-handed shooting to secure the victory by a score of 37-33, a narrow win.
