### 清兵與整警

After joining the war, the focus of all parties will naturally first concentrate on military affairs and the mobilization of manpower. However, overemphasizing this aspect is obviously unnecessary, because the main task of joining the war is to more effectively concentrate the nation's manpower and material resources for the government to use in an organized and planned way, in order to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and seek the final liberation of the East Asian nations. As we have long pointed out, cooperation with Japan in military affairs after joining the war should be of secondary importance, and the reason lies here. However, we are not saying that after joining the war, we can still maintain the past military status quo. This is impossible and should not be done. If China does not have armed forces to stabilize the border areas of Greater East Asia on its own, then Japan must allocate a considerable number of troops to occupy Chinese territories, which is tantamount to dispersing the strength of the allied forces fighting in Greater East Asia. Therefore, a certain degree of military reorganization is still necessary. However, this is a major issue that deserves deep consideration. Standing in the position of the common people, we deeply feel that there are several points that should be brought to the attention of the authorities.

First of all, the current military reorganization is entirely limited to maintaining the security of the peace zone and assisting Japan in consolidating the rear of the Greater East Asia War; moreover, the establishment and development of this Chinese armed force is being carried out in the midst of the country's most difficult situation. Under the premise of recognizing the above-mentioned tasks and environment, it is necessary to implement "elite troops." First, the organization of the army should not be too large or too complex, and the military structure should not be too large or too complex, because if it is too large and too complex, it may appear glorious on the surface, but in reality, it will inevitably waste national resources. Second, the number of troops should not be increased blindly, because with the increase in the number of troops, the costs of salaries, weapons, and supplies alone will force the government to increase the burden on the people. Then, even if no conscription is carried out, the result will still increase the suffering of the people, so those who seek to protect peace will inevitably create unrest. Third, the generals at all levels of the army must not only be military experts who are proficient in strategy, and not allow laymen to fill the ranks; they must also be cadres who have received considerable rigorous political training, who can understand the international and domestic political situation, and understand their responsibility to protect the country and the people. This is what Sun Tzu, the famous ancient Chinese military expert, called the way of "selecting generals" and "leading generals." On the contrary, if "selecting generals" is not careful and "leading generals" is ineffective, then even if there is no disaster of "arrogant soldiers and brave generals," I am afraid that they cannot be expected to take on the mission of soldiers in the current difficult era. And most importantly, fourth, there must be strict discipline. Countries that are known for strict military discipline, such as Japan and Germany, have been able to complete their missions with their armies. Conversely, an army with lax military discipline will eventually arouse popular resentment, not only burying the army itself, but also bringing the heaviest disaster to the country and the nation. In the past, this newspaper has received letters from readers hoping that the army will abide by discipline, care for the people, and establish iron-like military discipline. We believe that only when the above four basic requirements are universally and effectively realized can the principle of elite troops be considered to have a foundation, and the mission of the new era can be fully undertaken without regret.

However, we feel that in order to fully complete the task of participating in the war and maintaining the security of the rear of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to implementing the "elite troops" policy of military reorganization, we must also pay attention to the rectification of police administration, establish a new era of police system, and promote the power of the police as guardians of the people and society. Here, in a negative sense, we hope to completely change the traditional concept of the people's past contempt for the police. However, at the same time, efforts should be made to maintain a reasonable life for police officers. Judging from the current monthly salary of the police, taking the Xuhui and Nanshi districts of Shanghai as examples, it is less than 100 yuan per month, and they have to take care of their own meals. Everyone can imagine that this small amount is not enough to pay for the porridge for themselves, let alone that the police are not monks and need to support their families like ordinary people. Who is willing to be a policeman if they have any other means? How can people who become police officers live without engaging in side businesses? Under this kind of reality, is it not asking the impossible to talk highly about rectifying the police administration and promoting the power of the new police? Therefore, we hope that the authorities will pay attention to this point and quickly increase the salaries of police officers and improve their material lives. Then, the second step is to strengthen the political and technical training of cadres, absorb genuine talents from all aspects, and cultivate a large number of new police cadres who are suitable for the needs of the new era and can truly be guardians of the people. From this point, we especially hope that the authorities will pay attention to the fact that in the current situation where it is not possible to build and develop the army on a large scale, in the current situation where it is necessary to implement the "elite troops" policy, rectifying the police and developing the power of the police is of primary importance in consolidating the rear, protecting human rights, and caring for the people in the Greater East Asia War.

Of course, whether it is elite troops or police reorganization, there is a prerequisite that must be firmly grasped, that is, there must first be political solutions and selfless absorption of talents from all aspects. In addition, Japan has things worth learning from in terms of elite troops and police systems, and Japan also has a responsibility to assist as an allied country. Of course, all of these are China's internal affairs. We do not hope that Japan will overstep its authority, but hope that Japan will provide sincere assistance from a friendly standpoint.

The economic cooperation between the three countries will become closer in the future. In addition, this agreement breaks the international economic system monopolized by the United Kingdom and the United States in the past, and adopts a direct settlement method between Japan, Germany, and Italy, which is also of great significance. Therefore, it is firmly believed that the cooperation between the three countries will become more and more solid in both material and spiritual aspects, which will not only be beneficial to the completion of the war, but also make a great contribution to the new world based on justice after the war.

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency) Germany and Italy signed economic agreements with Japan yesterday.

On the same day, Japanese Charge d'Affaires to Italy Kase and Italian Foreign Minister Ciano signed the Japan-Italy Agreement on Economic Cooperation. The validity period is the same as that of the Tripartite Pact. It can be said that it is an extremely large agreement that concretely realizes its aims in the economic field and strengthens the Tripartite Pact. Japan, Germany, and Italy have always strengthened their political ties established by the Tripartite Pact. Now, they have concluded two economic agreements to establish grand economic plans and strive to mobilize the total strength of the two major economic spheres of Greater East Asia and Europe, implement the war to defeat the common enemy, and establish a foundation for the two major economic circles to permanently cooperate economically after the war. Therefore, in addition to stipulating the exchange of various economic works to promote each other, the two agreements also stipulate the implementation of cooperation in economic and financial aspects. The contents of the Japan-Germany and Japan-Italy agreements are as follows:

Japan-Germany Section

(A) Agreement on Economic Cooperation between Japan and Germany. The Government of the Great Japanese Empire and the Government of the Great German Empire, in order to mutually assist each other with their economic strength in this war to build a new order in Greater East Asia and Europe and strive for final victory, and to realize a new order sufficient to ensure the coexistence and co-prosperity of each nation within the economic circles of the two countries after the war, have decided to seek closer economic cooperation between the two countries.

(B) The full text of the Japan-Italy Agreement on Economic Cooperation is completely the same as the Japan-Germany Agreement, and is omitted.

Negotiation Process

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) The concrete negotiations for the conclusion of the epoch-making economic cooperation agreement between Japan, Germany, and Italy began in the spring of 1941. At that time, Japanese Ambassador to Germany Oshima and Minister Matsushima began to negotiate with the Trade Bureau of the German Foreign Ministry. At the same time, the German side specially appointed Dr. Veltat, Director of the Four-Year Plan Bureau, as the head of the economic mission, composed of key members of the diplomatic, economic, and food departments and important personnel from the central bank, to visit Japan in April of the same year. Dr. Veltat was highly valued by German Marshal Goering. Under the guidance of Foreign Minister Matsuoka at that time, the Japanese side, with Foreign Ministry Advisor Saito Ryoei as the center, began to exchange opinions with the German Trade Bureau. As a result, in just over two months, the opinions of both sides were completely一致. However, in June of the same year, the German-Soviet War broke out, so this basic plan had to be re-examined. By December of the same year, due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, a third revision of the content was made. Especially after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it was necessary to completely update matters such as material exchange, technical cooperation, and trade settlement methods. The negotiations between Japan and Italy began when the outline of the Japan-Germany negotiations had been roughly decided. Representatives of the two countries actively negotiated in Tokyo and Rome, so it was concluded at the same time as the Japan-Germany agreement this time.

Conference Held in Cairo to Discuss North African War Situation

Ankara, 21st (Haitong News Agency) According to news from Cairo, after British Cabinet Representative to the Near East Casey returned to Cairo, a meeting was held immediately. British military and civil authorities attended. This meeting was clearly to discuss the North African war situation.

Lisbon, 21st (Domei News Agency) According to news from North Africa relayed here, the Allied Command in French North Africa admitted yesterday that the Allied forces invading Tunisia had suffered setbacks again. It is disclosed that the Axis forces moved southwest from Pont du Fahs in southern Tunisia and advanced about seven miles. A Reuters reporter last night reported from the Allied Command, detailing the Axis victory, saying, "Although the British field artillery and flat-trajectory gun teams assisted General Giraud's French rebel army to resist the frequent pressure from the German army southwest of Pont du Fahs, the German army, with the assistance of tanks and aircraft, entered seven miles on the road from Pont du Fahs to Rougga. The fierce resistance of the Allied forces was ineffective." News from Berlin said that the French army suffered heavy losses, with more than 1,000 captured and a considerable loss of war equipment. German infantry and tanks attacked the important mountain positions, then cooperated with the Italian army to surround a large number of French rebel forces and are gradually eliminating them. The German army north of Bou Arada repelled the French army's attack and consolidated its position in a fierce encounter. Several British reconnaissance teams north of Medjez el Bab were ambushed and captured by German motorized troops. At the same time, Axis aircraft heavily attacked the Axis forces concentrated in Tunisia and bombed the port of Bone on the Algerian coast on the night of January 19, destroying military targets there. According to German news, General Rommel of Tripoli proved again that his defensive tactics were superior to those of British General Montgomery. The British Eighth Army launched a fierce attack on the southern part of the German Africa Corps on Tuesday morning, but was driven back by intense artillery fire. In the afternoon, the British army launched another attack and was repelled again. Axis air combat assistance was quite successful. In this battle, the British army lost 32 tanks and armored vehicles, more than 60 transport vehicles, and a number of cannons.

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency) The Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that the German army clearly intends to drive the Allied forces out of central Tunisia so that they cannot attack the ports of Sousse and Sfax, because the coast of Tunisia has become indispensable for the Axis forces near the port of Tunis and General Rommel's troops to establish contact. According to Axis sources, fierce fighting is currently taking place near the port of Tripoli. The French secessionist troops occupying the mountains south of the port were attacked by German mountain troops and have been surrounded. An Italian army team also participated in the battle. The French secessionist troops are in a desperate situation. General Montgomery launched two offensives yesterday, but both were repelled. However, there are still signs that the British army is preparing to attack again.

### January 10th, from Macau: Must Britain Abandon India? (3)

— Snow

The Saturday Evening Post published this telegram dispatch from Bombay by Edgar Snow on September 12th. The content is relatively specific, and the material is quite extensive. I am translating it for reference.

—Translator—

Nehru himself set forth surprising words to me, saying, "Among the British who have been sent to India in the past fifty years, Cripps is the person who has done the most harm to India. He has not only insulted our credibility but also insulted our reason." Those who think this way are certainly not limited to Nehru alone. Most Indians no longer trust British promises and believe that the best guarantee of freedom is freedom itself, and they want to obtain freedom as early as possible.

Even more extreme people distrust Britain, America, China, and the Soviet Union entirely. When the American Grady mission came to India to investigate the possibilities of assisting Indian industrialists, many industrialists regarded Grady only as an American imperialist sent to take over privileges. When the Soviet Union signed the Anglo-Soviet treaty, some Indians thought that the Soviet Union would not liberate India from the hands of the British and condemned it for betraying India. According to Nehru, those who say China is good among Indians are often subjected to sharp criticism from some nationalists. These extreme people simply cannot imagine that even if Britain now gives India freedom, it will still be affected by the international situation, and if the Axis powers win, India's freedom will immediately vanish.

The third, and also the most direct cause of the current outbreak of conflict, is the decline of the British government's prestige, which was the result of Britain's defeat at the hands of the Japanese this spring. The American and British people do not quite understand how this defeat produced widespread influence among the masses and how Japan swept away the prestige of the military capabilities and efficiency of Britain and America from the minds of Asians.

Prestige? That's it. Apart from the exchange rate of the rupee, we have no prestige. This is the biggest change since my last visit to India.

Fourth, the most harmful aspect is that Indians have deeply experienced all forms of unequal treatment of imperialism based on racial prejudice and the absurd idea of racial superiority. Most harmful aspect was the great difference in the treatment of white refugees and brown refugees during the recent great retreat from Malaya and Burma. Undoubtedly, the white people were more fortunate. More than 200,000 Indians returned from the occupied areas and broadcast their experiences throughout the country. Wherever they spread their stories, people did not believe in the ability of the British to handle emergencies.

Fifth, Indian industrialists and capitalists are extremely dissatisfied with the government's wartime production policy. I have spoken with the most important industrialists. They all believe that if there is a normal adjustment plan, supply, and industrial rationalization, production can be increased two to four times.

Grady told me the same thing. Without exception, Indian industrialists talked to us about the obstacles of bureaucrats, the lack of planning, the inadequacy of efficiency, and the frustration of their efforts to build India's self-sufficient economy. I found that no one believed that Britain would give up India after the war. To provide evidence, they cited many examples to illustrate that India's industrial development was being blocked, mainly due to Britain's post-war needs. There is no doubt that Gandhi and the National Congress fully reflect the wishes of the Indian bourgeoisie, who finance their activities.

Sixth, many Indians have doubts about Britain's ability to lead India to war. Nationalists believe that at this time, the government must be able to command the largest majority of supporters in order to mobilize the entire people to engage in war. They say that General Wavell's strategy believes that it is not necessary for the Indian people to support it in order to defend India. I have to add that Wavell's discussion with me can be said to have confirmed this point. To prove the necessity of mobilizing the people, the Indians compared the defeats of Malaya, Java, and Burma with the situations in China, the Soviet Union, and even the Philippines.

Some things can only be done by a truly Indian government, a government that can increase the burden on the people without causing rebellion. Among these things, the nationalists demand the following from the cabinet responsible for the future.

Currently, workers and industries are simply working purely for profit. Sir Mody, a member of the Executive Council under the Governor-General, frankly admitted this motive to me. Even without expanding industry, if patriotism is added to this motive, workers and factories can greatly increase production. As for the plan to relocate and evacuate factories from the threatened areas and industrial rationalization, it can be realized in accordance with the methods proposed by the Grady mission.

Refugees and the unemployed in rural areas should be educated and trained in methods such as industrial cooperative movements, like in China, to learn how to make wartime goods. Students and educated people should be made to serve in the national defense cause, instead of the method of limiting recruitment to the so-called military races with extremely high illiteracy rates. A conscription system can be applied, and in any case, military training must be implemented on a large scale.

Political training should be adopted to strengthen the morale of soldiers and civilians, so that they know that they must defend their newly obtained freedom. In this way, workers will not flee in droves when the situation first becomes tight, as has happened in Calcutta, Bombay, and other places. They will recognize themselves as proud citizens of a free India, holding on to their positions. The Indian people will not use non-violent resistance to oppose necessary national defense measures. They will organize and implement various national defense measures under the leadership of the new India. India will raise its head, shake off its inferiority complex, and keep pace with the rest of the world.

Some of the above reasons may have points that are worthy of criticism, but in fact, these beliefs and prejudices generally exist in the political consciousness of Indians, regardless of which party or faction they belong to.

These reasons, I believe, acting now, coupled with the greatest crisis of the Allied forces in the European war, will surely give the Allied nations the deepest impression. These thoughts are agitating India today.

The Indian National Congress has felt the need to coordinate internally and coordinate nationally, and two opinions have begun to separate very clearly in the national movement. The first opinion: wishfully believing that the Axis powers can be reconciled, advocates a neutral policy towards Japan. The conscious leader of this opinion is Subhas Bose, the former president of the National Congress, who escaped from the British prison and lives in Germany, often giving broadcast speeches to a large number of supporters in India, especially in Bengal. The other aspect of public opinion tends to the proposition that unity is above all else, believing that only on the basis of unity can the people be mobilized quickly to resist the Axis powers' attempt to repeat the history of France and China in India. This opinion is led by the smaller but highly efficient Indian Communist Party.

### South of Lake Ladoga: German Troops Resolutely Resist; Fierce Fighting Still Occurring in the Middle of the Don River; Soviet Army Linkage in the Caucasus Cut Off

German Supreme Headquarters, 21st (Haitong News Agency): This afternoon's German military communiqué stated that the Southern Front of the Eastern European Soviet Army launched several fierce counterattacks, all of which were repelled, and suffered heavy losses. In the past two days, the Soviets lost 52 armored vehicles. A certain tank division of our army destroyed 24 enemy armored vehicles. Elite German Air Force units and Romanian fighter planes scattered concentrated Soviet troops and attacked enemy supply convoys. The German troops inside Stalingrad bravely resisted the approaching enemy forces and repelled them. There were local battles in the central part of Eastern Europe and south of Lake Ilmen. Commando teams repeatedly established meritorious service. Fierce fighting is still occurring south of Lake Ladoga, with 27 Soviet armored vehicles destroyed. In the ten days from the 11th to the 20th of this month, our army destroyed and captured a total of 804 Soviet tanks.

Berlin, 21st (Allied News Agency): Officials here stated last night that after fierce fighting on Tuesday, the German army and other Axis forces on the Eastern Front, from Lake Ladoga in the north to the Caucasus in the south, smashed the Soviet army's attempt to invade the Axis forces' lines. The Soviet offensive south of Lake Ladoga slightly invaded the German forces' positions after heavy losses, but the German forces resisted resolutely, and the Soviet attack finally collapsed. In the Lake Ilmen area to the south, the German army surrounded and annihilated a Soviet unit. A Soviet tank unit in the middle of the Don River was defeated by the German army, with 10 Soviet tanks destroyed. Fierce fighting in the area is still in progress. In the Stalingrad area, the Soviet army once again launched a fierce attack on the German defensive forces, which failed. The Soviet army's attempt to suppress the German army was smashed, and it suffered heavy losses in manpower and material resources. On the Caucasus front, the Soviet army broke through the Axis forces' positions in the western part of the front, but its connection with the main Soviet forces has been cut off by the German and Romanian armies. The Soviet army in this area has also lost several inhabited areas. The Soviet offensive in the North Caucasus and the southern Don River has also been repelled.

### Axis Powers Change Naval Strategy; Will Deploy Large Numbers of Submarines

Stockholm, Sweden, 21st (Haitong News Agency): British First Lord of the Admiralty Alexander declared to the House of Commons yesterday that the Allied navies will shoulder arduous missions in 1943.

### British Foreign Secretary Claims Will Bomb Rome; German Aircraft Stage Daylight Attack on London

Bern, Switzerland, 20th (Havas News Agency): London dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden declared in the House of Commons that if bombing Rome is conducive to the victory of the war, Britain will not hesitate to do so. Since Italy has bombed London, we also have full right to bomb Rome. Several of the planes that bombed London yesterday were Italian planes. According to past rumors, Britain and Italy have established a gentleman's agreement stipulating that Britain will not damage the cultural value of Rome, and Italy will not bomb the historical city of Cairo at the same time.

Lisbon, 21st (Allied News Agency): According to last night's news, an alarm was issued twice in the London area yesterday. German planes flew over London. The first alarm was issued at noon. At that time, six German planes carried out the first daylight attack on London since October 26 of last year, dropping bombs. The ground was damaged, and several people died. In the evening, an alarm was issued again in some areas of the London suburbs, but no sound of planes was heard, and there was no artillery fire. Several places in southern England were also attacked by German planes.

### Giant Meteor Falls Near Brazil

The giant meteor seemed to fall near Brazil.

### Chile Notifies Japan, Germany, and Italy of Severance of Diplomatic Relations; Argentina Continues to Maintain Neutrality

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Allied News Agency): According to news from the capital of Chile, at 3:40 PM Chilean time yesterday (5:45 AM Shanghai Daylight Saving Time today), Japan, Germany, and Italy received notification from Chile of its decision to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. This decision was notified by the Chilean Undersecretary of Foreign Affairs Gajardo to the German and Italian ambassadors and the Japanese minister, and it was stated that the Chilean envoys stationed in Tokyo, Berlin, and Rome had notified the Axis governments separately. At the same time, the Chilean government also notified other American governments of the severance of relations with the Axis powers.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Chilean President Ríos gave a half-hour broadcast speech today, implying that Chile's severance of relations with the Axis powers was due to oppression, and said, "I hope that the historical, political, economic, and cultural ties between us will not be affected by temporary measures." He concluded by saying, "Chile is still a country that loves freedom and abides by the law. People with different opinions will not suffer any sacrifice, and the law will protect everyone equally." Yesterday, before discussing international issues, Ríos talked about domestic and foreign difficulties. Chile will do its best to uphold the principles of Pan-American understanding, but there are still dissatisfied countries in the Americas. In order to fulfill our moral obligations, we cannot turn a deaf ear and take measures to sever relations.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Argentine President Castillo declared that Chile's severance of relations with the Axis countries has not affected Argentina's neutral attitude. Argentina has not changed its attitude.

Berlin Expresses Regret

Berlin, 21st (Haitong News Agency): Berlin's reaction to Chile's severance of relations with the Axis powers was only "regret," especially towards Chile. Chile's decision is of little importance in Germany's strategic considerations. Berlin believes that there is no reason to sever diplomatic relations between Chile and the Axis powers. There is no fundamental conflict between Germany and Chile, whether politically or otherwise. Chile has maintained neutrality towards Germany in the past, and Germany has respected the status of Chile and other neutral countries. Because there is not only considerable economic connection between the two countries, but also close cultural and spiritual relations, the Chilean government's move to sever relations with the Axis powers this time is contrary to the interests of the Chilean people.

### Absolute Prohibition of Wasting Gas and Electricity; Strict Implementation of Restrictions Starting This Year; Supply Stopped for Those Exceeding the Allotment

The Shanghai Gas Company, in view of the large increase in gas consumption since the expansion of the war, has decided to adopt stricter new measures starting this month. If the consumption of users exceeds the officially allocated amount for two consecutive months, the supply will be cut off immediately.

Maximum Gas Consumption

According to the new measures, the maximum consumption is the amount of consumption in the month with the highest consumption from May to September last year, plus 10%. If the user's consumption exceeds this amount, the excess part will be charged at five times the normal price. If the excess amount is twice the normal amount, the excess amount will be charged at ten times the normal price. If the user continues to exceed the allocated amount for two months, the gas company will cut off the gas supply.

Electricity Saving Measures

The French Concession Police Department has recently followed the regulations stipulated by the French Consulate General to implement new restrictions on electricity consumption. Therefore, inspectors are dispatched every night from various districts and neighborhoods to investigate and ensure the implementation of the electricity saving campaign with excellent results. The electricity saving measures stipulated by the French Consulate General are scheduled to be implemented from January 1 this year. The newly allowed electricity consumption is 85% of the amount stipulated in October last year. In other words, every store and household should save at least 15% of electricity this year. Store and shop window lights must be turned off from 8:00 PM to 7:00 AM the next morning. Stores that cannot operate due to the extinguishing of store lights will automatically close. If they are not affected by the extinguishing of store lights, they can continue to operate without a doubt. The degree of internal lights in stores and indoor lights in each household should be reduced. Those who arbitrarily waste electricity or do not comply with the regulations will be punished. In serious cases, the electricity supply will be stopped. The police department is paying close attention to this matter, strictly prohibiting violations of the rules, and determined to implement the purpose of saving electricity.

Power Distribution System to Be Changed

This newspaper in Shanghai of the Allied Press learned last night that the National Government has now joined the Greater East Asia War, and the amount of electricity required by various industries has increased. In order to cope with this need, the Central China Water and Electricity Company will soon revise the current power distribution system, which is aimed at economizing, and change it to a system based on prioritized distribution of power. In the future, electricity will be given priority to enterprises engaged in wartime and important food production, and the power allocated to businesses deemed non-essential will be greatly reduced. After the company has discussed with the office of the Japanese Embassy in this city, it will announce the details.

### Sino-Japanese Jointly Run Shipping Organization to Control Junk Freight Transportation with a Capital of 300 Million Yuan is Being Actively Organized

Since the expansion of the war, the number of steamships has decreased, making them difficult to allocate. To remedy this, the authorities have decided to actively reorganize junk shipping as a substitute and to facilitate freight transportation. It is reported that, regarding this plan, a Sino-Japanese joint venture operating organization will be established for control purposes. The details and organization of this operating organization are still under consideration, but it is known that it will be jointly organized by important government figures, powerful Chinese businessmen, and Japanese-Chinese shipping companies. The capital is set at 300 million yuan. After the establishment of the organization, it will mobilize all junks in Central China to strengthen the transportation of materials to various places.

In addition, the East Asia Shipping Company is also preparing to use junks to operate in the Yangtze River and southern regions as a test for future regular navigation. Once the Sino-Japanese joint venture operating organization is established, everything can be presented in a controlled state.

Recently, as the deadline is approaching, the Real Estate Industry Association of this city, for the convenience of consulting with colleagues, if there are any unclear procedures, can inquire with the Association's Deed Section for detailed information to ensure the safety of property rights.

Deadline for Changing Land Registers

The authorities handle applications for the release of enemy property in the name of permitting the exchange of Japanese registration deeds, and after issuing the title deed, it is allowed to end on February 10th. It is heard that the title deed or land deed after the release of enemy management can be used as loan collateral. As for the genuine enemy title deed or joint-stock company, some of the shares belong to enemy nationals, and some belong to Chinese and neutral nationals. The authorities will also screen them. The screening period will be after the completion of the release of enemy property in the name of non-enemy nationals.

### Police Authorities Carry Out the Ban on Shed Stalls

Since the Municipal Council decided to prohibit the roadside stalls, it is dealing with the hawkers on Nanjing Road, Fourth Road, Zhejiang Road, Shandong Road and other places, and said that if they are found again in the future, their municipal certificates will be confiscated and they will be expelled from the country. At the same time, it is also learned that the police authorities will also prohibit the sheds and stalls set up on the empty land borrowed from the factory in the west, because this kind of sheds and stalls not only obstruct traffic and municipal appearance, but also have sanitation problems. Therefore, the responsible authorities have ordered the Baojia Association to forward orders to the factories to demolish all of them before the end of this month. If there are any resisters, they will report to the competent authorities at any time and impose severe punishments.

### Rationing of Food by Population in West Shanghai

### Sharp Increase in the Price of Cigarettes and Daily Necessities, Market Reopening Postponed

The Shanghai cigarette and daily necessities market, which was voluntarily closed by the industry association since last winter, originally planned to officially reopen last Monday. At the same time, the admission passes for registered colleagues have also been issued and 18 market supervisors have been appointed. However, the prices of cigarettes and daily necessities have been rising sharply recently, and there is deep concern that once the market resumes, speculators will still mix in and manipulate market prices, leading to punishment by the authorities. Therefore, it has been voluntarily decided to postpone the reopening and post a notice stating that the industry association will not be responsible for any accidents that occur in off-site transactions by colleagues before the market reopens.

### German Ambassador's Views on Economic Agreements with Axis Countries

A Dongmeng News Agency report from this city states that the newly appointed German Ambassador to Japan, Stahmer, after arriving in Shanghai from Beijing, is currently staying at the International Hotel. After completing preparations, he will go to Tokyo to take office. Yesterday, the Ambassador spoke to a Dongmeng News Agency reporter about the economic agreements concluded by Japan with Germany and Italy, saying that the agreements are proof that the foundations of the Axis Pact concluded by the three countries are working smoothly. The economic agreements are of great significance for completing the war efforts of the three Axis countries. He was very pleased to hear that Japan and Germany signed a new agreement on economic cooperation at the headquarters of the German head of state, and that Japan and Italy also concluded a similar agreement in Rome. This agreement is successful and important for the countries concerned, especially Japan, Germany, and Italy. It will use all industrial and economic resources of Japan and the Axis countries to ensure the victorious conclusion of this war. After arriving in Japan to take office, he will do his best to enable close cooperation between Japan and Germany, so as to seek the complete victory of the war as soon as possible.

### Japan and France Agree to Exchange Settlements

The Japanese Information Bureau announced the bulletin of the exchange of settlement documents between the Japanese and French governments, which was welcomed by the financial circles in this city, and it is expected that the trade relations between Central China and French Vietnam will increase. Since the outbreak of the current war, the commercial relations between Central China and the United Kingdom and the United States have been blocked, and it has had to rely on various regions in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam, for trade. However, there are many obstacles in terms of settlement accounts. Now that Japan and France have agreed to use the Japanese yen as the basis for Vietnam's settlement with other regions of East Asia, the financial circles expect that there will be no more difficulties in the future, and have opened the way for Central China to trade more actively with various regions in Southeast Asia, especially Vietnam will increase its rice exports to Central China. If Vietnam's exports exceed its imports from Japan, the new settlement method will offset it with Central China's exports to Vietnam. If Central China has a trade surplus with Vietnam due to the import of rice, Japan or other regions in East Asia can also increase their exports to Vietnam to offset it.

### Trade Section of the Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry to Discuss Future Policies

This huge amount of cotton goods will enable Shanghai to maintain its reputation as a major economic center and help stabilize the economy of Central China, putting Shanghai in an advantageous position to exchange agricultural products with the interior. It is found that the total amount of cotton cloth and cotton yarn registered by the authorities in this city since December 10 last year is 700,000 bales (officially estimated at 350,000 to 450,000 bales), of which 200,000 bales were registered with the Japanese Consulate General in Shanghai, 400,000 bales were registered with the Municipal Council and the French Public Works Bureau, and 100,000 bales were held by yarn factories and unregistered.

### Axis Ships Anchored in the Huangpu River Undergo Charter Negotiations Handled by the Imperial Shipping Company

When the European War broke out in the autumn of 1939, Axis ships sailing in the Far East sailed to various ports in China, Japan, and Manchuria. Afterwards, Japan, with the expansion of the war and the increase in the demand for ships, organized the Imperial Shipping Company to be responsible for chartering Axis ships in various regions and achieved considerable success. However, the ships in various parts of Central China were not included in the charter. Recently, the Japanese side, with a greater need for ships than before, plans to have the Imperial Shipping Company come forward again to charter the Conte Verde and other ships anchored in Shanghai and other places from the Axis countries. The charter negotiations are underway.

### The Way to Preserve Wealth (1)

— Nie Yuntai

The author of this article, Mr. Nie Yuntai, is a man of high age and virtue, who is happy to do good. In recent years, he has studied Buddhism intensively, and his compassion has increased. He lives a simple life, eating simple food and dressing plainly, and uses the surplus to donate to society, taking from society and using it for society. He is able to gather and scatter, and actively do good. It is heard that Mr. Nie's family has prospered for seven generations, which is enough to see that accumulating virtue is not accidental. Even if he does not accumulate money for his descendants, his descendants can continue his aspirations and stand out, which is enough to give our outlook on life a new inspiration. The following article fully expounds the principles of "accumulating money" and "doing good", citing facts that are vivid and lifelike. Every word and sentence is written from the experience and taste. I hope that readers will pay more attention, it is fortunate.

It is not difficult to get rich. It is most difficult to preserve wealth. I have lived in Shanghai for more than 50 years and have seen many people get rich. After getting rich, some fail in less than five or ten years; some fail in twenty or thirty years; and some fail completely in forty or fifty years. I remember that most of the wealthy people who interacted with my late father, whether officials or businessmen, were prominent for a while, but now most of them have withered, their families have declined, some of their children have squandered everything, engaged in prostitution and gambling and not doing their proper business, and some have disappeared without a trace of their children and grandchildren. Counting on your fingers, among the wealthy people of forty or fifty years, it is rare to find one or two families whose family affairs have not completely failed and whose children can study, engage in proper business, and make progress. This is not unique to Shanghai. The same is true in my hometown of Hunan. In the Guangxu era, there were six or seven families of wealthy people who were conferred titles, twenty or thirty governors and governors-general, and fifty or sixty generals. Now, most of them have declined. Among them, there are many civil officials, with relatively little property, and their descendants are better. As far as I know: such as the Zeng, Zuo, Peng, and Li families. The one with the least money, the descendants are relatively more able to study and serve the society with academics. The great-grandchildren of Zeng Wenzheng have six or seven graduates from domestic and foreign universities, and three are university professors. Several great-grandchildren of Zuo Wenxiang are also specialized in science, and the grandchildren and great-grandchildren of Li Yongyi have university professors, and the great-grandchildren are mostly university graduates. The descendants of Peng Gangzhi had an official in Shanghai ten years ago. Probably, the money at that time came from the right path, and there was no intention of accumulating money for their descendants, so their descendants were relatively virtuous and talented. The remaining ten or so civil officials with relatively more money, most of their descendants are now in decline. Dozens of military officers were all richer than civil officials at that time, with 100,000 or 200,000 (most of them made their fortunes by pacifying wars and continuing to command troops, and they could fill vacancies). There were only three or four with five or six hundred thousand, nearly one million. Such as Guo, Xi, and Yang, etc., all returned from military affairs in Shaanxi, Gansu, Yunnan, and Guizhou. When Jinling was recovered, Wenzheng urgently dismissed the Xiang Army because of its twilight atmosphere. The Huai Army was used to suppress the Nian rebels, so very few of the old Xiang Army generals were rich). Most of the descendants of each family have also declined, and it is rare to hear of those who can study and make progress. My family and the major families of the Zhongxing, Xiang or Huai, are mostly related, so we know a little about the rise and fall of each family. As for the major families of civil and military officials in Anhui, who were richer than the Xiang Army, they are now all withered and unbearable to look back on. In just a few decades, only three generations have passed down, and they are all like fleeting clouds. However, a few families who were unwilling to get rich and did not accumulate money for their descendants have many excellent descendants. The smartest one was Zeng Wenzheng, who had the highest position and the greatest power. He was in office for 20 years, and when he died, he only had 20,000 taels of silver. Except for the old house in the countryside, he did not build a mansion in the province, and did not buy an acre of land. He created the Lianghuai salt ticket, priced it extremely favorably, and the interest was very high (the ticket price was 200 taels, and later it sold for 20,000 taels, with an annual rental income of 3,000 or 4,000 taels. At that time, a family with a salt ticket was called a wealthy family). The public specifically discussed that the Zeng family was not allowed to inherit it. Many years after the public passed away, none of the descendants had a salt ticket. If it were to be registered under some other name, it would be extremely easy to receive one or two hundred tickets. Moreover, it is in accordance with the regulations, and it does not violate the law on the surface. However, taking advantage of the power and position to engage in private affairs, the villain thinks it is harmless, but the gentleman does not do it. My mother knew the details of this matter at that time, and few outsiders knew about it. As the Doctrine of the Mean says: "What the superior man cannot attain is just this: what is not to be seen in what he does." This is called consistency between appearance and reality, which is the foundation of Chinese political science. Without this foundation, all political roads will not work. Modern political scientists must pay attention.

### Japanese Insurance Companies Plan to Strictly Control the Insurance Industry, Chinese Insurance Companies Compete with Each Other, Insurance Premiums for Various Items are Too Uneven

Since last year, the establishment of insurance companies in this city has been like bamboo shoots after a rain, totaling more than 80 companies. However, most of them have unsound internal mechanisms, and the total amount of capital is only 60 to 70 million yuan. Each company ranges from several hundred thousand yuan to several million yuan, with an average of less than one million yuan per company. Moreover, they compete with each other for business, and the premiums for water insurance, fire insurance, and life insurance are all inconsistent. As for the Japanese insurance companies in Shanghai, there are a total of 14 companies. It is now learned that Japanese insurance companies, in order to unify insurance operations, plan to inform the Chinese insurance industry association and the insurance company supervision bureau newly established at the end of last year to strictly control them and strictly set insurance rates.

### Public Bonds Fluctuated

Yesterday, the public bond market initially showed signs of excitement, and market prices rose slowly. Later, due to continued pressure from sellers, it trended downward again, fluctuating without settling. People's hearts were confused. According to the current environment, it seemed that it should turn slightly higher, but it was restricted by the financial situation, making it unable to struggle. Yesterday, the Class C initial market was as high as 2.2 yuan, showing signs of rising. Then, pressure came again, and the price was again seen at 1.3 yuan, and finally at 1.56 yuan. Class E was 0.45 yuan, Class A was 1.4 yuan, and the rest were out of the market.

### Military Tickets are Flat, United Banknotes Rise

Yesterday morning, the interest rate of the Qianye Guild was still 1.7 cents and had not changed.

Yesterday, military tickets were flatter, with a peer-to-peer trading price of 5.5535 yuan, and the buying and selling prices for money shops and small money houses were 5.55 yuan and 6 yuan, also flat. Operators of the United Banknotes sold for 3.78 yuan and bought in for 3.73 yuan, up 3 cents.

### Woolen Industry Applies to Raise the Price Limit

Woolen cloth is difficult to obtain due to high raw material prices, and the cost is high and production is low due to electricity restrictions. The market is increasing day by day, gradually exceeding the price limit. Therefore, the industry discussed and requested the authorities to raise the previous price limit by 30%. It is heard that they have tentatively agreed to add 15%, and it is still under negotiation.

### Soap Price Increase Has Not Abated, Industry Association Market Postpones Reopening

The daily necessities market was voluntarily closed by the industry association since last winter, and it was originally planned to officially reopen last Monday. However, since the prices of daily necessities have been rising sharply, the industry association authorities are deeply concerned that once the market resumes, market prices will still be easily manipulated. Therefore, it has voluntarily decided to postpone the reopening and posted a notice outside the industry association yesterday, stating that the industry association authorities will not be responsible for off-site transactions by colleagues before the reopening. The prices of daily necessities yesterday are listed below:

The actual price of soap is still trending upward. Because of the lack of raw materials and the suspension of distribution, although miscellaneous brands are flooding the market, raw materials are very difficult to obtain, so production has also decreased, and the selling price is high. Yesterday, the market price of Guben soap continued to rise to 760 yuan per box, Baixiangmao soap 700 yuan, Huangxiangmao soap 640 yuan, and Scissor soap 730 yuan.

### Cigarette Tax Levied Based on Value: Factory Prices Approaching Market Prices

The rise in cigarette prices has stabilized, as the widely rumored tax increase issue has been announced by the authorities. The original plan to levy both the consolidated cigarette tax and the temporary special tax has been changed, with the temporary special tax being abolished and replaced by a value-based tax, still divided into five grades. Subsequently, the factory wholesale prices are quite similar to the current retail prices, which has somewhat calmed the public's fears, and buying and selling are becoming balanced. The prices are as follows: British American Tobacco's "Great Britain" brand is 11,300 yuan, "Old Knife" brand is 9,000 yuan, "Pinhai" brand is 7,500 yuan, "Wuhua" brand is 6,500 yuan, "Little Fairy" brand is 8,000 yuan, Japanese Tobacco's "Golden Gun" brand is 3,050 yuan, "Golden Building" is 3,800 yuan, "Red Rose" is 2,700 yuan, "Quanlu" brand is 3,450 yuan, "Nianzhi" is 3,100 yuan, "Zhinan" brand is 2,900 yuan, National Tobacco's "Pyramid" brand is 6,400 yuan, "Beautiful" brand is 5,700 yuan, "Golden Mouse" brand is 4,000 yuan, and "White Golden Dragon" is 4,100 yuan. High-quality goods, whether canned or boxed, are mostly reliant on foreign imports. With the lack of raw materials for local production, factories have stopped production for a long time, relying entirely on existing stock to meet demand. Therefore, those who have stock are bound to hoard and demand high prices, making it difficult for prices to fall. For example, 50-stick cigars cost 50,000 yuan, "Great South Gate" is 40,000 yuan, "3-5" brand is 41,000 yuan, "Big Cannon Platform" is 23,000 yuan, and "Small Cannon Platform" is 14,000 yuan, all per 10,000 sticks. However, prices have fallen considerably from their peaks.

### Rising Star - Aluminum

— Written by Liming

"It's white and somewhat shiny, definitely not made of copper or iron, but it's not tinplate either. It's not as soft as tinplate!"

"It's a bit like the tin pots we use at home for soup!"

The material for modern transportation tools that shorten space, and war weapons that blast enemy fortifications - airplanes, is mainly made of this stuff.

This is not surprising. It is difficult for us to have a lasting impression of this metal in our minds. It is neither copper nor iron, nor aluminum or zinc (tinplate is made of zinc), it is white with a crystalline shine, but very light, so it is used to make the outer shell and parts of airplanes. This is an advantage that none of the metals we know has. Everyone knows that metal materials are always heavy and bulky.

Therefore, in today's environment where "nothing is more urgent than air defense," this light and shiny metal has become the most popular thing. Its name is - "Aluminum."

In fact, aluminum's formal birth and discovery by humans was only about forty years ago. However, it was "born at the right time," fitting the needs of the modern aviation industry. In just a few decades, it has become the most popular metal, while copper and iron, which were discovered and used by ancient humans long ago, have faded into obscurity. Therefore, we often say: "Aluminum is the rising star among metals."

Among the various metals that humans can use, aluminum is one of the latest to be discovered. But in reality, aluminum is not a rare thing. According to the results of actual surveys and research, among the various metals contained in the 60-kilometer-thick crust, aluminum has the largest reserves. If the reserves of copper are taken as 1, then nickel is 10, magnesium is 1200, iron is 2200, and aluminum is 4000, which shows its abundance.

The reason why aluminum could not appear earlier is mostly due to the difficulties in manufacturing. Because aluminum's chemical properties are very active, its oxides cannot be reduced by ordinary carbon. So, the first production of elemental aluminum was achieved by the reaction of metallic potassium with aluminum chloride. Metallic potassium itself is a very expensive chemical, and the aluminum produced was sold at a higher price of over 160 gold yuan per pound. Later, although there were some improvements in manufacturing methods, it still could not be used as a common and practical material.

In 1886, the American Hall first experimented with producing aluminum by electrolysis. It was not until 1890 that it achieved complete success. Due to the simplicity and low cost of the electrolysis method, the application of aluminum has increased day by day. In recent years, it has shown a trend of surpassing copper and iron. Whether in transportation, manufacturing, national defense, or other industrial sectors, aluminum is an indispensable and important raw material.

The specific gravity of aluminum is about 2.7. In commerce, the purity of aluminum is usually from 98% to 99.5%. The remaining impurities are mostly copper, iron, and sand. As a result of advances in metallurgy in recent years, the purest aluminum can reach 99.998%.

The main uses of pure aluminum are as follows:

(1) Used in the steelmaking industry - Adding aluminum to copper can remove residual gases in the steel to obtain solid steel ingots. Also, aluminum increases the fluidity of molten steel, so aluminum can be used to obtain more precise and complex steel castings.

(2) Used in welding engineering - Aluminum has a strong affinity for oxygen. If aluminum powder and oxidizing agents (such as iron oxide, potassium chlorate, etc.) are evenly mixed, they can undergo oxidation and combustion, with a combustion temperature reaching 5400 degrees, far above the melting point of steel. So, using aluminum to weld steel has a multiplier effect. A certain type of newly made British incendiary bomb is made of aluminum and iron oxide. It burns at extremely high temperatures, and ordinary water hoses and chemical foam fire extinguishers cannot put it out.

(3) Pure aluminum is extremely difficult to combine with air; in chemical terms, it has strong "corrosion resistance." So, aluminum is often used to make better daily utensils and scientific instruments.

(4) Used in the electrical industry - Aluminum's conductivity is quite high, about 60% of that of copper, which is much better than common metals such as iron, zinc, and nickel. Therefore, aluminum wires are often used for the transmission of high-voltage electricity. Moreover, if a steel wire is inserted into the center of an aluminum woven strand, the tensile strength of the resulting "steel-core aluminum strand" can be several times greater than that of ordinary copper wire.

Because aluminum has high corrosion resistance, it is not easily corroded even in seawater, which is much better than other metals. This is quite important in the shipbuilding industry. When aluminum is exposed to air, it is easily oxidized by the oxygen in the air to form a layer of oxide film on the surface. The structure of this oxide film is very dense, which can protect the inner layer and prevent it from continuing to be oxidized. This is indeed a piece of luck for aluminum itself, because if oxidation could continue to the inside, then aluminum would become a useless thing in industry, so how could it be so important now?

In addition to the advantages mentioned above, there is another feature that everyone knows, that is, aluminum is the lightest metal. This makes it an important raw material in the aircraft industry.

But in fact, the problem is not so simple. Pure aluminum has a big disadvantage: it is not hard. Airplanes must be prepared to withstand bullets fired by the enemy at any time, and the outer shell cannot be made of tofu. In this regard, steel is the most suitable, but unfortunately, it is too heavy, and airplanes cannot "afford" it. So, the aircraft industry still wants to use this light metal aluminum, but if this soft aluminum cannot be hardened, aluminum will also be discarded like steel.

This difficulty was quickly resolved, that is, by combining aluminum with other appropriate metals and specifying appropriate components to form an "alloy," which can become an ideal metal that is light, hard, and durable. This is the so-called "aluminum alloy." (Donations to Relief Fund)

### Thoughts on the Play "Rainbow Garment Melody"

— Mang Ci

Mr. Yao Ke introduced himself in the special issue: "Rainbow Garment Melody is a pretty good thriller." What is a thriller! According to Mr. Yao's explanation, it does not pay attention to characterization, but focuses purely on "novel plot and tight staging."

Whether this definition of a thriller is valid is left aside; based on my impression after watching it, I think it is very vulgar, at best, just a very inferior American movie. People who are used to watching movies can imagine it with their eyes closed, so where is the "novelty"? A detective catching a robber, this is the G-man type; a bandit's den meets a beauty, this is the boy-meets-girl formula; and finally, plus a happy ending: in short, this is a full of Yankee gimmicks. It can be called a gimmick, but to boast about it as "pretty good," then I have to admire Mr. Yao's boldness.

We might as well quote a few of the most wonderful lines here:

Abao: Wearing pajamas to meet guests is good, but I'm afraid the young men who haven't married will feel a little, you know.

Hongying: How do you know he's not married?

Abao: If he was married, he would definitely not come so early tomorrow morning; he can't get up...

Enough! These few lines are enough to make people feel a little, you know.

Mr. Yao Ke is constantly clarifying that his thriller cannot be judged by "consciousness," but isn't the above the expression of "rascal consciousness"? It must be known that the word consciousness is not just about shouting two sentences "You are a bright girl," but is revealed in the author's words, and cannot be covered up no matter how hard you try. Although Mr. Yao peddles "thriller"... and that set of new terms from America, he should at least be responsible for audience education. If we say that fresh forms should be introduced, then are Vaudeville (boring dance dramas) and burlesque (thigh dances) in America also acceptable?

Taking a step back, even if we affirm that the path Mr. Yao is taking is correct, there is still a problem here: how should "rationalization" be discussed in the script? Mr. Yao said: "... do not demand absolute truthfulness and rationalization of the plot, as long as it is not too absurd and unreasonable." This is tantamount to saying nothing. Because he has not given a clear definition of rationalization.

My opinion is the opposite; if it is a good work, the plot can be unreasonable. Faust, do we really believe that he would deal with the devil? The family in "Swiss Family Robinson," do we really believe that they would suffer losses from the old king? The advantage of "artistic exaggeration" is to use unreal events to arouse a deeper understanding of reality. However, we can only say that the unrealism of "Rainbow Garment Melody" is childish!

Mr. Yao pays close attention to the small Guan programs (such as "Butterfly Returns to Its Original State" and "Volunteer Drama," how he can think of it!), but the entire play structure is extremely far-fetched, with contradictions everywhere. As soon as Sun Yuting comes up, he has a falling out with Hongying. In principle, he would never let go of the fat meat that he has already obtained lightly, but Hongying lies that Ling Yun is her fiancé, and Sun Yuting walks away and ignores it. After walking away, he sends people to monitor and inquire... As the leader of a private smuggler, how can he be as naive as a child? Ling Yun's attitude is also strangely strange. At first, he is unwilling to be the fiancé. Later, Hongying tells him that the news has spread, but he agrees. The extent to which Hongying is afraid of Sun Yuting is also elusive... In short, the relationship between Sun Yuting, Hongying, and Ling Yun is completely a messy account that cannot be cleared.

In terms of actors, Qiao Qi's portrayal of Ling Yun, who is a crude character, is commendable. The rest is not worth talking about. The most problematic is Gong Jiabao and Zhou Jing, who plays Abao. Abao is a female servant, but Zhou Jing has permed hair and lipstick, and from a distance, she is more beautiful than the protagonist Bai Hong. Gong Jiabao's body is like a rattle drum, constantly swaying while talking.

There are three interludes, but my "heart" is not used to "sitting in a sofa chair," so I really can't hear the good in them.

Finally, I do not particularly agree with Mr. Yao's use of Shaw's self-proclaimed bragging title. Shaw has his works to guarantee it; those who use Shaw as a talisman should also reflect on themselves: whether they have works worth bragging about like Shaw.

### The Greatest Teacher of All Time

— Written by James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

In such matters, about ten times, on one occasion, he was stubborn and would not listen to advice. In almost half of these exceptions, he later regretted not having listened to her advice. Years later, whenever he had trouble with a student, he often recalled these events and his heart would soften; the child would be there waiting to hear his punishment, but she would tell him that all was well. But he never guessed that Chips was remembering something that had happened long before he was born; he never guessed that Chips was thinking: Little rascal, I can't think of any reason to let him go, but I'm sure she can!

But she did not always ask for forgiveness. Rarely, when Chips was inclined to pardon, she would advocate for a severe punishment. "I don't like his looks, Chips, he's too self-confident. If he's going to cause trouble, I'll be sure to give him trouble."

Buried deep in the past were many small events that had once been critical issues, once intense debates, anecdotes that were interesting to remember. When the last trace of emotion has disappeared from human memory, does any emotion really matter? If it does matter, then how many emotions are firmly attached to him, refusing to let go before they dissipate! He must be polite to them, he must cherish them before they sleep forever. For example, the resignation of Alger! That was a strange thing. There was also the incident about the rat; Old Ogilvie put it in the organ loft while he was conducting the choir rehearsal. Ogilvie died, and Dunster drowned in Jutland; perhaps most of the people who saw or heard the incident have already forgotten it. This incident, and many others, seemed to have happened centuries ago. He suddenly saw in his imagination millions of children, teachers generation after generation since the Elizabethan era; the history of Brookfield could be considered long, but no basic records were left behind.

### The Rickshaw Puller Owns His Own Rickshaw

— Guan

Rickshaw pullers, in the current Shanghai occupational circle, are in fact a profession that can still make a living. However, they run all day long, in heat and cold, and only get enough to eat. Their lives are not guaranteed, and they deserve sympathy.

At a certain gathering, I heard the opinion of an elder. He said that the only way to guarantee the lives of rickshaw pullers is through saving. For example, currently, a rickshaw puller rents a rickshaw from the owner and has to pay a rental fee of two yuan per day. In this two yuan, the owner should be required to extract ten cents, and the rickshaw puller should also take out ten cents, put them together for savings. If calculated with interest on interest, after three years, there will be enough savings for a rickshaw, after five years, there will be enough for two rickshaws, and after ten years, the rickshaw puller will become a rickshaw owner, achieving "the rickshaw puller owns his own rickshaw," at which time his life will be guaranteed. This is a very concrete and reasonable method, and if rickshaw pullers can unite and implement it, it will not be difficult.

In fact, this method has already been implemented in many general institutions or organizations. That is, a certain percentage of the employees' salaries are deducted daily for savings, and the institution or organization subsidizes a portion, called co-savings. After a considerable period, the amount is indeed considerable. This kind of mutually beneficial labor-capital method should be actively promoted.
