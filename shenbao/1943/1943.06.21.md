### Crushing the Anglo-American Diplomatic Conspiracy

The situation of the international war is advancing towards a decisive stage day by day. Having suffered heavy blows in the Pacific, Britain and the United States, although constantly clamoring to attack Europe, and even extravagantly talking about a counter-offensive in the Pacific, in reality have no strength to carry out adventures. Therefore, their activities are still not relaxed in the political and diplomatic spheres. Britain and the United States, with their traditional cunning international conspiracy policy, do not dare to engage in frontal warfare, but attempt to win by trickery through diplomatic conspiracies. For their own victory, they have constantly sacrificed the interests of other countries and the interests of their allies. Before the Second European War, they sacrificed Czechoslovakia. Since the war, they have sacrificed the military strength of France, Canada, India, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union. Even between Britain and the United States, they are constantly deceiving and evading each other. Not long ago, the Washington Ro-Chu talks quietly ended without gaining the trust of Stalin, and the brevity of the conclusions was the opposite of the sensationalism before the talks, fully revealing the shadows among the anti-Axis countries. Precisely because of this, they are exaggerating and publicizing news such as the concentration of landing ships in a certain port or bay, the transfer of large numbers of troops in a certain place, and fierce air battles, while using political and diplomatic conspiracies to replace military offensives.

We can see that the political and diplomatic offensive of Britain and the United States is concentrated on the following three points: First, a diplomatic conspiracy against the Soviet Union centered on a counter-offensive in the Pacific, attempting to exchange the Soviet Union's concession of the Far East region as an air force base for Britain and the United States, and then open a second front in Europe. This was originally an attempt that the United States and even Chongqing had dreamed of for many years but had not realized. The US conspiracy against the Soviet Union has always been noticed by all parties, and warnings have been constantly issued to the Soviet Union. The Soviet Union, which has greatly depleted its strength after two full years of arduous fighting, even if it is so foolish as not to see the deceptive nature of this greed of the United States, is in fact impossible to wage war on the eastern border and act as a cat's paw for Britain and the United States. The first diplomatic conspiracy of Britain and the United States is bound to encounter complete failure. The second is to launch political work against European countries, threatening to sacrifice the opening of a second front in Europe at all costs. The main aspect of this work is naturally placed in Turkey and Spain first. As early as after the Casablanca Conference, Churchill paid a visit to Turkey. Not long ago, the British Middle East Army Commander-in-Chief Wilson, and now British Admiral Cunningham, visited the Turkish government one after another, nothing more than threats and inducements, attempting to get Turkey to allow the anti-Axis forces to use Turkish territory and troops to attack the Balkans and other places. Secondly, there are activities against Spain, as pointed out by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun on June 12: "They also want to form Anglo-American special forces on the border of Spanish and French Morocco. The purpose of this army probably has political significance, attempting to overthrow General Franco's dictatorship, support the Spanish free democracy movement, establish a new government organized by pro-British people, or establish a monarchy. French Morocco is currently gathering various Spanish opposition parties to form a democratic volunteer army, which also shows this tendency."

In addition to the increasing political activities against neutral countries, the third conspiracy is to incite political turmoil in the military control and political rule areas of the European Axis countries. The most important tool they use is the rumor of "peace", attempting to use this to create the so-called second and third "Darland." To create a series of political incidents and even incite armed rebellions, in order to shake people's hearts and the order in the rear of the Axis countries, as pointed out by the Japanese Asahi Shimbun editorial on the 11th of this month. These conspiracies are actually nothing more than despicable activities taken by the British and American authorities because of their military weakness, and naturally will not produce much effect. However, at the same time, we cannot fail to be vigilant that the small countries in Europe are currently facing extremely serious crises. Each of them has to cope with increasingly fierce and brutal bombings, and at the same time, they must strengthen the strength of the domestic front. At present, Italy is under the most cruel test. The bombings of the Italian mainland and the large and small islands in the Mediterranean are intensifying. Especially since the fall of Pantelleria Island, the brutality of the air raids has been invading Italy with the fierce tools of nerve warfare. However, Italy, which has been participating in the war for exactly three years, is strengthening its unity with Japan and Germany. Everyone is holding the determination to win the final victory and will not have the slightest wavering or division under the bombing. We believe that the Italians, who once created the opportunity for the European Renaissance and have long been admired in the world's national liberation struggle, will certainly not waver or bow their heads in front of difficulties or enemies.

All the political and diplomatic conspiracies of the enemy must fail. The evolution of the Argentine coup is gradually becoming unfavorable to the United States. The development of the anti-British and American struggle in Honduras, the development of the anti-British and American movement in India, the lack of thorough coordination within the French National Committee jointly formed by Girod and de Gaulle in North Africa, and even Stalin's resolute rejection of the United States' use of the Far East as a base of operations, can all be said to be the beginning of the failure of the entire British and American political and diplomatic conspiracy. The most important force that can give a decisive blow to the Anglo-American conspiracy is the unity and seamless cooperation of the large and small countries in the Pacific, the development of military cooperation, and the development of production and construction, as clearly declared by Prime Minister Tojo of the friendly country at the opening of the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet on the 16th of this month. We must move towards the path of defeating Britain and the United States and establish the foundation for the inevitable victory of the East Asian national liberation movement. The spirit and practice of our East Asian nations' sincere unity, cooperation, and shared life and death will surely stimulate Europe and serve as a model for them to crush the enemy's conspiracies. In the decisive battle in the future, the seamless unity of the Eastern nations will naturally lay the foundation for the final victory. However, despite this, we still cannot fail to call on the Eastern nations to pay attention. The political conspiracies that Britain and the United States are secretly active in various parts of Europe will certainly not extend their claws to East Asia at the same time. We must always be vigilant, everyone must be serious and tense, strengthen unity, thoroughly crush the enemy's nerve offensive and diplomatic conspiracies, expose any conspiracies of the enemy in East Asia, and give them a head-on blow, and then we will guarantee the final victory against Britain and the United States.

### Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee Held Appointment Ceremony Yesterday, Commander Kuroda Hosted a Banquet for Service Corps Representatives, Praising the Filipino People's Efforts to Build a New Philippines

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines announced the matter of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee at 11:00 a.m. on the 20th, saying: The supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines recently approved the personnel selected by the Special All-Island Congress of the New Philippine Service Corps to form the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee and ordered them to proceed with the preparation of the Philippines' independence as soon as possible. The chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee is Laurel, the first vice chairman is Avanceña, the second vice chairman is Aquino, and there are a total of 18 preparatory members.

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The appointment ceremony for the preparatory members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee was solemnly held at the official residence of the Supreme Commander at 11:00 a.m. today. At that time, 20 preparatory members (Chairman Laurel was absent due to illness) gathered in the hall of the official residence. The Japanese dispatch army, led by Supreme Commander Kuroda and more than 20 military and political supervisors, also attended. The meeting started on time. First, Supreme Commander Kuroda read out the appointment letter, and then Vice Chairman Avanceña represented Chairman Laurel to express the determination to advance the independence movement. The appointment ceremony was then concluded, and everyone toasted together, wishing the future well.

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - Kuroda, the army commander of the Philippines, hosted a banquet at noon on the 20th to entertain more than 100 representatives of the New Philippine Service Corps, praising the Filipino people's efforts to build a new Philippines, and hoping that they would continue to make progress in the future to achieve their goals.

The New Life Service Corps Has More Than 600,000 Members

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines has now broken free from the shackles of the United States and Spain for 400 years, and will complete its glorious independence as a young member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The New Life Philippine Service Corps is a national organization with the spirit of restoring East Asia in the Philippines. Since its establishment, it has only been half a year, but it has already launched active activities. On the 18th of this month, it was ordered by the Japanese dispatch army to the Philippines to organize a committee and become the mother body for realizing independence. Its political importance is particularly noteworthy. Because the organizational program of the Philippine Bird Service Corps is to unite all the people of the island, actively assist the Japanese military administration, and increase common welfare. In other words, its goal is to unify the activities and service capabilities of the current social, cultural, and economic groups, completely eliminate Anglo-American colors, and cultivate the inherent virtues of East Asia, such as honesty, prudence, devotion to public service, diligence, and sacrifice, and improve physical strength to restore it to a healthy East Asian nation. Its organizational regulations stipulate that men and women over the age of 18 are qualified to join the group. The president is held by Director Vargas. The current number of members has exceeded 600,000. Since its establishment, the group has become an ideological and cultural group and has not involved political colors at all. In accordance with the principles proposed by the military and political supervisor that are conducive to the Philippines' implementation of independence, it actively assists the military administration in ensuring security, reorganizing the economy to seek local self-sufficiency, and restoring the spirit of East Asia. This is a concrete movement guideline for the Philippine Service Corps. The Philippine Service Corps is correcting the wrong concept of relying on Britain and the United States, restoring the original state of East Asians, and implementing the concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Since launching a enthusiastic enlightenment campaign and shouting "Philippine security should be maintained by the Philippine people," the general Filipino people have been able to automatically assist the Japanese army in ensuring security. In addition, a central security committee has been added to the executive government. All of this has made great contributions to the establishment of security. As for the reorganization of the economic movement, in order to complete the five-year food production increase plan, it has mobilized the labor force of the members and participated in food collection activities. A labor personnel training center was established in May of this year to provide labor personnel with spiritual education to cultivate the virtues of diligence. In addition, rural groups have been established to provide active assistance. A healthy people's movement has been launched, sports equipment has been added, and radio has been popularized. The welfare business has also been greatly revitalized. The activities of the Philippine Service Corps have recently become more active and concrete. After Prime Minister Tojo personally visited the Philippines, the emotions of the Philippine people in seeking the rapid realization of independence became more激揚, and they shouted "Contribute our blood." In summary, we can know that the Philippine Service Corps is the mother body for the birth of the new Philippine country. Its mission is very important, and it has changed from a past ideological and cultural group to a political character.

### Philippine Thanksgiving Assembly Vargas Speech

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - The Thanksgiving Independence Public Assembly hosted by the New Philippine Labor Service Corps was held in Manila at 5:00 p.m. on the 19th. No less than 300,000 people participated in the conference, an unprecedented grand occasion. The military and political supervisors and other ministers attended. Vargas, the president of the New Philippine Labor Service Corps, and others gave speeches to the crowd at the conference. The crowd was extremely excited. The conference then closed in a joyous voice.

Manila, 20th (Central News Agency) - On the second day of the Philippine Service Corps National Congress on the 19th, Vargas, the president of the group, delivered a speech, mainly saying: Today, the "bright day has begun" for our beloved motherland, the Philippines. The entire Philippines is full of joy, which is a happy thing. This glorious independence will be realized within the year due to the lenient measures taken by Japan. Recalling that we were previously used by the United States and mistakenly resisted the Japanese army, we now have no right to demand independence from Japan. However, Japan is helping us as a brotherly country, making us a member of the big family composed of East Asian countries. First, it allows us to be independent and declares that it will be realized within the year. We Filipinos should repay Japan's kindness with sincerity. I dare to say that Japan has assisted the independence of the Philippines in the past. Therefore, after independence, the Philippines should permanently share weal and woe, live and die together with Japan. Today, in addition to thanking God, we also thank Japan, and we are determined to move forward together with Japan in the future.

### Japanese Army Attacks, War Results of the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing

Hankou, (Central News Agency) - The troops of Li Zongren of Chongqing (Fifth War Zone), in order to contain the Japanese army's summer offensive this time, actively counter-attacked in the area north of Yingcheng. However, after suffering repeated heavy blows from the Japanese army, they retreated northward in panic. On June 2, when a certain unit of the Japanese army attacked the Chongqing "122nd Division of the 41st Army" which was counter-attacking north of Yingcheng, it encircled and struck the 3,000 Chongqing troops at the Tianwang Temple Heights 14 kilometers east of Jingshan. On June 6, it defeated the Chongqing "127th Division of the 45th Army" near Renhedian, 32 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng, forcing them to flee into the mountains to the north. Although the Japanese army reversed its direction, it still seized the opportunity to counter-attack at any time. Therefore, at dawn on the 13th, with the cooperation of the aviation unit, it encircled the Chongqing troops from three aspects: Jiadian Renhedian and Leigongdian, 32 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng. It launched a brave annihilation battle on the evening of the 14th, completely crushing the Chongqing army's attempt. The war results obtained by the Japanese army in that area were that Chongqing abandoned 856 corpses, and 175 people were captured. The Japanese army seized three mortars, eight heavy machine guns, 132 rifles, and other light machine gun parts, various bullets and medicines, etc.

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) - Since Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying participated in the peace movement, more and more Chongqing generals have continued to come back. This fact has fully exposed the truth that Chongqing is in a dilemma after losing the name of resistance war. Chongqing's internal electricity has also been greatly impacted because of this, and the tendency to participate in the peace movement is becoming increasingly obvious. Therefore, Chongqing officials and generals also suspect and guard against each other, resulting in an abnormal chaotic situation within the Chongqing army. According to the information received here, a division commander of a certain Sichuan army has been arrested on suspicion of defecting, and a certain officer of the 7th War Zone has also been executed for expressing war-weary words in a letter to his colleagues. These facts are solid evidence of the current chaotic situation within Chongqing. According to Chongqing electricity, Yu Pengfei, the rear service minister of the Chongqing Military Commission, arrived in Xi'an via Baoji on the 15th. The purpose of this trip seems to be to adjust the transportation and supply after the annihilation of the Jicha Border Region Army, and other rear preparation matters, and to discuss the aftermath policies with the local authorities. However, the Jicha Border Region Army has suffered a major blow in morale due to the participation of the two generals, Pang and Sun, and other main generals, leading 70,000 troops in the peace movement. Recovery is impossible. Although Chongqing is now making every effort to conceal the truth to stabilize the military's morale, due to the loss of Chongqing's name for the war of resistance and the unfavorable war situation, its future is truly not optimistic, and it will inevitably become one of the main reasons for the collapse. There is no doubt.

### U.S. Water Conservancy Committee Chairman Discusses Flood Control Problems

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - This year's spring has been continuously rainy, and there are concerns about floods in summer and autumn. Jiang Zuoxuan, chairman of the Water Conservancy Committee of the Ministry of Construction, said that the rainfall in Nanjing this year was more than 110 mm in March, more than 100 mm in April, and more than 130 mm in May (more than 170 mm in May last year), which was not particularly much compared to the past three years. Examining the water level of the Yangtze River in Nanjing, it is currently 7 meters, which is not necessarily higher than this time last year. The Huai River rose early this year, reaching 14 and a half meters in April, and now it is close to 16 meters. Although it is very high, there is still hope that it will not be as high as last year. In summary, the Huai River is indeed high this year, and the Yangtze River cannot be said to be low, but there is no need to worry about floods immediately. It is necessary to judge the rainfall and the water coming from the Yellow River in the future. Although God's will is unpredictable, human efforts must be exhausted. Therefore, flood control work must not be neglected, especially in the months of July and August. In view of this, the Ministry of Construction has long prepared a general outline of flood control measures for three provinces and two cities, which has been submitted to the court for approval and implemented in sections. The general outline of the measures adopts a system of hierarchical responsibility for flood control work: (1) First, the central government formulates methods and subsidizes funds, and is responsible for advocacy; (2) Second, local governments formulate detailed rules, divide the area on the ground, organize the people, and allocate funds to pre-purchase materials, and are responsible for preparation; (3) When the flood arrives, in addition to receiving the funds and materials prepared by the government, the local people share the financial resources and are responsible for day and night patrols and temporary emergency rescue. In this way, the government will not suffer from the pain of being out of reach, and the people will benefit from the power of struggle. Official-civilian cooperation will increase efficiency.

### Italian Cabinet Discusses Increasing Official Salaries - Compulsory Labor to be Implemented Next Month - Crown Prince Umberto Inspecting Air Raid Disaster Areas - Arrival in North Africa Denied by Rome

### Tokyo Newspapers Discuss Significance of Bose's Arrival - Italian Government and Public Welcome - Britain Concerned About Bose's Future Movements

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Since the arrival of Indian independence movement leader Chandra Bose in Japan, the future of India has been filled with limitless brightness. Editorials in various newspapers here on the 20th focused on this topic, adding commentary. The following is the gist of the Asahi Shimbun's editorial: The sudden arrival in Tokyo of Chandra Bose, the vanguard leader of the Indian independence movement, to appeal to the world for Indian independence, is not only shocking news for the whole world, but also extremely welcome news. As Bose stated in his declaration, although the British are fond of advocating national self-determination and constantly praising democracy and equality, their policy toward India is extremely tyrannical and oppressive. From this perspective, Britain is indeed, as he said, India's "eternal enemy." It is also the enemy of all countries and nations in the world that love permanent peace and national freedom. He said that after the Axis victory, the United States' ambition to dominate the world and the British Empire would inevitably collapse, and India would thus obtain a good opportunity for independence. Therefore, the connection between the Axis countries and India is based on this common interest. At the same time, the relationship between Japan and India is particularly close due to various important conditions in geography, economy, politics, and other aspects. The Japanese people have always sincerely hoped that India can be liberated and that the construction of India by the Indian people can be realized. Therefore, they express their welcome to the great leader of India, Bose, and deeply understand the efforts and sincerity he has shown for the construction of the Greater East Asia, which aims at eternal peace in East Asia, and have the sincerity of full cooperation, which is sincerely pleasing.

Central News Agency, Rome, 20th - The Italian government and public unanimously expressed their welcome after learning that Indian independence fighter Chandra Bose had arrived safely in Tokyo, and wished the Indian independence movement a bright future.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to a London dispatch: The British government and public attach great importance to the visit of Indian independence giant Chandra Bose to Japan, and are extremely concerned about his future movements. Reuters also received a similar report from Japan Broadcasting Corporation without any criticism.

Reactions Among the German People

Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - Yesterday, German newspapers all published the news of Bose's arrival in Tokyo. The Deutsche Allgemeine Zeitung commented: The arrival of this Indian leader in Japan is an important political factor. His departure from Germany to Japan proves the close cooperation of the Axis powers. All newspapers hope that the Indian people can achieve independence under Bose's leadership.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The visit to Japan by Indian independence movement fighter Chandra Bose has caused a great reaction among the German people. The German Foreign Communication Agency commented: When Mr. Bose set off to leave Europe, we were sad to say goodbye, but because his return to the Far East has a legitimate reason, it is not convenient to stop him. The great achievements of the Japanese army in Southeast Asia have given the Indian independence movement a new opportunity. In order to take advantage of this excellent opportunity to start importing important tasks, Mr. Bose's return to East Asia is very good. In his recent speech, Prime Minister Tojo repeatedly stated that in order to free India from the shackles of Britain, Japan will prepare to provide various assistance. Moreover, Japan's attitude towards the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and all ethnic groups has been deeply understood by the Indian people. Moreover, Mr. Bose was able to go from India to Europe, and this time from Europe to Japan. This is enough to show the Indian people that the Anglo-Saxons are no longer the rulers of the world, so the spiritual impact is also great. At the same time, the Indian people have discovered their own strength in seeking liberation. According to this view, the Indian independence movement will definitely progress rapidly, and under the leadership of such a lover of gardens as Bose, India will soon be able to obtain freedom without any doubt.

### Bose's Status in India

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 20th - Among modern Indian leaders, besides Gandhi, who occupies a uniquely high position, the next most important are Chandra Bose and Nehru. They are both the bravest fighters in "Fighting India," and Chandra Bose's political position is particularly unique. Although Nehru and Bose both belong to the radical faction of the National Congress Party and are known as "socialists," in practice, they still follow Gandhi as their model. As for Chandra Bose, his respect and admiration for Gandhi are second to none, and he is one of the few people in India who can directly comment on Gandhi. He once praised Gandhi's career, saying that most of today's National Congress Party was created by Gandhi, and the organization of the Congress Party is Gandhi's career. He has also transformed the Congress Party from a mere discussion group into a fighting machine. When constitutionalism in the Indian independence struggle declined in 1919-20, and violentism was about to replace it, the masses rose up to seek new methods of struggle and needed new leaders. Gandhi arose at the right time and led the masses, so Bose once praised Gandhi as "the son of India's destiny." As for 1935, Bose once speculated on Gandhi's future struggle, saying that when the British government uses force against India in the future, whether Gandhi can maintain his inherent political position will depend on whether he can adopt a more radical policy. If he can dedicate himself to the work of radical struggle at that time, I am afraid that no one can stop him. I believe that at that time, he will still be the hero who leads the Indian people in the stage of the Indian struggle. In the next stage of the Indian struggle, he will still be the hero who leads the Indian people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Gandhi has indeed, as Bose had said, initiated an anti-British movement, starting to reduce the "orderly anarchy" that oppresses India, and finally launching an armed rebellion. Bose is very happy about this. Currently, Bose is working hard along the path of struggle pioneered by Gandhi. Bose's political beliefs are very clear. He believes that seeking India's political independence is the major premise for reviving India and liberating the Indian nation. To achieve this goal, all means must be adopted and struggles must be engaged in. Therefore, he argues: "We should not forget that it was the British who taught the Indians the policy of violence. We should treat the British in the same way they treat us." Therefore, he firmly advocates that in order to win India's independence, an armed revolution should be launched immediately. From this, we can see that Bose can launch the "vanguard movement" from a difficult environment because he has the passion and organizational skills to mobilize the masses. Bose is even more advanced than Gandhi in this regard. His strong belief is "no struggle, no honor." This saying can be regarded as his motto. In fact, he is a fighter for the British, and hopes to win India's independence from the bloody battlefield. Therefore, he is the successor to Gandhi, not only a loyal follower of Gandhi, but also a hero with the passion and fighting spirit to complete Gandhi's cause of Indian independence. He can be regarded as a representative figure among modern Indian fighters. This is also well known to Gandhi and the Indian people. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Indian people have all learned that Bose is a "defender of India" and are eager for him to come from Germany to lead the Indian independence movement. Last May, it was rumored that Bose died in Berlin due to a plane crash, and the Indian people were greatly shocked. All over India, flags were flown at half-mast and markets were closed to express mourning. At that time, Gandhi even said of Bose's death: "India has lost a giant star," but soon learned that this news was fabricated by the British. Bose's roar spread from Berlin to India, and the Indian people rekindled their long-lost hope in that instant. All of India was overjoyed, and they raised the flag of Indian independence and celebrated, which made the British authorities very embarrassed, and Gandhi also publicly congratulated Bose's mother. In short, today's Chandra Bose's safety is enough to influence the mood of the entire Indian people. Therefore, he has become a great man worshiped by the entire Indian people, and is the successor to the Indian Mahatma (meaning great soul).

### Fierce Positional Warfare in the Orel and Velizh Areas - Soviet Offensive in Kuban Suffers Further Losses - Their Fighting Spirit Has Significantly Decreased

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 20th - According to reports from the Eastern Front, Soviet forces in the Kuban region suddenly launched another offensive on the evening of the 18th, attacking German strongholds under the cover of powerful artillery and air force, but were repelled by German forces and suffered heavy losses. In addition, fierce positional warfare also took place in the Orel and Velizh areas on the 18th. The offensive and defensive battles in the Orel salient have been fought intensely day and night for several days, and are now gradually expanding. In another report, Soviet forces launched another counterattack in the Mtsensk area, 30 kilometers northwest of Orel. German and Soviet forces are currently engaged in a death struggle. Observing this situation, the Eastern Front war will gradually develop into a large-scale operation on the entire front, centered on the main battle areas of Kupiansk, Orel, and Velizh. The public believes that this implies that the nature of this year's summer campaign is particularly noteworthy.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 20th - The German News Agency learned last night that Soviet troops launched a local attack on the German positions in the Kuban bridgehead with strong troops on Wednesday, but without any success. Although the Soviet infantry used powerful artillery and fighter squadrons, they failed to break into the German defense line and were repelled at all locations. In addition to the death of hundreds of Soviet troops, 248 people were captured. The fighting in the lower Kuban region has lasted for two months, and the Soviet army has only received a small amount of replenishment, and its fighting spirit has obviously decreased. According to prisoners, the food and other supplies of the Soviet army in the area have been greatly reduced, so morale is also depressed. There have been only small-scale battles in other front areas, especially in the northeastern part of the Orel front and east of Velizh. The advance of the Soviet assault troops in each place was blocked in front of the German forward positions. Major Freytag, an air force representative of the German News Agency, said: The German Air Force continued to carry out planned attacks on the Soviet railway and highways on Friday, with considerable success. Soviet military industrial equipment was also attacked on Friday evening. German aircraft also sank two fully loaded freighters with a total of 11,000 tons at the mouth of the Volga River, and severely damaged two freighters with a total of 8,000 tons. A dive bomber squadron destroyed a Soviet railway bridge south of Leningrad. Soviet fighters attempted to intercept German aircraft but were also intercepted by German fighters, shooting down 31 Soviet aircraft. There were no losses for German aircraft. In total, the Soviets lost 45 aircraft on Friday, and two German aircraft failed to return.

### Wavell Appointed Governor-General - Indian People Dissatisfied

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 20th - According to a Bombay dispatch, the Madras Indian newspaper yesterday expressed regret over the appointment of Marshal Wavell as Governor-General of India. The newspaper said: "The Indian people, in their current mood, will definitely oppose this appointment, believing that it proves that Churchill is still opposed to the aspirations of the Indian people."

Beijing Correspondence

### 端午在北京

— Scholar

The Sequel to the Records of the Qi Harmonizer states: "Qu Yuan drowned himself in the river on the fifth day of the fifth month. The people of Chu mourned him and put rice in bamboo tubes and threw them into the water, wrapped in reed leaves and tied with colored threads, so that they would not be swallowed by dragons." Is the Dragon Boat Festival, as a festival to commemorate the suicide of a patriotic poet, at least a recognized fact in legend? According to traditional customs, the day is not only as described in the Records of Customs: "cooking horn-shaped dumplings," but also includes dragon boat races, inserting cattails and wormwood, drinking realgar wine, pasting pest-repelling talismans, wearing sachets, and so on. Regarding dragon boat races, the Sui History: Geography states that "Qu Yuan went to the Miluo River on the fifteenth day of the fifth month. The local people chased him to Dongting Lake but could not find him. The lake was large and the boats were small, so no one could cross. Then they sang, 'How can we cross the lake?' Therefore, they drummed and rowed to compete to return. They gathered at the pavilion to compete, and the custom was passed down as a dragon boat race." However, the Record of the Seasons of Jing and Chu quotes the Cao E Stele, saying, "On the fifth day of the fifth month, they welcomed Wu Jun against the tide, but she was drowned by the water." This is a custom in the Wu region, related to Wu Zixu, and has nothing to do with Qu Yuan. The Record of the Seasons of Jing and Chu also quotes the Records of Yue, saying that it originated with King Goujian of Yue. In this case, it is uncertain whether dragon boat races, or even the act of throwing oneself into the water during the festival, have an absolute connection with Qu Yuan, as Professor Zhao Yintang of Peking University stated accurately on the Dragon Boat Festival on the Beijing Central Broadcasting Station. But this is not the important issue. Anyway, a festival commemoration always has its social reasons, and secular customs often incorporate other elements. Inserting wormwood on the doorframe and pasting pest-repelling talismans on the door on the Dragon Boat Festival are clearly later additions. During the Ming Dynasty, officials and people in the capital would gather at the Temple of Heaven, hold horse races, and wear wormwood clothes and cattail shoes on the Dragon Boat Festival, not just hanging a few cattails and wormwood. The emperors of the Liao Dynasty even wore clothes made of wormwood leaves and cotton picked on the Dragon Boat Festival, making a great fashion statement. As for pest-repelling talismans, they are related to Zhang Tianshi's exorcism of the five poisonous creatures. Last year, during the Dragon Boat Festival, Beijing Central Radio broadcast a story in a crisp, delicate voice to children about how Zhang Tianshi came to Beijing to expel the five poisonous creatures. These have nothing to do with the story of the Minister of the Three Households throwing himself into the river.

We do not need to investigate the origin of the Dragon Boat Festival in detail, but it is undeniable that this festival is a major festival commemorated by the Chinese people.

If the Dragon Boat Festival originated with Qu Yuan, then this frustrated poet can be considered to have exhaled a sigh of relief in his death by throwing himself into the river. His suicide built a gate to the underworld for the poor, and many poor people, unable to pass this festival, took the same step as Qu Yuan. But on the other hand, he created many opportunities for the wealthy and romantic poets to enjoy the pleasures of life. Such powers of exercising authority and granting favors are probably beyond the reach of any emperor in the human world. Qu Yuan's spirit should be extremely satisfied.

However, due to general economic bankruptcy, besides this gate to the underworld becoming increasingly solid, the Dragon Boat Festival can no longer provide people with much opportunity for enjoyment. More than a decade ago, we could still see the dragon boat race spectacle declining year by year. Now, this custom has almost sunk to the bottom of the rivers along with the broken, irreparable planks everywhere. Even in Beijing, the former imperial capital, people who are slightly younger cannot even imagine what a dragon boat looks like.

Last year's Dragon Boat Festival was already dull enough. This year, the food problem in Beijing is the most alarming, but the Dragon Boat Festival was not as bleak as most people imagined. Three weeks ago, the government specially allocated an extra two catties of flour per person for the Dragon Boat Festival in the fourth ration. Because the newspapers reported it too vaguely, most people thought there would be a special Dragon Boat Festival ration in addition to the fourth ration, until two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, the newspapers made a clarification, and everyone suddenly understood. However, these two catties of Dragon Boat Festival rations did cause quite a stir for some time. Perhaps due to the festival or the government's strict enforcement of fixed prices, the price of grain actually fell a bit a few days before the Dragon Boat Festival. Although the price of rice only dropped from three yuan and two corners to three yuan per catty, it still gave people a lot of relief. What attracted the most attention was the newspaper announcement that the Beijing Municipal Government and the New People's Association would jointly hold a "dragon boat race" at 10:00 AM on the Dragon Boat Festival, and that citizen regattas and citizen carnivals would be held in Beihai Park and Central Park in the afternoon. The entertainment advertisements even had reports that Zhang Junqiu would perform the festival opera "Hun Yuan He" on the Dragon Boat Festival. All of this seemed to give people the feeling of "celebrating the festival."

Two days before the Dragon Boat Festival, Chairman Zhu issued a special notice to his subordinates, saying that during wartime, all celebratory formalities should be avoided. However, the "flavor" of the festival that could be smelled in those days was precisely because of the large packages of festival gifts seen on the streets where these formalities were practiced. However, this was, after all, a minority. Most middle-class families could not even afford to buy a few zongzi, and the public scramble for food at the markets in the East and West Fourth Memorial Archways added a considerable amount of excitement to the Dragon Boat Festival.

The Dragon Boat Festival arrived. So, groups of young men and women went to participate in the long-advertised dragon boat race with great hopes. Although the number of visitors to Beihai Park was not as large as on an ordinary Sunday ten years ago, it was still quite a few. There were even two young girls wearing two sachets on their chests, reminiscent of the past glory and sparking infinite reverie. However, there was no trace of dragon boats on the waters of Taiye Pool. Many colorful decorations were hung on the Five Dragon Pavilion, which could somewhat evoke the atmosphere of the festival. It was not until 11:30, amid eager anticipation, that the sound of flutes was suddenly heard. Then, in a burst of cries of "Here they come!" a few small boats slowly crawled out from the direction of the Five Dragon Pavilion. It turned out that the so-called dragon boat races were competitions of these "unskilled" modern small boats. Each boat had two or three rowers, and no matter how strong they were, they could not row the boat very fast. Compared with the fast boats with seventy or eighty rowers, flying up and down to the sound of deafening gongs and drums, competing for the dragon head and dragon tail, these were simply a small witch seeing a great witch. Most modern propaganda is of this kind.

In the afternoon, a citizen's carnival was also held in the newly built concert hall in Central Park, with programs including cross-talk, drums, and Beijing opera. However, the weather was too hot, which somewhat spoiled the fun. On the Beihai side, the citizen regatta also proceeded according to the original plan.

But outside these two parks, the atmosphere of the festival faded away. Traces of cattails and wormwood could not be found anywhere. And the sounds of beggars everywhere in the streets in the evening added a layer of gray emotion to the citizens after this "carnival."

The wartime Dragon Boat Festival passed like this. (Dragon Boat Festival Night)

### The Police Authorities of the Two Concessions Intensify Inspections of Public Places: Those Entering Without a Citizen's Certificate Will Be Questioned and Detained; Procedures for Moving Households Must Be Noted

The police authorities of the two concessions believe that public places such as hotels and entertainment venues are crowded with people, and it is inevitable that unscrupulous people will mix in. Therefore, they must intensify inspections of the above-mentioned places and strengthen the special self-defense corps of each place. The authorities have now stationed personnel at the entrances of some hotels and entertainment venues in the concession to check the citizen's certificates of those entering. Those who cannot produce them will not only be absolutely prohibited from entering but will also be questioned and detained.

Relocation Procedures

It is also learned that the Baojia authorities believe that citizens either do not fully understand the relocation procedures or have neglected them over time, which has greatly affected the accuracy of household registration. Therefore, they have further clarified the various procedures. Citizens who move to other places must declare to the Baojia chief and take their citizen's certificate to the issuing police station to cancel it. For short-term travel, they can take their citizen's certificate with them, but they must also declare it to the Baojia chief. As for moving to this city, they must go through relocation procedures with the Baojia chief.

Immigration Procedures

People who move in from other places must report to the Baojia chief of the place they are moving to with a county magistrate's certificate, a good citizen certificate, or a travel permit. Only after the household registration procedures have been completed can they be issued a rationing certificate for food distribution based on the number of people. If the county magistrate's certificate or other certificates have been lost, the head of the household and the Jia chief must issue a certificate confirming that they are indeed good citizens, and the head of the household and the Jia chief must take full responsibility if any accidents occur in the future.

Completing Certificates

The Public Concession Baojia conducts spot checks of households and requires the head of the household to complete a certificate in advance, guaranteeing that there are no falsely reported people in the household and no residents without citizen's certificates. The certificate must be completed and submitted by the deadline. If it is found to be inconsistent with the household registration during the spot check, the head of the household will be punished.

### Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign Week Begins Today: Relevant Authorities Cooperate

The Shanghai West district street cleaning campaign has been decided by the relevant authorities, including the Public Works Department's General Affairs Section, the Baojia Office of the district, the Police Department, the Health Bureau, and the Shanghai West Office of the bureau. All implementation methods have been determined, and the period from today to the 27th has been designated as "Shanghai West District Street Cleaning Campaign Week." The relevant authorities, in order to awaken citizens' attention to hygiene and closely assist the authorities in carrying out the street cleaning campaign, have specially printed a large number of large banners with white characters on a red background, with the words "Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign," etc. The Baojia authorities of the bureau have ordered them to go to public places such as hotels, restaurants, bars, and parks in the district, as well as busy streets and road junctions, to post them in places where pedestrians can see them. At the same time, each cleaning campaign worker will also wear a yellow "Shanghai West Cleaning Campaign" armband to show identification. This cleaning work is of great significance, so all relevant authorities are closely cooperating in order to achieve the ideal level. The Shanghai West Baojia Office will send 27 staff members to the 54 joint Bao offices in the district to supervise the citizens' cleaning work and concentrate all garbage at the locations designated by the Shanghai West Police, and then the Public Works Department will send vehicles to the garbage accumulation locations of each joint Bao to clear them out. At that time, the City Health Bureau, the Shanghai West Office of the Health Bureau, and the Shanghai West Police Department will all send personnel to supervise the citizens' efforts to clean up.

### The Fourth Phase of Household Sugar Distribution Is About to Be Completed

The Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office is about to complete the distribution of the fourth phase of household sugar.

### Coal for Boiled Water Shops Limited to Self-Use

Since the Great China United Coal Company agreed to supply fuel to the city's hot water shops at the allocated coal price, the industry association has been handling the registration of purchases by fellow businesses. The registration period ended yesterday. After the Great China United Coal Company notifies each hot water shop, they can pay and collect the goods. This coal must not be resold for profit and is limited to self-use only. Otherwise, membership will be revoked, and allocations will be stopped.

### Summer Hygiene Work: Epidemics of Cholera Must Be Reported Promptly

As summer approaches, epidemics are gradually emerging. In view of this, the Public Concession Baojia authorities have issued a special order to the self-defense corps members within the concession to intensify their assistance to the currency affairs personnel in promoting hygiene campaigns, maintaining local security, and protecting the health of citizens. Regarding summer hygiene, the self-defense corps members should pay attention to: (1) Strict prohibition of urination in the corners of alleys; citizens who violate this can be handed over to nearby police officers. (2) Attention to the accumulation of sewage and garbage in the gutters. (3) Attention to vendors selling unclean food and drink. (4) Urging citizens to get vaccinations as soon as possible. (5) If cholera epidemics are found in nearby areas, the self-defense corps must promptly report them to the authorities. In addition, citizens must pay attention to their health, diet, and daily life, and special attention should be paid to vaccinations. Those who have not been vaccinated will be severely punished once discovered.

### Tram Collision

At the Bund, at the foot of the Waibaidu Bridge, at around 8:30 last night, two trams collided. One of the trailers overturned, causing five passengers in the car to suffer minor injuries. Lu Xiuxiang injured his head, Chai Changwei suffered abrasions to his left hand, Zhou Jinyuan injured his arm, Tang Zhishi injured his chest, and Zhang Tuzi injured his face. They were later taken to the hospital by ambulance for treatment.

Also, at 2:45 yesterday afternoon, at the Kade Road Jing'an Temple Road intersection station, a tram on Route 2, due to excessive speed and stopping too abruptly, broke an axle. Fortunately, no passengers were injured.

### The Fifth Session of the Shenbao Scholarship Fund: Hoping for Continued Support from All Sectors; Increased School Fees and Numerous Student Applications Expected; Existing Scholarship Funds Are Still Far from the Expected Goal

Since the launch of the fifth session of the Shenbao Readers' Scholarship Fund, enthusiastic individuals and schools who are concerned about out-of-school children have responded by sending letters, generously donating scholarship funds, donating free places, or holding charity exhibitions of calligraphy and painting to benefit poor students, which is deeply admired. However, it is expected that the tuition fees of various schools will increase sharply in this session, and the number of applicants will be several times that of previous sessions. Compared with the current scholarship funds of this newspaper, it is still far from the expected goal, and we still hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will continue to support us. Details of various situations are recorded as follows:

Tingyunlou Scholarship Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

Tingyunlou, an organization of Shanghai calligraphers and painters, in order to support poor students, has collected more than 2,000 pages of calligraphy, painting, and fan surfaces donated by famous calligraphers and painters from home and abroad. It will be held at the painting hall on the fourth floor of the Great New Company for three days on the 22nd, 23rd, and 24th of this month. All proceeds will be donated to the scholarship funds of the Shen and Xin newspapers. All sectors are welcome to visit and purchase to support this charity.

Renwu Guangxia Donates School Places

In previous sessions of the scholarship fund organized by this newspaper, we have received donations of free school places from various schools, but there have also been donations of half-fee places or designated special methods. It has now been decided that the donation of free school places by various schools is very welcome; however, it is difficult to handle donations of half-fee places or designated methods. Yesterday, the Renwu Tutorial School donated five free places for the first grade of junior high school, and Guangxia Middle School donated two places each for the first grade of junior and senior high school. Thank you for this.

Yesterday's Scholarship Funds Received

The scholarship funds received by this newspaper yesterday are: Yan Zhensheng, 1,000 yuan; Xu Dingqing, 500 yuan; Xu (anonymous), 300 yuan; Qi Wenyao, 100 yuan; Yu Qingtang and Sang Zhiyu (picked up), 50 yuan each; Zhang Liancheng and Chen Minren (picked up), 10 yuan each, totaling 2,020 yuan in stored coupons. The balance is 455,851 yuan, 5 jiao, and 9 fen.

### Nanshi Epidemic Hospital Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday

Huang Jinrong, Wang Yongkang, and others initiated the establishment of the private Nanshi Epidemic Hospital, with an initial funding of 800,000 yuan. The temporary ward is located in the Sanle Hall in Yifeng Lane, Menghua Street, Nanshi, with a total of six large rooms upstairs and downstairs. One hundred beds have been prepared, as well as car-driven patient cars and various treatment equipment. Sixteen doctors and nurses have been hired, and a pharmacy has been set up to specialize in treating emergency cases of cholera, gastroenteritis, abdominal pain, and diarrhea. Medical and pharmaceutical expenses are waived regardless of the time of day or night. The preparations have been completed by famous local doctors Wang Zhenchuan, Jin Xuegao, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Fukang, and others. The opening ceremony was held at 10:00 AM yesterday. The Shanghai Orphanage sent a full band to participate and play music. The Yimiao Branch ordered a large number of police officers to maintain order. In addition to the 14 honorary directors and 35 directors, there were hundreds of guests from all walks of life, including Foreign Minister Chu Minyi and Tadai Yoshiaki, Director of the Public Concession Health Department. Mr. Chu Minyi presided over the ceremony. Yuan Fudeng, Yuan Jufan, and Yoshiaki Tadai successively delivered speeches, with many words of encouragement. Finally, the presidents of the hospital, Wang Yongkang, Jin Xuegao, Wang Delin, and Wang Zhenchuan, gave a joint thank you speech.

### Baojia Drill for Air Defense Control: Revised Regulations Have Been Notified to Each Household

The police stations of the two concessions have notified each district Baojia chief to inform each household and self-defense corps member of the alarm regulations revised on the 18th of last month: (1) Alert alarm (called fire alert control at night): siren sounds for two minutes. (2) Air raid alarm (called fire control at night): siren sounds seven or more times, each sound lasting five seconds. (3) Air raid alarm解除 (called fire alert control at night): siren sounds for two minutes, the same as the alarm alarm. (4) Alarm解除 (called fire preparation control at night): two siren sounds, each sound lasting fifteen seconds.

Fire Control Drill in the French Concession

The police authorities of the French Concession, in order to ensure that the air defense measures in the districts under their jurisdiction are properly strengthened, have stipulated that starting from this month, fire control drills will be conducted in the concession district by district. The responsible police station will notify the Baojia in advance and stipulate the time for the control, and post notices to inform residents to prepare. When the control is implemented, each district will be a joint Bao unit, and the joint Bao chief and the subordinate Bao chiefs and Jia chiefs will be responsible for supervision. Most districts have now completed the drills.

Actively Rectifying Air Defense Personnel

In order to cultivate the habit of citizens being prepared for air defense at all times, the authorities of the two concessions have reiterated the previous order and actively rectified the self-defense corps, fire brigades, ambulance teams, messenger teams, traffic teams, and patrol teams in each district to enable them to be dispatched for work at any time. As for air defense and fire prevention equipment, such as lampshades, straw mats, yellow sand, and water tanks, they must also be placed properly to avoid being at a loss when the time comes.

Short Comment

### The Chao-Shan Disaster Also Deserves Attention

The Chao-Shan regions are also suffering from drought this year. Although the disaster area is not as large as that of North China, the disaster situation is equally severe. We are in the same position and naturally do not favor one over the other.

We have also received some reports on the Chao-Shan disaster, among which the reports from Mr. Qiang Liang and Mr. Li Xunting and other Chao-Shan fellow villagers are the most authentic. For example, "Since the beginning of this spring, there has been a long drought without rain, and the fields are all red. The price of coarse rice is more than 500 yuan per dou, and sweet potatoes are more than 10 yuan per catty, and they are not easy to buy. Middle-class families have a pale complexion, and the poor are starving to death one after another. The cholera epidemic is rampant, and the lives of the old are not guaranteed." In short, the whole article is tragic and unbearable to read.

We know that there are quite a few people from Chao-Shan who are doing business in Shanghai and have accumulated a wealth of assets. Secondly, Guangdong fellow villagers also occupy an important position in the industrial and commercial circles. We first hope that Chao-Shan people and Guangdong people will put in double the effort in the position of fellow villagers. We are not advocating regionalism, and of course, we also hope that all sectors will donate together. However, the well-to-do Chao-Shan people should take the lead, which is also a matter of righteousness.

The Social Service Department of this newspaper has long been collecting Chao-Shan disaster donations. As of now, we have collected more than 10,000 yuan, and we will continue to handle this in the future to fulfill our responsibility.

### Record of Sino-Japanese Calligraphy and Painting Forum Sponsored by the Japan Cultural Promotion Association

The Japan International Cultural Promotion Association recently hosted a tea party to entertain Mr. Ma Gongyu, a calligrapher and painter from this city. A forum was held with Ya Chen, Wang Jichien, Xiong Songquan, Fang Huqing, Zheng Wuchang, Wang Jimei, Wu Hufan, and others, and they all expressed their opinions on the spot. Excerpts are as follows: Wu Hufan: The current exhibition held by Japan in Shanghai is very short. If China introduces its works to Japan for a short-term exhibition, the effect will definitely be minimal. Therefore, there needs to be an organization to provide long-term research in order to obtain better results.

Wang Jimei: I hope that the International Cultural Promotion Association can come forward to bring together Chinese and Japanese calligraphers and painters for long-term research, so that East Asian culture can be developed. Then, when exhibitions are held in the future, the results will naturally be even more remarkable.

Wang Jichien: I hope that in the future, more Chinese freehand paintings can be introduced to Japan, and Japan may also introduce Western painting techniques to China.

Wang Yachen: Painting and calligraphy have feelings and aesthetics. In the past five years, every Chinese painter has been particularly energetic in studying because of the current situation. However, this is not political power. If painting is promoted by political background, it will not be effective.

### Contributing Another Fundraising Method for the Urgent Relief in North China

— Di Jitang

The disaster in North China is extremely severe, with wailing everywhere, starving people lining the roads, a heartbreaking and unbearable sight. Everyone has a compassionate heart, and all humans are moved by it. In this city, there are those who donate and raise funds for relief. Not only did Shenbao advocate for it previously, but now enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life are organizing an urgent relief association, with a heart of compassion and a sense of vigilance in times of peace, hoping to collect a large sum of money to benefit the disaster victims, which is no small feat. However, the disaster area is vast, and the number of victims is large. Although people from all walks of life are actively donating, it is feared that it will be like a drop in the bucket, making it difficult to be widespread. Therefore, it is imperative to find multiple ways to raise funds. In addition to donations and holding ball games, art exhibitions, calligraphy sales, and other events, any possible methods should be implemented simultaneously, aiming to raise as much money as possible to universally benefit the disaster victims. Therefore, I humbly offer my limited views to the gentlemen handling the relief efforts, as a supplementary method for raising funds, which is just a thought from a humble person.

According to a clause in the will of the late Mrs. Luo Jialing, the wife of Hardoon, states:

"I bequeath property worth one million yuan (according to the 1937 Shanghai Municipal Council valuation) to the Chinese government to be used as funds to enhance public welfare."

The aforementioned property, valued at one million yuan according to the 1937 valuation, should now be worth over ten million yuan at current market prices. Although Luo's property is enemy property, the designated portion assigned to the Chinese government for enhancing public welfare should be excluded from the scope of enemy property and handed over to the Chinese government to be used for the current North China disaster relief needs. It is believed that the Allied authorities will gladly agree. If agreement can be obtained to allow the transfer, the government can entrust the urgent relief association to sell it through public auction. In this extraordinary period, considering the Shanghai market situation in recent years, there are many buyers of real estate, so it is not difficult to raise a large sum of money, which is more reliable for disaster relief than scattered fundraising. As for how to negotiate with the authorities and how to handle the procedures, it is up to the gentlemen handling the relief efforts to discuss and implement. I hope that the officials of our government and the prominent figures of society will also find my humble suggestions acceptable. The disaster victims would be extremely fortunate!

### Advocating for a "One Day's Income for Relief" Movement

— Zhang Yichong

Regardless of disaster relief funds, it is necessary to have the strength of the masses and the spirit of saving others as saving oneself, and work hard to contribute. Since the establishment of the North China Emergency Relief Association, all relief measures have been actively promoted. The citizens of this city have already donated a certain amount, but due to the vast disaster area in North China and the large number of victims, the total amount of donations in Shanghai has not yet reached two million yuan as of the current date. If distributed, the amount each victim receives may be extremely limited.

In order to expand the disaster relief donation movement, it is still necessary to maintain the spirit of the past and mobilize all citizens to work hard to contribute, in order to alleviate the urgent situation. Disaster relief is like putting out a fire, it must be done quickly. I suggest advocating for a "One Day's Income for Relief" movement. Whether it is companies, firms, stores, banks, educational institutions, laborers, freelance writers, theaters, entertainment venues, or other commercial and industrial organizations or individuals, all can participate by donating all of their day's business income or day's labor income to disaster relief funds. This is something that merchants would be happy to do, and it is also an easy task for individuals. It is hoped that the press will fully mobilize and expand publicity, and once again plead for the lives of the disaster victims in North China. This is deeply hoped and prayed for.

Opening Ceremony

The grand meeting began at 12:30 p.m. All staff of the athletic games and athletes from the two cities lined up and entered the field. First, the Japanese military band played the national anthems of China and Japan, followed by a moment of silence. Then, Chairman Okazaki of the association delivered a speech, and the athlete representatives from Dalian and Shanghai took an oath. Finally, Chief Referee Koyama Ryoichi announced the start of the competition.

Evenly Matched

The Shanghai-Dalian inter-city (track and field competition) began first. The first event was the 1500-meter final. Dalian's Lai Kou was expected to win, taking the lead with a fast pace. Shanghai's Kubota also did not show weakness, following closely behind. In the last quarter of the race, he surged forward, and as he approached the finish line, Lai Kou did not give up and sprinted straight ahead, winning the championship. (Pole Vault) Dalian was expected to excel. As a result, Abe and Kido dominated, taking first and second place. (100 Meters) Dalian's Fukuda's time of 11.1 seconds was close to his usual record. Shanghai's Kimura was also extraordinary, and the competition was fierce. In the end, he lost by a fraction of a second. (Shot Put) This event could have been won by Dalian, but Shanghai's German athlete Pike and Hua Liechai competed fiercely. Pike took first place with 11.85 meters, while Dalian's Kato was defeated. (Long Jump) Dalian's Fukuda maintained 7 meters and broke the record yesterday with 7.18 meters. (400 Meters) Shanghai's Kubota, after actively training hard, was unstoppable. Yesterday, he broke Dalian's Lai Kou's record of 53 seconds with a time of 52.7 seconds. Dalian's Yotsumoto was also not weak, competing with Kubota at the same time, but unfortunately fell behind by a shoulder and conceded. (Discus) Fukuda, who maintained 32 meters, regressed yesterday, and Kato won with 35.28 meters. Shanghai's Yamamoto still maintained his previous record. The famous Shanghai team's Kimura lived up to his name and dominated the event with 1.85 meters, only 0.5 meters short of his usual record. In the (5000-meter long-distance race), Shanghai's veteran Wang Zhenglin originally had hope for a silver medal, but was blocked by Dalian's Lai Kou at the start. Wang once surged past Lai Kou to take the lead, but Lai Kou quickly surged ahead. Wang retreated, and was then overtaken by Shanghai's Abe and Tominaga. In the final sprint, he finished third. Wang's even pace and fierce sprint posture won applause from the entire stadium. (Javelin) Shanghai's Hua Jiang Wang Xuewu's skills were commendable and extraordinary. The beauty of his posture attracted attention from the entire stadium. Yesterday, he surpassed Dalian's Kato and Kido, easily taking first place with 52.09 meters. (Shanghai Track and Field) The total score for the two events was initially temporarily behind by one point. Later, in the high jump, they added four points, and it was hoped that they could win steadily. Shanghai lost to Dalian in the 400-meter relay, adding three points, resulting in a tie of 52 to 52.

Shanghai Team Wins in Soccer

The Shanghai-Dalian soccer match kicked off in the center of the field at 5:30 p.m. The Shanghai team concentrated the elite generals from Japan, Italy and China. Victory was already expected. However, the overall strength of the Dalian generals should not be underestimated. The only reason was the lack of contact and technical coordination in contrast to the strength of individual players on the Shanghai side, which was the fatal blow. Both goalkeepers, Shanghai's Rotti and Dalian's Wei Zhonghua, were indeed capable, doing their duty to block dangerous balls. The defense was quite strict. Dalian's entire team was shifted to a defensive stance, making it difficult for Wei Zhonghua alone to block all the balls, resulting in a one-sided situation. Shanghai's Chinese generals Sun Jinshun, Dai Linjing, Wu Qixiang, Mai Youliang, Han Longhai, and Qu Yongfu were very active. The Japanese generals Yoda Yoshiyuki and Villaroel were also taking turns to go on the attack. In the initial stage of the match, both sides were attacking repeatedly, and the situation was quite tense. After 25 minutes, Villa opened the scoring from 30 yards out, hitting the center of the net, 1-0. Less than five minutes after Dalian conceded a goal, Wu Qixiang inserted himself in and scored another goal with a header. Then Dai Linjing scored another with a dribble. The score at halftime was 4-0, a big win for Shanghai. After the break, both sides switched positions and resumed the attack. Sun Jinshun charged straight in and scored another goal. Zhu Ji and Qu Yongfu also scored from 30 yards out, making it 6-0. At this point, Dalian became frightened and counterattacked with all their might. Tan Xueming scored a goal, breaking the duck egg and pulling back one goal. Later, Shanghai's Deipana scored another goal, making the second half score 3-1. At the end of the match, the Shanghai team won 7-1, singing triumphantly.

Rotti (Italy), Rossi (Italy), Li Tiansheng (Chinese Shanghai), Zhedu (Chinese), Nishida (Japanese Shanghai), Qu Yongfu (Chinese), Silati (Italy), Han Neng Hai (Chinese), Deipana (Italy), Sun Jinshun (Chinese), Dai Linjing (Chinese), Wu Qixiang (Chinese Shanghai), Tani (Japanese), Villa (Italy), Jia Liang (Chinese)

### Mother

— Li Xueping

It was a quiet autumn night. There was no moon, and it was terribly dark outside the window. The sounds of the road had long faded, and only the sound of the church bell, vibrated by the west wind, carried over in bursts from afar.

A three- or four-year-old child lay on a small bed. In the dim light, one could see his very thin, ashen face. His constantly twitching eyebrows revealed the pain in his body. His weak breathing, or opening and closing of his lifeless eyes, indicated that he had been ill for several days.

The mother, with a worried face, sat diagonally on the edge of the bed. Days and nights of hard work and worry had caused her eye sockets to sink in, and her face appeared haggard and yellow. She looked anxiously at the small life on the bed, struggling with pain. When he let out a painful moan, it was as if her soul was cruelly torn apart. She watched this small life struggle in the hands of the illness, undergoing torture; she felt a thousand bullets shooting into her heart, and a thousand wild beasts dismembering her limbs. But she would rather be shot by a thousand bullets and dismembered by a thousand wild beasts than see this young soul mercilessly ravaged by illness.

The child's groans suddenly intensified. His eyes showed a straight light, the corners of his mouth twisted painfully, and his hands trembled constantly. The mother cried out in alarm and picked him up as if she had gone mad. At this moment, the father, who had been tossing and turning in the big bed, jumped up immediately.

"What's wrong with the child?"

"Not...good, get the medicine quickly," the mother's voice trembled terribly.

The father quickly took the medicine from the table and poured a glass of water.

The child had almost lost consciousness. As the mother fed him the medicine, tears welled up in her eyes.

The child seemed much better after taking the medicine. The groaning stopped, and the painful expression on his face was reduced. He lay quietly in his mother's arms.

"The doctor said tonight is the most dangerous time. He will be fine after it passes, but I'm afraid..." The mother's throat choked.

"I don't think so. He's already much better. You've worked too hard. You should rest for a moment and let me watch him," the father felt really bad seeing the mother's sallow and tired face.

"No, no, you go to sleep. You still have to write tomorrow. I'll call you if the child gets worse."

"You haven't slept for several nights. Look at your face, you have to take care of yourself."

"No, no, I don't... it doesn't matter. He's quiet now, so let him rest for a while."

The child fell asleep in his mother's arms, partly helped by the medicine and partly for comfort.

The late autumn night was particularly desolate and terrifying. The croaking of insects sounded like the wailing of ghosts in the barren mountains. A gust of wind blew, causing the window to rattle, like a demon knocking on the door. The sound of rustling leaves, mixed with a dog barking from afar and the sound of the church bell, wove together a mournful symphony.

The father, exhausted from the day's work, had fallen asleep. The two older sisters in the bed over there were also sound asleep. The mother sat blankly on the edge of the bed, holding the child. Only the clock on the opposite wall, ticking away, seemed to be her only companion. Yet it was also her judge, the one on whom all her hopes rested. As long as its hands moved one more minute, the child's period of danger would decrease by one minute, and her worries would be reduced by one minute.

When the child's face showed a painful expression, she seemed to see death grinning at her triumphantly. She trembled and held the poor little life tightly, constantly praying silently, begging heaven to allow her to sacrifice herself in any way to exchange for the safety of this small life. She kept holding the child, not daring to put him down, partly because she was afraid he would be uncomfortable, and partly because there was a nameless terror in her heart, as if he would be snatched away from her arms as soon as he left her arms, never to return.

The clock did not seem to heed her prayers and moved especially slowly. The sun in the east also seemed not to have heard her prayers and was late in showing its face. But the child's condition was very good. Except for a few times when he wanted a drink of water, he had been sleeping very peacefully. The mother felt a little relief in her heart, but at the same time, she also felt a wave of uncontrollable fatigue. Days and nights of hard work had depleted all her energy. But it was always difficult to sleep while holding the child, and she also didn't dare to sleep. She thought that if she fell asleep, the child would be snatched away by death immediately. She had no choice but to force herself to straighten her aching waist, widen her powerless eyes, and support herself minute by minute for an unknown length of time. Finally, she felt the scene in front of her gradually turn pitch black, and her whole body seemed to scatter like dust. The things in the room all became dim. Suddenly she saw that the child's illness had been cured, and he was as innocent and lively as usual, running around the room. Just as she was about to rejoice, a demonic hand suddenly reached in from outside the window, reaching for the child. The mother was shocked and frantically hugged the child tightly. She woke up to realize it was a dream. The child was still sleeping very quietly in his mother's arms, and the east had already faintly revealed a patch of gray-white color.

"Thank you, heavens, for protecting the child and helping him through this night." The mother looked at the gray-white sky in the east, and then at the child's small face, and tears almost welled up in her eyes.

Following the morning light reflected through the window, she looked at her husband sleeping soundly in bed. His thin, dark face was etched with wrinkles, a gift from the burden of supporting the whole family and the illness of his children. She also looked at the two daughters over there, still lingering in beautiful dreams. Milk-white arms pressed against the black hair. Pink cheeks were printed under the closed eyes, making them look even more innocent and lovely. She also saw her own withered hands and breasts, sucked dry by the child. Where was her youth? Where were the tender, slender hands of her girlhood? The full breasts? The slender figure? The tender cheeks that had been carefully shielded from the sun with a handkerchief? She remembered what her husband had said to her last night.

"You've worked too hard, you should rest for a moment."

"Look at your face, you have to take care of yourself."

She felt a pang of pain in her heart, but it disappeared immediately. The sunlight had already penetrated the window curtain and shone on the apple-like faces of the two daughters and the very quiet face of the sick child, showing a comfortable smile.

"Yes, for them, I don't matter." The mother felt supreme comfort.

### On the Creators of "New Literature"

— Zheng Yuan

Recently, several articles discussing the issue of "New Literature" have been published in "The Magazine." These articles thoroughly examine and critique the content, form, style, and tone of current "New Literature" creations, offering many valuable insights. However, they all focus on minor details of creation, without addressing the creators of "New Literature" themselves. Now, I will briefly discuss what I have observed.

Generally, the creation of an excellent work—whether it belongs to the category of "New Literature" or "Old Literature"—requires practical experience as its foundation. Imagining everything from scratch, without any basis, will likely not produce good writing. It is said that before Zhao Ziang exhausted his representations of horses, he locked himself in a room, looking up and down, leaping and jumping, first performing many horse-like movements and postures, only then could he paint horses with vivid spirit. Émile Zola, in order to write about the lives of workers, went himself to experience life among them. Cao Yu, the author of "Sunrise," reportedly frequented the Eight Great Hutongs for a month or two to understand the inner workings of brothels. From this, we can see that genuine impressions are necessary to write substantial works.

Looking back at many current creators of "New Literature," they spend all day deep within their ivory towers—or, more accurately, in pigeonhole-style garret rooms—leading empty lives with limited experience. They cannot write groundbreaking masterpieces, nor even articles that are slightly rich in meaning and genuinely reflect life. Thus, as Mr. Zhe Fei said, they can only meaninglessly shout about things like "dreams of lilac flowers," "the sorrows of nightingale elegies," and "the purity of lilies," while the objects they describe are merely the lips of dancers, the throats of singers, and non-existent lovers. As for lilacs, nightingales, and lilies, they probably haven't even seen what they look like, even in their dreams.

Perhaps some might sigh and say, "We don't want to write articles with more meaningful content and more positive viewpoints, but we can't ignore the current environment." In fact, this reason is extremely insufficient. A person who truly understands the art of "creation" can express things that others dare not say or write, using clever metaphors, subtle and roundabout techniques, indirect allusions, and methods of "setting off the moon with clouds," allowing readers to understand implicitly without violating the taboos of the environment. Moreover, besides those "sorrowful gray systems," "desert-like loneliness," "desperate souls," or streamlined multiple love affairs, the "flowers in the wind and moon" of the 20th century, and the romances of modern talented men and beautiful women under rose bushes, are there no other materials that can be used? If our "New Literature" creators can step out of their ivory towers, walk onto the crossroads of life, and use their eyes to see, their ears to hear, and their brains to think, then in this arena of life's review, from the internal unrest of society and the agitation of the working masses to the curses of vendors and the weeping of newspaper boys, everywhere there are inexhaustible subjects. If not, then writing about one's own familiar and experienced daily sights and trivial matters would be more intimate and moving than those mirages, wouldn't it?

However, even with the rich, complex, and unparalleled life experiences like those of Maxim Gorky, lacking the ability to extract information, refine essence, and organize, arrange, and synthesize the material from that practical experience, it is still futile. Soldiers returning from the trenches cannot all become Henri Barbusse or Erich Maria Remarque, just as sons of wealthy and noble families cannot all become Cao Xueqin or Leo Tolstoy. Merely having experience does not necessarily lead to the creation of excellent "New Literature." Then, are talent and spirit innate? Those "genius theorists" say that creation requires something like "inspiration," so they don't think about anything and wait for inspiration to arrive. They drink a little wine, planning to, like Van Gogh, become impulsively hysterical and smear paint on the canvas. They also bring paper and pens to the park, wanting to learn from Beethoven, who carried paper with musical staff lines and would compose whenever inspiration struck. But after waiting a long time, there is no trace of inspiration... From this, it seems that while genius cannot be said to be completely non-existent, wanting to create solely based on genius is an extremely childish and laughable matter. Thomas Edison repeatedly told young people that "success" is made up of one part "inspiration" mixed with nine parts "perspiration." If a spark exists in the body but is not connected with effort, then this spark cannot be promoted and expanded to burn across the wilderness!

The so-called "perspiration" and "effort," for a creator engaged in "New Literature," refer to the continuous cultivation accumulated over time. As for the methods of cultivation, of course, there are only reading more, writing more, thinking more, and critiquing more. A creator must possess three particularly long organs: first, the eyes of a scientist; second, the brain of a philosopher; and third, the hands of an artist. The reason for needing the eyes of a scientist is for observation, the reason for needing the brain of a philosopher is for speculation, and the reason for needing the hands of an artist is for the techniques of expression in creation.

But in terms of the standpoint of creation, the refinement of style is far less important than the cultivation of thought. Indeed, beautiful writing and ornate rhetoric are necessary conditions for a writer. Although the carving of words and phrases is a trivial skill, which Han Yu was ashamed to use as an actor's makeup, if one does not pay attention to rhetoric, even with substantial ingenuity, it cannot be instilled into the reader's heart. However, style is only form, and thought is content. Style is like rouge and powder, and thought is like a beautiful woman. With a beautiful woman, adding rouge and powder will make her even more beautiful. If you are truly beautiful, then even without rouge and powder, you will not lose your beauty. But if you are not a beauty, using rouge and powder will only make you look ugly! We would rather listen to a mountain song than read a "Rhapsody on Hunting," a congratulatory preface, or a certain person's epitaph, because the former is genuine and emphasizes emotion, while the latter merely emphasizes official style and wears a mask. Anything that is not "true" is not "real," and there is no question of "beauty."

Speaking of this, it reminds me of the criticisms that some supporters of "Old Literature" make of "New Literature." They say that many current "New Literature" works are either too immature or "protracted and muddled," "circuitous and evasive," "too thick to dissolve"... This is undeniable. However, they are unwilling to calmly think that the development of "New Literature" is only a matter of the recent decades since the "May Fourth Enlightenment Movement." It is currently in the stage of sprouting and growing. "Old Literature," with thousands of years of history, still has many shortcomings, let alone this newborn infant. But in just these few decades, it has already produced so many groundbreaking masterpieces, esteemed and loved by tens of millions of progressives, and has become widely popular among the broad masses. Therefore, the expansion and flourishing of its future, bright and splendid, is not difficult to predict.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that every creator engaged in "New Literature" will live earnestly, learn continuously, and write solemnly, so as not to fail the mission entrusted by the times.

### Father's Eyes Are Open

— Tian Qi Zhong Tao

Father: It has been nine months since you went to another world. It was on the evening of September 12th last year, at half past eight, a late autumn night. Because it was the countryside, the surroundings were frighteningly quiet. My mother, siblings, and I sat by your bed, accompanying you. Your expression was very peaceful at that time: you were staring at us with your eyes wide open. Were you feeling that you were about to leave us, and therefore trying your best to find a glimmer of hope among us? I don't know. Slowly, your limbs grew cold, your heart stopped beating, but your eyes remained wide open, unable to close. Father! You were worried: afraid that we would not be able to stand on our own in society! Ah, Father! Mother and siblings wailed loudly, but at that time, I didn't cry, nor did I feel anything. I was just dazed. I stared blankly at your body, lying on the bed but never moving again. I felt that life and death were too mysterious, and the distance between them was so close, like crossing a threshold. The night was very thick. Mother, exhausted from crying, had already fallen asleep. A bean oil lamp was lit beside the bed, and the wind in the courtyard threatened the flame, shaking the bamboo, making a rustling sound.

Father! You had no property in this world, but you had several children, two of whom were already adults (my elder brother and I), with no achievements; two were still in childhood, precisely at the stage where education was needed; a daughter was not yet married, and I was not yet married. The responsibility was quite heavy. You were very ill, lying in bed, thinking of this, you said: "If I can live for another ten years, the education and marriage of my children can be roughly settled, and I will be at ease. Just ten years..." But you were ultimately killed by the disease. In the final moment, you were unwilling, still wanting to struggle a bit. Your eyes were wide open; you were afraid that your children would suffer; you were so distressed that tears fell! Father, you left us, and we are living in hardship, just as you imagined!

Ah, I dare not think further. Father! Among your children, you loved me comparatively more, and you placed deep hopes on me; but what about now? The result of my years of struggle is that I am not as good as a clerk in a small shop, I am not as good as a tea servant, a worker—no, I am simply worse than a beggar! I have no enjoyment in material terms, no comfort in spirit; I live lonely years in solitude. So I watch plays, drink wine; I want to numb my painful nerves. Father! I no longer think about effort, I no longer demand success, I just pass the days muddledly. But when I think of your open eyes—ah, I am reminded of my mother's happiness, my younger brother's education, my younger sister's marriage, my own future, I cannot suppress my emotions, I feel my heart aching like a pattern, I am so wasted, I am letting you down—Father, am I worthy of you? I can only cry, cry, until exhaustion takes me into sleep...

Father, you often taught us: do not seek unrighteous money, and you said that wealth obtained by improper means will not last long. So you ran education for a lifetime, helping local administration, and were still very poor. You did not complain at all; you only encouraged us to strive to acquire a skill for self-reliance, and you would be at ease. When you were financially well-off, you always gave it to the poor; when eating, you often gave food to beggars. You said: "Giving what is surplus to others is the best thing, do not be stingy." Ah, Father, when you yourself only ate porridge, you still saved a little to give to others, how compassionate your heart was! You were unwilling to speculate, and how honest you were! Those you usually saw were a group of villagers without status or knowledge, but you were very kind to them, and they respected you very much; they knew you were seriously ill, and often asked: "Is he any better?" When they heard the news of your death, none of them did not sigh! Father, you were too good, the impression you gave me, I will never forget; not only in the painful and miserable present, but in the future, in the last moment before my death, I will still not forget your kindness!

Father! My son's mood is extremely disturbed now. I am thinking of you, I am experiencing all the injustices of the world, ah, I can't bear it anymore, I really want to commit suicide! But, you are staring at me with your eyes wide open, and in this gaze there is sorrow, entreaty, hope, unease, horror, all kinds of emotions, which shake my thoughts of death; is there anything more painful than a life that has no interest in living but cannot die? I wander, wander on the road of life and death. Father! Forgive me! I cannot continue your career, I cannot fulfill your hopes, I no longer have the courage to live! Moreover, I just want to be with you...

Father! When I hear others mention their fathers, I miss you; at night, I miss you; when I have a little free time during the day, I often think of you; as soon as I think of you, I only feel heartbroken, and tears can't help but flow down. Ah, Father! I don't know what to do! I cannot solve the realities of the world, I cannot let go of my grief for you, I hope you will tell me in a dream! Father! Please tell me, I am your pitiful son!

### Commentary: Amending the Central Reserve Bank Law

On the 14th of this month, the National Government announced amendments to the Central Reserve Bank Law, with the following key points regarding issuance:

(1) The maximum amount of Central Reserve notes to be issued shall be approved by the National Government.

(2) Central Reserve notes shall be issued in five denominations: one, five, ten, fifty, and one hundred yuan, and may also issue decimal fractional notes.

(3) The reserve for Central Reserve notes shall be at least 40% cash reserve, with the remainder secured by securities issued or guaranteed by the National Government, domestic bank acceptances, drafts, checks, domestic commercial drafts, and drafts payable abroad.

(4) The cash reserve for Central Reserve notes shall be divided into two types: (1) silver coins and raw gold and silver, and (2) foreign currency and foreign currency deposits.

(5) The Central Reserve note reserve shall be fully transparent, and the amount issued and the amount of the reserve shall be published weekly.

After reading the above five points in the new Central Reserve Bank Law, we feel greatly pleased, because: (1) according to the first point, the issuance of Central Reserve notes will henceforth have a maximum limit, to reassure people; (2) according to the second point, there will be no more rumors of the issuance of 500 large notes in the market; (3) according to the third point, Central Reserve notes will henceforth maintain at least 40% cash reserve, and the amount issued will be limited in an invisible way; (4) according to the fourth point, part of the cash reserve of Central Reserve notes will be deposited in friendly countries, and from this we can infer that the new gold production of friendly countries may help stabilize the value of Central Reserve notes; (5) according to the fifth point, the amount of Central Reserve notes issued and the amount of the reserve will be re-published weekly as in the past, to gain public trust.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Stipulates Measures for Registering and Transferring Major Commodities

The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of the Ministry-promulgated Major Commodities Registration Rules, has specially drafted the Shanghai Special Municipal Measures for Registering and Reporting the Transfer of Major Commodities. After submitting it to the Municipal Government for amendment, in addition to sending letters to the Municipal Police Bureau, the Shanghai West Police Bureau, and the Industry Bureau Materials Control Office for verification, it has specially telegraphed the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to verify and instruct the respective trade associations to instruct their members to comply. The measures are recorded below:

Registration of Major Commodities

(1) Major commodities are limited to the eighteen items stipulated in the "List of Major Commodities Under the Jurisdiction of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce" promulgated by the Executive Yuan: "1. Cotton, 2. Cotton yarn, 3. Cotton products (including cloth and knitwear), 4. Chemical industrial products (including raw materials, Western medicines, paints, dyes, and alcohol), 5.

(2) Anyone within the city limits who stores, buys, sells, or manufactures the above-mentioned major commodities (including raw materials and products), whether they are members of our trade association or not, must comply with the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's Major Commodities Registration Rules to complete registration procedures. (3) Anyone applying to register major commodities must first purchase a Major Commodities Registration Application Form and a Major Commodities Registration Book from this Bureau, classify them according to the type of commodity, fill them out, and submit them to the Bureau for review. (4) In registering major commodities, the type, name, quantity, source, value at the time of acquisition, packaging method, or storage location of the commodity, as well as the brand name, business location, name, address, and date of completion of the commodity owner and applicant, must be filled in separately and in detail. (5) Members of all trade associations who store, buy, or manufacture the various major commodities listed in Article 1 may have their registration applied for by the trade association on their behalf. (6) Those who are not members of trade associations who store, buy, or manufacture the various major commodities listed in Article 1 shall apply for registration at the Bureau themselves.

Procedures for Reporting Transfers

(12) If, after the registration of major commodities by the Bureau, there is no significant or complete change or reduction, the applicant for registration shall fill in the various items listed in the monthly report form of the commodity transfer prescribed by the Bureau in detail and submit it to the Bureau before the 5th of the following month in order to facilitate inspection. (13) After the registration of major commodities by the Bureau, the Bureau will send personnel to inspect the quantity of stock at any time. If it is found that there is concealment or underreporting, it will be punished in accordance with the Provisional Regulations on Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Major Commodities promulgated by the National Government on May 3. (14) If there is a change or reduction in the quantity of major commodities after registration by the Bureau, and a report is not submitted in accordance with the procedures, strict penalties will be imposed upon verification.

### Various Trade Associations Establish Evaluation Committees

Various trade associations in this city, in order to comply with the orders of the authorities, have been reorganized and established one after another. To take things a step further, starting from the beginning of this month, they have successively launched the establishment of evaluation committees for various trade associations. These committees have now been established one after another. All committee members are naturally the directors and supervisors of the respective trade associations, with the chairman of the board serving as the chairman of the committee. Additionally, individuals with outstanding talent and broad knowledge within the trade are hired as consultants to provide opinions and serve as evaluation material at any time. The organizational system is quite simple, mostly consisting of (1) an assessment section, (2) an investigation section, (3) an allocation section, and (4) a procurement section. Simultaneously, a research committee is established to study issues such as the adjustment of commodity prices, the stability of the commercial market, and the improvement of production efficiency.

Observing and Establishing Rules

For the convenience of promoting the work of the various evaluation committees, regulations that members of the trade should abide by have been established. The main points are as follows: (1) The price limits for goods of all grades evaluated and determined by the committee must be observed by the trade members. They must sell according to the limits and are not allowed to disobey openly and comply secretly, or sell above the set prices in secret. (2) Engaging in black market transactions or illegal activities such as speculation is prohibited. Any member of the trade who knows of such situations must report directly to the committee for punishment according to the law. (3) Monthly (or every ten days), a report form, in duplicate, must be filled out and submitted to the committee for record. This form should include the following items: A. Name of the business; B. Address; C. Nature of the business; D. Total value of existing goods; E. Quantity sold; F. Quantity of goods purchased; G. Business conditions. (4) Various goods are limited to being sold to legitimate users only and may not be resold to vendors or merchants outside the trade for profit.

Punishments for Violating Regulations

(5) Any items sold in retail stores should be marked with the price limits evaluated and determined by the committee. The size of the characters and the style of the labels should be limited to what is stipulated by the authorities and must be placed in a prominent location so that every customer can easily see and distinguish them clearly. (6) The measuring instruments used must meet the standards. Forgery, or being too long or too short, or too big or too small, is strictly prohibited. (7) Purchases of various goods must be recorded in a register for future inspection by the authorities and the committee investigators at any time. If such a situation occurs, the account books should be presented promptly without any other excuses. (8) The allocated goods must not be concealed and refused to be sold, so as not to confuse people. (9) It is strictly forbidden to reduce the quality or quantity for profit. Regardless of whether the customer is old, young, male, or female who wants to buy any kind of item, the item should be shown and the price limit should be told, without any deception. (10) If any of the above items are violated, they will be punished according to the law, or sued in court. No leniency will be shown.

Responsible for Promoting Evaluation

Thereafter, in addition to selling according to the limits, if members of the trade need to adjust the selling price slightly due to cost considerations, they must submit a cost sheet in advance, filling in the type of goods, the current market price, and the purchase price in detail. At the same time, the name of the business, the name of the representative, the name of the manager, and the detailed address must be written clearly. After the detailed price committee receives the cost sheet, it will be submitted to the evaluation meeting for lengthy discussion, and then handed over to the investigation section for investigation. After that, a document will be sent to the relevant authorities for approval. Only after the authorities approve can the new price limit be sold at. Otherwise, no changes can be made. As for the distribution and purchase of goods, it is hoped that the relevant authorities will supervise and assist, and that all members of the trade will contribute opinions at any time to promote public welfare.

### Six Items Such as Steel Will Establish a Control Association

In order to meet the needs, the relevant authorities are now planning to include six items, including steel, machinery, non-ferrous metals, wood, rubber, and chemical products, into a unified control organization. Currently, the control organizations for steel, machinery, and non-ferrous metals have been completed, and the control organization matters for wood, rubber, and chemical products are currently under review by the relevant authorities and will be finalized soon.

Cement Incorporated into Chemical Products

Cement for construction is also an important material for the war effort. In view of the increasing demand, in addition to the relevant parties actively procuring and manufacturing raw materials for cement, such as limestone, coal stone, and gypsum, to facilitate mass production, it has been decided to include organizations related to the production and sale of cement in the chemical products department for unified control.

### Hua Yi No. 1 Vessel Held Launching Ceremony Yesterday - Allied Nation Lieutenant Colonel Nakajo Attended in Person

The first vessel newly built by Hua Yi Engineering Enterprise Company, an affiliate of Jiu An Industrial System, held a launching ceremony at the Hua Yi Shipyard Machinery Factory in Pudong at 3:00 PM yesterday. In advance, Mr. Lin Kanghou, chairman of the company, invited guests from all walks of life to a luncheon at the Duchen Hotel at 12:00 noon. Guests included Lieutenant Colonel Toyoma Nakajo of the Shanghai Garrison Headquarters, economic figures Zhu Boquan, Pan Yangyao, Yu Mingshi, Li Quanshi, Zhang Yifan, Li Zhennan, Cai Qian, Pan Tongyun, Zhu Sihuang, Liu Yunfang, and over a hundred others. After the banquet, they gathered at the Customs Wharf and took a special vessel to the Hua Yi Shipyard in Pudong to watch the ceremony.

Ceremony Circumstances

The launching ceremony of the new vessel was held at 3:00 PM sharp. Miss Lin and Miss Zhou broke the champagne bottle and the guests cheered, completing the ceremony. Subsequently, Chairman Lin Kanghou and Standing Director Zhou Zhijun delivered speeches successively, and Lieutenant Colonel Nakajo stood up to congratulate. Finally, Zhu Binyuan, Shen Zhangfu, and others from Jiu An entertained the guests with tea and refreshments and visited the factory facilities until around 5:00 PM when everyone left.

Business Prospects

Hua Yi Engineering Enterprise's main business is shipbuilding and shipping. There are currently two more vessels under construction, both of which are intended for inland river transportation. At present, the promotion of material exchange and transportation is of utmost importance. In addition, the general manager Yao Runhua and engineer Chen Shiying, who are employed by the company, are both former specialized technicians from the Jiangnan Shipyard and have rich experience. Therefore, the company's contribution to the future of the shipbuilding industry will be great.

### Brief News

The Preparatory Office of the Metal Industry Federation is ready, and it is scheduled to convene an inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM tomorrow (the 23rd) at No. 150 Hong Kong Road. All registered iron and steel, machinery, and hardware trade associations in various regions must send representatives to attend on time.

The Shanghai Stack Industry Trade Association was ordered by the Economic Bureau to reorganize within a time limit, renaming itself as the Shanghai Special City Warehouse Industry Trade Association. Geng Xuekun, Zhuang Zhiyao, and others were designated as responsible conveners to establish it soon. All those engaged in warehouse business or part-time warehouse business in this city must apply to the trade association for registration before the 25th.

The Regional Egg Industry Trade Associations and the Japanese Egg Industry Joint Venture Company decided to establish a Sino-Japanese Egg Merchant Friendship Association, with Lu Boqi as the Secretary-General. Following the instructions of the Business and Trade Unification Association, it is also recommended to establish an Egg Industry Professional Committee, with Zhou Zizhuan as the Secretary-General. It is stipulated that from the 10th of this month, members who have goods arriving in Shanghai without being appointed by the trade association to purchase them will be considered private goods and will be punished according to the charter of the trade association.

In order to solve the problem of raw materials, the printing ink manufacturing industry in this city is currently organizing the Shanghai Printing Ink Industry Association. The organizational content has been applied to the authorities. It is reported that once the association is established, unified measures will be taken regarding the raw materials for manufacturing printing ink, such as pigments, mineral oil, rosin, and the sale of products.

Fu Min Dairy Company started production and delivery in October of this year. The original capital was 2 million yuan, which was approved for registration and held a license. This spring, due to business expansion, an additional 3 million yuan of capital was added, totaling 5 million yuan. The products include two types of milk powder, namely white tower and powdered milk, to meet the needs of the industry. Recently, it has been actively producing bottled Fu Min milk, which will be launched soon.

### Saying that the Central Reserve Bank Will Issue 500-Yuan Notes - There is No Provision in the Constitution

Recently, there has been a widespread rumor that the Central Reserve Bank will issue banknotes with a face value of 500 yuan, causing public anxiety, believing that this move will easily stimulate the market. However, according to sources with inside information consulted by reporters from Guofeng News Agency, there is no legal basis for this statement. The amended Central Reserve Bank Law promulgated on the 14th of this month, Article 19, states that the bank can issue exchangeable notes in five denominations: one yuan, five yuan, ten yuan, fifty yuan, and one hundred yuan. According to the latest laws and regulations, there is no provision for the issuance of 500-yuan banknotes, so the above rumors are hard to believe for the time being.

### Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association Holds General Membership Meeting Today

The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association is scheduled to hold a general membership meeting at its new address on the fourth floor of the Xinga Building, No. 12 Bund, at 4:00 PM today (the 21st) to discuss association affairs. At the same time, Minister Tajiri will be invited to give a speech. In addition, Mr. Kajiyama Kanroku, a member of the association, has been honorably transferred to the Tianjin Mitsui & Co. branch manager and will leave Shanghai to take up his new position soon. The association will also hold a farewell party at that time, and the enthusiastic atmosphere is foreseeable.

### Commercial and Trade Unification Association and Sino-Japanese Economic Relations (1)

— Toraji Kuriki

The advancement of Japan's policy toward China is the most significant manifestation of putting policy into practice. The first thing that should be mentioned is that under Chinese sovereignty, China's controlled economy is about to develop successfully. Moreover, this work is entrusted to Chinese civilians, which is indeed a groundbreaking initiative. The Commercial and Trade Unification Association established this time is an organization with such characteristics. The function of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association can be said to be the central nervous system of the Chinese economy.

Using this form of autonomous controlled economy to handle the Chinese economy is probably the first time in Chinese history. Therefore, the success or failure of the autonomous controlled economy still depends on future results. However, in terms of the significance of China's independent participation in the war, the Chinese people, no matter what difficulties they encounter, must take responsibility for completing this important task in order to complete the victory of the Greater East Asia War. This is especially true for Japanese economic people in China. In short, we will not hesitate to join hands with Chinese economic people and do our best to help China establish a controlled economy, which is also our duty.

Since the local Japanese residents participate in the Commercial and Trade Unification Association as the lower-level organization, Japanese people should make full use of their special skills or knowledge gained from years of experience to achieve common goals.

The fundamental principle of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association is that it is a public welfare institution belonging to Chinese sovereignty. Therefore, the regulations on its operation are entirely handled by the Chinese, which is an extremely fair and wise measure. We are sincerely pleased with this, and it is also due to the wise measures taken by the Chinese and Japanese authorities. This fact, along with Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, can be said to be proof of Japan's practice of its policy toward China. In other words, this proves that Japan's policy toward China is not just empty talk. It always respects China's sovereignty, and all issues between China and Japan start from this point of view. This time, it has been realized economically and politically, and it can be considered that the stage of implementing Sino-Japanese equality has been reached.

Therefore, Chinese officials and civilians must also strive to implement this point with the same understanding as the Japanese. Chairman Tang has repeatedly explained the important mission of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association. He also spoke very clearly in his instructions to the staff of the Commercial and Trade Unification Association and its lower-level organizations. However, I would like to emphasize it a little bit here and look forward to the Commercial and Trade Unification Association. (To be continued)
