### The Special Characteristics of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association

— Zhang Yipeng

Regardless of the type of organization, any that is local and organized by a group of intellectuals to protect the interests of the general public in the area will inevitably benefit the country's policies or decrees, directly or indirectly. Especially in times of national crisis and upheaval, if there are no such organizations to maintain and promote them, the government may find it difficult to cope, and the people will inevitably lose their support. Autocratic politicians, clinging to the prejudice of national omnipotence, believe that since the people are governed by a country, they should only accept governance and should not have automatic creation; they should only obey and should not have suggestions. They do not realize that acceptance and obedience are indeed unshakable principles, but automatic action and suggestions under these principles not only do not conflict but also make the implementation of power more solid and thorough. Therefore, parliamentary politics invariably measures the tendencies of political parties, and even dictatorial politics, even communist politics, require the support of people's organizations. The world often calls such groups public opinion bodies, which is not without reason.

The above is a general discussion of people's organizations in general. If we further analyze it, there are two major differences. One is somewhat political, and the other is completely apolitical. Those that are completely apolitical focus solely on the interests of the people themselves, how to obtain legal protection, and there is no room for research and discussion on the current political trends. This is the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, which was established not long ago and is mentioned in this article. This association has been in preparation for more than two months. Since the inaugural meeting on April 8 of this year, it has been three months. The number of members who have joined successively has reached ninety-seven, and the number of cases requested by citizens that have been accepted is ten. The internal and external correspondence of the association is inexhaustible. Although there is no public report, people from all walks of life who have been in contact with the association have understood its nature, and it seems that there is no need to express it urgently. However, telescopic observation is always inevitably vague, or equated with the local associations and citizens' associations of the past, and the special characteristics of the association are lightly overlooked, which is considered very regrettable.

What are the special characteristics of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association? There are, however, major meanings. The following three points can give a glimpse:

The first point is not to seek immediate success—whenever a new group is created, everyone eagerly hopes to do a lot of work. If no results are seen, they gradually become indifferent, as if they initially hoped that it would have omnipotent technology, and over time they see it as a superfluous decoration that is useless. How do you know that all kinds of work should be continuously continued, and not like fighting a war, you need to do it in one go. Under the current circumstances, citizens' welfare does indeed have an urgent need for assistance, but it must take steady steps, be prudent and thorough, and establish an effective and lasting foundation. Otherwise, a setback, a tiger's head and a snake's tail, then why bother?

The second point is not to show off one's abilities—the same two groups have the same goals and the same cause. However, upon closer inspection, each has its own abilities and its own ways. Although it does not go so far as to cause jealousy among merchants in the same industry, there is always some superficial welcome and secret resistance. The directors and committee members of the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association are all powerful figures in various Shanghai organizations. Even if the things they do have an independent and innovative color, there is absolutely no discrimination of closeness or distance. As long as it is in line with the purpose of this association, it will be relieved and supported uniformly, and treated as if it were its own business. No matter how hard the work is, no matter how successful it is, this is the creed of all members.

The third point is not to talk about theories—"theory is the mother of fact" is a purely philosophical theory. If you are a true practitioner, you must grasp the facts. No matter how much you talk about grand theories, put them aside for the time being. The university's "knowing where to stop, then there is determination" is the same principle. Shanghai citizens' welfare is all real events. The association only knows how to do this event in a practical and resourceful way. If you want to expand the scope and raise the purpose, you can only reserve it for the time being. The second membership meeting will be held on the 10th of this month. I would like to take advantage of the space in the Shanghai Daily's Weekly Review to express my humble opinions, without being ashamed of my ignorance. If you have any brilliant ideas, I would like to receive your guidance.

### Rice Prices Soaring, Competent Authorities Should Quickly Devise Countermeasures

Recently, black market rice prices have continued to rise. What we hear in the streets and alleys are long sighs for the price of rice, and what we see are frowning faces for the price of rice. "The people regard food as heaven," and the people's food problem is the most important part of the people's livelihood problem. Today, the price of rice is rising, reaching new highs, directly threatening people's lives, how can people not be anxious?

The Ministry of Food is the highest government agency in charge of the people's food, and the Rice and Grain Joint Cooperative is the implementing agency for regulating the people's food. With clear powers, they must be used to accomplish the mission. The government has said a lot about stabilizing people's livelihood, and the agencies that manage people's food should also have everything they need. Why is the development of the facts completely contrary to this? Therefore, we believe that the competent authorities have a responsibility to quickly decide on countermeasures to reverse the tide.

It is said that although there is a shortage of food in North China, the competent authorities have used various effective methods to reduce the price of grain by 30-40%. Then, the food supply in Central China is definitely not as difficult as in North China, but it is rising wildly. Where is the reason?

People's food is the most important point of people's livelihood. If the people's food adjustment is helpless, then where will the stability of people's livelihood start!

Executive Yuan Orders Provincial and Municipal Governments to Strictly Prohibit Insulting Allied Women and Children; Any Insulting Incidents Will Be Punished According to Law, Regardless of Size

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): The Executive Yuan recently issued an order stating that the relationship between China and Japan is becoming closer, but there are still vulgar elements in the market who insult Allied personnel, especially women and children, going to and from the streets and alleys, or make rude remarks, which is not appropriate and may lead to bandits and spies taking the opportunity to cause trouble. Therefore, the Executive Yuan ordered the Capital Police Headquarters, provincial and municipal governments, and the Xin Huai Special Zone Office that if such incidents are discovered, regardless of size, they will be punished according to law to serve as a warning. The original text of the order is as follows: Since China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, it has stood on the same front as its ally Japan, sharing weal and woe, and seeking the completion of the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, that is, seeking the liberation of China. Our ally Japan has also assisted China in completing its independence and autonomy, returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality ahead of schedule. In recent months, first the specialized concessions have been returned, and recently, the Shanghai International Settlement has been returned. The shackles imposed on China by Britain and the United States for a hundred years have been broken in one day, and China's long-cherished hopes have been realized in one day. The friendly relations between China and Japan have been further consolidated, and the friendship between the peoples of China and Japan will also be deepened as a result. At the same time, the Chinese people should be mindful of the great mission and the difficulty of bearing the burden. In their daily interactions with Allied personnel, they should always be based on the sincerity of sharing weal and woe, and show a humble and self-respecting attitude, so that the feelings between the people of the two countries will become more and more cordial, and their own morality will be tempered and become more and more sound. Recent intelligence has revealed that there are vulgar elements in the market in the capital and other places who insult Allied personnel, especially women and children, going to and from the streets and alleys, or make rude remarks, resulting in vulgar and base behavior, provoking resentment, and abandoning personality. Such inferior behavior is deeply hateful, and it is difficult to guarantee that there are no Chongqing Communist bandits and spies hiding among them, taking the opportunity to cause trouble and achieve their evil schemes. The Capital Police Headquarters and the provincial and municipal governments concerned are ordered to strictly investigate and prohibit such incidents from occurring. If any of the above incidents occur, regardless of size, they shall be punished according to law to serve as a warning to others. Facing the noisy wind in Lu, there are also those who say that all citizens should break the "selfish" mentality, and all citizens should advise each other on good deeds and correct each other on faults. Sincerity is closely related to this. The above-mentioned evil deeds are indeed committed by vulgar bandits; however, if people with knowledge and character can take social morality into consideration and correct them as soon as they see them, then the foolish and ignorant will know to restrain themselves, and crimes will have no chance to occur. If they think that it is not their business and turn a blind eye, then they are abandoning their responsibility. Ask yourselves whether their consciences can be clear. All agencies with educational and training responsibilities should pay attention to cultivating good customs and exhorting personality, which is to maintain diplomatic relations and have high hopes. This order, President Wang Zhaoming."

### Japanese Submarines Search for Enemy Ships and Achieve Great Results: Eleven Enemy Ships Sunk in June

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has used its electrical warfare to maintain strategic lines with strong supply and transportation warfare on the vast coast of 4,000 miles east to west and 10,000 miles north to south, while suppressing the enemy forces and forcing them to retreat to the eastern corner of the South Pacific and the East Pacific. This situation can be said to be an absolutely invincible and sustainable situation, but on the contrary, the enemy not only cannot reverse the current decline, but also cannot implement the necessary reinforcements for the landing forces approaching the Japanese front line. Therefore, the target of Japanese submarines has now changed from the initial principle of attacking warships to suppressing enemy reinforcement routes and sinking enemy transport ships as targets. A tight surveillance network has been deployed in the Pacific and Indian Oceans to search for enemy ships. The Pacific Ocean is not as small as the Mediterranean Sea, and there is no such thing as Gibraltar to control the key points. The traffic of enemy ships is not as frequent as in the Atlantic Ocean. Therefore, the search work is extremely difficult. However, according to the announcement made by the Japanese General Headquarters on the 3rd, a total of eleven enemy ships with a total of 85,000 tons were sunk in June, which is a considerable achievement. The largest of these eleven enemy ships was 15,000 to 20,000 tons. Therefore, since the beginning of the war, a total of 380 enemy ships with a total of 2,335,000 tons have been sunk.

### Japanese Economic Investigation Group to China Gives Talks to Reporters: The Group Will Hold Sincere Talks with Leading Figures in the Chinese Financial World

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): The China Economic Investigation Group organized by the Japan East Asia Economic Roundtable Meeting will soon depart for China. The head of the group, Ogura, and Messrs. Akashi and Nango, specially invited a group of reporters here yesterday to give talks, explaining the mission of the investigation group. The general idea is that the central task of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere lies in the proper resolution of Sino-Japanese relations, that is, in close cooperation in the political, economic, and cultural aspects to realize the ideal of so-called common life and death. Looking back at past Sino-Japanese relations, there has been cultural and economic communication, but it is still not cooperation. However, after the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's implementation of its new policy toward China, figures in the Chinese financial world have generally believed that the time for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has already matured. Therefore, our visit to China at this time is of great significance. As for our mission, it is to hold concrete talks with leading figures in the Chinese financial world and the National Government on economic cooperation between the two countries, and to fully accept the opinions of Chinese people. Therefore, we will not only take collective action, but also plan to hold private talks to exchange views. During this visit to China, economic issues in China, such as prices, finance, trade, and food, are all issues that we should study fully. If the results of our sincere talks with figures in the Chinese financial world can be beneficial to the coexistence and co-prosperity of the two countries' industries and economies, then that would be fortunate.

### General Matsui Iwane's Speech in Vietnam: The Fundamental Policy Towards Vietnam Remains Unchanged; Expecting the Vietnamese to Develop Great Power

Saigon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - General Matsui Iwane of Japan, before departing for Bangkok on the 3rd, met with a delegation of Vietnamese journalists here on the afternoon of the 2nd and gave a speech, stating roughly: I came to Vietnam thirty years ago and stayed in Tonkin for a year. I also came here fifteen years ago, so I am deeply concerned about the situation in Vietnam. This is my third visit. The people of Vietnam have given Japan the greatest cooperation, and Japan is grateful for this. Japan's policy towards Vietnam is based on eradicating the root of misfortune in East Asia and establishing lasting peace in East Asia, which is the core of the relationship between Japan and Vietnam. It is not limited to the Japan-Vietnam economic agreement, but aims to increase the happiness of Vietnam. The relationship between Japan and Vietnam may change in the future, but Japan's fundamental policy towards Vietnam will never change. Japan will take necessary measures to increase the happiness of Vietnam. You must understand that the future destiny of Vietnam depends entirely on the spirit of the Vietnamese nation. I have studied the history of Vietnam carefully, and I always sympathize when I read about the great powers invading Vietnam. However, I do not want to encourage you to launch a revolutionary movement. No matter how the European situation changes, Japan is determined to drive British and American forces out of East Asia, and it is still proceeding steadily. Therefore, the future of Asia is a bright world. The future of Vietnam is also predictable. I sincerely hope that the Vietnamese people will not forget the spirit of their motherland, be aware that they are members of Asia, and fully develop their great power.

### Germany Sweeps the Soviet Rear, Achieves Great Results

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German Supreme Headquarters announced a battle report on the 2nd, detailing the German army's campaign to sweep up Soviet guerrillas in the rear of the central region of the Eastern Front. The German High Command added a supplementary explanation on the same day, stating that the German army's campaign to sweep up Soviet guerrillas ended on the 1st, achieving great results. In this campaign, the German army captured 194 Soviet positions and 422 special fire points, and annihilated 10,376 Soviet guerrillas, also destroying one aircraft and fifty transport gliders. The German army also captured nineteen heavy cannons, nine anti-tank guns, eighteen mortars, thirty heavy machine guns, thirty-one light machine guns, sixteen anti-tank rifles, nine wireless radios, and many other items. Furthermore, Soviet residents and volunteer corps in the German-occupied territories also provided great assistance to the German army.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency learned from military circles that General Vlasov's Russian soldiers cooperated with the German army on Thursday to fight against Soviet guerrillas, protecting the rear railway lines and highways in the central section of the Eastern Front. This Russian army is mostly composed of captured Soviet soldiers who later volunteered to participate in the anti-Bolshevik war. Several Cossack battalions, led by their original officers, also fought alongside the army, demonstrating their reliability in several decisive battles. Many have been awarded for their bravery. In June, a planned bombing by Soviet guerrillas was avoided due to the attention of these local troops. A team of these Russian soldiers fought against a team of Jews attacking villages and townships. The Jewish bandits suffered heavy casualties, their camps were destroyed, and many of their weapons, ammunition, explosives, and a printing press were captured.

### Soviet Union Expresses Dissatisfaction with Anglo-American Delaying Tactics

Argentina Capital, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Churchill's statement that the Allied forces' landing operation in Europe will be delayed until after the autumn has greatly disappointed the Soviet Union's expectations for the Second Front. Recent Moscow commentaries obtained locally indicate that the Soviet Union is very dissatisfied with the delaying attitude of the United Kingdom and the United States. For example, the Moscow correspondent of the Washington Star reported on the 3rd that the Soviet Union is even more resentful of the Allied forces' general war plan against the Axis powers, especially the delay of the Second Front, because the United States has stopped supplying food to the Soviet Union. Moscow reporters also said that if the Allied forces only aim to occupy Mediterranean islands such as Sicily and Crete, or seize bases on the French coast, then the Soviet Union will not be satisfied with this. Furthermore, the Allied forces' preparations for operations on the European continent have also failed to achieve the effect of restraining German troops on the Eastern Front. According to a dispatch from Moscow, an article in the June 30th edition of Pravda attacked the Anglo-American propaganda work, saying it lacked authenticity. It stated as follows: The United Kingdom and the United States have said that Germany has transferred a large number of troops from the Eastern Front to be deployed on the coasts of Norway, France, Italy, and the Balkans, but since March, the strength of the German troops on the Eastern Front has not decreased, but has instead increased. This shows that what the United Kingdom and the United States have said is not true. Furthermore, the Soviet English newspaper Moscow News reported in February that the German authorities had increased the number of elite troops sent from the south to the Eastern Front.

Tangier, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Radio Algiers broadcast last night that the French Committee of National Liberation will hold a meeting today, chaired by General de Gaulle. De Gaulle's position has gradually strengthened due to the two changes in military and political positions in Algiers. His subordinate, General Bergeret, has replaced Colonel Tighalenri as the director of the Military Advisory Council (Note: Tighalenri was under General Giraud in France). In addition, Picot has been appointed as the director of the Civil Advisory Council. Picot has held diplomatic positions in Moscow, Sofia, Chongqing, and Washington.

### Japan Establishes Wartime Student Mobilization Plan (2)

Strengthening Mobilization for Increased Food Production

Increasing food production is currently an urgent task. The four vice-ministers of Agriculture and Forestry, Interior, Education, and Health jointly issued a statement on increasing food production, mobilizing labor from all over the country, utilizing wasteland, and moving towards increasing food production. Regarding the mobilization of students for increased food production, the vice-ministers of the Ministry of Education and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry responded to the aforementioned statement and issued the following statement to the governors of each prefecture on the 25th to further strengthen the original labor mobilization. The main points of the statement are as follows:

(1) In areas where there is currently vacant land due to a lack of labor, schools above the middle school level should actively cooperate with various agricultural associations and agricultural organizations to cultivate it together.

(2) The internships of students at agricultural schools and the operation of school farms should be focused on increasing food production. Regarding food production outside of schools, it should be supplemented by means of labor cooperation.

(3) The period of suspension of classes for higher grades and elementary school children in rural areas should be extended, taking into account the requests of local agricultural associations.

(4) Regarding the dispatch of school patriotism corps to agricultural schools in the mainland for long-term stays, special attention should be paid to appropriate guidance.

(5) In addition to having each school use its existing farms and usable school land to increase food production, use various nearby lands and vacant lands to establish patriotism farms and rotate students of all levels to plant food crops suitable for each region.

(6) In addition to mobilization during the busy farming season, each school should use rest days to cultivate food crops and, if possible, engage in work such as composting, mowing grass, collecting wood ash, and improving land.

(7) The accommodation, bedding, agricultural tools, seeds, etc. required for this labor mobilization should be handled jointly by each administrative official and related organizations, and financial assistance should be provided when necessary.

### A Perspective on Labor Disputes in the United States

U.S. President Roosevelt refused to sign the anti-strike bill, returning the bill to the Senate for review. The Senate rejected the President's veto by a vote of 56 to 25 and transferred it to the House of Representatives. The House of Representatives adopted the same attitude as the Senate and formally decided to override the law. The situation in which the President and Congress have come into direct conflict over the coal mine strike issue is highly concerning.

Roosevelt's decision to exercise his presidential veto at the last minute and refuse to suppress the bill shows that Roosevelt has put a lot of effort into resolving the strike. At the same time, he observed the trends of various domestic forces and finally decided to risk a battle with Congress.

The direct target of the bill proposed by Congress was to oppose the coal mine organization. From the various industry organization conferences to the more compliant American Federation of Labor, all launched fierce opposition movements. If the bill were formally passed into law, it was expected to induce a great unity of the entire American working class, and the production of military supplies would be in an irreparable state. Furthermore, the next general election is approaching, so Roosevelt considered it carefully and decided to issue this.

However, the President's ambiguous attitude unexpectedly aroused the opposition of Congress. The Senate adopted the motion to override the veto within five minutes after receiving the President's teaching, which shows how激昂 the upper house was about the President's actions this time. The faction that supported the suppression bill also merged with the original anti-Roosevelt faction to reject the President's bill. The government has in fact yielded to John Lewis, who was previously called a traitor.

Furthermore, the military department was opposed to Roosevelt's proposal to increase the conscription age to replace the suppression bill. They argued that if strikers were taken into the army, it would turn the glorious army into a kind of penal prison, which might have an unexpected adverse effect on the morale of the American army.

Therefore, the coal mine dispute has turned into a political struggle between the government and Congress, and the situation is extremely chaotic.

The main points of the anti-strike law formally established by the US Senate and House of Representatives overriding the President's veto are as follows:

Article 1: This law is named the Wartime Labor Disputes Act.

Article 2: Definitions of relevant matters.

Article 3: Regarding the confiscation of various wartime production facilities. Grants legal authority to the President.

Articles 4 and 5: Regarding the instructions of the Wartime Labor Board, other labor employment in certain situations, stipulating the maintenance of existing provisions.

Article 6: Anyone who incites, directs, or assists a strike in an operating factory or mine will be punished by the government as a criminal.

Article 7: Grants legal authority to the Wartime Labor Board, stipulating the various provisions of the aforementioned authority.

Article 8: Regarding major disputes that may hinder war-related production, labor representatives have the obligation to notify the Secretary of Labor, the Wartime Labor Board, and the Labor Relations Board. After receiving the notification, the Labor Relations Board will conduct a secret vote among the workers in each factory or mine on the thirtieth day to decide whether to stop working.

The full text of President Roosevelt's arguments on the anti-strike bill and the proposal to advance the conscription age is as follows:

I hereby do not approve of the so-called Wartime Labor Disputes Act and return it. The bill contains many issues and is not a simple bill. The bill has nothing to do with the system of preventing wartime strikes, but instead contains provisions that induce slowdowns and even strikes. I also doubt whether the Senate and House of Representatives have had a full opportunity to review the impact of these provisions on military supply production. According to Article 8 of the bill, when the representatives of employees based on wartime labor contracts pose a significant threat to hindering military supply production, they should report the above disputes to the Wartime Labor Board and the Labor Relations Board. In this way, employees will use a secret vote to indicate whether they believe there is a will to hinder military supply production. However, in the above provisions, although the pledge that leaders of labor organizations must not strike should prevent strikes, it must be notified in advance. As a result, relying on secret votes will instead promote strikes. In wartime, although there will be no prior notification, there cannot be a strike. Article 8 completely ignores the labor world's pledge not to strike and recognizes strike announcements and strike votes. Therefore, those who prevent strikes will instead increase the labor world's unease. Therefore, I am now amending the Selective Service Act, hoping that American people up to the age of sixty-five will have the obligation to engage in military labor other than combat. After this amendment, Americans who induce stoppages or even hinder work in factories under the control of the U.S. government due to strikes and other reasons can be assigned to military labor.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Clarifies the Situation of Rice Supply; Distribution Mechanism Transfer Period Temporarily Reduced; Strict Punishment for Stores that Raise Prices without Authorization by Taking Advantage of the Political Situation

The Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office announced: Due to the recent reorganization of the Shanghai Rice and Edible Oil Distribution Association, despite the various efforts of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, the shipment of rice to Shanghai has been slightly delayed. As a result, the distribution quantity of household rice has been temporarily reduced.

Temporary Phenomenon of Household Rice Reduction

The Council expresses its regret for the delay in the distribution of household rice this time and the temporary reduction in the quantity of distribution. However, this situation is entirely due to the temporary unavoidable delay in the arrival of rice in Shanghai after the transfer of the rice distribution mechanism to the Chinese authorities. The Council firmly believes that once the Chinese authorities have completed all necessary preparations, everything will return to normal. We sincerely hope that the citizens will not easily believe the rumors created by unscrupulous merchants. It must be known that the purpose of unscrupulous merchants is to sacrifice the public and only seek private gain.

Strict Measures for Spreading Rumors and Confusing the Public

Recently, illegal merchants have dared to take advantage of this opportunity to create unfounded rumors and wildly raise black market rice prices to enrich themselves. In addition to raising black market rice prices, they also disrupt the economic situation and endanger the peace and order of society. In view of this, the Council has decided to take strict measures against such illegal merchants.

Warning to Stores Not to Raise Prices

In addition, the Council warns general stores not to raise prices privately. Those who take advantage of the recent political situation and raise prices without authorization will be severely punished by the Council. This type of store not only endangers the city but also constitutes a criminal act of disrupting the political and economic situation. Regarding this, the Council will cooperate with the Chinese and Japanese authorities to impose the most severe penalties on unscrupulous merchants. We hope that the citizens can fully understand the importance of this step.

### 150,000 Bags of Rice Are Already on Their Way to Shanghai; Rice and Grain Joint Venture Escorts the Shipment to Shanghai; The Shortage of Household Rice Can Be Made Up

The supply of household rice in this city was slightly reduced in this period due to the transfer of the procurement mechanism. However, the announcement from the Shanghai Municipal Council Information Office has solemnly stated that the authorities are making every effort to make up for it. According to inquiries from the person in charge of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture, there is absolutely no problem with the distribution of food for the people of this city. The delay in the shipment of rice to Shanghai due to unavoidable reasons is purely a temporary phenomenon. Currently, there are 150,000 bags of rice on their way to Shanghai. The source of this large batch of rice includes 100,000 bags transferred by the Suzhou Rice and Grain Management Office, 30,000 bags transferred by the Huzhou Rice and Grain Warehouse, and 20,000 bags transferred by the Yangzhou Rice and Grain Joint Venture. The company has already sent personnel to the above three places to escort the rice shipment to Shanghai. After the arrival of the above-mentioned rice in Shanghai, the shortage of household rice in this period will be fully made up. At the same time, the Central China Rice Distribution Office still has ample food rice procured and stored in the warehouses. If necessary, the relevant authorities can also find ways to borrow it for relief. Therefore, residents can rest assured and do not need to worry unnecessarily.

### Authorities Take Strict Measures to Crack Down on Illegal Black Markets; Determined to Sanction According to Law to Stabilize the Market

Commodity prices in this city have recently soared, causing great panic among the general public. The main reason is entirely due to the manipulation of the black market. Creating rumors, agitating people's hearts, and disrupting the market situation, the relevant authorities in the urban area have dispatched personnel to conduct a thorough investigation and arrested unscrupulous merchants. It is believed that the rising trend will soon be completely quelled.

Speculation in Gold

Previously, speculation in gold was strictly prohibited by the authorities. Unexpectedly, recently, gold shops and speculators have again taken advantage of the political developments to create rumors and confuse the public, secretly raising prices. Black market gold transactions have risen to exorbitant heights. The listed price of gold ornaments in the gold shops' stores is sold at ×××× per tael according to the limit price and has variably increased the handling fee by ××××× per tael per day. This handling fee has a certain target, which is no different from speculation and disguised price increases.

Food

Since the authorities adopted the household distribution system for food in recent years, the supply of food for the people has been slightly balanced, and people's hearts have been able to stabilize. Unexpectedly, recently rumors have spread, and black market rice prices have risen daily. Yesterday (the 3rd), the rising trend was the most severe. After learning of the incident, the authorities immediately dispatched personnel to secretly investigate and detained rice dealers to be severely punished. The rising trend began to decline in the afternoon. The storage of rice allocated by the authorities in this city is extremely abundant. Recently, the Ministry of Food and the Allied authorities in Shanghai have purchased a large amount of rice from the internal production areas and have been clearing the way for shipment to Shanghai. Therefore, there is absolutely no shortage of food for the people. The rumors are completely unfounded. It is also heard that the allocation of household rice will be restored soon, and there is a proposal to increase the amount of rationed rice per capita. It is learned that the relevant authorities have taken strict measures to crack down on black market transactions and illegal price increases.

### Third Phase of Regular Allocation of Artificial Butter

The Shanghai Municipal Council has recently issued an announcement that the third phase of artificial butter will be allocated from July 6th to 15th. At that time, the registered retailers will exchange each ticket of the artificial butter certificate No. 3 for one-quarter pound of Parrot or Snow Brand artificial butter, and the selling price is eight yuan plus retail donation.

### Charity Performance for Disaster Relief; Entertainment Tax Exempted; Donations Collected in Round Numbers in the Name of the Shanghai Municipal Council

The Shanghai All-Circles North China Emergency Relief Association is actively planning and assisting in charity performances in various theaters to raise donations. They have also petitioned the Shanghai Municipal Council to exempt the 30% entertainment tax and allocate it to disaster relief funds. The Shanghai Municipal Council has replied in a letter that after the donations have been collected in round numbers, the donations will be donated to North China in the name of the Shanghai Municipal Council. According to this method, the Shanghai Municipal Council will collect the entertainment tax it receives in round numbers and hand it over to the bank designated by the North China Emergency Relief Association to collect donations, which will be used as disaster relief funds. If the amount is insufficient, the Shanghai Municipal Council will make up for it, but the maximum amount is limited to 200,000 yuan.

Shanxi Fellow Villagers Perform Drama to Raise Disaster Relief Funds

The disaster in North China is severe this time, and all circles in Shanghai are enthusiastically raising funds to organize emergency relief. The Shanxi Shanghai Fellow Villagers Association is deeply concerned about the disaster in their hometown. To raise disaster relief funds, they will perform a drama to raise funds at the Golden Grand Theater on the afternoon of the 5th of this month. All proceeds from the ticket sales will be donated. Ambassador Li Fang and Ms. Zhao Wenyi, president of the Women's Welfare Association, will personally take the stage. At the same time, Li Shifang and all the artists will perform their lifelong masterpieces. It is believed that those who are kind and generous will be happy to support it.

### Results of the Shen Bao Cup Charity Tournament

The charity donation for the Shen Bao Cup basketball charity tournament has been generously contributed by all circles. The total income from ticket sales for three days was more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, Mr. Xiang Kangyuan of Kangyuan Canning Factory generously donated 10,000 yuan, and donations from all circles. We deeply admire his charitable nature. The list of donations received yesterday is as follows:

Shanghai YMCA and Shen Bao jointly organized basketball game ticket sales for three days: 11,300 yuan, Xiang Kangyuan: 10,000 yuan, Wang Jingdong: 2,000 yuan,

Shanghai District Egg Industry Association: 600 yuan, Yao Deyu of Zhongyong Bank, Chen Shichang of Danan Bank, Chen Fumu, United Association of Egg Industry Associations in Various Districts, Shen Liuchun, Chuan Shoupu: 400 yuan each, Fang Jichuan: 200 yuan, Zhi Xiangzhuang: 200 yuan, Liu Jingji: 400 yuan. A total of 27,100 yuan of savings certificates were received. Previous savings of 193,300 yuan. Balance of 220,400 yuan.

(The balance reported yesterday did not include the income reported on the second day, which was a shortage of 1,400 yuan. This is hereby corrected.)

### World Red Swastika Society Continues to Take in Refugees

The Shanghai Refugee Relief Center run by the World Red Swastika Society received 38 refugees sent by the French Municipal Council yesterday, and also received the first batch of 53 refugees sent by the Shanghai Municipal Council (including one sent by the Baojia Guidance Department). After the doctors examined them one by one, they found that two were addicted to opium, six were addicted to white powder, thirteen suffered from syphilis, two were disabled, and two suffered from lung disease. A total of 25 people were eliminated.

### Paper Mill Industry Requests Removal of Electricity Restrictions to Increase Production and Maintain Cultural Development

The Shanghai Paper Industry Association, greatly affected by electricity restrictions on production, has specially submitted a written request to the Baole Department and the Shanghai Special Municipal Government, requesting measures to lift the restrictions so that they can maximize production and maintain culture. The written request stated: Although the association has 17 members, most are located in the International Settlement. The production volume of each factory has been severely restricted by the power company due to electricity consumption, reduced to one-half of pre-incident levels, and monthly work is less than a full month. In some cases, electricity is exhausted after only a few days of operation, while the social need for paper is urgent. Upon investigation, the Shanghai Power Company originally rationed electricity due to a lack of fuel. Now, coal sources are smooth and reserves are abundant, so even if full opening is not possible, the minimum requirement should be to facilitate electricity use for factories. If restrictions are imposed across the board without considering urgency, resulting in extreme shortages and skyrocketing black market prices, it would both hinder the authorities' efforts to suppress commodity prices and violate the wartime principle of increasing production, which would be an unwise measure. The association silently considers the crisis of the future of culture and respectfully submits this document, hoping that you will examine it closely and approve its transmission to the Japanese Embassy, ordering the Shanghai Power Company to remove restrictions on electricity use for all paper mills so that they can maximize production, thereby maintaining culture. This would be fortunate for the nation and fortunate for society.

### Strictly Punish Those Who Manipulate Market Prices; Appeal for Enforcement of Orders; Second Special District Party Headquarters Petitions Various Authorities

The Second Special District Party Headquarters of this city, in view of the prices of goods in recent days, which have caused an unprecedented surge with no end in sight, even doubling daily, not only makes life difficult for citizens but also affects the social economy, which is no small matter. Although the National Government has repeatedly issued clear orders and admonitions, the market has intensified its behavior, ignoring laws and warnings as if they were non-existent, resulting in today's black market. In order to safeguard the people's livelihood and stabilize prices, the headquarters advocates that those who hoard, speculate, and engage in black market activities should be strictly investigated and punished as a warning to others. To this end, it submits a petition to the Central Authorities, requesting the reaffirmation of previous orders and their effective implementation. It also sends separate letters to relevant authorities in the city, requesting that they truly judge those who manipulate market prices and take effective measures to reassure the people and curb the rising trend.

### Shanghai's Economy After the Return of the Settlements

The Shanghai Public Settlement will cease to exist on August 1st. In the past, the Public Settlement was a base for British and American aggression in China, and free market economics prevailed, forming a distorted state. Now that the settlements have been returned and are directly administered by the National Government, there should be a thorough transformation, striving to improve along the path of building a new China. However, some problems can be pointed out. The most important and obvious is that hoarding behavior has not yet been eliminated, with attempts to use the new agency for material control to seize illegal profits. Although there are many reasons, the complexity of the administrative structure is the main reason. Because of this relationship, it is difficult to impose strong sanctions on all economic crimes, which is deeply regrettable!

This time, the National Government's recovery of the settlements should fundamentally modify the settlement economy and implement adjustments. From now on, Shanghai's economic machinery can be unified, the obstacles in the administrative system can be completely removed, and the unification of control can be realized to achieve a perfect posture. At the same time, Shanghai is the economic heart of China, and all relations are of utmost importance. After the settlement takeover, it is hoped that special care will be taken in the selection of personnel and the operation of institutions responsible for practical work and adjustment.

### Silver and Money Industry Sets Business Guidelines for the Second Half of the Year

After completing the final accounts for the first half of the year, the silver and money firms reopened for business yesterday. At the same time, the stock market and various industry markets resumed trading. It is reported that the entire financial sector in Shanghai, under the leadership of the Central Reserve Bank, has remained stable throughout. After the firms were adjusted through low-interest loans, their own strength has become more abundant. In order to make every effort to support the development of agriculture, industry, and commerce, it has been decided that starting in the second half of the year: (1) Promote the acceptance and discounting of bills. The specific implementation methods have been formulated by the small group of the Banking Association and will be gradually promoted in order to facilitate the funding of legitimate industrial and commercial funds. Commercial bills that have been accepted for discounting can be re-discounted with the Central Reserve Bank. (2) Increase deposit interest rates to absorb excess floating capital in Shanghai society and assist the authorities in suppressing commodity prices and curbing floating capital from wreaking havoc in the black market. (3) Provide loans for small industries and agriculture. All industries that wish to develop production and purchase agricultural products and need funds may apply for loans from various firms, but they must provide documentation to prove the use of the funds, and then the loans will be approved after strict review.

### Summary of Business Conditions

Cotton Yarn: The holiday is over, and the yarn market is optimistic, but the volume of goods is not large, and holders are unwilling to sell, so prices are reaching a peak, and transactions are not active. 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix has reached a huge 46, 32-count double-strand Xiantao is slightly lower, 20-count Shuangma Bank is at 35, and 10-count Red Shuangma is about to break through.

Daily Necessities: Today the prices of daily necessities soared. Huorong (matches) were in short supply because the small matches allocated by the Japanese Match Allocation Association to the city have not yet been distributed, causing prices to soar. Soap and candles rely on inventory, and market prices have risen sharply. For example, Guben soap has exceeded the "customs", and Baixiangmao Arrow Knife has also risen high.

Government Bonds: This morning, Unified Government Bonds rose sharply in the gray market, but types B and D were relatively low.

Call Loan Interest: This morning, the Call Loan Interest rate of the Money Industry Association was 22%, up 2%.

Outside the industry, transactions were not active. The price of silver outside the industry will reach nearly half a hundred.

Cotton Cloth: This morning, the cloth market was surging. At the beginning of the morning, the demand exceeded the supply, resulting in prices hitting record highs, and the results were consistently higher than before the holiday. Longtou fine cloth rose to 95, and the price of Sijunzi Serge also rose. The current prices of Taohua Nushi Linbu rose more slowly, and the rise in Sanyang Serge and White Cat Printed Cloth was slower. The former was higher by 40, and the latter was higher by several yuan.

Woolen Fabric: Sezi Gong Ni, because it cannot be spun from Chinese wool, is becoming increasingly scarce in the market, and prices continue to climb. Recently, it has been found that only one or two out of more than 400 woolen fabric firms have a stock of green Sezi Gong Ni.

### The Responsibility of Today's Industrial and Commercial Circles

— Lu Tingfang

Recently, economic scholars generally place their hopes on the government's actions and solutions for various economic problems in China at this stage, such as the lack of resources, the decline in production, the high prices of goods, the stability of currency value, the obstruction of transportation, the use of idle funds, the control of interest rates, the renewal of financial institutions, the elimination of speculative behavior, the establishment of capital markets, and the expansion of the rationing system. This is because wartime economic control requires leadership from the authorities from top to bottom, or the use of legislative means to establish the trajectory of private economic behavior, or the use of administrative means to guide the path of private economic behavior. All of these are originally unchangeable principles, and various countries have implemented them with considerable success.

However, the current situation in our country has a special point that no other country has, namely, the psychological pathology of the industrial and commercial circles. We deeply know that "the government authorities not only have well-thought-out plans for controlling the economy, but are also actively promoting them; and they are also open-mindedly adopting opinions from the private sector, sparing no effort. We have infinite respect for this painstaking effort. However, if we look back at the internal situation of the industrial and commercial circles, we feel a shadow lingering in our minds. Today's industrial and commercial circles are indeed in a state of struggle and exhaustion due to the evolution of the current situation, which is undeniable. However, if we can recognize the current situation, cooperate with the authorities, and actively make changes suitable for the environment, then this state of distress and struggle can be regarded as the darkness before dawn. However, there are still a great number of people in our industrial and commercial circles who linger at the door of liberalism, confused by the "ultimate victory". This kind of pathological psychology has been rooted for a long time, and it is very difficult to eliminate. The result is the rampant prevalence of profiteering, and the use of funds no longer follows legitimate paths; all activities of industrial and commercial operators are no longer based on the premise of the people's livelihood. Therefore, they take various evasive actions towards government control, and lack the enthusiasm for self-motivation in promoting production. Invisibly, they weaken the power of economic construction, and the industrial and commercial prize winners themselves fall into a state of struggle and exhaustion and cannot extricate themselves. Since the existing materials are limited and the production situation is so sluggish, coupled with the fact that everyone wants to make a profit from just one transfer, no matter how strict the authorities' price control is, the rise in prices will inevitably occur. Therefore, turning from side to side, the beneficiaries are indeed the industrial and commercial sectors themselves, and the victims are none other than the industrial and commercial sectors themselves; as a result of rising prices, on the one hand, the relative purchasing power of money is weakened, leading consumers to reduce their consumption due to limited economic capacity, and on the other hand, industrial and commercial enterprises have to sell their goods at a price of one hundred yuan, and they inevitably have to replenish them at a price higher than one hundred yuan. As a result, although they make a profit on the books, the actual goods they retain are reduced. This phenomenon has been deeply loved by informed people, and if it is not remedied, it will inevitably lead to extremely serious consequences. The way to remedy this is to stabilize prices, in addition to the various measures of the authorities. In particular, industrial and commercial self-respect and self-love are required. Those engaged in industry and commerce should know that the current profiteering policy, its profits, should be said to be taken from business, rather than obtained from plunder; even if the wealth obtained from plunder can be secured, the heart is still uneasy. Moreover, will all the adverse consequences it causes still be borne by the business community itself? Since the National Government's participation in the war, all policies have been based on economic construction, and it is gradually improving the current economic situation. This is the time for the industrial and commercial circles to strive for development through normal channels. Can our industrial and commercial people abandon the concept of pursuing excessive profits? And take serving society and regulating the supply and demand of materials as their own responsibility? The self-respect and self-love of the industrial and commercial circles can not only reduce a lot of labor costs for the authorities, but also be the gospel of the social group.
