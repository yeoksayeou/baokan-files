### Wartime Economy and Suppression of Speculation

Since the formal declarations of war against Britain and the United States, this newspaper has systematically and proactively offered suggestions on wartime economic policies and increasing production. When discussing wartime economy at this moment, in addition to active efforts and facilities, naturally, there must also be passive measures that complement each other to achieve practical effectiveness. I will now further elaborate on my views as a humble contribution.

The essence of what is generally called wartime economic policy lies in being able to adapt to economic policies during extraordinary periods. Its goal is to concentrate and strengthen the work of various economic sectors, improve the effectiveness of economic policies, and strive for the final victory of the war. Therefore, anything that goes against this supreme principle, anything that has an unfavorable impact on the war, anything that weakens combat power, must be suppressed by extraordinary means. Currently, the most serious issue is speculation—speculation in disguise. To put it bluntly, the evils of Shanghai have always been caused by the rumors of speculators. Especially in recent years, the so-called "extraordinary period" has created opportunities for speculators to seize excessive profits. Ordinary owners of idle funds, because speculation can yield excessive profits, have abandoned the proper investment path and flocked to the evil path of speculation. As a result, on the one hand, it has led to rising prices; on the other hand, it has led to a shortage of materials due to insufficient investment in production. At the same time, the stagnation of the production sector and the increase in unemployment have further reduced the purchasing power of the general public. As a result, not only has it created panic in society, but it has also adversely affected the country's financial economy. In the past six months, although the Chinese and Japanese authorities have repeatedly and severely cracked down on speculation in foreign exchange, opium, cotton yarn, and other areas, the idle funds in the market, unable to find a proper outlet, have instead used national bonds and Chinese stocks as speculative targets under the guise of "investment." Market prices often fluctuate sharply, rumors flourish, people's hearts are shaken, and society is uneasy. This situation poses a significant obstacle to the government's implementation of wartime economic policies. Therefore, suppressing speculation in disguise has become one of the most urgent policies at present.

The Chinese and Japanese authorities already have principles and methods for suppressing speculation, which need not be elaborated. We believe that what still needs special attention today can be divided into two levels: on the passive side, it is necessary to thoroughly implement restrictions. There is no need to explain why the restriction on national bonds must be implemented. Even for Chinese stocks, there should be corresponding measures. It should be known that the current disguised speculation, which takes Chinese stocks as its main body, is not only fueled by general speculators, but also by some shareholders who hold Chinese stocks. As a result, a generation of entrepreneurs cannot concentrate on planning the development of their businesses and must also spend part of their time and energy dealing with the rise and fall of their own stocks in the market. If there is a reasonable price limit, then the storm will lose its opportunity to act. However, suppressing speculation cannot rely solely on passive measures such as controls, price limits, and crackdowns. Greater efforts must be put into the active side. First, the authorities must quickly and meticulously determine policies for the development of agriculture and industry, so that the owners of idle funds thoroughly understand the proper path to investment and profit. Second, the authorities must create safe and profitable conditions for investing in industrial and agricultural production from several key aspects. For example, specially protecting private industrial and agricultural production, implementing a guaranteed interest system for industrial and agricultural production projects, implementing large-scale industrial and agricultural loans, and welcoming private idle funds to participate, giving them particularly favorable profits. Third, the authorities must fully supply industrial raw materials, provide the greatest convenience for transportation, and ensure the reasonable distribution of product markets. Fourth, strict sanctions must be imposed on special classes who monopolize everything with the government or Japanese influence as their backing and seize excessive profits. We firmly believe that the most important reason for the current speculative frenzy is that the owners of idle funds cannot find a safe and profitable outlet. As long as the authorities sincerely implement the above points, effectively protect and guide idle funds into the proper path of production, we firmly believe that the speculative trend will stop without being suppressed. Just like controlling floods, instead of blocking everywhere and inevitably causing breaches everywhere, it is better to dredge on a large scale, which can not only avoid flood disasters but also reap the benefits of irrigation.

Finally, we want to offer loyal advice to those who own idle funds and engage in speculative activities: First, speculation is already a risky business in peacetime, which is not allowed to exist by organized countries. In wartime, this behavior that endangers the country and society will not only be condemned by one's own conscience but will also inevitably be subject to the most severe sanctions of national laws. Speculators must know that the acquisition of excessive profits is accidental and fortunate, while the sanctions of criminal laws are inevitable and unavoidable. Second, we should thoroughly understand that speculation is a kind of gambling. Whether it is national bonds or Chinese stocks, once they become the main body of speculation, no one can guarantee the safety of their speculative "investment." Then, whoever engages in speculation is not only heading for a dead end but also becoming a sinner of the country and society.

### Admiral Dönitz Succeeds Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy; Admiral Raeder Transferred to Naval Inspector General; Submarine Warfare Will Intensify

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - According to a public statement issued by the Führer's headquarters, Führer Hitler received the German Navy today at the headquarters, and awarded the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross to Admiral Raeder due to his outstanding achievements, which are closely linked to Raeder's long-term service.

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - It is officially announced here that the new Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Dönitz, will continue to serve as the Commander of Submarines. Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - The succession of the German Submarine Commander as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy has great significance from a military point of view. Although the German Navy is responsible for various missions, the submarine mission is the most important and should occupy a priority position in the navy. Dönitz's succession as the Commander-in-Chief of the Navy indicates that the naval battle will intensify, and the great war for ocean freedom will inevitably be increasingly fierce submarine warfare.

Encouraging Naval Officers and Soldiers

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - The new Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy, Admiral Dönitz, issued a letter to naval officers and soldiers, stating that he was ordered to succeed as the Commander-in-Chief of the German Navy and would continue to serve as the Commander of Submarines, hoping that all naval officers and soldiers would absolutely obey, be brave and decisive, be loyal to their duties, and achieve victory and peace under the leadership of Führer Hitler.

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - Admiral Dönitz is 52 years old. Twenty-five years ago, he was captured in Gibraltar. At that time, he was a submarine lieutenant and made great achievements in attacking enemy ships in the Mediterranean. The date of his capture was October 4, 1918. In 1934, he was transferred from the Naval Department to serve as the captain of the training ship Emden. In 1939, he was transferred to be the Commander of Submarines. Within four years, he completed the construction of submarines. After the outbreak of the European war, German submarines had sunk 15,000,000 tons of enemy ships.

### Axis Powers Submarine Warfare Achievements

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - In recent days, German submarines have sunk nine British ships with a total of 45,000 tons in the North Atlantic, Mediterranean, and Arctic Seas.

Rome, January 31st, Havas News Agency - An Italian submarine sank two destroyers and one large ship off the coast of Algiers. Another Italian submarine sank two enemy ships near Bougie.

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - When Roosevelt and Churchill were lingering in Casablanca for ten days, they were discussing countermeasures, trying to prevent German and Italian naval and air forces from continuing to destroy Allied ships on the coast of Algeria. Often an enemy destroyer was escorting a merchant ship and was sunk by an Italian submarine. At the same time, the port of Algiers was dealt a fatal blow, and the number of damaged merchant ships was numerous. German submarines are now active again in the Mediterranean, the Arctic Sea, and the North Atlantic, sinking sixteen ships with a total tonnage of 103,000 tons. In the Mediterranean, many enemy ships, although heavily guarded, were eventually sunk. These ships were loaded with a large number of vehicles and supplies, which were originally intended to be shipped to North Africa for use by the British army, and some were to be transported to the Soviet Union via the Arctic Sea via Murmansk. These sunk enemy ships were all large-scale barges. In the North Atlantic, there were ten large steamships, including a large oil tanker, reaching 75,000 tons. Through the experience gained in this war, the naval strengths of Britain and Japan can be compared with each other. Britain has set up new departments under the naval and air forces, and Japan's naval and air force commander-in-chief is directly responsible to the Emperor.

### Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule; Grand Celebration in Berlin; Goebbels Encourages the People to Support the Führer and Strive for Victory

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - A grand mass meeting was held in the Berlin Sports Palace yesterday to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. The brown National Socialist Party uniforms and red national flags created a magnificent scene. However, there were very few German soldiers wearing gray military uniforms. German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels, accompanied by Labor Front leader Dr. Ley and National Socialist Party Stormtroopers leader Himmler, entered the venue at 3:25 pm, and the crowd cheered like thunder. A delegation from the Italian Fascist Party led by Calabini also attended the meeting. Dr. Goebbels' speech and Führer Hitler's instructions left a deep impression on the audience, and cheers were heard from time to time.

Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency - In order to celebrate the tenth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule, a commemorative bonfire party was held here at 4 pm on the 30th. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels attended on time. Before reading Führer Hitler's declaration, he first explained the reason why the Führer was unable to leave the headquarters to attend due to busy military and political affairs. Then, he delivered a speech, revealing Germany's determination to strive for final victory, with the following main points: The British and American propaganda agencies spread various unfounded rumors about the domestic situation and combat beliefs in Germany in order to confuse the world. Little did they know that Germany had made complete preparations. The word "surrender" does not exist in the dictionary of German socialists. The enemy may have realized how firm the German people's determination is. Today, all German people are ready, and their determination to strive for final victory is unwavering. This war is approaching its final curtain, and our battle is not for the glory of the country, but to ensure the survival of the people. Therefore, all German soldiers are loyal, brave, and willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. At this extraordinary moment, in addition to expressing trust in the German soldiers, we should also absolutely trust Führer Hitler. Now the German people are contributing everything to the country to complete the war, and the call has been heard by the leader, knowing that no one in Germany wants a comfortable life, but all hope to do their best to strengthen military equipment. The government will take various measures in the near future to complete the war. All our people should also rise up to eliminate totalitarianism and communism. At the same time, national socialism should also be strengthened and its direction determined. In this war for survival, German people, regardless of men, women, old, or young, should contribute their best to the country. At the same time, we should always remember that Führer Hitler personally commanded the Eastern Front operations under any difficult conditions.

Italian King and Prime Minister Send Congratulatory Messages

Berlin, January 31st, Central News Agency - Italian King Emmanuel III also sent a telegram to German Führer Hitler on the tenth anniversary of the Nazi Party's rule in Italy, and Führer Hitler and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini also exchanged congratulatory telegrams.

### Key Points of Hitler's Instructions; Incompatible with the Soviet Union; Germany is Fighting for the Entire Europe

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels read the German Führer's instructions on the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule at a mass meeting in Berlin yesterday. The German Führer asserted that as a result of the current war, Germany and its allies will achieve complete victory. The instructions also discussed future work, to establish a "German state for Germans" and to protect the European Federation to defend against the crisis in the East. The ideals of the National Socialist Party and the German people are engaged in the current war to await the final victory. In Führer Hitler's instructions, the political and economic situation in Germany after the Treaty of Versailles was first described, followed by the announcement after the party came to power, deciding to unite the country to suppress the crazy emotions at home and resist the oppression imposed abroad. Then, the internal organization of Germany in the past ten years was described in general. Regarding Führer Hitler's diplomatic mission, the instructions stated that if God had not given the power of the country to the National Socialist Party, what would Germany and Europe be like today? The purpose of the massive military build-up implemented by the Bolsheviks was to attack Europe. Since 1941, European countries have been resisting the crisis in the East under the leadership of Germany. However, this should be attributed to the National Socialist Party's acquisition of power in 1933, otherwise it would not have been possible. Under today's circumstances, Europe and the Bolsheviks are incompatible. If Europe cannot achieve victory, then the land of European culture will be ravaged by the Bolsheviks. Führer Hitler also expressed his gratitude to those who have devoted themselves to national socialism and this war for ten years, saying, "The enemy we are currently encountering is still the old enemy of 1914. This war will determine the survival of the people of the country. Therefore, God will always be our judge. We should do our best to fulfill our responsibilities, according to the principle of survival of the fittest, to overcome all hardships. New life will be born from the dead and the destroyed. Our work is here. The spirit of our war will last forever and be immortal. When necessary, we will need to protect the European Federation to defend against the crisis in the East, so that Greater Germany and its allies can coexist, prosper, and enjoy freedom."

Berlin, January 31st, Havas News Agency - A special dispatch from Havas News Agency stated that the German Führer did not personally deliver a speech yesterday because he was too busy with military affairs to leave the headquarters. However, no one knows what Führer Hitler is paying attention to at the moment. Dr. Goebbels and Marshal Goering announced that the strength of the German army will have new developments this spring. The new German army will be better equipped. This is enough to show the world that the German army has unprecedented strength. Dr. Goebbels declared that the German people will exert greater power to engage in the production of preparations. When Marshal Goering mentioned the intensity of the fighting on the Eastern Front, he revealed that the Soviet army has used its last batch of reserves to make a desperate bet. Therefore, the Soviet offensive has shed a lot of blood. The German command will publish the correct figures of the Soviet army's losses to the world. The diplomatic community here expressed deep sympathy for Marshal Goering's remarks, believing that Germany is the only country to destroy Bolshevism. Since the Soviet army launched an offensive on the Eastern Front, the German army on the front line has often been in the most dangerous position. In the German Führer's instructions, he stated that Germany and national socialism are fighting against the Bolsheviks, and are fighting for the entire Europe. Those who did not participate in the war should keep these words in mind, because this war is not only fought for the Germanic nation, but also to eliminate the crisis from the East for European countries.

### Situation in North Africa Unclear; Conflicting News from American Newspapers

Switzerland, Seoul, January 30th, Havas News Agency - A French separatist news agency in London expressed dissatisfaction today with the failure of American newspapers to report accurate news about the North African incident to readers. Although American newspapers published a public statement issued by the French separatist news agency in the name of General Tugault, they also published a public statement issued by the official in Algiers. Therefore, the news released by the two sides often contradicted each other, making it impossible for American readers to understand the truth of the situation in North Africa. For example, regarding General Tugault's possible appointment of General Giraud as the administrative governor of Algiers or Morocco, American newspapers published no fewer than eight conflicting pieces of news, but never stated which one was true.

Sweden, Seoul, January 31st, Havas News Agency - According to Swedish newspaper news, dissatisfaction with Secretary of State Hull's North Africa policy is increasing in the United States.

The "New York Post" called Hull an "incompetent person," and even the "New York Post," which is close to Roosevelt, expressed disappointment with the development of the political situation in North Africa. The newspaper said that President Roosevelt should bear the responsibility for this matter himself and requested Roosevelt to publish a document on whether Churchill agreed with Beaudoin's appointment. The newspaper concluded by asking Hull to frankly tell Roosevelt that the United States needs a document on the North Africa incident.

### Tunisian American Reinforcements: Axis Forces Tenaciously Defend Positions; Rommel's Rearguard Fights Bravely; Both Sides' Air Forces Bomb Transportation Lines

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch): According to North African news, the Tunisian battle situation has recently appeared increasingly advantageous to the Axis forces. On the 29th, the two armies engaged in large-scale battles in several locations on the eastern side of the Atlas Mountains in central Tunisia. It is reported that the Axis forces have occupied a strategically crucial high ground. Although the Allied forces launched a counter-offensive in an attempt to recapture the high ground, they were repelled by the Axis forces. In addition, the French forces in the area have also repeatedly launched offensives and are currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces. Further news indicates that a large number of American reinforcements have arrived in central Tunisia. Moreover, in the border area between Tunisia and Algiers, the British First Army and strong American units are also concentrated. It is said that the Allied commander in North Africa, Eisenhower, is quite anxious about the lack of progress in the battle situation and intends to order his troops to break through the Kasserine Pass defense line and advance into the area from Sousse Port to the southern part of Menezia and the western part of Tripolitania. The Axis rearguard units have repeatedly defeated the vanguard units of the British Eighth Army, preventing their advance. Although a Cairo dispatch reported that a portion of Montgomery's army had entered Tunisia, this claim has not yet been confirmed. Currently, the western coastal area of Tripolitania is completely under the control of the Axis forces. At Buerat (approximately 50 kilometers west of Sirte), the British forces have launched continuous attacks over the past three days, but the Axis forces continue to tenaciously defend their positions.

Swiss Capital, 31st (Havas News Agency dispatch): It is learned that the frontline fighting in Tunisia has become more intense today. The British and American Allied forces are attempting to prevent the Axis forces from taking encirclement actions south of Pont du Fahs. In southern Tunisia, there were intense encounters between the scouting units of both sides. American troops, along with the Free French forces defending the area, are preparing to advance towards the coast.

Swiss Capital, 30th (Havas News Agency dispatch): According to Axis and Anglo-American sources, the North African front was limited to localized engagements yesterday. The battle situations in various areas are recorded as follows: (1) In the Tripolitania sector, the rearguard of General Rommel's armored units was subjected to fierce attacks by the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery and was eventually repelled. (2) In the Tunisia sector, according to war reports released by both Germany and the Anglo-American forces, only localized battles occurred. The Italians claim that the Axis forces are currently consolidating their positions. (3) Both sides' air forces were quite active. Anglo-American aircraft bombed the port of Sfax, while Axis aircraft attacked the ports of Algiers and Bône. Twelve Anglo-American aircraft were shot down on the front lines, and seven British aircraft were destroyed on the ground at Bône port. Furthermore, German and Italian air forces again attacked convoys between Algiers and Bône. According to the Italian communiqué, one British destroyer and two merchant ships were sunk, and another was severely damaged. Subsequently, another bombing raid was carried out, sinking three merchant ships with a total displacement of 14,000 tons, and two British destroyers were severely damaged.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): On January 29th, at midnight, German aircraft broke through the anti-aircraft fire network of Algiers Bay and dropped a large number of bombs on targets at the docks and stations, causing significant damage.

Allied Commander in the Mediterranean: Major Changes Imminent

After Eisenhower's appointment as Supreme Commander, his command will establish three service commanders for the army, navy, and air force. General Alexander will serve as Army Commander, Air Marshal Tedder will serve as Commander of the Anglo-American Air Force, and Admiral Cunningham will serve as Naval Commander.

### Voronezh Region: Fighting Intensifies; Soviet General Offensive on the City Remains Unsuccessful; German Forces Successfully Withdraw from the North Caucasus

Stockholm, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch): According to news from the Eastern Front, fighting in the Voronezh region has become more intense in recent days and has become the only fierce battle area on the Eastern Front. German and Allied forces in the area are repelling fierce Soviet attacks on the Novokhoskovo defense line and repeatedly attacking regardless of sacrifices, but the German forces are still holding their original positions. In the lower Don region, the German forces appear to have the upper hand. It is reported that German forces in the southern Don have launched an offensive, defeating Soviet troops everywhere. German forces in the northern Caucasus have also launched counterattacks in various locations. In the western Caucasus region, German and Romanian forces have jointly repelled the Soviet forces.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): According to a war report released today by the German High Command, the enemy is now concentrating its forces again to launch a general offensive on the German defense line in Stalingrad. The war units in the south, under the command of General Paulus's great solidarity, have already held their positions firmly. The defending troops in the northern part of Stalingrad have repelled the enemy.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Yesterday, Soviet troops fiercely attacked the northern suburbs of Stalingrad, but were unsuccessful in attacking the factories held by the German forces. More than 400 Soviet troops were killed.

Führer Headquarters, 31st (News Agency dispatch): This afternoon's German war report stated that after a period of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, German forces are still holding their original positions. Fresh troops have arrived on the front lines and immediately joined the fighting, strengthening the German defenses. The Soviet offensive in Stalingrad is gradually diminishing in scope and attempting to concentrate its forces to invade us. However, the German forces under the command of General Paulus are still holding their positions firmly and have not wavered in the slightest. The northern part of the city is defended by the 11th Army, which has repelled the invading enemy.

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): The Soviet offensive has been blocked by the resistance of the German 6th Army in Stalingrad and the German and allied forces in the western Caucasus. German forces are firmly holding their positions in the mountainous areas of the western Caucasus, covering the planned withdrawal of German forces operating in the Terek and Kalmuk areas. The Soviet offensive has been exhausted, and no further attacks were launched the day before yesterday. German-Slovak troops are holding their positions in the western Caucasus, standing firm. After consolidating the positions from the Black Sea to the central Donets River, the German command can now focus on the fierce fighting in the Voronezh region. Elite German units, assisted by tank formations, are advancing northwest from the Donets River area, launching a surprise attack on the flanks of the Soviet forces advancing southwest. The Soviet forces are in a state of chaos. One division retreated in panic, abandoning five 15cm artillery pieces. The Soviet forces also lost 16 tanks. The Soviet forces continue to fiercely attack west and northwest of Voronezh, attempting to prevent the eastward movement of German forces. The German forces are engaged in fierce fighting with Soviet forces that have invaded the German defense lines and are hindering the movement of German forces, destroying 41 Soviet tanks.

### Commander of German 6th Army Promoted to Field Marshal

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): Führer Hitler has promoted General Paulus's rank to encourage him. Paulus is the commander of the 6th Army stationed in Stalingrad.

According to the Führer's headquarters, the Führer highly praised the glorious achievements of the 6th Army.

### Timoshenko's Whereabouts Revealed: Appointed Commander of the Northern Front

Kuybyshev, 30th (Central News Agency dispatch): After the replacement of General Timoshenko, the former commander of the Soviet Southern Front, various rumors circulated here regarding his whereabouts. However, the Pravda newspaper on the 29th mentioned General Timoshenko as the representative of the Soviet Northern Front. Therefore, according to this news, it can be determined that he has now assumed the position of Supreme Commander of the Northern Front.

### German Military Weekly Report

Berlin, 31st (Haitong News Agency dispatch): In order to shorten the German defense line in the Soviet Union, the German High Command has decided to withdraw from a portion of the land occupied last summer. The German forces have made this major decision after detailed consideration of the situation in various areas. Therefore, the German withdrawal is proceeding very smoothly. Currently, the front lines on the southern route of the Eastern Front, from the northern Caucasus to the lower Don River and some positions in the Donets-Voronezh region, have also been abandoned. Since the German forces launched their summer offensive last year, their momentum has been unstoppable. Therefore, the further the German forces advance, the longer their rear transportation lines become. At the same time, the Soviet supply lines become shorter and shorter, which is very beneficial to the Soviet forces. The loss of the Stalingrad industrial area is a serious blow to the Soviet Union. In addition, the suspension of navigation on the Volga River has a huge impact on the Soviet economy. Therefore, the Soviet forces are recklessly using their last batch of reserves in a desperate attempt to regain their lost ground. However, based on the experiences of last winter, the German forces are holding their positions firmly, waiting for the arrival of spring, and then using the superior timing to show their skills again. The temporary withdrawal of German forces from a part of the Soviet-occupied territory is regrettable, but there is no need to worry. The German 6th Army besieged in Stalingrad is still resisting strongly. German generals and German-Croatian troops are fighting side by side with the soldiers, sharing weal and woe, and even taking the lead in battle, engaging the enemy in bayonet combat. Their spirit of bravery is such. The fighting in other parts of the Eastern Front is relatively calm. The Soviet offensive in Velikiye Luki has failed and suffered heavy losses. In North Africa, Field Marshal Rommel has already withdrawn from the area near Tripoli. As the Axis forces withdrew westward, the plan to encircle the flanks of the Axis forces was foiled by the German forces. Field Marshal Rommel is now holding the positions in western Tripolitania and has repelled the pursuing enemy. The number of enemy troops who have reached Tripoli is small and not enough to affect the situation there. The Axis forces in Tunisia are very active, and their positions have been greatly improved. In the period from January 18th to 24th, the British and American forces lost 4,000 prisoners of war and 70 artillery pieces. The German people will never be discouraged by temporary setbacks. This is enough to warn the enemy. The recent mobilization measures of the German people are an "expression of strength" and not a sign of weakness. The UK and the USSR have been implementing these measures for a long time, while Germany is only beginning.

### A Record of Inspecting the Soviet-Finnish Front

— Ureshino

(Yomiuri Hochi Ureshino Correspondent, Helsinki (Finnish Capital), 22nd dispatch): I, the reporter, received the Finnish military authorities' kind permission to inspect the Karelian front for four days. I saw the frozen Kronstadt naval port and the streets of Leningrad. First, I took a train to Vyborg, and then changed to a military vehicle to visit the frontline headquarters near Terioki. Then, I crossed the old Soviet-Finnish border. On the right, I saw Kronstadt. After inspecting the thunderous frontline from the forest, I headed north to inspect the frontline bases in Kakkisalmi and other places on the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The mid-south battlefield from the Caucasus to Moscow is still active due to the Soviet winter counteroffensive, but the Finnish front is relatively quiet, with only small-scale skirmishes. The front line has not changed much compared to a year ago. According to the person in charge of the headquarters, since Timoshenko was recently appointed as the supreme commander of Leningrad and the southern part of Lake Ladoga, he has not launched a large-scale winter offensive. If there is one, it may be launched in March or April, just like last year. However, the Finnish defenses are very solid, so there is nothing to worry about. The war situation in this area may have come to an end.

Finnish Soldiers are Energetic

The distance from the coast south of Terioki to Kronstadt is only seventeen kilometers. In front of Kronstadt Island, there are seven earthen stoves. From the coast to Totleben is very close, less than ten kilometers. Fortunately, the weather was good, and Kronstadt could be seen very clearly. Totleben, in particular, was closest, and with a telescope, the Red Army's movements could be observed. At night, the skating patrols of both sides had minor skirmishes on the ice. Terioki still has the remnants of the summer retreats of the nobles and princes of the Tsarist era. The magnificent villas on the beach have added many bullet marks due to recent wars. Finnish soldiers were laughing and playing on the ice on the shore. The climate here is extremely cold, with only three or four hours of sunshine a day. The accompanying officer told me on the way that the remnants of the Soviet Baltic Fleet are now frozen in Kronstadt. Every night, the Soviets use horses, trucks, and light tanks to transport supplies, sneaking across the frozen sea to supply Kronstadt. After hearing these words, I couldn't help but think of the Soviet newsreels I saw in Stockholm. The Soviet film shots showed, as mentioned above, setting up roads on the frozen Lake Ladoga and partially laying light railways to supply the Soviet troops trapped in Leningrad and evacuate some of the civilians. There is no doubt that light tanks passed on the frozen sea between Kronstadt and Leningrad.

Barracks with Bathroom Facilities

When I arrived at the front line, I felt the tension of the war. I ran to the observation post built on thick ice and could see Leningrad very clearly. Looking through a telescope, it was a silver powdery world. In the vast white, the black mass in the south was Leningrad. Last night, it was bombed by German aircraft, and the bombs hit the target. The snowy night sky added a red light. There is not much contact on the Finnish front north of Leningrad. It seems that the Soviet army has launched a counteroffensive on the southeastern battlefield of Leningrad, which is occupied by the German army. I walked down the observation post and walked towards the hills. The army's barracks were covered by heavy snow. From a distance, it was no longer visible that there were barracks. The barracks were made of wood, each one could accommodate fourteen or five people, with a stove in the middle, which was quite warm, and even electric lights were available. Next to the kitchen, there was also a Finnish-style bathroom. The interior was simple and plain. Many books and flowers were placed on the windowsill, enough to comfort the boredom of the front line.

Women's Activities are No Less Than Men's

In the Terioki front, in addition to the colorful winter frontline scenery, there is also a market operated by the Finnish Patriotic Women's Organization. A separate room is set up in the market for the soldiers to learn songs and entertain themselves. The food supply on this front is richer than in the capital Helsinki, because Finland had a good harvest last year, so there is a surplus of food. As for sugar, etc., although not very abundant, it is not as serious as what is said in Stockholm.

As for that patriotic women's organization, it has a long history. In 1921, Finnish women organized this group to revive their impoverished motherland after the war. It is very active in society, and this group is also very famous in Europe. Since the war against the Soviet Union, its activities have become even more vigorous. It not only makes men free from worries but also dispatches to the front lines. Almost all Finnish women participate in it. The scope of activities is very wide. Just from the above points, it can be proved that the patriotic enthusiasm of Finnish women can be said to be a promising women's army! The general headquarters is in Helsinki. The president is Ms. Raukuna, who is over seventy years old this year. When I visited her, I heard some information about the association's affairs. It is said that there are already more than 300,000 members. Except for special staff, there is no remuneration. In terms of work, it is no less than men, and even dispatched to the front lines to cook, wash clothes, and nurse the troops. Recently, they have also begun to serve as air defense surveillance soldiers, transporting food and medicine. Because Finland has a small population, women are doing their best to help men in non-combat parts. Such a spirit is truly admirable.

Absolute Trust in the German Army

From Terioki, I took a military vehicle to Kakkisalmi on the west bank of Lake Ladoga. The journey took hours, and the weather was extremely cold. My hands and feet lost all sensation. Kakkisalmi was the most severely damaged. After the Soviet retreat in the autumn of 1941, there were only a few residents left here. In the summer, Kakkisalmi and Suurtahtopää on the north shore were the bases for Lake Ladoga fast boat operations. In the winter, Lake Ladoga is frozen like iron. Although I did not travel to Murmansk due to time constraints, I know that the Soviet Union used Arkhangelsk as a loading and unloading port in the summer to avoid German bombing. In the winter, it will reuse Murmansk and try to transport British and American supplies to the inland through the railroad from here to Lisu, using Locke, and Arkhangelsk. Finland trusts Germany very much and hopes that Germany will soon transfer its surplus power to the southern battlefield and penetrate Leningrad from the north so that the Karelian front can come to an end. At the same time, it will cut off the Murmansk railroad and cut off the Soviet supplies coming from the north. It hopes that Germany will exert its power in this regard as soon as possible. This is of course a very legitimate hope. (Transcribed from Yomiuri Hochi, January 25th)

### Remembering Solomon

— Kogen

(○○ Base Kogen Special Correspondent (Naval Reporting Team) Telegraph) At dawn on New Year's Day at ○○ Base, welcoming its second New Year under the Greater East Asia War, several patrol planes bravely set out toward the Solomon Sea. There is no New Year in war. Now, to thoroughly prevent the enemy's movements, the patrol mission cannot be neglected for a moment. These patrol planes must set out to ○○ nautical miles out at sea, standing at the forefront of the battle line. However, for example, sending the first telegram with the shocking enemy intelligence report "Enemy Mobile Forces Discovered," which became the prelude to a major naval battle, is likely to be only a few dozen or even a few hundred out of the many patrol planes. The rest are all buried under the achievements of the battle, regarded as mere work, and are often forgotten. This time, the reporter was very fortunate to be ordered to accompany a patrol plane, enabling him to witness the hardships of patrolling and also have the opportunity to survey the Solomon Sea, which is attracting worldwide attention, from the air.

Naval Plane Accompanying Log

On the dawn of the third day, ○○ Base had fierce wind and rain, but by the time it was broad daylight, the wind and rain had gradually stopped. However, thick fog prevailed, filling the sky. By the time ○○ Commander gave the order to "Start," it was more than an hour and a half past the scheduled departure time. Between the gloomy rain clouds, a place that seemed bright was sighted, and the plane flew towards it. Perhaps because of the bad air currents, the plane shook violently. At this time, a crew member patted me on the shoulder. When I turned around, he was holding an enamel bowl, full of New Year's rice cake soup, and handing it to me. Because I had already eaten when waiting for the plane to start on the ground, I shook my head and declined. The crew members also seemed to have already eaten, and no one ate this breakfast on the plane. However, this bowl of New Year's rice cake soup gave people quite a feeling of "New Year on the plane."

Coral Reefs Beneath Our Eyes

When the clouds cleared for a moment, islands could be seen below the plane. Last autumn, the reporter had already been deeply impressed by the islands he had viewed from the transport ship he was accompanying. At this time, they were all arranged in dots under the clouds. The winding coastline was edged with white coral reefs everywhere. Furthermore, near the coast, one or two places could be seen that looked very much like farmers' villages. Several parts of coconut groves that had already been reclaimed could also be seen. Besides these, what was seen were various trees, vying for the strong sunlight, growing in layers, forming ancient dense forests. Viewed from the air, Solomon presented a beautiful and gentle natural appearance. However, its reality harbored a terrifying murderous aura, with warships and planes traveling back and forth here. From near ○○ Island, the plane changed course to the ○ direction and moved forward. The islands that had just been seen became increasingly distant, gradually reaching the point where only the island shadows were vaguely visible on the horizon.

Flying Over Enemy Territory

As the island shadows gradually blurred, the plane gradually increased its altitude. Clouds of various shapes flew from under the plane, until it felt as if we had flown over a cloud plain. The captain carefully inspected the left, right, and front from time to time. On the vast sea, not even a single ship could escape his eyes. The navigator, whose hands were free, took out binoculars to observe the edge of the large clouds, because we had now flown over enemy territory, and enemy fighters could be encountered at any time, so such tense vigilance was necessary. The captain's orders came from the speaking tube from time to time, and the navigator followed the orders, tilting the wings to the left or right, placing the aircraft in a position easy to view, ensuring that extremely distant places could be observed.

The Hardships of Patrol Missions

After ○ hours since starting to fly at high altitude, when the taste of oxygen had been fully inhaled, the plane had completed the mission of advancing ○○ nautical miles and then flew on the return route. The reporter, who had been sitting and doing nothing the whole time, felt very tired at this time, and the crew members also inevitably showed signs of fatigue. When I thought about the daily hardship that had to be endured to confirm "There is nothing unusual in the South Pacific," I couldn't help but feel deeply moved. At this time, the crew member patted the reporter on the shoulder again and sent over lunch: rice balls with oil-fried tofu and seaweed, and a small can of beef vegetable soup. When flying near ○○ Island, I saw that the cumulus clouds that hadn't attracted much attention when we flew past earlier had now developed into a gloomy shape. The drastic changes in the weather of the Solomon Sea could be seen here. Using the report of not seeing enemy ships and planes as a homecoming gift, the ○-hour flight was completed, and we landed. At this time, the unit commander came to ask the reporter for his impressions, and I told him that "I came back after seeing islands and clouds and the sea." The ○○ captain next to me smiled and said, "It's good to have only seen the islands." How important is the sea patrol alone in defending the vast Pacific Ocean? Thinking this way, the patrol mission is indeed arduous. (Cai: Translated from the January 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Italy Conscripts Women for Rear Service, Now Over 1.2 Million

Rome, 30th (Havas) - After Italy conscripted reservists born in 1924, it also conscripted women to replace the work of young men about to go to the front lines.

### Commemorating the Second Anniversary of the East Asia League

— Chen Fumu

I have repeatedly pointed out that "the East Asia League Movement is based on the history of imperialism's aggression in Asia for more than a hundred years and is a resistance to imperialist aggression at the present stage." This time, the second anniversary of the founding of the East Asia League China General Association coincides with the National Government's declaration of war against Britain and the United States, which makes us feel the profound significance of this second anniversary and the importance of the mission we will bear in the future.

In the past two years, although we dare not say that the East Asia League in China has laid a solid foundation, we cannot deny that our colleagues have indeed paid a price of blood and sweat. Needless to say, our future efforts will inevitably require fierce struggles.

Both China and Japan, after five years of bloody and iron struggles, have come to realize today that "war cannot solve the problems between China and Japan, only consumes the national strength of both countries, and deepens the rifts and hatred between the two countries. This is not in the interest of China and Japan, and even less in the interest of East Asia." Therefore, at a time when our country has already declared that it will fight alongside Japan, our attitude towards war is even more resolute, and our actions in engaging in the East Asia League Movement are even more correct.

The purpose of the East Asia League Movement is not only to solve the problems between China and Japan but also to solve the entire problem of East Asia. For more than a hundred years, the various ethnic groups of East Asia have been under the aggression, coercion, enticement, exploitation, trampling, and sowing discord of imperialists. Their awakening today is undeniable, and their need for unity and liberation is also undeniable. The political ideals of the East Asia League—political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication—are precisely the concrete demands of the various ethnic groups of East Asia. Only such great and correct demands and ideals can unite the will of the various ethnic groups of East Asia to fight together, and only such a program that is suitable for the common development of the various ethnic groups of East Asia can guarantee the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

In Japan, the East Asia League Movement has caused quite a bit of political antipathy. However, to date, no one has been able to concretely, systematically, and forcefully refute the theory of the East Asia League from a theoretical standpoint. It can also be said that this theory cannot be refuted.

In China, due to the influence of Japanese politics, there are still many people who lack the courage to participate in this movement, and there are still many people who hold considerable doubts. However, "I dare to assert that the East Asia League Movement is the soul of the peace movement. If the peace movement does not make efforts to promote the East Asia League Movement, then it can be said to have no theoretical ground." Moreover, "the East Asia League Movement is based on Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism as its ideological basis. In other words, this movement is a re-promotion of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism."

Therefore, on this day of the second anniversary of the founding of the East Asia League China General Association, now that the National Government has declared war, although this movement is still in a difficult and complex environment, I must repeat once again our belief in this movement. I believe that the realization of the East Asia League ideal can be foreseen, and the following phenomena can be expected:

(1) Aggressive wars will henceforth be eliminated;

(2) All ethnic groups will be able to establish their own independent and autonomous countries;

(3) Economically, all countries will have what each other lacks, use their strengths to compensate for their weaknesses, and establish a system of common prosperity;

(4) Cultural fusion will enable all ethnic groups to sympathize with and understand each other, eliminating suspicion;

(5) East Asia will become a stabilizing force for world peace.

### East Asia League and China's Participation in the War

— Chen Zhong

From the East Asia League Movement to China's Participation in the War

The East Asia League movement, initiated in China, has only been around for two years, but the idea behind the movement originated more than ten years ago.

When the Father of the Nation, Dr. Sun Yat-sen, went north, he advocated Pan-Asianism in Japan, aiming to restore the survival of Asian nations. Unfortunately, the political circles and the public in both China and Japan at the time failed to deeply understand this call, which resulted in the tragic sacrifice of the Sino-Japanese War over the past five years. This was certainly caused by the competition among imperialist powers such as Britain and the United States in China, which weakened China's national strength and led to feelings of dependence and fear. At the same time, it was also due to the failure of China and Japan to be open and honest with each other, making it impossible for most politicians who advocated cooperation between China and Japan to accept this ideal. This cannot but be said to be a regrettable event in the history of the East Asia League. It was not until the National Government moved its capital back to Nanjing and concluded the Basic Treaty of Relations between China and Japan that the two countries gradually realized the inseparable relationship between the Chinese and Japanese nations in reality.

The East Asia League cannot proceed smoothly unless the Sino-Japanese Incident is completely resolved. To solve the China problem, it is necessary to drive the evil forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia. In the future, East Asia must continue to wage war to completely defeat Britain and the United States, and at the same time, it needs to carry out the great undertaking of building a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Whether in war or construction, the East Asian nations will always share weal and woe and work together.

In order to fulfill the declaration of sharing joys and sorrows and working together, the Chinese government officially announced its participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9 this year, and signed the China-Japan Joint Declaration with its friendly country Japan. The two governments, with strong determination and conviction, will cooperate jointly in military, political, and economic affairs. At the same time, concessions were returned and consular jurisdiction was abolished, etc. From this, we can see that the East Asia League movement has achieved great success from China's determination to participate in the war.

China's Participation in the War as an Initial Manifestation of the East Asia League

China's official declaration of war on Britain and the United States has aroused great praise and inspiration from the political circles and the public in Japan, as well as the sympathy of countries such as Germany and Italy. According to the East Asia League program, the first thing we should achieve is political independence.

As for the economy, due to special geographical and economic conditions, especially the distribution of East Asian nations in the East Asian continent, each has its own stage of economic development, its own needs and habits, and they support each other. Therefore, economic cooperation needs to be further promoted in the future. Since China and Japan are allies in the war, they should implement the following based on the principle of equality: (1) Materials: to make up for each other's needs and adapt to the balance of supply and demand. (2) Talents: to provide each other with talents to develop the economic strength of each country. However, the scope of the economy is very broad. During the war, most people focus on industry, transportation, trade, and economic control. China's industry has always been backward. It is not an industrial country, but a large agricultural country. It seems that the mobilization of economic warfare is not as great as that of Japan, but food and all raw materials are of decisive importance in wartime. Because the mobilization of millions of troops during the war, its supply and the supply of food for the people are no less important than the urgent replenishment of ammunition. After China's participation in the Greater East Asia War, the strength of China's economic participation in the war should not be underestimated. In the past, Japan's high-profile advocacy of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation has yielded little results. There are many reasons for this, and the most important one is the failure to implement the spirit of the conditions for cooperation. Everyone should understand that the prerequisite for economic cooperation is that each unit must have the strength to cooperate. Strength is built by the country itself, so economic cooperation should also pay attention to the spontaneous efforts of each unit country. We hope that after China's participation in the war, China and Japan will sign a mutually beneficial economic agreement. This agreement is completely equal and mutually beneficial, so that the two countries should exert their full efforts in all economic sectors to exert the power of participating in the war.

Again, the military alliance in the East Asia League program is directly related to China's participation in the war. Is China's participation in the war the initial realization of the military alliance? After participating in the war, how to provide strong assistance to the Greater East Asia War, it is now necessary to conduct an in-depth discussion. Fourth, cultural communication is as important as economic cooperation. What needs to be specially pointed out here is that culture is the source of civilization. The East Asia League seeks the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asia. Therefore, culture should adopt the method of communication, rather than the method of assimilation.

How Should China Strengthen its Military Strength After Participating in the War?

Everyone knows that today's war is a war of technology. Therefore, modern warfare is not only a war between people, but also a war between things, and also a war between science and science. What is the current state of our military strength? We should first conduct a self-examination. After the incident occurred, China's original weak military force has been depleted a lot. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has spared no effort in building the army. But it is still far from ideal. Since the establishment of a 300 million yen loan to Japan last year, it has been used to purchase a large number of weapons and equipment to strengthen military strength.

Can the new Chinese military equipment share the great responsibility of the Greater East Asia War? We should pay attention to two conditions of the war. First, it must have the strength to assist allied countries in combat. Although the current military equipment is very weak, Japan cannot provide full assistance. Especially for the replenishment of weapons and equipment, there must be a large supply. It is not difficult to train and become a strong army in a short period of time. Second, it must have the military strength to assist allied countries in stabilizing the rear. At present, China's military equipment is not enough to directly fight against Britain and the United States, but China's responsibility for stabilizing the rear is obligatory and necessary to take on automatically. Also, since China's participation in the war, some people do not understand right and wrong, and believe that the participation in the war may be accompanied by a military alliance with Japan, but this point has been formally expressed in a speech by Foreign Minister Chu. I believe that the Sino-Japanese military alliance agreement, in fact, according to the current military strength, only the prior cooperation in stabilizing the rear security, to share the heavy responsibility of the Greater East Asia War, but in order to strengthen China's participation in the war, Japan must have at least the following understanding of China's military construction:

(1) China's military construction is to achieve the conditions for Sino-Japanese cooperation, from maintaining local security to consolidating overall security. In this way, if China does not build its army, it will not be able to complete the task. Therefore, China's military construction should be fully supported.

(2) The issue of troop withdrawal from China is an urgent need to consider after the start of the Greater East Asia War. If the troop withdrawal can be gradually realized, the power of the Greater East Asia War will inevitably increase. The responsibility of troop withdrawal and defense change depends on the completion of China's military construction. The reason is very clear. Therefore, the establishment of the new Chinese army is a prerequisite for the realization of the military alliance, and also a strong guarantee.

(3) Sino-Japanese cooperation is based on the spirit of Wangdao. Both China and Japan must sincerely rely on each other. Therefore, the significance of China's military construction lies in the cooperation in solving the Sino-Japanese Incident and completing the Greater East Asia War. Japan must fully trust China's cooperation, without a doubt.

Finally, if we talk about the great East Asian peace a hundred years later, it will naturally require the permanent cooperation of China and Japan. Neither side should think that after the victory of the Greater East Asia War, the military alliance does not need to be discussed. We must know that for the long-term coexistence and co-prosperity of the two major nations of China and Japan, the East Asia League should be more closely strengthened.

### Utilizing Lakes and Marshes to Increase Fish Production, Suzhou Construction Department Submits a Request to the Provincial Government

Suzhou, 31st (Central News Agency) The Director of the Suzhou Construction Department believes that in recent years, fish production has gradually decreased, resulting in rising prices, which has greatly affected the national economy. During the current war, various products should be planned to increase to meet the needs of the war. Recently, it has been found that the lakes and marshes in various counties of Suzhou Province are crisscrossed and should be utilized for the cultivation of various fish fry to increase production and seek a sound basis for the national economy during the war. Therefore, Director Tang of the Construction Department will submit a request to the Provincial Government to first investigate the area of all lakes and marshes in various townships, and according to the size of their area, order the owners to release at least a small number of fish fry within a certain period of time, and formulate incentive measures to encourage them.

### Secretary-General of the New People's Society Delivers a Speech

Haitong News Agency, Peiping, 31st The Secretary-General of the New People's Society yesterday made a statement to the press regarding the 10th anniversary of the National Socialist Party's governance in Germany, stating that the cornerstone of the new European order was laid ten years ago when the National Socialist Party came to power. The achievements of the National Socialist Party in the past ten years have been truly amazing. This should be attributed to the effective leadership of Führer Hitler. The people of China and Germany are now in the same boat. Therefore, the people of the two countries should fight together to build a new world order. We deeply respect Führer Hitler of Germany and the National Socialist Party. We will do our best to mobilize our country's manpower and resources to fight alongside Germany, Japan, and other Axis countries to destroy our common enemy and build a new world order as soon as possible.

### Trends of Overseas Chinese in Various Places After the National Government Participated in the War

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency) Regarding the trends of overseas Chinese in various places after the National Government's participation in the war, according to a telegram from Zhao Nan on the 30th, the 3.5 million overseas Chinese in Malaya have completely changed their past concepts after the Japanese army quelled Malaya and Sumatra, and have turned to cooperate with the Japanese army in construction. First, they launched a 50 million yuan donation campaign to show their sincerity. After the National Government's participation in the war, they have a deeper understanding of the path they should take. In the past, they have not been able to fully recognize the strength and position of the National Government. They were deeply moved by the National Government's announcement of the declaration of war and Chairman Wang's declaration of the common life and death of China and Japan. They are willing to do their best to assist in the construction of Malaya. For example, Lin Wenqing, Chairman of the Malaya Overseas Chinese Association, said in a speech that after the National Government's participation in the war, it has given a bright future to the future of the overseas Chinese in the South. We have long been convinced that this move will be realized. Now it is true. We are very excited about this and feel that it is already late. From now on, we are determined to move forward with all our strength to assist in the completion of the war under the great party of Sino-Japanese cooperation. We are convinced that this is the only path we should follow. Also, according to a telegram from Bangkok on the 30th, the 2.6 million overseas Chinese in Thailand were greatly excited by the heroic posture shown by the motherland after the National Government participated in the war. In order to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, they decided to fight to the end with all their material and spiritual strength under the leadership of the motherland. In order to express their sincerity in cooperating in the war, they sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government on the 11th to express their supreme respect for leading the motherland to resolutely declare war on Britain and the United States, and at the same time expressed their absolute support for the National Government and their determination to pledge loyalty. On the 13th, they jointly united with overseas Chinese in Malaya, Myanmar, Java, Vietnam, the Philippines, and Japan to strive to smash the forces of Britain and the United States and completely destroy the Yu faction in order to complete the construction of a truly co-prosperity sphere. They pledged to rise up together under the leadership of the motherland and fight until the final victory is achieved. Chen Shouming, Chairman of the General Chamber of Commerce of China in Thailand, representing the 2.6 million overseas Chinese in Thailand, expressed his determination, saying, "We now deeply understand the true meaning of the saying 'Those who have money contribute money, and those who have strength contribute strength.' This is the awareness that we should have in cooperating to complete the war. In order to actually cooperate in the war, we are now planning to launch a patriotic donation campaign." Also, according to a telegram from Hanoi on the 30th, after the Japanese army entered northern Vietnam, the overseas Chinese in Vietnam deeply understood the current situation in East Asia. The overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam have achieved remarkable results in cooperating with the Japanese army after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. On the anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, they sent a letter to Yu Jiang to urge him to reflect, and sent a telegram to the National Government to pay tribute, stating that the National Government resolutely announced the declaration of war on Britain and the United States. China and Japan have stood on a line to fight together in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. The 50,000 overseas Chinese in northern Vietnam expressed their absolute support for the National Government's participation in the war in this telegram. In addition, the education of overseas Chinese children there is also based on the basic principles of Sino-Japanese friendship, and a new education policy has been formulated. Since Zhang Yongfu, the commercial representative stationed in Hanoi, took office, the unity of the overseas Chinese in Vietnam has become increasingly consolidated. Also, according to a telegram from Saigon on the 29th, the overseas Chinese in southern Vietnam unanimously and enthusiastically expressed their support for the National Government's resolute declaration of war on Britain and the United States. Under the leadership of the Federation of Overseas Chinese Organizations, they united and formed a joint association to support the National Government's participation in the war, and advocated three major goals: supporting Chairman Wang, absolutely trusting the Japanese army, and destroying the Yu faction. They gave full cooperation to the construction of a co-prosperity paradise for Asians. After the National Government's participation in the war, they held two meetings to discuss matters such as the smooth use of overseas Chinese capital. The enthusiasm for loving the motherland is extremely high.

### The Big Cake and Fried Dough Stick Industry is Allowed to Resume Flour Rationing; the Authorities Have Instructed the Association to Inform the Trade; the Noodle and Steamed Bun Industries are Awaiting Reply

Since the Public Works Department announced changes to the distribution method of flour products on December 31 last year, changing to exchanging flour for products, the noodle, cooked noodle, big cake, steamed bun, fried dough stick, and other industries in this port, because their patrons are mostly from the lower classes, and they are always used to exchanging flour for products for economic convenience, feel inconvenient, so the shops and stalls have no customers and are in a state of shutdown. The association has separately presented its grievances to the Public Works Department, seeking changes and requesting normal distribution to maintain the livelihoods of workers and facilitate coolies to buy food to satisfy their hunger. Now, the authorities, considering the actual difficulties of the industry, first restored the flour distribution to the cooked noodle industry. However, to restrict it, the flour distribution is limited to purchases in the store. Yesterday, according to the reporter of the Da Tong News Agency, the Lianyi Association of the noodle-made big cake and fried dough stick industry also received a letter from the Public Works Department, stating that the request for normal flour distribution for the registered members of the industry has been approved, and instructed the industry to inform all members of this intention. As for the requests of other noodle and scallion cake steamed bun flour product industries, the matter is the same, and the authorities are reviewing the price-limit compliance methods submitted by the industry, and a reply will be given soon.

### Mr. Zhu Shunshui's Influence on Japanese Culture

Jing'an Temple has recently been tirelessly promoting religious culture and charitable endeavors. It has responded to this newspaper's education assistance campaign with admirable sincerity. Yesterday, the 26th Buddhist Academic Lecture was held, with the esteemed speaker Mr. Dui Binhe, president of this newspaper, lecturing on "The Influence of Ming Confucian Zhu Shunshui on Japanese Culture." The following is a record of the lecture.

It is very meaningful to study the thoughts, knowledge, and actions of an ancient person as a mirror for our new era of being human!

What kind of person was Zhu Shunshui? First, we must understand the era of Mr. Zhu. Mr. Zhu's given name was Zhiyu, his courtesy name was Luying, and Shunshui was his sobriquet. He was from Yuyao, Zhejiang, born in the 28th year of the Wanli reign of the Ming Dynasty and died in the 21st year of the Kangxi reign of the Qing Dynasty, which in the Gregorian calendar is 1600 to 1682. He lived for 83 years. These 80-plus years were a period of great turmoil for China, with political corruption, frequent factional strife, social unrest, and popular suffering. This resulted in two major events: internal strife and external refuge. Mr. Zhu was a scholar of principle. He did not want to participate in factional disputes, nor did he want to join the rebel bandits. So, what did he do? Scholars at that time had three paths. One was to participate in politics, which was the path Mr. Zhu did not want to take. The other two were: one was "to enter the mountains, fearing they are not deep enough," which was the path taken by Mr. Huang Yaozhou, who lived in seclusion and wrote books; the other was "exile"! This can be further divided into two factions. One faction learned from Sima Qian, the Grand Historian, traveling to famous mountains and rivers to prepare to return and write books to pass on to later generations. Mr. Gu Tinglin took this path. The other faction learned from Confucius's method of "riding a raft and floating on the sea" to go to foreign countries, which was the path taken by Mr. Zhu Shunshui. This is essential to understand when studying Mr. Zhu Shunshui's thoughts and actions. Without understanding the background of the era and his origins, one cannot understand his words and thoughts.

Early on, he gave up any intention of officialdom, and was only a student without any official position. When the Ming Dynasty fell in the 17th year of the Chongzhen reign (1644 AD), he was already 45 years old. When Prince Fu established himself in Nanjing, Ma Shiying wanted to put him in an important position, but he fled. In the fifteen years from the fall of Nanjing to the death of the emperor, he sometimes ran to Japan, Annam, and Siam, and sometimes returned to China. He dedicated himself to running around for national affairs, enduring all kinds of hardships. He worked with Zhang Cangshui in Zhoushan; he entered Siming Mountain to help Wang Wanxun train village soldiers; he went to Japan with Feng Jizhong to beg for troops; he followed Zheng Chenggong to invade the north across the Yangtze River. In the end, seeing that the overall situation was lost, he had to flee to Japan to live out his days.

At that time, Japan did not allow foreigners to reside in the country. Fortunately, there were several civilian idealists, such as Ando Shuyaku, who admired Mr. Shunshui's learning and morality and revered his loyalty and righteousness. They took him as their teacher and found a way to make an exception and allow him to live in Nagasaki, where he lived for seven years. The Japanese Prime Minister Tokugawa Mitsukuni, was a person who loved talent and learning, invited him to Tokyo and treated him with the courtesy of a guest teacher.

Mr. Shunshui, as a traveler in distress, was able to gain the respect of the Japanese government and public entirely because of his noble character.

Regarding his character, let us look at his self-description:

"In my life, I have no other strengths, only this heart that loves good and hates evil, which is etched in my bones. That is why I was unwilling to serve in the late Ming Dynasty." - To Changdao Naoshi.

"I am inferior to others in everything, but I am not swayed by wealth and status, nor moved by poverty and lowliness, nor bent by force. I seem to be able to be worthy of one ten-thousandth of the ancient sages and worthies. My personal experiences are indeed different from those scholars who talk emptily on paper." - Reply to a letter from Ohtaku Seijun.

"I have never said anything in my life that I could not do, and I have never done anything that I did not say... I dare to evaluate myself: My character is paramount, followed by virtue, then action, then literature, and finally calligraphy." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Painting Eighteen.

"...Since being displaced and suffering chaos, it has been twenty-six or seven years. I have been on the verge of death more than ten times... Therefore, even under the bright blue sky, there is an implicit thunder and lightning above. As for the dangers of wind and waves, overturning and precariousness, I am completely unwavering. This is because I have always been confident." - Record of Destined Beginning Hall

After reading his self-description, and then examining his life's actions, he was indeed a person of pure virtue and strong will. He often expressed his entire personality without concealment, sharing it with others. Therefore, the Japanese at that time regarded him "as the seventy disciples regarded Confucius."

Mr. Shunshui's academic style advocated practice and rejected empty talk. He said:

"...Boasting and exaggerating to disguise their wickedness and sell their skills, this is the worst of petty people without integrity. Would you say a gentleman would do such a thing?" - Reply to a certain letter

"In my words and actions, I only know that I do not deceive myself internally and do not deceive others externally. There are times when I act without speaking, but I have never been able to speak without being able to act." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter Ten.

"Moreover, what is learning? Why must one celebrate times of desolation and abandon one's career, carrying books a thousand miles, before learning? If there is a mother at home, learn to be filial. If there is a younger brother at home, learn to be fraternal. If there is a wife at home, learn to be harmonious. When going out and serving a ruler, learn to be loyal and prudent. When having friends, learn to be trustworthy. There is no place where one cannot learn. If there are things that one does not agree with, one should often take the words of the ancients to verify and prove them. Expand and enrich them, and this is learning." - Reply to Ohtaku Juji Letter.

Mr. Shunshui's academic style was a reaction against the Wang Yangming's philosophy. So he commented on Wang Yangming, saying:

"Wang Yangming only had this one thing, lecturing on learning." - Reply to Sanoda Okina Letter

"Wang Yangming also had his shortcomings. However, he also had many good points. He lectured on innate knowledge and founded academies, and the world generally had a reputation for moral learning. Looking up and striding forward, wearing the clothes of a jester, that was his shortcoming." - Notes

Mr. Shunshui also expressed dissatisfaction with the "moralists" since the Song Dynasty. He said:

"In the past, there was a skilled craftsman who could carve a macaque monkey on the tip of a thorn... This is the most skillful craftsman in the world, past and present. If I were to suddenly get this, I would definitely denounce it as gravel... Why? Because the craftsmanship is skillful, but it is not beneficial to the world... Song Confucians analyzed things in minute detail, but never accomplished anything." - To Ando Shuyaku Physician

Mr. Shunshui regarded practical use as the standard for learning. Practical use means either beneficial to one's own mind and body or beneficial to society. He said:

"The way to revitalize China lies in focusing on what is near and benefiting the world and the country. It does not lie in fiddling with the bellows and chasing shadows... Do not plagiarize and embellish, calling yourself a sage... If you are in danger and doubt and cannot make a decision, or if you are faced with difficulty and cannot overcome it, how can you be a Confucian?" - Reply to Okimura

Mr. Liang Qichao, in his book "Academic History of China in the Last Three Hundred Years," has these two passages:

"There was a great master who was hardly known in his own country. However, he had a great influence in foreign countries, namely Zhu Shunshui. Japanese historians commonly say: 'The Tokugawa had more than two hundred years of peaceful rule.' When talking about this, one naturally thinks of Zhu Shunshui."

"During the Tokugawa's two hundred years, Japan almost entirely became a Confucian nation. The greatest driving force was really Shunshui. Later, Tokugawa Mitsukuni wrote a 'History of Great Japan,' specifically emphasizing the meaning of 'honoring the king and unifying the realm.' Fifty years later, Tokugawa Yoshinobu returned the government and abolished the domains, accomplishing the great cause of the Meiji Restoration. Mitsukuni's book contributed the most. And Mitsukuni's learning was entirely received from Shunshui. Therefore, Shunshui is not only the benefactor of the Tokugawa dynasty, but also the most powerful teacher of Japan's revitalization."

In the year of Mizune in the Meiji era, the Japanese Baron Goto Shimpei wrote a preface to the complete works of Zhu Shunshui, also saying: "Opening the eyes and surveying the past three thousand years, the key to consistently enriching our national history lies in using the stones from other mountains to polish our jade. Gathering their strengths, collecting human beauty, chewing and integrating them, in order to greatly achieve our culture, has been done in every era... As for Zhu Zhiyu, the Ming Dynasty recluse, he is the ultimate treasure from a neighboring country. In terms of morality and righteousness, he penetrates the heart; in terms of academics, he focuses on royal affairs. Unable to realize his ambitions in his homeland, he instead transmitted his teachings to our country. It is lamentable for the Ming Dynasty, and even more admirable for Zhiyu... Even though his ambition to restore the Ming Dynasty was not fulfilled, he embodied his full loyalty and indignation in the spirit of Masashige Kusunoki. He illuminated the great way and expounded the royal path... Moreover, his spirit of pure loyalty and honoring the king, which was overwhelming and deeply cultivated, after two hundred years, finally sparked the advocacy of loyalist patriots, leading to the restoration of imperial rule and ultimately the accomplishment of the great cause of the Meiji Restoration, leading to the flourishing of the national fortune today. What we have gained from Zhiyu is indeed great!"

Let us look again at the Japanese Prime Minister Tokugawa Mitsukuni's admiration and respect for Mr. Shunshui. When Mr. Shunshui served as the Prime Minister's teacher, the Prime Minister greatly admired Mr. Shunshui, often sending gifts. When he was ill, he personally inquired and sent doctors to treat him. When Mr. Shunshui passed away, Tokugawa Mitsukuni sighed endlessly, personally attending his funeral and inscribing the spirit tablet. The heir also attended. The eulogy stated: "...He graciously resided with us, and we were teacher and student. All day long, he earnestly discussed literature and lectured on ritual... He was learned and had a strong memory, knowing everything. He revived what was abandoned and enlightened the ignorant, tirelessly and skillfully guiding... He had virtuous conduct in life, and it is impossible not to give him a beautiful posthumous title after death. The ancients said: 'Moral integrity and extensive knowledge are called Wen (culture), and steadfastness in service is called Gong (reverence).' This is indeed what Mr. Shunshui was like, so we posthumously name him Wengong (cultured and reverent)..."

Mr. Shunshui's contribution to Japanese culture can already be understood from the writings of Mr. Liang Qichao, Goto Shimpei, and especially Tokugawa Mitsukuni. For the sake of easier understanding, I will give more examples:

First, he promoted friendship with Japan. After settling in Japan, Mr. Shunshui was exceptionally friendly to the Japanese people. For example, in his reply to Okumura Yoshirei, he said: "...Moreover, I regard the people of your country as my own brothers, children, and father..."

Second, he hoped that Japanese culture would flourish. Apart from hoping for the restoration of the Ming Dynasty, Mr. Shunshui most hoped that Japanese culture would flourish. In his letters to Japanese friends, this was constantly revealed. For example:

"...I hope that you and I will achieve something together, not only in the area of learning. But also that the friendship between the Great Ming and your country will last for generations, and the civilization of your country will flourish, all based on this." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter.

Third, he advocated that Japan establish schools. Mr. Shunshui earnestly persuaded Japan to establish schools. For example:

"To build a country and govern the people, education comes first... If you sincerely want to achieve order through morality, and change customs, the *Book of Rites* says, 'If there is learning, there will be many good people and few bad people.' When there are many good people, morality will flourish. When there are few bad people, there will be political order..."

"...In the past, Teng was small and narrow, unable to reach fifty li. Once schools were established, their usefulness was not yet fully realized, but scholars and officials still praised it. Now your country... If you do not do it now, there will be those who bear the blame in the future. As for those who are concerned about customs and rituals, establishing schools and teachers is the way to teach the rites of elders and juniors, and to promote the principles of filial piety and brotherly love, loyalty to the ruler and love of country, and to change customs..." - Reply to Kato Tomoyuki Letter

"I heard that your country's capital, Edo, is planning to establish schools, which is very gratifying. Everything in your country is good, only this is lacking. But this is the most important thing for countries in the world, past and present. How can it be lacking? Now your country has signs of the flourishing of sacred learning, which is also a sign of your country's prosperity..." - Reply to Ando Shuyaku Letter

I have briefly discussed Mr. Zhu's life, thought, and his important influence on Japanese culture. What is the significance of our studying Mr. Zhu's influence on Japanese culture today? Of course, it is not to say that we also had such a master who helped Japan, and become self-satisfied... Nor is it to defend our current friendly cooperation with Japan because there was such a "pro-Japanese" figure three hundred years ago. No! The first reason we study Mr. Zhu Shunshui is to make us Chinese people aware that in the chaotic era of the late Ming, Song, and early Qing dynasties, we once had such a master who, regardless of difficult circumstances, traveled overseas, carrying out the sacred work of education and social reform in the nations of East Asia. In this work, he never forgot his motherland - the Great Ming Dynasty. In his hard work, he did not forget the development of the East Asian nations at that time. This is precisely the model of the most progressive nationalist and cosmopolitanist of the time. The combination of learning, morality, and practice is still worthy of our respect and emulation today!

Secondly, we should draw a model for modern cultural figures from the sincere feelings and brotherly friendship of Mr. Zhu's contribution to Japanese culture, and his spirit of not shirking difficulties for the sake of developing the Japanese people and the progress of culture, which is especially worthy of the attention of Japanese people today. There is no need to deny that Chinese culture lags far behind Japan's. Today, we urgently expect more Japanese Zhu Shunshuis to help China's cultural cause, to develop China's educational cause, to improve the cultural level and political level of the broad masses of the Chinese people, to treat the Chinese people with the same loving and sincere attitude that Mr. Zhu Shunshui regarded the Japanese people as brothers, and to make more active and constructive contributions, because this is the only way to restore the original attitude of the people of China and Japan, and it is also a necessary condition for the common development of the East Asian nations today. Today, we study the influence of Mr. Zhu Shunshui on Japanese culture, and from the standpoint of the Chinese people, we earnestly hope that the Japanese Zhu Shunshuis will cooperate with Chinese culture!

### Grain Bureau Consults on Grain Supply for Military and Police

The city's military and police need a large amount of rice each month, which has been supplied by the central government. However, starting from January of this year, in order to reduce the burden on the central government, the method was changed to find solutions nearby. Therefore, the Municipal Grain Administration, in order to effectively maintain the supply of rice for the military and police in the urban area, specially convened a meeting of various military and police agencies in the urban area yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m. in the conference room of the Bureau to thoroughly discuss the matter. In addition to the responsible personnel from the Municipal Police Department and the Security Office and other military and police agencies, Ye Yisun, director of the Grain Department's Shanghai Office, was also invited to attend. Director Wu chaired the meeting, which lasted until after 5:00 p.m. It is reported that an agreement has been reached on the supply and adjustment methods of rice for the military and police in the urban area.

### Cigarette Dealers Registration Closed Yesterday Strict Review Unified Allocation Distribute Goods According to the Actual Needs of Each Business Enforce Price Limits Crack Down on Black Market Transactions

The Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Association, in order to unify the distribution of Japanese-Chinese cigarettes, set a deadline for the registration of cigarette dealers in the city. It ended yesterday. Those who failed to register after the deadline were considered to have voluntarily given up the right to distribution. The review will begin immediately and is expected to be completed in ten days. After that, all cigarettes produced by the Military Administration's Yuanyuan Tobacco Company, the Japanese-owned Zhonghua Tobacco Company, and cigarette factories of various industries will be handled by the association. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency learned from the association that the distribution of Japanese-Chinese cigarettes will resume after the registration and review of cigarette dealers is completed. The distribution method is to entrust 300 major wholesalers to handle it, and small wholesalers will distribute it in retail. The standard will be determined according to the actual needs of each dealer. The goods distributed will be sold strictly in accordance with the official price limit, with a 2% retail tax collected. Strict measures are also stipulated to crack down on black market cigarette transactions. If it is found that there is price gouging, hoarding, or speculation, in addition to permanently canceling the distribution, the authorities will also punish them. As for the cigarette raw materials needed by Chinese and Japanese factories, the China Tobacco Leaf Distribution Association will be responsible for the allocation. The purchase work in various roasted tobacco producing areas will also be unified by the unified control agency. The raw material allocation method will be determined according to the production rate of each factory.

### "Participation in the War and the People" —Grand Gathering of the Greater Light Speech Assembly—

The Anti-British and American Association of the Chinese Nation held a "Participation in the War and the People Speech Assembly" at the Greater Light Grand Theater yesterday (the 31st) at 2:00 PM. More than 3,000 people attended, including directors of the association, university and middle school students, representatives from the press, and citizens. Before 1:30 PM, the venue was already full, and latecomers could only stand on both sides. The unprecedented scale shows the depth of concern among the citizens of this city regarding the issue of participation in the war and the people. The assembly began promptly at 2:00 PM, with senior executives of the association, Wang Boyong, Liu Hanru, and Li Guohua, presiding over the event. They reported on the significance of holding the speech assembly and then invited the speakers to deliver their speeches, the general ideas of which are as follows:

(1) Mr. Lin Kanghou: Elaborated on the relationship between anti-British and anti-American sentiment and participation in the war, urging the public to clearly recognize the crimes of aggression committed by Britain and the United States in East Asia, and to support the government in achieving the goal of participating in the war.

(2) Mr. Chen Binhe: Explained that people should vigorously pursue production and economize on consumption during wartime, citing examples of people in Japan, Britain, and other countries economizing during wartime, advising the people of our country to emulate this behavior to adapt to the wartime environment.

(3) Mr. Yoshida Toyosuke: Spoke about the changes in the views of the Japanese government and people towards China after the war, stating that Japan has now taken a further step to respect China's international status and hopes that people from both China and Japan will continue to work hard to strive for overall peace and jointly work together to defeat Britain and the United States.

(4) Mr. Quan Shi: Discussed the importance of wartime productivity, stating from an economic standpoint that the production of major products should be increased. He suggested that private gardens and open spaces in Shanghai should be used to plant vegetables and food to reduce the panic over daily food shortages. He also stated that the accumulation of gold and silver by the United States is one of the reasons for promoting world war.

(5) Mr. Zhang Peng: Said that the three major elements of war are competition in manpower, material resources, and intellectual power. China has sufficient manpower and material resources to cope with the war, and only needs to pay attention to intellectual power, promote people's belief in the war, and can naturally defeat Britain and the United States and liberate East Asia.

The speakers all spoke concisely and to the point, and the audience's emotions were extremely enthusiastic, with constant applause. Finally, Chen Yafu, a director representative of the association, delivered a thank-you speech and screened the anti-British film "The Flower Girl." The assembly ended at around 5:00 PM.

### Relocating Refugee Children - Monthly Cost of Relief and Care in Shanghai is More Than 200 Yuan Per Child

The Times reports that 40 charitable organizations in this port that provide relief to children are currently planning to send a large number of children they have taken in to various rural areas, especially the villages near Suzhou, as the main destination. The cost of living in these areas is about 70% lower than in Shanghai.

Some Refugee Children Have Already Left Shanghai

The China Children's Welfare Association, the largest in scale, has announced that it will discuss this plan in early February. If it is approved, it will be submitted to the relevant authorities for implementation. The Shanghai Relief Children's Charity Organization recently moved to Jiaozhou Road. The organization has already implemented a plan to relocate children. About 50 children were sent to Suzhou by sailing ship three months ago. It is said that the monthly cost of providing relief to a child in Shanghai is nearly 200 yuan, while in Suzhou it is only 50 yuan.

Relief Organizations Distributing Cotton Clothing

The China Children's Welfare Association recently launched a fundraising campaign and raised a total of 100,000 yuan, most of which has been used to manufacture cotton robes and bedding, which was completed at the end of December. These cotton robes are now being distributed to impoverished families living in Shanghai for their children, who have no warm clothes to protect them from the cold. Poor families applying for clothing must have children under the age of 14 and must provide proof and have a guarantor. Only after the association's verification will they be allowed to receive the clothing.

Support for Charitable Organizations Depends on Donations

The association has two shelters in Shanghai, one on Route Lafayette and the other in the Nanshi area. The former houses 110 refugee children, while the latter houses 300. According to the association's budget, it needs nearly 480,000 yuan for relief funds in the first month of this year. Due to this urgent need, the association will launch a large-scale fundraising campaign in March, which will be completed before Children's Day. It is said that without public support in the past 14 years, it would have been difficult for the association to continue operating until now. Also, without the charity dance party in October of last year, it would now be impossible to sustain. The funds raised from the previous dance party were no less than 100,000 yuan.

### New Year's Charity Champagne Lottery Drawing - Small Champagne Tickets Also Drawn

The Wan Guo Sports Association's New Year's Charity Grand Champagne Lottery tickets were drawn yesterday as scheduled during the sixth race. All the profits from this event will be used for winter relief and other charitable causes. In addition, the 31st Autumn Small Champagne Lottery tickets sold by the Shanghai Race Club were originally drawn according to the Shanghai Race Club's Autumn Grand Champagne Race. However, due to the postponement of the race, it was also announced that the drawing would be postponed. Now, because the club has no scheduled date for the race, it has been decided to draw the tickets according to the Wan Guo Sports Association's New Year's Charity Grand Champagne Race. The drawing was held at 6:00 PM the day before yesterday. The winning numbers can be obtained from the club at Luhuatang, Mahou Road.

### Announcement of Scholarship Grants for Elementary School Students - Hope to Claim According to Regulations - Scholarship Grants for Middle School and University Students Insufficient - Still Awaiting Generous Donations from Enthusiastic Individuals

The Fourth Shen Bao Readers' Scholarship Grant has been open for application and registration for 15 days. The selection and investigation of primary and secondary school students has been completed. The elementary school group has been reviewed and decided, and the list of students in grades 5 and 6 who will receive the grants will be announced today and tomorrow. Those who are selected are requested to bring their registration certificates and the seals that match those used during the application process to the office immediately to collect their scholarship grant checks. The details are recorded as follows:

Heavy Workload of Review Process

Regarding the elementary school group grant, the following is a general overview of the handling process for the benefit of the generous individuals who have donated funds, as well as to encourage the students who have received the grants to study harder and not disappoint the expectations of all sectors of society. (1) The period of time from application to approval for the elementary school group grant was very short, and the procedures were particularly complicated. The teachers of the YMCA presided over the examination, and their efforts and services were tireless. Every paper and every word was read. School grades and examination grades had to be cross-referenced, and the family situation had to be thoroughly investigated. The applications for the scholarship grants from more than 800 students in grades 5 and 6 of elementary school were repeatedly reviewed, examined carefully and fairly, and now it has come to a conclusion.

Paying Attention to Character and Being Mindful of Poverty

(2) The review standard, in a nutshell, is "to seek those who should receive the grant." The principle of the review was to constantly seek those who should receive the grant, fearing that someone would be missed. This is also the original intention of the donors. The following points were given special attention: (1) Striving for strictness in character. If the character is not good, what benefit will it bring to society even if the student completes their studies? (2) The scholarship grant is to assist outstanding students from poor families. Those from more affluent families should not occupy the opportunity to receive assistance from those from poor families. (3) For those with slightly lower grades, younger age, and good character, or whose parents have passed away, self-study lacks guidance, and the student helps with many household chores, it is hoped that the student will study hard and rebuild the foundation of the family, so the selection was wider. (4) Although this scholarship grant has received enthusiastic donations, the funds are not considered small in terms of the amount collected, but they are insufficient in terms of the number of applications. Therefore, all students in grade 5 with grades above 90 and students in grade 6 with grades above 85 will have their tuition fees fully covered. In addition, those with relatively lower grades or conduct, or whose family situation is difficult but whose parents and guardians are still able to work, will have appropriate scholarship grants determined based on various circumstances. There are also cases where the school tuition is particularly expensive, but the student's grades are not good and the conduct is average, and only a portion of the scholarship grant is approved. The main point of these reductions in scholarship grants is that there are insufficient funds to distribute, but it must be the same as the students' academic performance and conduct. Students who have received sufficient grants should encourage themselves even more, and those who have not received sufficient grants should encourage themselves at all times, so that they can have exceptional results in the next session.

Textile Magnate - Undeniable Contribution

The total amount of scholarship grants originally planned for grades 5 and 6 could not fully meet the expectations of the students. Later, Yuji and Yiji, which operate in the textile industry, generously donated 20,000 yuan, instructing that it be specifically distributed to elementary school students, so as to avoid young children losing their abundance and affecting their future independence. The colleagues followed Mr. Renxin's heart to help the world, and specially increased the number of elementary school scholarships to about 200. These 200 elementary school students continue to study, and Yuji and Yiji have really helped them to achieve this. Otherwise, the colleagues would have the intention to care for them, but the cotton strength would not be enough, and the people of society and the colleagues would always regret it. At present, the application quotas and scholarship grant budgets for middle school and university students are still insufficient. It is hoped that all sectors of society will continue to donate funds so that the number of middle school and university students who receive assistance can be increased, and they can have the same fortunate experience as the elementary school students. Then, it would be fortunate.

Scholarship Grants Received Yesterday

Yesterday, scholarship grants were received from Liu Jun, 400 yuan; Wu Wanfang, 200 yuan; Ma Xiaoxin and Xiao Liang, 100 yuan each; Jiang Zhaonan (raised from 15 people), 100 yuan; Tailonghao people, 64 yuan; Li Lyujun, 60 yuan; Shen Jun (raised from 5 people), 56 yuan; Fan Jun, 50 yuan; Li Qiaozeng, Chen Dexin, and Xia Yingde, 40 yuan each; Zheng Dingzeng, 35 yuan; Chen Zuochen, 30 yuan; Fang Chuanzeng, 24 yuan; Yu Zhaoliang, Feng Hefu, Yuan Xiru, Lin Xiaoquan, and Lin De, 20 yuan each; and Lu Jun, 10 yuan, totaling 1,346 yuan in reserve certificates. Adding the previous balance of 220,725 yuan and 72 cents, the current balance is 222,071 yuan and 72 cents.

### Outline of Cultural Policies After the National Government's Participation in the War - Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office Studies with the Public Works Department's Education Office

The politics, economy, and culture of Central China have undergone great changes after the National Government's participation in the war. The outline of cultural ideology and its methods is currently being studied by the Cultural Department of the Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office and the Education Office of the Public Works Department. The goal of the cultural policies is to promote the integration of Chinese and Japanese cultures, promote the construction of a new order in East Asia, sweep away the Anglo-American style of liberal education, and promote the true essence of Eastern culture.

The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office has sent approximately 300 Japanese language teachers to the National Government and the Public Works Department's universities and middle schools, using Japanese language textbooks approved by the National Government as teaching materials to specialize in teaching Japanese. However, after the National Government's participation in the war, merely relying on teaching Japanese is not enough to promote Chinese-Japanese cultural cooperation and understand the spirit of shared life and death advocated by the National Government. The Japanese Embassy Shanghai Office is aware of this, so it has decided to formulate an outline of cultural education and policies so that young students can understand the evils of liberalism and communism and promote the construction of a new order in East Asia. The specific methods will be announced to all Japanese language teachers soon.

### Winter Relief Roundtable Conference Convened by This Newspaper

Foreword

Given the urgency of winter relief, this newspaper, leveraging its position in the media, aims to raise awareness among all sectors of society, expedite winter relief efforts, and provide timely assistance to impoverished compatriots. Consequently, we convened a roundtable conference with philanthropic individuals from the community. The opinions expressed during the conference were initially published in this newspaper on January 26th. Subsequently, to gather more diverse perspectives and garner the sympathy of Japanese individuals, we invited fellow members of the press in Shanghai from friendly nations to hold another roundtable conference. We are deeply grateful for the enthusiastic participation of foreign journalists and their valuable input. We now urgently disclose the key points as follows:

Compilation of Opinions (Arranged by Stroke Count of Last Names)

Mr. Masao Kawasaki—Chief Editor of the Chinese Section, Domei News Agency

The winter relief issue is, needless to say, an extremely urgent one. With prices so high and the need to revitalize and develop productive industries, the winter relief issue is even more pressing. Chinese philanthropists in Shanghai have been generously donating, and Japanese residents naturally express their deep sympathy for such relief efforts. However, Japanese society is generally more stable, so perhaps the plight of Chinese refugees does not receive the full attention of Japanese residents. As for concrete measures:

(1) After consulting with the Japanese authorities, request Japanese stores to provide essential goods at cost or the lowest possible price.

(2) Organize a charity sale of items donated by Chinese philanthropists and sell them to Japanese residents.

(3) Place "Winter Relief Charity Boxes" in Japanese cinemas and other venues.

(4) Solicit donations from Japanese residents.

However, the Chinese side needs to organize a unified body, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, to be responsible for coordinating, distributing, and managing donations. (Editor's Note: This city already has such an organization, but its nature as a people's organization limits it to local work.)

In my opinion, winter relief is merely an emergency measure to alleviate suffering during the cold season. However, in the current situation, it is essential to actively enable people to become self-sufficient. Before providing relief, the authorities and neighborhood security should investigate how many people need assistance. With a definite plan, they can be sent to reclaim wasteland or engage in handicrafts. This is better than simply soliciting donations. First, set up facilities for work, formulate expansion plans, and then provide appropriate subsidies. In short, proactive relief is more meaningful than passive relief.

In the current situation, it is of course necessary to provide as much relief as possible. Aiding the marginalized members of society is an obligation for all members of society, both Chinese and Japanese. Therefore, I am willing to do my best to help reduce the "existence of misfortune." I propose the establishment of a "China-Japan Joint Relief Association." Current winter relief efforts are a temporary measure. It would be best to seize this opportunity to establish such an organization and make it a permanent institution to promote relief efforts through China-Japan cooperation. If this organization is established, then Japan can serve as the center for donations. Regarding the prospects for practical work, we can wait until the organization is established. Therefore, I hope that philanthropists from China and Japan will step forward as soon as possible to promote the establishment of this "China-Japan Joint Relief Association." (Translated by Yun)

Mr. Kiyomasa Nikko—Editor-in-Chief, New Shen Bao

(1) Providing relief to Shanghai refugees is not only an excellent act of charity, but I believe it is also necessary for securing victory in the Greater East Asia War. Solving the food and employment problems of Shanghai refugees is equivalent to strengthening combat power and enhancing labor in the rear of the Greater East Asia battlefront.

(2) I believe that Japanese residents in Shanghai are also willing to contribute to refugee relief efforts. As for relief methods, first, Japanese newspapers should assist in publicizing this idea to make it clear to Japanese residents. Then, request the cooperation of various organizations such as the Japanese Residents' Total Mobilization Patriotic Association, the Women's Association for the Current Situation, and the Shanghai Asia Development Association. I believe that its effect will be significant.

(3) Consult with the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy to gain their understanding. Then, request the Shanghai Office of the Embassy to arouse the sympathy of Japanese residents. This method is also very good.

(4) Regarding the method of providing relief to refugees, here are a few more suggestions:

1. Organize refugee relief agencies to shelter refugees and solve their food, clothing, and employment problems.

2. Encourage labor-intensive agencies, companies, and so on to hire more refugees.

3. Organize model villages in the suburbs of Shanghai to accommodate refugees and enable them to engage in cultivation.

4. Encourage the Shanghai Municipal Council to hire refugees to repair or clean roads.

In addition to the above, I think there are many other ways. If Chinese and Japanese people work together sincerely, I believe the results will be good. Regarding the funds needed for refugee relief, it is also simple. In addition to generous personal donations, we can hold theatrical performances, movies, concerts, and so on, and use all the proceeds as charitable donations. (Translated by Yun)

Mr. Motoharu Ishiyama—Shanghai Branch Manager, Tokyo Shimbun

(1) Winter relief is a social problem. Therefore, in any case, it is an internal Chinese problem. Regardless of whether past social undertakings were the work of a few philanthropists or one of the political deception tactics of the United Kingdom and the United States, now that China has begun to enter the path of a new unified nation, it must earnestly address the current national livelihood issues. I believe that the Chinese authorities should evoke a discussion that shifts from a charitable concept to an obligatory concept. In other words, charity is individualistic humanitarianism, not collectivism. However, this kind of social undertaking is the responsibility of the state. Therefore, the National Government and municipal authorities (and the current Municipal Council in the foreign concessions) must take charge. If relying solely on the charitable hearts of the business community, the driving force may not be strong.

(2) For this issue, the attention of Japanese residents must be aroused. However, this is only material and spiritual assistance from the side. The main subject of the issue is the Chinese side. If the Japanese side does this casually, there will inevitably be unfamiliar points in implementation, leading to misunderstandings, the true intention will not be understood, and it may even foster a mood of complacency. This would be detrimental to the liberation and rebirth of China and the revival of the national spirit of shared suffering and mutual support. The Japanese side should, when the Chinese side or even the Municipal Council undertakes this undertaking, create conditions that make it possible or favorable, and strive to make it last.

(3) In wartime, complacency is out of the question. Therefore, those who desire the living standards and attitudes of peacetime should strive to correct themselves spiritually. Those who are dissatisfied with this lose their value for relief and are abandoned by society. Opinion leaders must have this determination and effort. However, on the other hand, a minimum standard of living must be guaranteed in any case. This undertaking has its own goals and limitations, and mobilizing vagrants into production is the most important thing. This productive power should be borne by the public, and it is best for those with surplus resources to bear it. Therefore, use indirect taxes on luxury goods (even if they are domestic products today) or entertainment to provide a financial source for the undertaking. Furthermore, donations from philanthropists can be used as a financial source to establish a charitable foundation to manage the disbursement. In short, individual charity as it exists now cannot be unified and therefore cannot achieve the effect of the whole. Therefore, these organizations must be united as an extension of the government authorities, under government control, so that they are closely linked.

The above views are too biased towards the subjective and are inevitably the talk of an outsider. However, since I have been entrusted, I have nothing to offer in response, fearing discourtesy. Therefore, I disregard my shallowness and write casually. If it can be regarded as a reference, I would be very fortunate. (Translated by Ding)

Mr. Tocho Hirao—Shanghai Branch, Asahi Shimbun

The Greater East Asia War for the liberation of the East Asian peoples should be completed by the East Asian peoples sharing both joys and sorrows. During this great war, East Asian peoples, regardless of their nationality, must endure hardships in life and concentrate all their efforts on the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, the so-called shared suffering should also minimize the suffering as much as possible. Therefore, those who are struggling in life should provide mutual relief and assistance so that the power of wartime production can be cultivated and continued. Japan has long implemented the allocation of occupations, appropriate allocation of food, and control of general supplies through government policies and the neighborhood association system. China has also reached the stage where it should implement such policies. Therefore:

(1) Promote the further popularization of the neighborhood security system in the Chinese national character's beautiful tradition of family assistance, and the organization of mountain forest security to share what one has with others.

(2) The connection between government agencies and winter relief organizations should be rapidly materialized by government agencies, with respected figures as chairpersons, establishing refugee relief committees and sub-committees for each road, to carry out the following:

(3) Set a date to hold charity performances such as flower sales, plays, and movies, and charity dances (i.e., using the income from dance halls as charitable donations).

(4) The collection, storage, and distribution of clothing can be studied and adopted based on the methods currently used in Japan.

(5) In theaters in the Hongkou district, such as the Great China Theatre, hold charity performances mainly featuring magic tricks and juggling, to arouse the sympathy of Japanese residents and conduct fundraising and collection of old clothes. Alternatively, consult with film companies to invite male and female actors to perform on stage.

(6) To arouse social attention, encourage books and writings with the meaning of "the righteousness of East Asia and relief" and connect them with the New People's Movement to revitalize the inherent spirit of mutual assistance in the East. (Translated by Ding)

Mr. Hideo Unno—General Bureau for Central and Southern China, Yomiuri Shimbun

The problem of refugee relief is by no means a new undertaking this year. Every winter, many impoverished people die from cold and hunger. However, there has never been a definitive method of relief in the past, which proves China's "certain uniqueness." Seeing many refugees and beggars wandering the streets makes one feel that relief must be provided as soon as possible. What would happen if Japan had such a situation? It would certainly be considered a serious social problem, and each prefecture would submit it to the prefectural assembly. The councilors would treat it as a very important issue to study. The prefectural government would first provide relief on the spot, and even members of the House of Representatives and the House of Peers would consider it a national issue to discuss and treat the relief of refugees as a national affair. China is currently on the path of "revolution," so refugee relief should be treated as a national undertaking. Moreover, the world is now at war, and refugee relief has become a direct objective for promoting the great war and cannot be ignored. When we see men and women with gaunt faces and emaciated bodies, exposed to the wind and sleeping in the open, that kind of wandering anxiety makes us doubt our own eyes. Are these really the people of China, our friendly nation of the same culture? People coming to Shanghai from Japan are surprised by the number of beggars and refugees. I once witnessed such a thing: a beggar pulled a handful of tattered cotton from the clothes on his body, stuffed it into his mouth, and ate it with relish, laughing as he ate. I am afraid that the beggar was really too hungry, so he pulled the tattered cotton and ate it as food. This phenomenon is probably not limited to one person among the Shanghai refugees!

Now is a time of unprecedented war, and I am afraid that these refugees will only increase and not decrease. I believe that refugee relief is a major responsibility of the Chinese and Japanese peoples. However, what is the best way to do it?

(1) Group Living: Accommodate refugees in a place in the suburbs of Shanghai and have them live in groups. However, this method does not mean asking those refugees to live idly. Instead, assign them work according to their skills and guide them to maintain a self-sufficient life. Among the beggars, there may be people who are unwilling to work, because beggars are a kind of personality flaw. Therefore, one or two days of guidance cannot correct their character. Responsible people must make the refugees understand the principle of "no work, no food." Therefore, refugees must be classified. People with relatively few personality flaws should be separated from completely useless people. The disabled who cannot work should be housed in other places and provided with food and clothing.

Where are these locations most suitable? I apologize for not having been to various places in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, so I cannot explain. However, I think that in many places, there are always places to accommodate about 50,000 to 80,000 people and allow them to live by reclaiming wasteland. Let them live in that kind of uncultivated wasteland and give them houses and farming tools. Perhaps there will be good results.

(2) The funding for winter relief should logically be borne by the national treasury. However, due to environmental factors, it may not be possible. I believe there is another way. Several hundred dance halls, cafes, bars, and all non-essential entertainment venues in the concession may impose a kind of "winter relief tax" to be used as relief expenses. This method can be considered as collecting a "head tax" from the guests entering those venues. It is also possible to slightly levy "indirect taxes" on the items sold in those venues, so that the men and women entering entertainment venues can bear some of the burden. Furthermore, please invite key figures in the financial world to generously donate. However, there is no fixed category for the funds, so there must be a sum of money before the work can be gradually promoted. It is more appropriate to treat donations as a second step. If there is a way to obtain the location and the funds, a public organization should be established to manage and guide the work. Under this organization, a social enterprise organization should be established to arouse the compassion of the public and collect cold-weather clothing, food, etc., and the public organization should guide and supervise this social enterprise organization. At the same time, guide those refugees who have moved to the countryside. After this model village is established, under the benevolent guidance of the supervisors, I believe that the rice, wheat, vegetables, and pig and chicken farming they produce will be considerable and can be self-sufficient. If there is a slight shortage, other parties can be asked to subsidize it. The disabled are housed in places like nursing homes, and funds are collected using the methods described above.

Everything must have permanent facilities, but the most important thing is to eradicate the dependence of refugees and beggars (I believe there must be a strict distinction between refugees and beggars) and cultivate the spirit of self-reliance. People who work diligently should be given considerable rewards to strengthen their savings mentality. The current social situation is like being in a dream, and all methods must be done by observing reality. Perhaps in the future, it will be possible to establish banks targeting these refugees and primary and secondary schools to educate these children.

Japanese residents should, of course, also do their best to help relieve these refugees. (Translated by Yun)

### Outline of Issues

(1) Winter relief is already very urgent. How should we arouse society to pay attention again? How should we promote it quickly and separately?

(2) How should government agencies, winter relief organizations, and organizations handling winter relief work closely coordinate and discuss consistent methods to strengthen the effectiveness of relief efforts?

(3) How should winter relief funds be raised universally? How should the amount of funds be reasonably regulated? How should relief affairs be implemented quickly?

(4) How should the target of relief be investigated and handled in order of urgency?

(5) How can the methods of clothing collection and storage be made scientific?

(6) How should we appeal to Japanese residents to generously donate with a spirit of mutual assistance and compassion?

### Summary of Key Points

(1) In wartime, there is no room for complacency, and there can be no peacetime living standards and attitudes.

(2) Relief is a societal problem as a whole and should be handled by state institutions, not just by relying on the philanthropists of the business community.

(3) Government institutions and relief groups should promptly liaise with respected figures in charge.

(4) Japanese newspapers should help with propaganda and request Japanese resident groups to cooperate to arouse the true feelings of Japanese residents.

(5) Japanese residents can provide assistance from the side, materially and spiritually.

(6) Organize agencies to accommodate refugees. Factories and companies, etc., should employ as many refugees as possible, and the Municipal Council should employ refugees to build roads.

(7) Accommodate refugees in one place, live in groups, assign work according to each person's skills, and enable them to be self-sufficient.

(8) Eradicate the dependence of refugees and beggars and cultivate the spirit of self-reliance. Adopt the Japanese neighborhood association system to share what one has with others.

(10) Sources of funding should be taxes on dance halls, cafes, bars, and all non-essential consumer venues in Shanghai—a "winter relief tax," "head tax," and "indirect tax." Furthermore, financial figures should be asked to generously donate.

(10)(1) Hold charity performances such as flower sales, plays, and movies, as well as charity dances in dance halls, with the income used as expenses.

### Realistic Imagination

— Cold Wind

If an individual wants to develop his ambitions, then he must be good at using imagination. Imagination has a great power for life. Whether in business, education, as well as increasing happiness and health, it is an extraordinary element. The progress and success of everything in the world are probably guided by imagination. Imagination is not a purely empty thought in the mind, it has a realistic basis. Great models and functions grow in thought, making it possible to realize them.

The reason why great figures in various countries in the world today and in the past were able to succeed is because their imaginations grasped reality, spurred reality, and then seized good opportunities and put them into practice. Then, they worked hard towards the ideal goal. Because of imagination, they felt dissatisfied with reality, and because of dissatisfaction, they honed their ambitions and stimulated their advancement, so that the ideal finally became a reality and they achieved success. If a person's imagination is correct, then his ambitions will surely be realized, that is, he can succeed. If imagination goes astray, it can cause him endless disasters and darkness.

### 4th Place Winning Essay: My Plan for This Year

— Wang Yuquan

Using spare time, gather a few comrades to start a regular publication, specializing in introducing necessary knowledge to colleagues in the professional circle, discussing the personal problems of professional youth, cultivating the personality of employees, and exchanging knowledge. It provides ways for salaried people to cope with wartime life—a regular publication purely for professional youth to read and created by professional youth themselves. This is an important program in my plan for this year.

Due to the experience of working at noon, as well as various feelings in life, I deeply realized my various shortcomings, such as insufficient professional knowledge, insufficient living methods, insufficient contact with colleagues… I felt that I needed proper guidance. In order to seek this guidance, I collected specialized publications. I ran through magazine companies and searched all the newspapers and books listed on the newsstands. I have not found such a book that can benefit us. Although in the past there were enthusiastic people who compiled many special books for professional youth, and there were also periodicals, they are now out of print. This is a very disappointing and hungry situation under our urgent needs.

I usually like to write and fiddle around, so I wanted to run a publication suitable for the reading of the professional public, to remedy the above shortcomings. But limited by my personal limited ability and shallow knowledge, I am even more unable to do this work with a major mission. So I wanted to seek help and cooperation from others, and gather the power of the majority to do it, so that this publication can become a publication of every professional youth. Everyone can write articles, everyone can speak, so that they can be open to each other, research each other, cultivate together, and contribute data together. I am just an arranger. The content may not be so poor.

It is not easy to start a publication now. The high cost of printing and paper has become a serious problem for general newspapers and books, let alone starting a new publication? But I believe that this is a publication that we create ourselves for ourselves to read. We can save materials as much as possible with our own efforts and reduce the cost to the lowest possible limit. We plan not to waste a single point. The selected manuscripts must have sufficient content, and the length should avoid useless waste. The price should only be affordable for every salary class. After sufficient design, only one issue will be published each month. Although it is only a thin one, every sentence is meaningful, and every article is beneficial to read. People who spend money and time on reading can get a large amount of harvest.

In terms of content, I am planning like this:

Special Articles: For the latest changes in the business community that are worth discussing, give precise analysis, succinct judgment, and correct instructions, so that readers can get a clear concept after reading and get practical conclusions based on the instructions. This does not have to be written by ourselves, we can ask social advanced people and business leaders to write for us. Only their rich life experience and thorough observation can seek the truth from the incident impartially.

Cultivation: The clear and touching writing must also be written by the predecessors in the industry and commerce, and speak to the professional youth from a guiding position. At the same time, it is also possible to translate good writings from foreign specialized books.

Public Forum: This is a place for us to give speeches. Each person stands on their position and says what they want to say. It is okay to report their own experiences, study important issues, or tell their inner feelings. As long as the issue is worth discussing publicly, it is possible to hold a forum here to express the opinions of the public.

Life Report: It is best to use literary description techniques to express each person's lifestyle, arouse literary appreciation, and also accommodate manuscripts discussing life.

Professional Experience: Each person writes about their professional experience, the experience of work, the attitude of employment, and the advantages and disadvantages of other people's work methods that they usually feel and observe. Learn from each other. If there are wrong places, whether their own or someone else's, they should be criticized honestly. If they feel good, they should also be praised and suggested. Valuable professional experience is the only foundation for developing a career.

### History of Success of Famous Industrial and Commercial Figures

I plan to place this kind of text at the end of the book and treat it as a long novel. All the famous figures who have succeeded in the industrial and commercial circles at home and abroad, how they started, how they worked hard, how they struggled, and how they succeeded, are described one by one, regardless of the length of the number of words, depending on the size of the layout.

If possible, we can also set up industry and commerce trends, industry visits, and professional mailboxes. In short, I will devote all my efforts to publish this periodical this year, and I also hope for the help of my colleagues in the profession (Note: Mr. Wang is now twenty years old and used to work as a editor in a newspaper office).

### Supplement to Paper Size Aesthetic Point of View

The method of the standard script competition published in the Free Talk on March 30th, the height of the paper in the second item is calculated by the construction ruler, according to the construction ruler is equal to 0.32 meters, and is equal to 0.96 city ruler.

### Leonardo da Vinci's Job Application — One of the Letters of World-Renowned Artists

— Written by Lincoln Schuster, Translated by Gu Xin

Background: Thomas Craven called Leonardo da Vinci "the most brilliant figure in mankind." In the following job application letter, da Vinci's words are very direct and assertive, indeed reflecting his character. He could have said more, stating that he was a geologist, botanist, biologist, and master of many other arts and sciences.

Leonardo da Vinci was born in 1452 in Italy, a few miles from Florence. He made "his life an era—and his era was the Renaissance." Antonina Vallentin wrote a biography of him, one of the newest and most authoritative accounts of da Vinci. In this biography, Vallentin broke with traditional views and presented da Vinci in a different light. Traditionally, it was assumed, "This man, among his contemporaries, soared like a rocket," but Vallentin said, "This man struggled in the dark to find a way out, fighting for light and life, dreaming grand dreams, watching these dreams shatter one by one... It wasn't until he was over forty that he gained fame, and this fame came so late that it was too late to comfort his loneliness or alleviate his contempt for humanity..."

Da Vinci believed that everything was made of the same basic substance, which aligns with most modern scientific discoveries. He wanted to fly within the realm of human achievement and built a model airplane. The perfection of his paintings, the vitality of his simplest sketches, the breadth of his interests, the richness of his writing, and the balance and depth of his thoughts all made him one of the legendary giants of all time. His life motto—also his daily practice—was "unyielding perseverance."

At the age of thirty, Leonardo da Vinci, weary and seeking new frontiers for development, left his hometown of Florence for Milan. At this time, Florence, under the rule of the Medici family, was in decline, while Milan, under the rule of Lodovico Sforza, was prospering. The following letter is da Vinci's job application to the Duke of Milan.

"...Assure Yourself of My Secrets"

Text: Most Illustrious Lord, some have become renowned in the art of inventing war machines. I have seen and considered their experiments, and I do not find their inventions much different from those used daily. Therefore, I have no prejudice against anyone and boldly request that Your Excellency assure yourself of my secrets and grant me a commission.

First, I can build bridges that are light, strong, and easy to move. With them, you can pursue and defeat enemies. There are also other more solid bridges that can resist fire or attack, but are still easy to move and place; and I can also burn and destroy enemy bridges.

Second, in sieges, I can cut off the water in moats, create pontoon bridges, scale walls with ladders, and create other similar machines.

Third, if a place cannot be attacked because of its high position or great strength, but its foundations are not on bedrock, I can destroy every fortress.

Fourth, I can also build a large cannon that is light and easy to transport. It will fire rapidly and like hail small stones. Its smoke will greatly terrify the enemy, causing them significant losses and throwing them into chaos.

Fifth, I can build tunnels silently to any predetermined location, straight or curved, as needed, and even pass under trenches or rivers.

Sixth, I can manufacture armored vehicles to carry large cannons. These vehicles can break through the enemy's most concentrated ranks, opening a safe passage for our infantry.

Seventh, if the time is not right, I can construct beautiful and practical mortars and light cannons, unlike those commonly used.

Eighth, when cannons cannot be used, I can also supply crossbows, catapults, trabocchi, and other highly effective but less common devices—in short, if necessary, I can provide an unlimited supply of tools for offense and defense.

Ninth, if war breaks out at sea, I can design many of the most suitable machines for offense and defense, warships that can withstand the greatest firepower, and manufacture various explosives and weapons.

Tenth, in peacetime, I believe I can provide complete satisfaction in the construction of public and private buildings, and in water diversion projects from here to there, as well as anyone else.

Furthermore, I am very capable of sculpting in marble, bronze, or clay. In painting, I can do as well as anyone. Also, I would like to take on the task of casting a bronze horse, which will deeply commemorate your late father and the Sforza family with immortal glory and eternal honor.

If anyone sees anything impossible or impractical in the above, I am willing to test them in your garden or any place your Excellency prefers. With all possible humility, I recommend myself to Your Excellency.

Aftermath

He got the job and held it for sixteen years until the French invaded Milan and dismissed his employer. He died in France in 1519 at the age of sixty-seven, with premature signs of aging. Although later generations called him a "universal genius," he felt that his "greatest scientific plans were not realized" and that "his pursuit of artistic perfection" was also unsuccessful.

### Reading the Pictures of "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (5)

— Hua

—To My Daughter

Could it be that matters of filial piety in ancient families were the responsibility of children, regardless of whether adults were involved? Although my mother liked to hit me, she never asked me for anything to eat when I was young; instead, she often bought things for me to eat. Even when I was taking care of her, she never complained about this or that. My mother was not even my biological mother, and she had a rather volatile temper. Speaking of which, I want to protest to those who fabricate stories in my capacity as someone who has been a son and is now a father—on the one hand, to defend my parents, who were certainly not as they describe them, and on the other hand, to defend my own wife, as we as parents are certainly not as they describe us either.

Considering the vastness of the earth and the long history of ancient and modern times, human nature is diverse and varied, and there must be many strange things. For example, Meng Zong and Wang Xiang were scolded and beaten by their mothers to the point where they had no way to go to heaven or earth, so they ran to the bamboo forest to cry, or to the river to find carp, or even thought of drowning themselves. Children may lack knowledge, which is not impossible, but catching carp in winter is something ignorant people have added.

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

"Very well, you've said enough, Mr. Chipping—that's an example of what I'm complaining about. You have your opinions, and I have mine, and since you won't budge, there's no better way. My aim is to make Brookfield a fully modern school. I am a scientist myself, but even so, I'm not against the classics—but the classics must be effectively taught. Just because they are dead languages doesn't mean that's a reason to treat them with dead educational techniques. I understand, Mr. Chipping, that your Latin and Greek lessons are exactly the same now as they were ten years ago when I was here, aren't they?"

Chips replied slowly and proudly; "On that point—ahem—they are exactly the same as when your predecessor—Mr. Meldrum—came here, that—ahem—was thirty-eight years ago. We, Mr. Meldrum and I, started here in—in—1870—ahem. And the first to approve of my teaching outline—was—um—Mr. Meldrum's predecessor, Mr. Weatherley. He said to me, 'You can teach Cicero's works to the Fourth Form.' It's Cicero—not Kickero!'"

"Very interesting, Mr. Chips, but that proves my point once again—you have lived too long in the past and not enough in the present and future. Times are changing, whether you've noticed it or not. Parents now demand more from the school for the three years of fees they pay than some broken languages that no one speaks. Besides, your students haven't even learned what they think they have. None of them passed the junior certificate last year." (27)

Social Services

### The Newspaper's Social Service Department Establishes Small Loan Fund for the Poor

At a time when industry and commerce are showing signs of recovery, the number of unemployed is increasing daily. With the soaring prices of goods, the poor are finding it difficult to make a living, and their situation is becoming increasingly dire. If assistance is not provided promptly, they may starve. This newspaper, in accordance with the wishes of its readers, is striving to do its part and dares not lag behind. In addition to vigorously supporting winter relief efforts by providing porridge and clothing to shelter from the cold, we have recently established a small loan fund to help the poor become self-reliant and avoid desperation or resorting to illegal activities. We have gradually received donations totaling ten thousand yuan, which will serve as the foundation for the small loan fund. Loans will be interest-free and absolutely fair. Unemployed and impoverished compatriots who lack the ability to make a living can apply. After an investigation confirms their circumstances and they provide a guarantor to prove that the borrowed funds will not be used for improper purposes, they can borrow from the newspaper's Social Service Department.

### Yiyou Hospital Temporary Clinic Offers Free Medical Services

The Yiyou Society in Fusui Lane, Tianjin Road, is organized by enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life and spares no effort in serving the community. The society has established a temporary clinic, Yiyou Hospital, which employs physicians such as Yang and Ding Wenwei. They provide free medical services every afternoon from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM and from 7:30 PM to 9:30 PM. Patients are welcome to visit for diagnosis and treatment.

### Li Church Expands Small Loan Fund

The Shanghai Special City Li Church's Small Loan Fund Office and Material Lending Center are located in the Yinchengtang Public Hall, Xiaopi Lane, Anren Street, Nanshi. Recently, prices have risen sharply, making it difficult for small vendors with limited capital to manage their finances. The number of applicants to the association is increasing daily, and the economic directors plan to expand the small loan fund to provide widespread relief.

### Yijing Helps the Poor

The bonsai exhibition at 165 Haig Road, opposite the De Li Church, is hosted by bonsai experts such as Kong Zhiqing. Participating in the International Flower Show has brought great reputation to the country. This winter's seasonal flowers, such as wintersweet, nandina, daffodil, and plum blossom, are particularly colorful. In view of the difficult living conditions in Shanghai and the extreme suffering of the poor, they will donate 10-20% of the flower sales to the newspaper's poverty relief fund.

### Aurora University Law Association Establishes Scholarship Fund

The Aurora University Law School Association, in order to improve its affairs and establish a scholarship fund, initiated a fundraising campaign for the association's academic fund in September of last year, raising approximately eight thousand yuan in total. The association's president, Xu Pei (Shen Tai), convened a staff meeting on the 23rd of this month and decided to allocate five thousand yuan as a scholarship fund. A scholarship fund committee was established, with Father Peng Lianshi, Dean of the Law School, as chairman, and Xu Pei, Wen Zhiyong, and nine others as committee members. The regulations have been finalized and announced. All students of the Law School can apply in accordance with the regulations.

### Compilation of Free Schools

(1) Wude Voluntary Middle School at 750 Lane 6, Xinzha Road, has begun enrollment for this semester. Tuition and fees are completely free. Students with excellent grades and impoverished family backgrounds can apply. (2) The Shanghai YWCA has expanded its original Girls' Night School and Women's Refresher Class this year at Hongyi Middle School. Classes range from illiterate to fifth or sixth grade. Fees are very low. The Girls' Night School is purely voluntary and only charges ten yuan per semester. Both schools offer free tuition to students from impoverished families. (3) Trinity Primary School at the intersection of Ave. Haig and Gordon Road may reduce or waive fees entirely, reduce fees by three-quarters, half, or one-quarter for students from impoverished families. You can even request free books and notebooks. Applications can be made at any time before the school opens on February 3. It is better to mention the Shen Bao's introduction.
