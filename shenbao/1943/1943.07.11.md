### Review and Discussion of the Study Abroad System

— Zhang Chao

According to a Central News Agency dispatch, Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani Masayuki, when meeting with reporters on June 26th, spoke about the issue of establishing a system for Chinese youth to study in Japan. From this, it can be seen that Japan's current new policies towards China not only focus on politics and economics, but also take into account culture and education. I would like to take advantage of this epoch-making opportunity to review and discuss the past and future of the study abroad system, to provide a reference for China's education circles, and also to thank the friendly country for its kindness.

Review of the Past Study Abroad System When China first opened up to the world, insightful individuals, assessing the situation and considering the national conditions, deeply understood the importance of science and technology. They knew that unless we caught up quickly, we would not be able to stand on our own feet and fulfill our international mission. Therefore, there was the initiative to send students abroad, with the aim of learning from others' strengths to make up for our weaknesses, adopting the best practices, and with the deepest intentions. However, at that time, transportation was not yet developed, and people regarded traveling across the ocean as a daunting and frightening prospect, and hesitated to move forward. Therefore, it was difficult to be strict in the selection process. In some cases, regardless of whether age and academic qualifications were suitable, methods of encouragement were used to gather the required number of candidates. During this initial period, the number of students returning from abroad was small, and their achievements varied. Although there were some outstanding individuals who applied their knowledge to practical use, most were merely nominally qualified. Once they obtained the title of "returned student," it was easy to enter the ranks of officials, so there were many who coveted and envied this. As a result, the trend changed drastically, with study abroad being seen as a shortcut to wealth and status. Wealthy families no longer questioned their children's intelligence and invariably considered sending them abroad as a lifelong ambition. Without waiting for government funding, they were willing to empty their own pockets, and some even sent their middle school students, aged seventeen or eighteen, abroad without waiting for their physical and intellectual maturity. Their eagerness was both pitiable and laughable. The drawbacks of studying abroad were thus rooted in this. From then on, the number of students studying abroad increased day by day. Those with limited vision valued quantity over quality, and based on statistical figures, celebrated the progress of Chinese education, not knowing that the level of returned students was deteriorating as a result. Fortunately, there were many insightful people in the country who, recognizing this crisis, strived to correct it. Therefore, the selection process for government-funded and public-funded students had to be made as strict as possible, and private-funded students were also required to apply to the Ministry of Education for study abroad certificates, with the intention of adding restrictions through review. However, due to weak implementation, the results were not significant. Cunning individuals evaded the regulations altogether, and no one was ever heard of being punished as a result. It only added another procedure, and the government undermined its own dignity. Strictly speaking, there was no so-called study abroad system in the past, but because the sending of students was excessive, the situation of studying abroad was also complicated. Those who were older and had a deeper foundation had more steadfast aspirations and studied more diligently, but they were as rare as phoenix feathers and unicorn horns and could not be seen often. The next group were those who were muddleheaded and perfunctory, taking the degree as the goal and study abroad as a formality, and they were the most numerous. The worst were those who neglected their studies, were accustomed to extravagance, and even claimed to be unconventional, competing with each other. Close to ink, they were stained black, and the habit became a trend. All returned students could describe this in detail, so there is no need to elaborate. Although there were proposals to send senior officials to supervise on the spot, they were not effective because they were not widely implemented and the implementation was not thorough. In addition, due to excessive sending of students, the situation of applying what they learned after returning to the country was also disorganized. Government-funded and public-funded students often did not know where to start after returning to the country to contribute what they had learned, let alone private-funded students. Talented and knowledgeable individuals were rejected and ended up in poverty, while those who only stole a false reputation held important positions. The motive for sending students abroad was to save the country, but the general image of returned students presented to us was the opposite. The failure to establish a study abroad system for decades was due to this.

Discussion on the Study Abroad System Before discussing the study abroad system, two necessary conditions should be met: (A) The domestic education system is sound. (B) Those who implement the study abroad system have high moral character. Regarding point A, the education systems of various countries must each have their own consistent policies and characteristics. If study abroad is used as a path for further study after graduating from university, or if study abroad is used to replace domestic university education, it is not the right way to run education, and it cannot be used to establish a study abroad system. Regarding point B, the effectiveness of any system depends on the people who implement the system. When people are capable, policies are successful; when people are incapable, policies fail. This is true in all ages. If those who implement the study abroad system do not understand the importance of their own responsibilities and use their position to monopolize and seek personal gain, then even if the system is established, it will not be effective. Under these two conditions, A and B, based on my limited understanding, I propose the following outline for the study abroad system: 1. Establish a Study Abroad Management Office, which will centralize all matters related to selection, sending, supervision, assessment, recommendation, investigation, and statistics. When necessary, the office will appoint special study abroad commissioners to take responsibility for care, assistance, guidance, and supervision on the spot. 2. Whether government-funded, public-funded, or self-funded, the minimum qualification is graduation from a domestic university, good health in all three areas (intellectual, physical, and moral), and continuous service in a relevant organization for at least three years (those with special talents or contributions are not subject to this requirement). 3. When government agencies or private enterprises need special talents, they should first apply to the management office for deployment. If the office cannot supply the required personnel, then the office will publicly recruit and select a certain number of candidates who meet the minimum qualifications. This is the preliminary selection. Those who pass the preliminary selection must then engage in two preparatory tasks: (A) Become proficient in the required foreign language. (B) Research the designated research problem as much as possible in China and complete it within the specified time. The management office will select the required number of candidates from those who pass the preliminary selection based on the results of these two tasks, A and B. This is the final selection. Self-funded students must also go through the preliminary selection process and submit proof of meeting the requirements for the final selection, but they are free to choose the research problem. 4. The duration of study abroad does not need to be predetermined and should be determined based on needs. The number of candidates should not be based on the agency or discipline. The cost should also not be fixed and should be flexible, so that the efficiency of study abroad is not constrained by economic factors. As for the length of study abroad, although it is estimated in advance, there is room for increase or decrease. All arrangements will be the responsibility of the management office, and the commissioner in the host country will do their best to assist, so that there are no shortcomings. Self-funded students must have a guarantee for the funds they raise themselves and must deposit them in installments with the management office, which will distribute them on their behalf, with no difference from government-funded or public-funded students. The aim is to ensure that young people studying abroad do not have to be distracted by economic and livelihood concerns, and also do not become depraved due to excessive indulgence. All young people are the lifeblood of the country and should not be discriminated against because they are self-funded. 5. Government-funded or public-funded students will serve in the required agencies upon returning to the country. Self-funded students must first register with the management office, which will recommend them to suitable agencies as a priority. As for the detailed rules and regulations for implementation, they can be revised based on the above outline, but they are beyond the scope of this article. In addition to contributing to various sectors in China with the research problems specified by the research institute, returned students also have the mission of cultural exchange between countries, which is also worth our attention.

### Night Battle of Kula Gulf: Japan Achieves Remarkable Results; 28 Enemy Ships Damaged or Destroyed in Eight Days; Over 159 Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) In the daylight battles off New Georgia and Kolombangara Island and the night battle of Kula Gulf on the 5th of this month, several destroyers of the Japanese naval squadron and the Japanese army and navy garrison units stationed there sank three enemy warships, severely damaged one cruiser, and heavily damaged another cruiser. This was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 7th. The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 10th that, according to later reports, in addition to the above results, it has been confirmed that one enemy special service ship was sunk. The Class B cruiser that was damaged and caught fire has also sunk. According to later reports, on July 4th, one newly commissioned Saint Louis-class Class B cruiser, one Brooklyn-class large cruiser, and one warship of unknown type were sunk. In the night battle on that day, the Japanese naval squadron resolutely engaged in close combat with the enemy, sinking the enemy Class B cruiser Helena with torpedoes. From the course of this battle, it can be inferred that the enemy fleet was indeed frightened by the activity of the Japanese destroyer squadron and tried to escape. However, when it confirmed that the Japanese fleet was only a destroyer squadron, it regained its confidence. Therefore, the courageous operation of the destroyers at night, penetrating deep into the enemy fleet's formation, resulted in the announced victory. After this battle, the enemy fleet must have learned that the Japanese naval squadron is brave and formidable.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) From the 30th of last month, when the American forces began their counteroffensive in the areas of Rendova Island and New Georgia Island, through the naval battle of Kula Gulf on the 4th and 5th of this month, to the 7th, when enemy forces attacked Rubiana Island, over eight days, the total results achieved, according to the announcement of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, can be summarized as follows: Sunk: Four Class B cruisers, five large destroyers, one destroyer, one special service ship, one torpedo boat, one warship of unknown type, and twelve transport ships. Damaged: One Class B cruiser, one destroyer, and one torpedo boat. In total, 28 enemy warships were sunk or destroyed. In addition, many enemy boats were sunk, and over 159 enemy aircraft were shot down.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) Reuter reported from the headquarters of the Allied forces in the South Pacific that a strong formation of Japanese fighter planes fiercely attacked Rendova Island yesterday. The official report also stated that Japanese bombers attacked Allied bases in eastern New Guinea, but did not mention the losses suffered.

### German Armored Forces Break Through Soviet Lines: Both Sides Employ Large Numbers of Artillery and Aircraft in Unprecedented Large-Scale Fierce Battle

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) Although Soviet tank units fought to the death to block the German wedge from entering the Soviet lines south of Kursk, the breakthrough by the German reserve forces was further expanded. A DPA dispatch from Berlin last night stated that the Battle of Kursk had reached its fifth day yesterday, and its nature was unchanged compared to Thursday. Large numbers of the latest tanks, such as the German Tiger tanks and the improved Soviet T-34 tanks, were engaged in battle between Belgorod and Kursk, and in the area south of Orel. The Soviet strategy was to use tank attacks, followed by infantry attacks, in an attempt to cut off the German forces, resulting in fierce battles. However, according to reports from Berlin, the German forces achieved their objective. The Soviet forces concentrated large numbers of artillery and rocket launchers at two focal points, and the German forces also employed artillery in an unprecedented large-scale battle. Therefore, the intensity of the artillery battle between the two sides is unprecedented in this war. A Reuter correspondent commented last night that the large number of tanks, artillery, and aircraft employed by both sides in the Battle of Kursk made it the largest battle of the entire war. Both sides are constantly sending in reinforcements. Berlin reported that the number of Soviet tanks and aircraft destroyed yesterday exceeded one thousand, but it is believed that General Rokossovsky, commanding the forces in the Belgorod area, still has more tanks in reserve for his deployment. DPA pointed out that the German command has adopted new tactics for tank warfare. After the vanguard of the armored forces breaks through the echeloned Soviet lines, it does not hastily penetrate deep inside, but instead expands its breach and consolidates its positions. DPA reported that after the German armored forces broke through 60 kilometers north of Belgorod towards Kursk, they used another formation of tanks to break through the eastern Soviet defense line of Belgorod, expanding the German wedge towards Novy Oskol. The Soviet countermeasure to the German breakthrough was to attack the flanks of the German forces, but the German command had taken this possibility into account. In any case, General Rokossovsky's tank units encountered strong German armored reserves assisted by fighter and ground-attack aircraft. The German air superiority also prevented the Soviet operational plan from being realized. A Reuter correspondent in Moscow admitted last night that the dangerous area for the Soviet forces was somewhere between Belgorod and Kursk, where the German armored forces had broken through the Soviet lines. The Soviet authorities have not yet announced the exact location of the battle zone, but it is understood that the main German offensive is along the main route from Belgorod to Kursk, or parallel to that route.

### Japanese Newspaper Editorial Discusses the Battle of Kursk

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) The Nagoya Chubu Nippon Shimbun editorial on the 10th, entitled "The Nature of the German-Soviet Offensive and Defensive War," commented on the future nature of the fighting in the Kursk region, stating that on the eastern front, the German and Soviet forces, at dawn on the 5th of this month, began the largest offensive and defensive war since the end of the winter campaign, centered on the Kursk salient at the northern end of the southern front. According to frontline reports, both sides had forces of one million men, and mobilized tanks and aircraft in the thousands, with a scale comparable to the large-scale offensive and defensive war in Stalingrad last fall. When this operation began, the German authorities claimed that the Soviet forces had launched the offensive first, while the Soviet Information Bureau said that the German forces had launched the offensive first. Because the two sides were completely contradictory, the truth is difficult to discern. However, it is clear that both the German and Soviet forces used the stalemate period of the past hundred days to continue to strengthen their forces in that area, waiting for an opportunity to attack. Therefore, it is not important who launched the offensive first; the main thing is who can first gain the initiative in the battle and then continue to attack. Judging from the current situation, the initiative in the battle is in the hands of the German forces. The Soviet side seems to have admitted this. Regarding armored forces and air power, the air force has an absolute advantage. In this regard, the overall situation of the battle has already been decided. There is also much discussion about whether the current operation is the German summer offensive. If we look at the map, we can see that the Soviet lines west of Kursk have a salient that extends 300 kilometers. By its nature, a salient is in a passive position, so the forces deployed there are fewer than on the defensive side. In order to remedy this defect, the German forces must flatten the salient lines in the Kursk area and make them a straight line. From the above, the current German operation seems to be a localized position-strengthening battle, with no intention of carrying out a large-scale full-scale offensive. This is clear from what the German authorities have stated several times. In short, whether the Allied forces can launch an invasion of Europe is still questionable, but their preparations are a fact. The German forces cannot repeat last summer's all-out offensive on the eastern front, concentrating their forces only on the eastern front and giving the Allied forces an opportunity to land. Therefore, an offensive like last summer's may not be possible this year, but the operation in the Kursk salient will continue to unfold. Therefore, although the German summer offensive this year is completely different in nature and scale from last summer's offensive, it is still a summer offensive.

### Landing Battle Occurs on Sicily: Axis Forces Resisting Fiercely; Enemy Suffers Heavy Losses

Rome, 10th (Central News Agency) The American High Command issued a communiqué on the 10th stating that Allied forces, under the cover of naval vessels and air forces, landed paratroopers on the 9th and began to attack Sicily. The Axis forces are resisting the enemy forces with all their might and are currently engaged in fierce battles with the enemy on the eastern coast of Sicily. When Allied aircraft attacked Sicily on the 9th, 22 aircraft were shot down by Axis ground fire, 15 of which were shot down over Gela. In addition, German fighter squadrons shot down 11 enemy aircraft. The Italian air force also severely damaged three enemy merchant ships in a torpedo attack off the coast of Tunisia.

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) Reuter, citing the London Daily Mail, reported that Allied forces began landing on Sicily this morning. The landing forces included British, American, and Canadian troops, all under the command of General Dwight D. Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied forces in North Africa.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Military sources here recently stated that the Allied forces landing on the southeastern coast of Sicily suffered extremely heavy losses after the Axis defense forces fought bravely. Axis coastal batteries and bombers inflicted heavy damage on enemy landing craft and transports filled with troops.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) Plana, a special correspondent for the German News Agency, wrote that Britain and the United States have divided their tasks in the Mediterranean. Britain is responsible for attacking Europe from the eastern Mediterranean, while the United States is starting operations from the western Mediterranean. The Allied command is trying to hide its troop movements. This fact is evident from the Allied news and propaganda policy, it is said. In the past few weeks, the Allied command has been making major troop movements. Many units have been transferred from eastern Tunisia to the eastern Mediterranean. This is partly to facilitate supply and distribution, and partly to replenish its exhausted units in areas outside the range of Axis bombers, and most importantly, to reduce friction between Britain and the United States.

(British Eagerly Await the Invasion of Europe)

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) According to Reuter, a Swiss radio correspondent in London reported that as the Battle of Kursk intensifies, the emotions of the British people are also becoming tense. They are asking whether the Allied forces can invade Europe at this time. Churchill announced that he would invade Europe in the autumn, when the leaves fall, but the British clearly want this to happen immediately. The London Observer paid close attention to the Soviet report that German air forces from the Channel and the Mediterranean had been transferred to the eastern front to assist armored units, believing that the time for the Allied invasion of Europe had matured. Military sources in London believed that German forces had been transferred from Eastern Europe to the Balkans and the Mediterranean. By the time of Kursk, the strength of the German forces was so great that it was also felt. The British general public acknowledged that the time for the invasion of Europe was approaching. The magazine "Time and Tide" said that the raid on Crete and the intensified activities of the Allied air forces were a prelude to the invasion of the Italian islands.

### Japanese Forces Complete Comprehensive Blockade: Chongqing's Difficult Situation Deepens

Argentine City, 10th A special dispatch from the New York Times in Chongqing states that since Chongqing was completely blockaded by the Japanese army, its difficult situation has deepened. The Japanese army's blockade operation against Chongqing has not only weakened Chongqing's military strength, but has also paralyzed its economic power. Since the Yunnan-Burma Road was cut off, it has only been able to rely on small-scale air transport from the Soviet Union, which is difficult to meet its needs. Moreover, the Soviet Union is focusing all its efforts on the eastern front and has no time to spare, so the assistance to Chongqing is almost non-existent. Therefore, Chongqing's poverty has become imminent. Under such circumstances, it is illusory for the Chongqing army to launch a counteroffensive against Japan. As far as Chongqing's transportation situation is concerned, we all know that the number of railways still retained by Chongqing is very small, and its water transport volume is only about 100,000 tons per year. Currently, Chongqing has a total of 7,600 kilometers of railways, of which 6,000 kilometers were built after this year. The number of vehicles, including military vehicles, is less than 20,000, and most of them use alcohol or charcoal gas, so their transport capacity is extremely low. At the same time, since 1937, prices have risen a hundredfold, so the people's lives are becoming increasingly difficult, and the economic situation is becoming increasingly dire. Chongqing, in such a situation, still dreams of final victory, which is pathetic.

### Bai Chongxi Arrives in Lanzhou

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) According to news received here, the Chongqing government is making every effort to pacify the Hui Muslim uprisings in the Northwest region. On the 8th, it decided to appoint Ma Guoli and Ma Zhongwu, two influential Hui Muslims in Gansu, as members of the Gansu Provincial Government, and sent Bai Chongxi, who has potential influence among the Hui Muslims, to the area to cooperate with Zhu Shaoliang, Commander of the Eighth War Zone, Gu Zhenglun, Chairman of Gansu Province, and Ma Hongkui, Chairman of Ningxia Province, in order to appease the high tide. It is reported that Bai Chongxi arrived in Lanzhou on the 7th and is currently starting his activities.

### Japanese Military Police in Beijing Assist in Promoting Grain Administration: Wang Wumin Expresses Determination to Stabilize Food Supply

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) In order to assist the authorities' food policy, the Japanese military police in Beijing issued a notice yesterday to Japanese residents, stating that anyone who violates or attempts to disrupt the policy will be punished according to military law.

### Grain Storage Warehouses to be Completed Before Autumn Harvest

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) The Central Reserve Bank, previously entrusted by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Food, issued the Grade B Grain Storage Bonds of the Republic of China in 1942, with a total value of 100 million yuan, to build grain storage warehouses. It has been learned that the Ministry of Food is now actively carrying out this work, adjusting existing warehouses in various places to make them scientific, and setting up warehouses in Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Danyang, Yangzhou, Gaoyou, Baoying, Taizhou, Lishui, Xintai, Xinghua, Jiaxing, Hangzhou, Huzhou, Wuhu, Anqing, and Dangtu. The grain distribution warehouses in various rice-producing areas are all required to be completed before the autumn harvest. Regarding the management of the warehouses, once the Central Grain Storage Bureau is established, it will be managed by the bureau in order to implement the established policy of storing grain for famine prevention.

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) Since its establishment, the Ministry of Food has been actively promoting grain storage. It has formulated the Rice Grain Storage Law, the Wheat Flour Prevention Law, the Rice Grain Storage Outline, and the Warehouse Destruction Law, which have been distributed to various warehouses and agricultural improvement experimental zones for reference. The various methods proposed are all practical and meet the needs.

### Roosevelt Announces Attitude Towards France

Lisbon, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt declared yesterday at an executive press conference that the United States would not recognize any French government as long as 95% of the French people are still under German rule. The President's brief remarks have attracted great attention from political circles in the area. The President did not want to make any announcement regarding his meeting with Mr. Giraud, except to say that only military issues were discussed. However, Mr. Giraud told the press yesterday about the White House meeting, saying that he had reached a complete agreement with President Roosevelt. He said that President Roosevelt had stated that he was prepared to deploy 300,000 French troops for offensive operations. According to news from well-informed sources in Washington via the Haitong News Agency, more attention is now being paid to the development of Mr. Giraud's trip. It is gradually believed that Mr. Giraud's trip will lead to a political decision. The opinion prevailing in Washington, D.C., is that President Roosevelt's statement that he would not recognize any French government was directed specifically at Petain. Those who have contacted Petain do not support the anti-Axis military goals, but focus their efforts on strengthening their political position after the war. On the contrary, others believe that it is an expression of the French spirit of fighting against Germany. Washington correspondents for American newspapers have reported for the first time that Petain's attitude has aroused suspicion in Washington.

### German Commentator Analyzes Axis Production Situation, Believes that Labor Can Be Fully Supplied in This War

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The famous German commentator Mr. Long Lingboff recently published an article in the Berlin People's Prosecutor's Daily entitled "Nine to Eleven," in which he elaborated on the recent speeches by German Minister of Armaments Speer and Labor Organization Officer Zaker, focusing on the situation of production. The main points are as follows: German Minister of Armaments Speer previously reported to the German people on the status of German armaments production. Now, Mr. Zaker, the Labor Organization Officer who is fully responsible for the deployment of labor in Germany, has also explained the vast labor force provided to the Axis side, outlining the situation. Mr. Chai made a report on the current state of the two camps during the First World War and this war, publishing comparative figures, which is very gratifying to us. According to this, during the last World War, the manpower of Germany and its allies was only in a ratio of 10 to 1 with the United Nations. On the contrary, in this war, this situation has undergone fundamental changes. The ratio between the enemy and us is currently 9 to 11. Mr. Chai said that if we had the strength to hold on until the last five minutes at that time, we might have won the last World War. Mr. Chai has made it clear in this statement that, in terms of the current state of manpower on both sides, we now have an absolute advantage. Therefore, the outcome of this war for the Axis powers can also be answered here. At present, the total number of laborers we have is 380 million, while the enemy has 555 million. However, the labor force possessed by the Axis side is actually deployed, and is in fact the labor force that can be deployed in the future. On the contrary, although the enemy's labor force is numerically superior to ours, they may not be able to fully mobilize all of them. This is because the above numbers are the total number of laborers scattered around the world, and the enemy is restricted by climate and natural conditions, so some labor cannot be mobilized to engage in armaments production. For example, Indian farmers and black laborers on American farms. As for the labor force possessed by the Axis side, it is distributed in Europe, Japan, and the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan today has fully demonstrated its organization, not to mention its great economic power in this war, which is beyond the dreams of the United States. Moreover, since the establishment of Manchuria, although not long ago, the domestic economy has been exceptionally developed. China, which is on the road to recovery, has also achieved great results in terms of labor distribution, with no room for doubt. At present, the 190 million labor force possessed by the two major co-prosperity spheres in the East and West can do their best, and strive to increase production in closely connected regions. The production sites on the European continent are particularly concentrated. We have now appropriately allocated the necessary labor to this concentrated production site, and the areas we control are linked together, unlike the enemy, which is scattered in various places. Therefore, we can actively implement production plans, which is far beyond the reach of the enemy. However, we not only make appropriate use of all the vast labor force, but also seek to improve its efficiency, and have achieved results. The great situation of the results obtained by the total force in the two major co-prosperity spheres in the East and West is fully evident from the results achieved by Japan, Germany, and Italy in East Asia and Europe.

### Afterthoughts on a British Tragedy

— Tokutomi Iichiro (2)

By the time of Edward VII, Jewish power was even closer to the court. Edward VII was still the Prince of Wales at the age of seventy, and various kinds of mixed elements gathered around him. Among them were gamblers, speculators, financiers, and jockeys, too numerous to mention individually. Among them, Sassoon, Arnstein, and Cassel can be called his close friends. He was a Jewish financier, a famous wealthy man in England. It was said that some of the secret expenses of the Crown Prince were paid by him. Therefore, after Edward VII ascended the throne, he naturally remained a powerful figure by his side. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan raised public bonds. He and Jewish financiers in New York, such as Schiff and Loeb, responded to each other, subscribing to public bonds and contributing a lot. This was naturally at the suggestion of Edward VII, and we need not speculate wildly.

Looking at Jewish power outside the court, there is no doubt that some of the party expenses of the two major political parties in England, the Conservative Party and the Liberal Party, are paid by Jews. Although cleverly concealed, the Marconi wireless telegraph incident was a major event that once shook British politics. The British Liberal Party cabinet almost collapsed as a result. Now there is no need to describe the beginning and end in detail here. To put it simply, on March 7, 1912, Samuel, the then Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, paid the Marconi Company for wireless telegraph affairs. Samuel was naturally a Jewish politician. Even in Japan, there was a branch of his compatriot Samuel Petroleum Company.

Moreover, the general manager of the Marconi Company, Godfrey Isaacs, was also a British Jew. His brother, Rufus Isaacs, was then the Attorney General of the Liberal Party Asquith cabinet and the chief legal advisor to the cabinet. Godfrey Isaacs, the general manager who was instructed by the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs, went to the United States with 100,000 shares of the American Marconi Company and returned to the London market. Prior to this, he had secretly met with his brother Harry and the then Attorney General Rufus to consult his two brothers and propose to distribute them at a price of one pound and sixteen shillings per share. Harry took 56,000 shares here, and Rufus then bought 10,000 shares from Harry at a price of two pounds per share. However, the then Chancellor of the Exchequer Lloyd George provided the funds to the Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Samuel, and Lloyd George and the Parliamentary Secretary of the Treasury kept it as a secret expense for Liberal studies. Airey-Punt also participated in this matter at that time.

In April 1912, these stocks were offered to the market at a price of three pounds and five shillings. As a result, General Manager Godfrey, Harry, the Isaacs brothers, and Lloyd George, Airey-Punt, etc., all sold those stocks and gained considerable profits. Airey-Punt not only used his own property, but also used the secret expenses of the Liberal Party, and gained even more benefits. Therefore, in July 1912, the approval case for the contract between Minister of Posts and Telegraphs Samuel and Marconi Company General Manager Godfrey Isaacs was submitted to the House of Commons, and the problem arose here. The subsequent disturbances are not described in detail. Lloyd George was unaware of it at first, so there was nothing he could do. After the investigation committee was selected, Attorney General Rufus Isaacs secretly met with the committee and made it clear that not only himself, but also North Pavilion officials were involved in the matter. Saying that if Lloyd George pointed out this matter, it would be a loss. He even made his wife's savings account public in court. When England engaged in the South African Boer War, the Chamberlain family was a major shareholder in an arms company and obtained undue profits, and Lloyd George had also proposed a motion for impeachment in the House of Commons. The so-called yesterday is right and today is wrong is probably referring to this kind of thing! Soon it ended anticlimactically and vanished like smoke. This is naturally the success of the British government in turning big things into small things and small things into nothing.

Rufus Isaacs was the youngest of the three brothers in his family. He initially lingered in the stock market as a broker and the like. He once caused an event related to criminal issues, but it was unexpectedly eliminated. Therefore, he aspired to become a jurist, a lawyer, entered Parliament, and gradually succeeded. He smoothly became the Governor-General of India and was conferred the title of Marquess of Reading, which was a higher rank than Disraeli's earldom. He eventually became the Master of the Rolls in the English High Court. He had completely fulfilled everything a party member should have, and he occupied a transcendent official position outside the party, maintaining it until after his release. He reached this point, and his talent need not be said, but even more than this, we must not forget that it is his Jewish instinct.

### Welcoming the Japanese Economic Mission: Two Organizations Hold a Grand Tea Party Yesterday; Jointly Organized by the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the Economic Roundtable; Advisor Ishiwata Addresses the Meeting, Focusing on Shanghai's Commodity Prices

The Japan East Asia Economic Roundtable, in order to promote Sino-Japanese economic cooperation and leverage the economic strength of both countries to complete the great undertaking of constructing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, specially organized a Sino-Japanese goodwill economic mission. Led by Viscount Councilor and President of the Wartime Financial Fund, Ogura Masatsune, the mission arrived in Shanghai on the 7th. In the following days, they held earnest discussions and exchanged opinions with the Chinese economic community and relevant authorities. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the China Central China Branch of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, considering the mission's significant mandate in China and its potential contributions to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, specially held a complete tea party yesterday (the 10th) at 5:00 PM on the fourth floor of the Asia Building on the Bund to welcome the delegation and express their respect. In addition to the economic mission, members of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, and the entire membership of the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, also attended. For a time, the economic powers of China and Japan were concentrated in one place, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. The details are recorded as follows:

Attendees from China and Japan: From the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association: Japanese members: Yoshikazu Ishido, Hikoji Ichihashi, Goro Yomura, Akitsugu Nishikawa, Yaichi Okamoto, Sadatoshi Oda, Kenichi Kawaguchi, Misao Katsuta, Kikuro Kaji, Shigemitsu Tanaka, Takashi Tsutsumi, Yastaro Nakagawa, Yoshimi Tsukawa, Takejiro Muto, Toraji Awamoto, Nagama Fukuda, Kiyotaro Fujino, Jiro Shindo, Nobutane Mizuuchi, Sado Kimura, Masashi Kimura, Kosei Monden, Kyutaro Sugiki, etc. Chinese members: Wen Lantao, Teng, Kanghou Lin, Yipeng Zhang, Fangyuan Ding, Boyuan Wang, Meibo Wang, Huailian Tu, Miaosheng Zhu, Xiaoshan Ren, Tugang Ren, Quanshi Yu, Zongcheng Jin, Shuhua Shao, Boxiang Hu, Junzhi Yao, Xinghai Tang, Jusheng Tang, Ping Ren, Yongzu Xu, Qun Xu, Xiaochu Xu, Jingfu Xu, Dinghe, Kangyuan Xiang, Yuyi Huang, Fuxiao Ye, Luqing Tong, Zhaoxing Yu, Qing, Hongyan Zheng, Rutiao Zhao, Yangyao Pan, Xiwu Su, Qingxiang Yan, Nan Qun Gu, Gongmo Gu, etc. From the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable: Japanese members: Tatsichiro Funatsu, Takashi Aoki, Masaburo Kanno, Ichimatsu Inada, Katsumi Horie, Inzaku Tsuneguchi, etc. Chinese members: Shaopeng Chen, Ri Ban, Xue Nong Wang, Deyi Zhang, Chengbo Tang, Xiaochu Xie, Dong Zhang, Mao, etc.

List of Economic Mission Members: Under the leadership of Ogura Masatsune, the head of the Japanese Economic Mission, members entered the venue in succession around 5:00 PM amidst applause. In addition to the head Ogura, the members included Teruo Akashi, Saburo Nango, Go Kotera, Toshio Nakanishi, Chiyozo Fukuda, Seiji Yoshida, Sanroku Izumiyama, the head's secretary, Gaiji Takagi, and staff members Kinjiro Kuzutsuseki, Takeo Toiguchi, and Kyoei Hamano. Head Ogura wore formal attire with a red flower on his lapel, appearing to be in good spirits. After all members were seated, Highest Advisor Ishiwata and Consul General Nakata also arrived at the venue, and everyone stood up to welcome them.

Welcome Speech by Wen Lantao: Chairman Wen Lantao, President of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, after announcing the opening of the meeting, delivered a welcome speech, stating: "Distinguished members of the economic mission, esteemed gentlemen: Today, I, on behalf of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, extend a warm welcome to the 'Sino-Japanese Goodwill Private Economic Mission' led by His Excellency Ogura. I feel exceptionally gratified and hold unlimited hopes. From any perspective, mutual assistance and cooperation between China and Japan are a matter of course, and there is no need to repeatedly emphasize this point. Recent measures between the two governments have been moving in this direction. Various sectors of the two countries should uphold the will of the government authorities, strengthen mutual assistance and cooperation, cherish each other's country, love their neighbors, and build a Greater East Asia of co-existence and co-prosperity. The gentlemen of the economic mission are all elites from friendly private sectors and leaders in the economic community. This visit to China to inspect the economy will surely yield satisfactory results beyond expectations. 'Where sincerity resides, even metal and stone will yield.' The two great nations of China and Japan, placing their hearts on the table and treating each other with sincerity, sharing a determination to share weal and woe, will surely achieve the goal of co-existence and co-prosperity. Finally, I wish the gentlemen of the economic mission good health and success in completing their mission."

Speech by Mr. Chen Shao: According to a speech by Mr. Chen Shao, representing the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, expressed a sincere welcome to the economic mission and hoped that the mission would carry out its great mandate to complete the war between China and Japan and achieve the goal of building the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Response by Mission Head Ogura: Economic mission head Ogura responded that the mission's visit to China was due to the enthusiastic execution of the Liaison Association and the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable, for which he was deeply grateful. He also expressed contentment at being able to gather with economic authorities and frankly exchange opinions. He deeply thanked Mr. Wen Lantao and Mr. Chen Shao for their welcome speeches. Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, China and Japan have stood on the same front to jointly seek the construction of a new order in East Asia. However, to thoroughly construct a new order in East Asia, it is first necessary to complete the war, and to complete the war, it is even more necessary to first establish a wartime economic system in order to achieve the goal. Therefore, China and Japan must cooperate closely in the economy and work together to complete this great mandate. The main purpose of the mission's visit to China was to frankly exchange opinions with people in the Chinese economic community and to discuss and find concrete solutions for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. Since arriving in China, the mission has contacted and held several meetings with economic figures from your group, learning that there are many economic problems in Shanghai that urgently need to be resolved. Therefore, he will do his best to help solve these problems and will consult Mr. Ishiwata. Regarding the realization of economic cooperation between China and Japan, as Mr. Wen said, "Where sincerity resides, even metal and stone will yield." If we can make the greatest determination, any difficult problem can be solved easily. Furthermore, there is the Chinese story of Li Guang shooting the stone, which proves that with determination, even stubborn stones can be opened, which can serve as a mirror for us. Finally, he welcomed Chinese economic figures to organize observation missions to Japan to thoroughly understand and cooperate with each other.

Speeches by Chinese and Japanese Members: Vice President of the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association, Takeo Komuro, was ill, so Executive Director Mr. Fujino, on behalf of the Japanese members, delivered a speech, stating that the presence of the Japanese economic mission at today's friendship meeting and the unity of spirit among the Chinese and Japanese economic figures present were highly commendable. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is an assembly for mutual cooperation between Chinese and Japanese economic figures. The members were grateful for the visit of Head Ogura and his delegation. China and Japan are geographically close countries. If they can cooperate sincerely, they will surely be able to promote East Asia. Therefore, in addition to implementing friendship today, they have a heavy responsibility. We must make further progress in understanding and work hard to achieve the final goal.

Speech by Zhang Yipeng: Then, Mr. Zhang Yipeng, representing the Chinese members, delivered a speech stating that today, welcoming the Japanese mission and hearing Head Ogura's frank and trending statements made us very excited. From an economic perspective, the natural conditions, geographical advantages, and material resources of China and Japan can provide the most suitable natural conditions for cooperation. Economic cooperation must have two essential elements: First, sincerity. If one party is reluctant, the surface may resemble cooperation, but the content will inevitably conflict. Once there is mutual benefit, if one party wants to take more advantage, the other party will inevitably be disappointed, and cooperation will not be effective. Looking at past facts, after the Japanese came to China, there were many factories in Shanghai and nearby major cities. At that time, many hoped that the Japanese would come to cooperate, but the method of cooperation stipulated that Chinese people would account for 49% of the total amount, while Japanese people would account for 51%. Moreover, the Japanese issued bills for custody fees and repair fees, without making a single exception. They could get 51%, which is a major obstacle to economic cooperation. When the project was about to succeed, the first need of the Chinese factory was Japanese technical talent, while supervisory management talent was secondary. As a result, those sent to the factory were mostly in the supervisory management area, and those in the technical field were few, so they felt very anxious, which is another economic obstacle. This time, everyone has spent a lot of effort and time, so of course they want to get a satisfactory solution. Learning from the mistakes of the past, I dare not avoid taboos and frankly tell you this for your reference.

Speech by Chen Riping: Soon, Mr. Chen Riping, a member of both the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the East Asia Economic Roundtable, also stood up to speak, deeply hoping that the economic mission could improve and coordinate the economy of China and Japan, and strive to eliminate obstacles in China in order to obtain satisfactory results.

Speech by Advisor Ishiwata: Stating: "Wartime economic policies, whether in the Chinese or Japanese governments, cannot achieve good results without the cooperation of the private economic sector. Today, gathering the leaders of the Chinese and Japanese private economic sectors in one place can often have good gains. For the government, the most serious problem in China today is the 'price problem,' especially the price problem in Shanghai. I previously inspected various places with Minister Zhou, and the situation in Hankou was better than that in Shanghai. Although rising prices are inevitable in any wartime country, the price situation in China is even more serious. Because of the soaring prices, merchants think they have gained considerable benefits, but they must know that other prices are also rising, and as a result, they cannot obtain any benefits. Ignoring the overall situation for the sake of temporary personal gain is extremely foolish. However, the most important thing to solve this 'price problem' is the cooperation of the private sector. For example, the Japanese private sector price cooperation conference has already cooperated with the government and achieved good results in suppressing prices. Asian countries also have similar private sector cooperatives. The Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is the most powerful organization in the Shanghai industrial and commercial community. If it can cooperate with the government to solve the serious 'price problem,' I believe it will make a great contribution and will also greatly benefit the livelihoods of the people of China and Japan. In the future, the opinions provided by the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association to the government will surely be adopted by the government authorities."

The Entire Mission Will Go to Beijing for Discussions: The Japanese economic mission is scheduled to go to Beijing on the 12th to meet with Chairman Wang, Commander-in-Chief, and Ambassador Tani. After that, they will hold economic discussions with the ministers of Industry, Finance, and Food, members of the National Economic Commission, and key figures from various groups. They will also discuss cultural issues with the ministers of Foreign Affairs and Education, exchange opinions with Advisor Ishiwata, and visit Yuhuatai and Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum.

Akashi Discusses the New Economy: After the Japanese economic mission came to China, various parties held frequent banquets and sincerely discussed strategies for solving economic problems. All parties have high expectations for the results and content of the talks. According to Mr. Akio Akashi, a member of the mission and chairman of the Tokyo Bank Collection Association, the essence of the new economic policy lies in protecting and supporting Chinese national capital and actively cooperating with it. It is not enough to simply protect and support Chinese national capital. In the future, in order to nurture Chinese national capital, Japanese capital must be provided to new economic fields that allow the Chinese side to operate. Therefore, those of us who are responsible for the financial sector are willing to frankly discuss this point with Chinese financial giants and prepare to eliminate obstacles to the growth of national capital. Once financial cooperation is successful, problems in other economic sectors can also be solved.

### Implementation of Ticket-Based Rationing of Cotton Products for Japanese Residents; A Total of Eleven Types of Cotton Products Will Be Rationed

The Japanese authorities in this city, due to the sharp rise in the price of cotton products, have implemented a ticket-based rationing system for cotton products for Japanese residents. They have specially organized the "China Central China Japanese Residents' Civil Cotton Products Planning Committee." This committee is composed of representatives selected by various relevant associations of Japanese cotton product merchants. The committee has held several discussions, and the specific plan and implementation steps have been decided. It is understood that the rationing will be implemented from the 17th of this month. A total of eleven types of cotton products will be rationed, and the annual ration per person that has been determined is as follows: General Category: Two towels, one large cotton cloth, six yards of bandage, six cotton threads (30 yards each). Adult men: Four pairs of socks, two handkerchiefs, two shirts. Adult women: Four cotton wool balls, three pairs of cloth socks. Children under seven: Three yards of cotton cloth, four pairs of socks. The rationing amount for other cotton products is under consideration.

At that time, the shops will sell one catty of number two flour for six yuan and two jiao per ticket, with the registration number noted on the ticket. The announcement regarding the sale of rice with rice purchase certificate number forty-one and the associated ticket will be made separately. Furthermore, rice shops and the department's rice sales points will be temporarily closed for sales on the 20th of this month.

Short Commentary

### Advisor Ishiwata Encourages the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association

Yesterday afternoon, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the China Central China Headquarters of the East Asia Economic Roundtable jointly held a tea party to entertain the Japanese Economic Mission. Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, attended the meeting and gave a speech. We express our agreement with Mr. Ishiwata's insightful views.

The main points of Advisor Ishiwata's speech: Wartime economics will not achieve the desired results without the full cooperation of the private economic sector. The most serious economic problem in China is the price problem, especially the price problem in Shanghai. The situation in Hankou is better than that in Shanghai. Rising prices are inevitable in wartime countries, but the price situation in China is even more serious. Japan and Manchuria both have private organizations that cooperate with the government to suppress prices and have achieved results. The Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association is the most powerful private economic organization and should actively assume this responsibility.

Regarding these three points, they are also our consistent views. The first point is not only true for the economic aspect, but also for the political aspect. It cannot be strengthened without the cooperation of the people. We have repeatedly emphasized the relationship between the Shanghai price problem. We fully agree with the views of Advisor Ishiwata and do not hope that the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association only "befriends" and holds receptions and welcomes, considering that it has fulfilled its mission. We hope that the association will assume the responsibility of cooperating to suppress prices and give full play to the active performance of private organizations. We look forward to it.

### Rain Qi Cup Basketball Inaugural Performance: Northern Team Bravely Overcomes Mixed Team; White Goose Team Greatly Defeats Upper Girls' Team by 31 to 9

The inaugural Rain Qi Cup basketball league, sponsored by the Huizhong Bank, kicked off yesterday afternoon at 5 o'clock at the Paramount ballroom, with a crowded audience. Mr. Pan Sansheng presided over the opening ceremony. First, Zhou Bangjun and Huang Yuqi delivered opening speeches, and finally, the general manager Chen Zhong reported on the preparations. An autographed basketball was auctioned, and Chen Chunhua purchased it at a high price of 10,000 yuan, designated for the Shaoxing Middle School Scholarship Fund. The women's performance started first. The referee was Yu Juju. The Upper Girls' team was unable to field their main player, Zhang Zhen, due to illness, and Huang Mingyuan also mistakenly missed the time, resulting in the team lacking a leader. In addition, Shi Mei of the White Goose team had remarkably accurate shots, scoring almost every time. As a result, the White Goose team greatly defeated the Upper Girls' team by 31 to 9. The first half ended with the White Goose team leading 20 to 4. As the final match began, Lu Guyuan of the Mixed team made a long shot, opening the scoring. The Northern team refused to be outdone, and Shen Jingong scored, bringing the score back to a tie. The Mixed team then went on a scoring spree, but the Northern team called a timeout to reduce their momentum. Li Zhenzhong made a jump shot, and Li Baozhong scored from long range, resulting in three ties. The first half ended with the Northern team leading 21 to 18. In the second half, the Northern team's offense was strong, and the excellent shots of Li Baozhong and Shen Yu Gong seemed divinely inspired, pushing the score upwards. The Mixed team's advantage was not good, and they bravely resisted, with close defense, resulting in a fierce, yet somewhat relaxed, situation. In the end, the Northern team overcame the Mixed team by 51 to 41.

Economic Commentary

### "Appropriate Authority"

Mr. Inagaki Noboru, Director of the Materials Control Office of the Bureau of Industry and Commerce, told reporters the other day: "This port lacks an appropriate authority to deal with unscrupulous merchants who seek illegal profits." It was also pointed out that "In order to relieve the general public in this port, the suppression of hoarding and profiteering, and the penalty tax rules, need to be reorganized."

From the preceding statement, we can imagine that although the material organization work in Shanghai has been carried out for some time, and although it has the support of the Public Works Department and the local authorities, it still feels unable to cope with the rampant hoarding and soaring prices. From the latter statement, we can feel that the crackdown on hoarding is not only lacking in unified and effective executive authority, but also the penalty rules are not strict enough.

While deeply sympathizing with Mr. Inagaki Noboru's views, we hope that after the recovery of the Public Concession and the French Concession, due to the unified police authority, and the manifestation of strength, an appropriate authority can be organized to effectively enforce the crackdown on hoarding, and to strictly reorganize the rules for punishing hoarding. The defect of "having laws but no one to enforce them" must be remedied, and the principle of "using severe punishments to govern a chaotic country" must be implemented.

### Following Ministerial Standards: Financial Institutions Increase Capital According to Regulations; Native Banks Transformed into Limited Companies

In order to comply with the financial authorities' determination to strengthen wartime economic institutions, financial institutions in this city are required to increase capital or merge within a six-month deadline after July 1 this year. It is stipulated that banks organized as limited companies or joint-stock limited companies, including native banks, silver shops, silver companies, and trust companies, must have a total capital of at least 6 million yuan. According to the Company Law, half of the capital, or 3 million yuan, must be paid up first before business can commence. In the past, the stipulated capital amount was 500,000 yuan, so financial institutions have been increasing capital in accordance with the new regulations. According to a survey by a Shanghai News reporter, in the past week, more native banks have increased capital than regular banks, because small banks mostly increased capital successively in May and June. Native banks were slower, and since July 1, after the Ministry of Finance ordered them to be reorganized as limited companies, several have increased their capital to 3 million yuan or more. Many others are in the process of convening shareholders' meetings to discuss capital increases. New banks or native banks are also being established, and their capital must be at least half of the minimum amount before they are allowed to operate. Regarding mergers, although they are possible in principle, the unique circumstances of each financial institution make them difficult to implement, so capital increase will be the only way forward. The revised minimum capital amount for financial institutions is 6 million yuan for limited companies or joint-stock limited companies, 2 million yuan for unlimited companies, and 5 million yuan for general commercial banks engaged in trust business (including 3 million yuan for the bank's capital and 2 million yuan for the trust department's capital).

### Reviving the Silk Industry and Stabilizing People's Livelihood

— Tian Da

China has always been based on agriculture, and among agricultural products, silk and ramie are the most important, and are major exports. Due to the lack of statistical data in our country, there are no accurate figures for the annual production of silk. According to the Customs report in 1929, the export of raw silk was more than 189,000 dan, which, at the current value of 60,000 yuan per dan, is worth more than 100 million yuan in national currency. This does not include the domestic consumption of silk factories and local silk products. If these are included in the calculation, the amount will be even larger.

Since the outbreak of the war, many factories have been severely damaged, and silk factories have certainly not been spared. The remaining factories in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai have been exclusively operated by the Allied Sino-Japanese Silk Company since 1938. This includes 14 factories in Jiangsu Province (Wuxi 12, Suzhou 2), 7 factories in Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou 2, Chang'an 2, Jiaxing 2, Xiashi 1), and 2 factories in Shanghai, totaling 23 factories with 7,476 silk looms. The monthly production of raw silk is about 3,000 dan. Since 1941, the business situation has gradually declined. Currently, only 6 factories are still operating in the three regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Shanghai, with just over 2,000 silk looms.

During the same period, 28 new silk factories emerged in the Shanghai Concession. Due to the difficulty in collecting raw materials, they disappeared like a flash in the pan and soon closed down. There are more than 300 small silk-making factories scattered throughout the interior, with Wuxi having the most. However, they are short of capital, have simple equipment, and are set up and dismantled quickly, changing with the times. They are merely a kind of abnormal handicraft enterprise adapting to the extraordinary environment, earning a small profit and barely surviving.

Silk is the national quintessence of China and the only sideline occupation of Chinese farmers for thousands of years. However, it has declined to the point where it is now, and the impact on the national economy and people's livelihood is enormous. According to reports, the harvest of spring cocoons this year in Jiangsu Province is about 50,000 dan, and there is no such figure for Zhejiang Province. However, Zhejiang Province has historically produced more cocoons than Jiangsu Province, so the reduction in cocoon production in Zhejiang Province in recent years is even greater than in Jiangsu Province. The reason for the reduction in cocoon production this spring is due to the lack of silkworm eggs. It is a pity that good mulberry leaves are left to rot on the ground. However, due to the unstable silk prices and the repeated price reductions of cocoons over the years, farmers have lost interest in silkworm breeding after suffering losses, and have switched to other crops, resulting in a sharp decline in cocoon production year after year.

In addition to the soaring prices of various commodities, various products have risen greatly compared with before the war, but silk alone is low. Farmers sell agricultural products at low prices and buy daily necessities at high prices. This unequal exchange makes farmers increasingly impoverished and loses their only agricultural capital, eventually making it impossible to maintain their lives. Eighty percent of the people in China are farmers. If farmers live in poverty, how can the entire society be peaceful? Therefore, to stabilize people's livelihood, we must first make farmers prosperous. To make farmers prosperous, we must first develop production. If we want to develop production, then the revival of the silk industry is the most beneficial, because China's land is suitable for planting mulberry trees, the climate is suitable for raising silkworms, and silk making is a light industry. Once improved, development can be expected, which means that with half the effort, twice the result can be achieved.

Recently, the Sino-Japanese Silk Company has reduced its operations and dismantled some of the silk factory machinery, which poses many obstacles to the revival and development of the silk industry in our country. We deeply appreciate the Allied countries' prior delivery of various military-managed factories, so that our country can engage in economic revival. At the same time, we hope that the Allied countries, as an industrially advanced country, will maintain and support the silk industry, which has enjoyed fame in Chinese history, so that it can be fully developed to strive for production in East Asia and meet the high needs of wartime. The Sino-Japanese Silk Company has already been decided by the authorities of the two countries to be adjusted. We hope that this can be realized as soon as possible. We also hope that people in the silk industry in our country can abandon their individual self-interest and take the welfare of the national economy and all the people of East Asia as the premise, and coordinate with the advanced forces of the Allied countries under the supervision and guidance of the wise authorities to seek the rational development of the silk industry.
