Japanese War Science's New Weapon

Optical Lenses

The launch of giant cannons and torpedoes, and the power of aircraft bombing, often rely on precise periscopes, aiming devices, rangefinders, and other scientific activities. These are the "eyes" of weaponry, and optical lenses are their lifeblood. The battle area at sea will continue to expand in the future, such that in naval battles, ships are already firing before sighting enemy vessels. How can one discover the enemy at such long distances and seize the key to victory by preempting them? Here, the mission of the "eyes" of weaponry becomes increasingly important, and the glorious mission of optical lenses is increasingly emphasized.

In the current war, what is particularly noteworthy is that in the naval battle between Britain and Germany, the German battleship Bismarck was able to sink the British Hood, entirely thanks to the rangefinder. Looking back at historical precedents, in the Battle of Jutland in the North Sea during the First World War, the British army was superior to the German army, but still faced a difficult battle in the opening stages because the British army did not have rangefinders as good as the German army.

Without optical lenses, merchant ships transporting important materials would be blind to submarines; surveillance posts defending the Japanese mainland from air raids would not be reliable; and photographic records would be impossible to take. Therefore, optical lenses can even be said to be the "eyes" that determine the survival of a nation. The whole world is now devoting all its efforts to research in this area. Previously, Germany had a monopoly on research in this field, and the manufacturing methods were kept secret. However, in Japan, thanks to Mr. Takamatsu's more than 20 years of dedicated research, an unprecedented two-ton large crucible (furnace) has been completed, opening the door to the mystery of optics.

After leaving school in Taisho 10 (1921), Mr. Takamatsu entered the Osaka Industrial Experiment Station of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, where he was known among the young apprentices as a stubborn scientific fortress and was appreciated by the then director, Dr. Shoji.

The term "optical lens," as the name implies, indicates that refraction, dispersion, and other properties are important. Due to the differences in the values of refraction and dispersion, more than one hundred and dozens of different optical lenses are produced. The required precision even reaches four or five decimal places. If the product has an inaccuracy of one in ten thousand, even the best gunner's shots will be in vain.

Now, let's look at the manufacturing process successfully researched by Mr. Takamatsu. The first step is to carefully select clay, knead it, and dry it to make a crucible. Then, various main raw materials of glass, such as silica, are crushed, mixed, and melted in the crucible. When it's almost ready, a very fine sample of violet glass is taken for inspection, and then a rough selection process is carried out, discarding any non-homogeneous parts without hesitation. At this stage, one already feels heartbroken, as it has taken nearly a year of hard work, and the yield is only about one-fifth of the total melt.

At this time, the cost of producing a rough blank for a telescope lens three feet in diameter is 100,000 yuan. The cost of ordinary unpolished lens blanks is also considerable. Conducting a trial diagnosis in a melting-in-the-cell-unit crucible costs as much as 1,000 yuan. In order to save resources and money, he worked continuously day and night for as long as a week without rest. Less than a year after starting the research, Mr. Takamatsu fell ill and was forced to take three months of rest, but in reality, he did not truly rest. During this time, he constantly pondered how to complete the research on optical lenses.

The crucible radiates an intense white-hot light. Using one end of the stirring rod, he stares intently at the changing temperature and viscosity in the molten glass for one hour, two hours, three hours... six hours. This laborious stirring work is more than just a technique, a fusion of mind and body, as if reaching a world of inspiration. Researchers pay close attention to even the smallest bubble in the glass liquid, just like in a battle line amidst a hail of bullets, treating the test tube as a gun. With such a dedicated spirit, overcoming the above difficult conditions, they create products with a crystal-clear clarity, like the ice on the summit of Mount Fuji. These are accurate and sharp weapons, "divine weapons of science," beyond the reach of Britain and the United States.

In Showa 9 (1934), the "Asahi Prize" of this newspaper was proudly displayed on the pyramid built by Mr. Takamatsu. Mr. Takamatsu is not complacent with this. The times urgently demand a rapid increase in the production of high-quality optical lenses. So, trial after trial... By the time the China Incident broke out, Mr. Takamatsu's great achievements were truly astonishing. At that time, Takamatsu was already the head of the third department of the institute and had created a two-ton-capacity crucible. Any country would be satisfied with creating a crucible larger than one ton, who would have believed this was even possible?

In Showa 15 (1940), an independent department—the sixth department—was established to manufacture excellent lenses that could spot the enemy from afar. At the same time, the experiment station continued to conduct research in the field of optical glass.

Now, Mr. Takamatsu is the director of the institute. He says to people:

"This is not entirely my personal achievement. Dr. Shoji's assistance and the cooperation of the staff were of great help. The record of this two-ton crucible has not yet been written. Soon, we will definitely be able to do the same as Germany. The United States has not achieved anything in optical lenses and is desperately researching radio measurements to compensate."

In these humble words, he implies that the future of optical glass research is still fraught with difficulties, and we must continue to strive. (Sho: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, April 17)

The Emperor of Manchukuo Will Inspect Andong

Xinjing, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) According to an official announcement here, His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo will soon inspect the Andong region of South Manchuria, and inspect the area's administrative, educational, civic affairs, and sites of the Russo-Japanese War. Since the founding of Manchukuo, His Majesty the Emperor has personally visited Fengtian, Jilin, Binjiang, Longjiang, Mudanjiang, Jiandao, Jinzhou, Sanjiang, Xingbei, Xingdong and other provinces. This tour of Andong proves the prosperity of the national fortune of Manchukuo and the consolidation of the northern defenses. The people of Andong are deeply honored to learn of this news, and the people of the whole country are rejoicing.

Andong, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) The Emperor's current inspection of Andong Province is of the central region of Manchuria's industrial development. Recently the province has been involved in the development of underground resources along the Eastern Border Area, hydroelectric power construction on the Yalu River, coastal industries, and projects like the Dadong Port. The progress is quite obvious. Currently needed materials such as alcohol, aluminum, asbestos, mica, and metals have already reached substantial production levels. In addition, the power plant built using the rapids of the Yalu River is now generating millions of kilowatts, becoming a major power source for the heavy industrial region and transportation construction in southern Manchuria. Recently, the Huanren Power Plant in Yizhou will also be completed. Moreover, the industries of textile, paper, cement, shipbuilding, light metals, and carbon each have an annual production volume of hundreds of thousands of tons. Furthermore, the sericulture production has reached 70% of the nation's production. If it is reorganized and consolidated to rationalize management, it will grasp the reins of sericulture. Other industries include salt production.

Fighting in Northern Thailand. Burmese Air Raid Downs Two Enemy Planes.

Bangkok, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Thai troops have recently been very active in the northern region. The Supreme Command of the Thai Defense Forces announced on the 1st that a Thai army patrol clashed with a unit of enemy troops near the north of Manbao in Saharat Thai Doem on April 2nd. As a result of the battle, the enemy left several corpses behind and fled. We suffered no losses and captured some weapons.

Burma, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - On April 11-17 and May 1-5, enemy planes flew in to bomb Meiktila and Rangoon. Our fighter squadrons immediately took to the air to intercept them, shooting down two enemy fighters and severely damaging another.

A Perspective on the Soviet-Polish Severance of Relations

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Since the severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland, the United Kingdom, the United States, and other anti-Axis countries have been greatly affected, and the lack of unity within the anti-Axis camp has also been exposed. According to informed sources here, since Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov notified Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Romah, on the 26th of last month that the Soviet government was severing diplomatic relations with the Polish government, the United Kingdom and the United States were greatly shocked. Therefore, on the 27th, there was a meeting between Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, Foreign Minister Raczynski, and British Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Minister Eden. At the same time, in addition to instructing the US Ambassador to the UK, Winant, to contact the UK, Roosevelt also held a conference with Churchill by direct telephone. Therefore, the extent of the blow to the United Kingdom and the United States can be seen. The Soviet Union and Poland previously had disputes over the issue of future national borders. Now, one wave subsides and another rises. With the outbreak of this latest issue, the two countries finally severed diplomatic relations. From the UK's point of view, without Soviet cooperation, the anti-Axis countries have no hope of victory. Therefore, even if it knows what is right and wrong, it has to support the Soviet Union. However, the UK has a good relationship with Poland. In its previous declaration of air warfare against Germany, the UK solemnly stated its assistance to Poland. Therefore, its position is also quite difficult. However, because the UK values the Soviet Union's current position in Europe, as a result, the UK may do everything possible to reorganize the Sikorski cabinet and seek coordination with the Soviet Union. On the other hand, the United States has always stood on the Atlantic Charter, and therefore has always expressed its support for the Polish government. This is another seed of opposition between the UK and the United States. In summary, the Soviet-Polish severance of diplomatic relations can be said to be a concentrated manifestation of the contradictions within the anti-Axis camp. In this regard, the following points can be mentioned: (1) The Soviet Union's independent position in the war has become clear, and the contradiction of the UK's war aims is becoming increasingly profound; (2) The divergence of interests between the UK and the US regarding Soviet policy is becoming more and more obvious. In addition, we can imagine that this incident will cause the following various situations: (1) the destruction of the Atlantic Charter; (1) the overt involvement of the United States in European policy; (1) the intensification of domestic chaos in the United Kingdom; (1) the desertion of the UK by the Polish government-in-exile and other small countries. However, this Soviet-Polish severance of relations may be forced to end with the reorganization of the Sikorski cabinet and other remedial measures. However, given the fundamental opposition between the Soviet Union and Poland, and the fundamental difference in war aims between the UK, the Soviet Union, and the US, the increased gloom in the future of the anti-Axis camp is an undeniable fact.

President Roosevelt Intervenes in National Miners' Strike

Orders Secretary of the Interior to Seize Striking Coal Mines, Urges Workers to Dedicate Themselves to Wartime Service

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington last night, President Roosevelt yesterday ordered Secretary of the Interior Ickes to immediately seize all striking coal mines, because 500,000 US miners have gone on strike to demand higher wages or lower food prices. According to the latest figures, there are 523,000 workers in the striking mines, of whom 480,000 have gone on strike. Whether anthracite coal miners are also included in the above figures has not been specified. It was previously reported that the total number of strikers exceeded 570,000, including 70,000 anthracite coal miners. President Roosevelt, in view of the great crisis threatening national wartime production and bringing all coal production to a standstill, has decided to deliver a speech to the nation on the radio at 10:00 PM tonight. The White House has announced that the President will deal with this matter with drastic measures.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt, in his handwritten order to Secretary of the Interior Ickes to seize the striking coal mines, also ordered the same action to be taken for mines that are brewing strikes. At the same time, he ordered Secretary of War Stimson to take actions deemed necessary to protect the coal mines and workers. The content of his order to Secretary of the Interior Ickes is to immediately seize the striking mines and all individuals and real estate, privileges, equipment, funds, and other assets related to the operation of the mines. If deemed necessary, he may operate the mines to ensure they do not obstruct the war effort. In addition, he authorized Ickes to execute all matters related to the production, sale, and distribution of coal, and to provide necessary protection to those returning to work and those seeking work. The military has been ordered to prepare, and some have already moved into the mining areas. Secretary of the Interior Ickes, after receiving the order, has the power to deal with all possible disturbances, but it is expected that there will be no serious disturbances. President Roosevelt, after reviewing the situation, issued a statement saying: Except for a few coal mines, coal production has virtually come to a standstill, and national interests are in great danger. This strike is directly hindering the progress of the war. He is now calling on all striking miners to immediately return to the mines and work for the government. The country needs their service as much as it needs the soldiers holding guns. He firmly believes that all workers are patriotic and will not lag behind others. He has no intention of hindering the war effort, and after this call, he will quickly respond to the call and resume his wartime duties. Secretary of the Interior Ickes has now ordered 3,400 bituminous coal companies to appoint government managers for each mine, selected from among the employees of each company. Each manager must swear to be a representative of the US government. However, Ickes' order stipulates that the mines will continue to be operated by the current employees, and these employees will retain the right to group discussions and other mutual aid.

The President of the United Mine Workers, Lewis, after learning of President Roosevelt's actions, refused to criticize, but then issued a statement expressing his opinion. Lewis's opinion has a significant impact on the national spirit before the strike is resolved. Yesterday, the US Senate will discuss the full range of labor disputes, and Senator Connally will introduce a bill to ban all strikes during wartime. The results of subsequent developments may give the government more control over all workers. According to a brief dispatch from Washington, the bituminous coal miners in Missouri and Kansas are currently working as usual. Director of the Office of War Information, Davis, admitted that based on his week-long investigation, he believes that the workers' wage demands are quite justified, because food prices have increased significantly, especially in the mining areas.

America's Largest Steel Mill Has Only Four Days of Coal Supply

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - Washington news that due to the impact of the national coal mine strike, the largest US Steel Corporation in Pittsburgh may be forced to shut down. It is reported that the company has only four days of coal supply, and the supply of other steel mills can only last for one month.

Beijing Correspondence

North China is Central China - A Deep Impression

The atmosphere in the area called "North China," encompassing Pingjin (Beijing and Tianjin), Qing, Ji (Hebei), Yu (Henan), Lu (Shandong), and Jin (Shanxi) provinces, has been somewhat different lately. This unusual atmosphere is reflected in the general psychology.

In the past half-month, North China has suddenly been honored by the visits of many important figures. The first was Mr. Chen Gongbo, President of the Legislative Yuan and Mayor of Shanghai Special Municipality. Mr. Chen arrived in Beijing from Japan via Manchuria on April 14th, stayed in Beijing for four days, and flew back to the capital on the 18th. The second was Mr. Zhou Fohai, Vice President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government. He flew to Beijing from Manchuria on the 19th, the day after Mr. Chen left Beijing. He stayed in Beijing for a week, and did not leave for the capital until the 25th. In between, General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, also arrived in Beijing.

"So many top-tier Chinese and Japanese dignitaries have come!" People from all walks of life are discussing this. The quiet old capital suddenly became excited, and this excitement naturally contains political and economic factors.

So what has been given to North China? Let's give a comprehensive overview of everything related to this.

(1) The Starving Tianjin and Beijing

Since the end of January this year, the cost of living in North China has suddenly risen sharply, especially for food and daily necessities, which have increased many times over. The inflationary trend only slightly subsided in April, the most recent month. In the past two to three months, the two largest cities in North China, Beijing and Tianjin, have experienced unprecedented starvation and terror. This terror is manifested in the following ways among all levels of society:

(1) The propertied class is desperately hoarding food. The price of food also increases day by day with the rush to buy, and even the price difference between the morning and afternoon is extremely high.

(2) Small families and salaried employees with incomes below the middle class live in panic. Most employees of small institutions and elementary school teachers pull rickshaws at night to supplement their income.

(3) Hungry people wandering the streets are everywhere. Therefore, incidents of grabbing food occur anytime, anywhere.

(4) Rickshaw pullers dragging passengers are prone to fainting on the street and never waking up again, because their stomachs are empty and they are exhausted. According to investigations, in March, 200-300 people in each of the cities of Beijing and Tianjin die every day due to starvation.

The above are only the phenomena in large cities. As for the countryside, it is even more tragic. In Tangshan, about 30 li north of Beijing, residents are using grass roots, grass seeds, and tree bark as food. Shandong is better, but in some places in Shanxi, Henan, and Hebei, even grass roots and tree bark have been eaten up.

At the meeting of provincial and municipal officials in North China last month, because all the proposals focused on the food problem, a certain director smiled and said: "Last year's proposals at the meeting of provincial and municipal officials focused on the problem of public security, and each official's slogan was "As long as public security is maintained, everything can be solved." This year's slogan in the meeting is: "As long as there is food, everything can be solved." If the common people continue to starve like this, I am afraid that they will die, flee, and become fewer and fewer. By next year, the slogan of the meeting of provincial and municipal officials should be, "As long as there are people, there will be a solution." Although this is a joke, the severity of the food shortage as the biggest problem in North China can be imagined.

Although the North China authorities have long been aware of the seriousness of the food shortage and are studying solutions, increased production policies are too slow to solve the urgent problem. We must think about the source of food. The first source we thought of was Xuhai and Central China. In addition to grain, the lack of other materials, such as cotton cloth, soap, leather, and other manufactured daily necessities, is also becoming increasingly serious. Therefore, in general, there is an increasing hope in the central government for food relief and material exchange.

(2) Central North China

Since the end of March this year, Japan has fulfilled its promise to return the exclusive concessions in China, and the strengthening of the National Government to promote China's independence and autonomy has been realized. How is the National Government strengthening itself? This is naturally a matter of concern to all Chinese people, not just North China. At this juncture, Presidents Chen and Zhou, as special envoys visiting Japan and Manchuria, arrived in North China one after another, and general observations suggest that this should have a great connection with the implementation of the National Government's strengthening policies.

After arriving in Beijing on the 14th, Mr. Chen Gongbo was busy with social engagements. It wasn't until 5:00 PM on the 17th that he met with reporters at Qin Zheng Hall in Zhongnanhai. Among his remarks, the following three points were most noteworthy: (1) Regarding politics: "The Republic of China, whether in the present or in history, is a whole and cannot be divided into North China, Central China, or South China. We should integrate the human and material resources of the whole country and contribute to the Greater East Asia War." (2) Regarding economics: "Regardless of north or south, economic exchanges must occur, and food is just one part of the economy." (3) Regarding foreign affairs: "The stability of Greater East Asia cannot be considered complete simply by defeating Britain and the United States. The new responsibilities require further close cooperation and efforts between China, Japan, and Manchuria to build it."

Mr. Zhou Fohai, after arriving in Beijing on the afternoon of the 19th, met with reporters and made a very frank statement. He said, "Regardless of east, west, south, or north, all forces in the country should be integrated into the central government in order to make a strong contribution to the Greater East Asia War. North China is the Central North China, and the Central Government is the Central Government of North China. The National Government will do its best to provide relief for the food problem, material exchange, and the financing of transaction funds in North China."

The words of Mr. Chen and Mr. Zhou are exactly the same. The general public's observation that the two men are here to carry out the mission of strengthening the National Government is more affirmed. At the same time, because both men have said that the Central Government has decided to do its best to relieve the food problem in North China, the price of grain in Beijing and Tianjin actually fell from stable to falling in those few days. The trend of people's minds can be seen in general. However, on the other hand, Mr. Chen's remarks about foreign affairs made the general public feel that the new responsibilities of the Chinese people, especially the people of North China, are heavy, and their hearts seemed to be much heavier.

(3) Rumors and Facts

After Chen left and Zhou came, many rumors suddenly occurred in Beijing and Tianjin. To sum up, there are the following categories:

(1) The nature, organization, and personnel of the North China Political Affairs Commission will change.

(2) The state of health of Zhu Shen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, and the question of his successor.

Not long after these rumors occurred, Chairman Zhu Shen held an expanded tea party for Chinese and Japanese dignitaries in the garden of his private residence on the afternoon of the 23rd, personally socializing among the guests. Although his jaundice had not healed and his face was thin, he was able to support himself for an hour and a half. A day later, on the day before Mr. Zhou Fohai returned to the south (the 24th), the North China Political Affairs Commission announced the successful completion of the north-south rice transport negotiations and the specific measures. All newspapers published this on the front page in large print. Mr. Zhou Fohai flew back to the capital on the day this good news was published. Regardless of the rumors, the starving Pingjin and the grain-starved North China, since the arrival of Chen and Zhou, can be said to have a way to alleviate hunger and understand the benefits of "North China is the Central North China." Regardless of the national government's evolution or the North China Political Affairs Commission's own problems, the common people only pay attention to how to fill their stomachs. This is the number one priority.

Tunisian Front: Axis Forces Firmly Hold Original Positions, Lake Achkel Becomes a Natural Barrier, and the Important City of Mateur Is Easy to Defend and Difficult to Capture

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the military special correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency: The anti-Axis forces are again intensifying their pressure at several points on the Tunisian front, apparently still trying to carry out their breakthrough plan in the central sector. The French rebel forces in the northern coastal area have advanced several kilometers eastward, and the long-inactive US Second Army has also made slight progress after hard fighting, but this is not of major strategic significance. Even if the French army can advance to Lake Achkel, it should not be regarded as a major threat, as the 15-kilometer-wide lake is an excellent natural barrier, and the narrow land between the north bank of the lake and the Mediterranean coast, with the heavy artillery of the Bizerte port fortress, is very easy to defend. South of the lake, the Axis line forms a salient westward, and the anti-Axis forces must overcome six fortified mountains to reach Mateur. At its current rate of advance, the US Fifth Army will take weeks to advance unless it receives reinforcements. However, General Anderson may concentrate all of his reserves on his northern flank, so a resolute attack on Mateur may become a serious threat, but so far, the British First Army has shown no sign of shifting its main force to the left flank. In the central area of the western front, from Djebel Mansour to Djebel Anng, the situation is roughly as follows: The German army made local attacks in the area north and east of Mejez el Bab on Friday (which cannot be regarded as a counterattack) and has improved its positions. In the area west and south of Pont du Fahs, there was only small-scale fighting on Friday. The French army, with the assistance of US tanks, made an enveloping attack, hoping to advance towards Djebel Zaghouan, but it failed due to a strong counterattack by the German army on the flank of the anti-Axis forces. The anti-Axis forces suffered a serious blow and were driven back to their original positions. In the adjacent Djebibina area, the left flank of the British Eighth Army was quite quiet the day before yesterday, and its artillery was very active after the arrival of newly arrived ammunition. Whether this intensive bombardment of the Axis mountain positions northwest of Takrouna and Enfidaville is a prelude to a large-scale attack or merely a feint is still difficult to say.

Franco-German-Italian Relations Enter a New Phase: Laval Returns to Vichy from Paris, Reports on Meeting with Hitler

Paris, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - French government leader Laval had previously held talks with Hitler at the German headquarters. Having completed his mission, he returned here yesterday. He then held a press conference on the 1st, saying that the relationship between France and Germany and Italy has entered a new phase as a result of the talks between the three countries. At the same time, France's future position and its relationship with the Axis will also be determined by this. Therefore, the French people should recognize this fact, and any domestic policies that are contrary to foreign policy will inevitably be prohibited. Although France has not yet joined the Anti-Comintern Pact, it has a full understanding of the conspiracies of communism. Therefore, in order to eradicate this threat, we should form a common front with the Axis countries, he said. It is also reported that Prime Minister Laval left for Vichy at noon on the 1st to meet with Marshal Pétain to report on the results of the three-nation talks.

Spanish Head of State Arrives in Seville on Southern Tour

Madrid, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to German news agency reports, General Franco and his entourage arrived in Seville on Saturday evening, and will stay at the Alcazar for a short time and travel to nearby cities, departing on May 10.

Madrid, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Spanish head of state, Franco, who is touring the southern part of the country, arrived in Cordoba yesterday. Accompanying him are his wife and the heads of his military and civil cabinets, General Grande and General Aquila, Minister of the Army Asensio, and Minister of the Air Force Guilez.

Soviet Army Offensives Repelled by German Forces

Berlin, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German News Agency, quoting the Supreme Command, stated that the Soviet army's attempt to break through the German defense line at the Küpen bridgehead yesterday was repelled. The enemy troops who landed north of the bridgehead were annihilated.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Soviet army on the northern front launched a counteroffensive on the 30th, but it appears to have been completely repelled by the German army. The frontline news received here is summarized as follows: (1) The Soviet army began attacking the German positions in the Orel region on the morning of the 30th in the rain. When the Soviet troops launched their first attack with the support of ten tanks, they were soon repelled due to the fierce fighting of the German grenadier units. Two hours later, they attacked the German positions again with the cooperation of tanks, but the German army completely destroyed them on the front of the defense line. (1) On the Homber River front southeast of Leningrad, the Soviet army launched an attack with a large number of troops on the 30th in order to recover the territory occupied by the German army. It is reported that the German army also repelled them.

Finnish Commander-in-Chief Goes to Switzerland for Treatment, Rumors of Resignation Are Untrue

Helsinki, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - The news reported by Reuters and the Associated Press that General Mannerheim had resigned as Commander-in-Chief of the Finnish army was solemnly denied by officials here yesterday. It is said that these rumors were caused by Mannerheim's visit to Switzerland for treatment.

Speculation on the Reason for the Soviet Ambassador to the United States Returning Home: Preparing for a Meeting between the Two Giants, or Related to the Soviet-Polish Dispute

Buenos Aires, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a dispatch from Washington, Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, decided to return home to discuss important matters with his government, and planned to hold talks with the British government heads in London.

Stockholm, 2nd (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to American newspapers, if Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, visits London on his way back to Moscow, the Washington diplomatic community will not be surprised. The topic of discussion in London will be possible close cooperation between Moscow and the new or reorganized Polish government. A spokesman for the Soviet Embassy in the United States today denied reports that a new Polish government would be established in Moscow at Stalin's request. If there is a Polish government in London that is suitable for the Soviet government, the Soviet government will be very satisfied. The ambassador's return home this time cannot be assumed to be entirely due to the Soviet-Polish dispute. An important reason for his trip may be to prepare for a meeting between Roosevelt and Stalin.

Sweden Strictly Adheres to Neutrality

Stockholm, 1st (Central News Agency Telegram) - Swedish Foreign Minister Hantsson issued a statement on the May Day Labor Day, reaffirming the country's policy of strict neutrality. He said: "Although Sweden's neutrality is on the verge of danger, it must be firmly adhered to. It is rumored that Sweden will be dragged into the whirlpool of war, which is purely fictitious. It must be known that the Swedish government's strict adherence to neutrality will be understood and respected by all belligerent countries. Therefore, we are also determined to strictly adhere to this neutral policy and never change. However, if our territory is invaded, we will do everything possible to resist it.

### Public Opinion and People's Participation

Yesterday's commentary listed the importance of "human harmony." For a government to strengthen its political position and achieve a healthy state, it must first possess the condition of "human harmony." Humans are sentient, have personality, and have consciousness. Especially, our people have a stronger sense of conservatism. Whenever a new thing occurs, they tend to hold a distrustful attitude at the beginning, observing very cautiously. They will not easily agree until their psychology changes. The ancients said, "It is easy to conquer a city, but difficult to conquer the heart," further illustrating the difficulty of "winning people's hearts," that is, the difficulty of luckily obtaining "human harmony."

However, the more difficult it is to obtain by luck, the more it must be strived for. Here, we must recognize that to strive for human harmony, we must first value the inviolability of "personality" and "consciousness." Therefore, we must never adopt coercive means to force compliance. Because the hegemonic method can only achieve temporary results on the surface to a certain extent, and in essence, it cannot avoid "outward compliance but inward discord." Only when the government's every move is for the benefit of the country and the happiness of the people, and when it invigorates itself and treats others with sincerity, will the people "be sincerely convinced" over time. This is the way to strive for substantive "human harmony," the way of the king.

There is no need to shy away from, nor should we shy away from, the fact that our country still has remnants of division today. Our National Government is working with friendly Japan to advance on the path of destroying Britain and the United States; while the Chongqing regime is willing to be seduced by Britain and the United States, stubbornly resisting. However, as we observe the current situation, Britain and the United States themselves cannot stand firm, especially their aggressive forces in East Asia are almost completely driven out. Therefore, the Chongqing regime has become an orphan at the end of its strength. However, we do not regret the stubborn self-destruction of a few people in the Chongqing regime; rather, we must liberate the people who are still under their rule. Just as Chairman Wang Jingwei declared, "...We cannot forget the majority of our compatriots in Chongqing who are shackled, and we must liberate them and make them stand with us...." Therefore, how to use the way of striving for "human harmony" to make the compatriots under the rule of Chongqing unanimously return to our fold is a major responsibility of the National Government. By that time, the Chongqing orphan, without the support of the people, will no longer be able to continue the stubborn resistance.

We deeply believe that the government authorities have long recognized the importance of "human harmony," and a few leaders have made many efforts. Today, we are more willing to conduct a thorough review from a practical point of view, as a goal for tomorrow's efforts:

Since Chairman Wang Jingwei initiated the peace movement in its early stages, most people, when suffering from the ravages of war, had no understanding of the peace movement, and therefore held an attitude of worry, suspicion, and fear, which was also a matter of course. At that time, the psychology of the people can be summarized into two trends: The first is that they have firm prejudices, without considering whether the peace movement is possible, and blindly tend towards the psychology of Chongqing. The second is that they believe that the peace movement is what they seek day and night, but they lack faith. Therefore, they adopt an attitude of not paying attention to and ignoring the National Government, and have a psychology of sitting and watching the changes. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and until the recent changes in Japan's policy towards China, these two psychologies have also changed accordingly, and have been completely changed. They can also be summarized into two types: One is that they gradually turned from pessimism to disappointment with the Chongqing regime. The other is that they have come to understand, accept, and strengthen their belief in the peace movement. The most obvious and common change in these two psychologies before and after is that the peace movement has changed from a view of indifference to a recognition and belief that it must be possible. Although the change that promoted this is the movement of the Greater East Asia War and Japan's new policy towards China, the government authorities' various efforts and their painstaking efforts are even more admirable.

We believe that this change in the psychology of the people is the beginning of the government's efforts to strive for "human harmony," and it is necessary to make good use of this "beginning" as a starting point to expand to completion. At the same time, it is particularly important to recognize that since the people have fundamentally changed their psychology towards the peace movement, and recognize it, accept it sincerely, and have faith in it, then they will naturally show more concern for the government's every move. This expression of concern can be reflected in the public opinion of the people, providing a bright attitude of supporting the government for fear of being insincere, and supervising the government for fear of being lax.

Our newspaper, standing in the position of public opinion, has always strived to communicate the will of the government and the people and promote the interests of the country and the people as its core direction. Therefore, government orders and public opinion within this scope are expressed in speeches with a sincere heart. We believe that this is our responsibility and will never take into account unreasonable reactions. If there are a few people who have misconceptions, limited by their personal emotions and interests, and point to our speeches as propaganda that is beneficial to the Chongqing regime, we are not surprised by the ignorance of right and wrong of such people; but we cannot but solemnly correct their misconceptions.

We believe that what the Chongqing regime is most worried about and most afraid of is the people's understanding and concern for the Nanjing National Government; in other words, the Chongqing regime most hopes that the people's psychology will ignore and not care about the Nanjing National Government. And we further believe that all public opinion related to the government is a sincere expression of the people's love for the government. If there is no public opinion that cares about the government, then it is inevitable that the people are the people, and the government is the government, and they are not related to each other. How can we talk about participating in the war against foreign aggression? Therefore, all wise governments must not dislike public opinion, and further, they must not only value public opinion, but also give the people the opportunity to participate in politics and jointly discuss national affairs.

In the past, the people cared about the Chongqing regime but did not care about the Nanjing National Government; now, the people care about the Nanjing National Government and are disappointed and pessimistic about the future of the Chongqing regime. The key to this lies in the change in the psychology of the people. The National Government must promote political reform, put politics on the right track, and guide the people's psychological beliefs to become more firm. And public opinion and people's participation are the two major forces for promoting political reform. The government should sincerely accept them and give them development. If the people of a country do not care about politics and do not tell the truth, then the people of this country are no different from the people of a colonial country, and this country will not become a modern country. Therefore, we must first have a modern country that gives the people the opportunity to speak, and then have the substance of a modern government that reforms politics. The revival of the country and the well-being of the people can be hoped for!

### Fierce Fighting in Jin, Yu, and West Hebei; Japanese Troops Make Repeated Progress; Lingshou and Pingshan Counties Under Siege

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a telegram from the Jin Province front line on the 2nd, the Japanese army in Jin Province, in response to the 15,000 Communist troops of the Fourth Military Sub-district of the Jin-Chahar-Hebei Border Region's attempt to infiltrate the mountainous area of western Hebei, secretly attacked them on the evening of April 19. They immediately surrounded Lingshou and Pingshan counties, the Communist troops' bases. At 10:00 AM on the 20th, the Japanese troops launched a fierce attack, completely defeating them. The Communist troops' headquarters and various Communist troops' agencies were also thoroughly destroyed. Up to the 16th, the Japanese army's achievements were as follows: 43 engagements, 5,320 Communist troops casualties, 316 Communist troops captured, 518 Communist troops killed, 23 Communist troops facilities destroyed. The Japanese army seized 4 heavy and light machine guns, 9 mortars, 618 mortar shells, 8 grenade launchers, 7 automatic rifles, 77 pistols, 5,056 hand grenades, 717 land mines, and a large number of other munitions. In this campaign, the Japanese army only suffered 6 casualties.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here, the Japanese army has launched large-scale operations in North China since the middle of last month. In the south, they fiercely attacked approximately 80,000 of the Yu [Chongqing] faction's "24th Army Group" and Communist troops entrenched in the Jin and Yu provinces. In the north, they swept away approximately 15,000 Communist troops active in the Jin-Chahar province. In just half a month, these Yu and Communist troops have been completely defeated. The overall results of the battle before April 28 were announced by the Dai Ben'ying [Imperial Headquarters] on the 1st. According to reports, this operation is the largest operation since the previous Central Plains Battle. The Yu and Communist troops abandoned as many as 5,000 corpses. This is truly due to the Japanese army's skillful tactics. At the same time, the correspondent emphasizes that since China's participation in the war, the internal Yu [Chongqing] faction has suddenly shown signs of wavering and has already displayed that the Yu [Chongqing] faction's will to resist has long been lost. This can be confirmed by the defection of Sun Dianying, commander of the "New 5th Army," and his troops. Among these soldiers, there are hundreds of officers from senior cadres down to junior officers. Furthermore, the Japanese army captured a large number of military supplies, including 19 various artillery pieces, 6,000 light and heavy machine guns and rifles. Therefore, this operation has dealt a significant blow to Chongqing. Furthermore, after this operation, the security of various places has become more consolidated. The Chongqing's camp of resistance, under this heavy pressure, has further accelerated its collapse.

Tokyo, 2nd (Central News Agency) – The main senior generals of the Yu army captured by the Japanese army in the Taihang Mountains are as follows: Sun Dianying, commander of the Yu's New Fifth Army; Yang Ruxian, deputy commander; Feng Yangtian, chief of staff; Ji Ji, secretary-general; Hou Guanwen, commander of the transport regiment; Yang Shouchong, commander of the replenishment regiment; Wu Ruiting, commander of the 24th Division; Wang Yanqing, commander of the 3rd Division of the New Fifth Army; Wang Yueying, commander of the 4th Division; Hou Ruyong, commander of the guerrilla detachment of the 40th Army; Yu Guanghui, deputy commander of the 4th Independent Advance Column of the Hebei-Chahar War Zone; Yang Zhixi, director of the general staff; and Wu Changheng, staff officer of the 24th Army Group.

Taiyuan, 2nd (Central News Agency) – According to a certain person here, after the Japanese army launched a fierce attack on Da Dong Yaoji in southern Shanxi, the operation proceeded extremely smoothly. In addition to the defection of Sun Dianying, commander of the Yu's "New 5th Army," and other cadres and officers, there were also 1,400 corpses left behind. The army group of Pang Bingxun in the "Hebei-Chahar War Zone" suffered a crushing blow in this attack. In total, within ten days, the Japanese army killed and captured 20,000 Yu troops. After Sun Dianying defected to the Japanese army, he immediately declared that he would sever relations with the Yu faction and support the National Government. At the same time, he also published a "Letter to the Cadres of the 24th Army Group," urging his comrades to quickly stop resisting, support the National Government, and support the policy of national reconstruction. After the letter was sent out, the morale of the Yu army was greatly shaken, and the sentiment of breaking away from Chongqing became even stronger. This operation by the Japanese army has achieved great results in both strategic and political terms. Therefore, it has a profound impact on Chongqing. Moreover, after the launch of this operation, millions of people in the Jin, Hebei, and Henan provinces who were under the oppression of the Yu faction were able to escape from the water and fire and enter under the rule of the National Government. Furthermore, the development of important resources in this region will also have new developments. This region has long been known as the "granary," and in the future, its industrial connection with various cities along the Jinghan [Beijing-Hankou] Railway in Henan province will become even more active, allowing farmers to increase production.

### Commander-in-Chief Hata Returns to Nanjing After Inspecting the Town and Yangzhou County's Clean-up Campaign

### Mayor Zhang of Hankou Issues a Statement in Nanjing

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) – Recently, Mayor Zhang of Hankou and his party came to Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Wang and present 1 million yuan in national defense donations from the people of Hankou. The reporter believes that this move is very meaningful, so he visited Mayor Zhang. Mayor Zhang said that the government resolutely joined the Greater East Asia War, and its sole responsibility is to share part of the obligations of friendly Japan. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is neither the exclusive investment of a certain country in East Asia, nor can any national be allowed to stand by idly. At the same time, in terms of the strength of the war, military force is indeed the main force, but the coordination of economic power is also very necessary. In the past, our people have suffered from the fierce poison of British and American aggression. During this period of revenge, everyone should bear the obligation of contributing their strength, contributing their money, and contributing their money. Wuhan was the birthplace of the revolution in the past, and it is now the forefront of the peaceful region. The citizens of Hankou, considering the heavy responsibility borne by the Central Government in this participation in the war, first fulfill the obligation of contributing money before contributing their efforts. Therefore, two months ago, the people of all circles organized the Hankou Special City Support the War Assistance Association, which was divided into three groups: propaganda, fundraising, and condolence, to carry out their work separately. The first step has already been taken by the citizens to voluntarily raise 1 million yuan in national currency, which will be presented to the government first, in order to contribute a small amount of effort. The quantity is obviously too small, but if all parts of the country can continue to respond, the combined force will be huge, or it will be enough to share the burden of the government and share the labor of one ten-thousandth for friendly Japan. Then this move will not be in vain.

Correcting the bleakness of the storm, the warriors died. Retracing your forthright words, you were understanding and knowledgeable.
