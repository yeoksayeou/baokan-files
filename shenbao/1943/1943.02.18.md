### Protesting to the British Empire Regarding Gandhi's Fast

For the past few days, we have been feeling extremely uneasy because Mr. Gandhi, the "Mahatma" of the Indian nation in Asia, has been fasting for over seven days.

Mr. Gandhi is already 76 years old, and this is his sixth anti-British fast. Why is Mr. Gandhi fasting again, causing such spiritual unease among us Chinese people? This is because Mr. Gandhi and the 350 million Indian people behind him are engaging in heroic acts of resistance against British imperialism in order to seek liberation, which is enough to make us admire them. Although we have never had the opportunity to interact with Indian nationalist activists, Mr. Gandhi's revolutionary spirit and the significance of the Indian nationalist movement often move us.

British imperialism has ruled India for over two hundred years, and it has also ravaged China for a hundred years. Now, China has declared against British imperialism. However, the final victory must be achieved by all the nations of Asia uniting to completely eliminate British imperialism. India, with whom we have the longest historical friendship, is still under the direct rule and devastation of British imperialism. Mr. Gandhi, the highest leader of the Indian nation, is using his "self-sacrificing" spirit, with fasting as a weapon, to expose the last mask of Britain and save 350 million Indian compatriots! The historical relationship between the two countries of India and China, and the common anti-British task of the two countries, cannot but move me and make me spiritually uneasy. This uneasiness is partly due to our concern for Mr. Gandhi's health and partly due to our concern for the future of Indian national liberation.

This time, Mr. Gandhi's fast is using his own sacrifice, in front of 350 million Indian compatriots and 1 billion Asian compatriots, to tear off the mask of British imperialism for the last time and take the jewels from the crown of the "British Empire" and return them to the Indian nation. We know that during this war, Britain and the United States jointly announced the so-called "Atlantic Charter," mainly to declare that this so-called anti-Axis war was to oppose aggression and to ensure that all nations would be treated equally after the war. However, in reality, they have not abandoned their determination to engage in imperialism in the slightest, and they have not allowed India's liberation. Their attitude since last August towards the Indian National Congress's demand for "British to quit India" has fully exposed the hypocrisy of the Atlantic Charter and further exposed their hideous face of continuing to enslave and exploit India. Mr. Gandhi and other leaders, the most beloved leaders of the Indian people, have been arrested by Britain, and bloody suppression has unfolded throughout India! And now, Mr. Gandhi is demanding unconditional release through fasting, but the British rulers are still turning a blind eye. To what extent their "ruthlessness and heartlessness" has reached cannot but increase the hatred of every Indian, and us Chinese, and even all Asian people, towards British imperialism! Mr. Gandhi's fast has not only called on 350 million Indian compatriots to unite, but it must also have called on 450 million Chinese and even 1 billion East Asian nations to unite and fight against British imperialist policies!

According to recent newspaper reports, the Governor-General's Office of India has admitted that Mr. Gandhi's health has deteriorated after the fast. We cannot help but be more anxious about this! We want to solemnly point out that damage to Mr. Gandhi's health is damage to the Indian nation! Damage to the survival of 350 million Indian people! The British imperialists' disregard for Mr. Gandhi's statement is also a disregard for the lives of the entire Indian nation. Every Indian, every sympathizer of the Indian national revolution, must raise the most serious protest to the British government and the Governor-General's Office of India for the sake of Mr. Gandhi's health and for the sake of the survival and independence of the Indian nation. We have a Chinese saying, "Many mouths make gold!" It is also said, "Where sincerity penetrates, metal and stone will open." The protests of 1 billion people in East Asia will surely win the final victory!

Finally, in the capacity of Chinese supporters of the Indian national independence movement, we would also like to offer a little advice to our Indian revolutionary friends: From this fast of Mr. Gandhi and the attitude of the British government, it can be seen that the British imperialist policy of oppressing India is consistent. It does not matter whether you are Gandhi, Nehru, or Jinnah. Its enslavement and exploitation extend to all Indians and all weak East Asian nations. No matter the party, religion, or class, no one can escape the bullying, insult, oppression, and trampling of British imperialism! However, British imperialism is best at using cunning and treacherous means to exploit your differences in ethnicity, party affiliation, religion, and class to sow discord, so that you restrain each other, guard against each other, and cannot unite, and your strength cancels itself out. Then it can do whatever it wants. Therefore, I sincerely ask the friends of the Indian national revolution to see through the sinister schemes of British imperialism from now on. Everyone must disregard ethnicity, party affiliation, religious belief, and class relations. As long as everyone urgently needs to be liberated from the shackles of British imperialism, they should understand, sympathize, join hands, unite, and cooperate with each other without any suspicion. As long as the Indian nation itself unites more firmly and at the same time struggles together with the East Asian nations, our final victory is about to come!

Mr. Gandhi's fast is not for a certain party, a certain religion, or a certain class, but for the independence and liberation of the entire Indian nation. Mr. Gandhi's fast has reached a dangerous stage. Are we still indulging in suspicion, making trouble over religion, class, and party affiliation? No! We cannot! The entire Indian nation must unite! The Chinese and Indian nations must unite! The entire East Asian nation must unite!

Commentary

### Transfer of Enemy Assets in China to National Government Management

The Japanese government, through Ambassador Shigemitsu on the 8th, notified the National Government that it would transfer the management of a portion of enemy assets in China, belonging to Central and Northern China, which had been seized after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, to the National Government. The procedures were completed on the same day.

The fundamental policy of abolishing unequal treaties in China, as stated in the Konoe Statement and the Japan-China Basic Treaty, had already been established, and it was materialized when the National Government declared war against Britain and the United States on January 9th. As a result, China and Japan fully cooperated in military, political, and economic aspects to consolidate the decisive battle posture. Prime Minister Tojo also mentioned this at the time. The two countries strengthened their vow to share life and death in advancing the common goals of completing the Greater East Asia War and building a New East Asia. The Anglo-American ideology of binding China's rights and interests for a century was finally eliminated. With China's autonomy and independence and the full exercise of the National Government's political power as strengths, the construction of a new China is within sight. The abolition of unequal treaties and the handling of enemy assets in China are natural developments of the aforementioned situation.

The development of China, centered on the National Government, since mid-January has been far more rapid than the progress made in the two years since the conclusion of the Japan-China Basic Treaty. First, from a foreign perspective, overseas Chinese in Malaya and Sumatra were previously allowed to remit funds back to the country, and overseas Chinese in the Philippines can now enjoy the same rights. Second, domestically, there are countless examples of demarcations centered in Wuhan and North China. For example, in Wuhan, in addition to the establishment of a controlled economy office, the circulation of the old legal tender has been prohibited, and the resumption of business of the branches of the Bank of Communications and the Bank of China will soon be implemented. As for the smooth situation of the reserve certificates in purchasing materials in Central and Southern China since last spring, there is no need to elaborate further. In North China, the North China Political Affairs Commission, which was reorganized on February 8, has essentially become a part of the National Government, and its laws are promulgated by the National Government as implementing regulations. In addition, the appointment of Chairman Wang as the honorary chairman of the New People's Society is also noteworthy.

Due to the advancement of the power of the National Government, it is a natural sequence to transfer over a thousand enemy assets in China, such as schools, hotels, entertainment facilities, and factories in Shanghai and Tianjin, to the management of the National Government. The military authorities in China, whenever they have an opportunity, return the factories they manage to the Chinese people, which makes a great contribution to strengthening the National Government and tightening the ties between Japan and China. However, in order for these measures to achieve real results, it is hoped that the National Government will exercise self-respect, and it is hoped that the general Chinese people will have a clear understanding of this.

### Sequence of Abolishing Extraterritoriality

Since the Japanese government concluded a treaty with the National Government on January 9 to abolish extraterritoriality in China, what has been of greatest concern to Japanese people in China and even people in the country is the abolition of extraterritoriality, and in what sequence will it be implemented? It not only has a direct and significant impact on the lives of hundreds of thousands of Japanese residents in China, but also has a significant impact on the future development of Japanese people on the mainland. This concern was reflected in the questions of committee members in the parliament on the 10th. Aoki, the Minister of Greater East Asia, replied to this by saying: "The implementation method will be decided by the special committee of the two countries. The right to tax will be implemented before extraterritoriality." He clarified the policy held by the government authorities.

Generally speaking, extraterritoriality in China includes various rights such as consular jurisdiction, inland navigation rights, taxation rights, and police rights. To abolish all of them at once, considering the state of preparation for recovery by the National Government and the current living conditions of Japanese residents in China, is difficult to implement simultaneously. Therefore, when implementing the abolition of extraterritoriality, the actual situation of both parties should be carefully examined, and confusion that can be avoided should not be caused. The National Government must start with the easiest to implement and abolish them in order.

Therefore, the question becomes which right should be abolished first. After examining it from various angles, it seems that abolishing taxation rights first is the most appropriate. Why is this? Because not only is it easy for the National Government to take over this taxation right, but it will not cause unnecessary confusion and will yield real benefits. The relevant authorities have previously stated the policy of starting with the abolition of taxation rights. This is probably also based on this reason.

The Military Affairs Commission of the Second National Military Conference, in order to implement the purpose of strengthening the military, convened the First National Military Conference in March of the 30th year of the Republic of China in an official capacity. Internally, it sought to advance national power, and externally, it joined hands with advanced friendly nations to advance and face the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, friendly nation Japan has used the power of its army, navy, and air force to eradicate the evil forces of Anglo-American aggression in East Asia and has achieved great results. In order to ensure the fruits of the war and complete the war aims, it is even more necessary to continue the struggle in the future. The National Government, in view of the progress of the current situation and the importance of its responsibility, proceeded from a shared adversity and made the determination to share life and death, and declared its participation on January 9, assisting friendly nations and defeating the common enemy. Based on this meaning, the Military Affairs Commission convened the Second National Military Conference, gathering senior generals of the army, navy, and air force to discuss major plans together, focusing on how to strengthen the national military power during the war and how to ensure the security of the rear during the Greater East Asia War, and to strengthen training and equip troops in order to be able to share the responsibility of killing the enemy and achieving results on the front lines. All these major efforts have been studied. All of us comrades-in-arms must follow orders and fulfill our duties with a spirit of bravery, diligence, perseverance, and hard work. The war for China's freedom and equality, and the realization of the construction of East Asia's co-prosperity, are in sight. We swear to die without changing this. We hereby declare this to the public. Second National Military Conference

Representative Qi Dudu delivered a reply: I was ordered to attend the meeting, and I am very grateful that all the proposals and reports were approved and adopted. I understand the instructions given by the Chairman very well, and I will strive to implement them immediately. After returning to the defense area, I will immediately convey them to my subordinates and abide by them in order to live up to expectations. Especially at this time when the Greater East Asia War is in a decisive battle and our country is beginning to participate in the war, we should work even harder to live up to the Chairman's expectations. I hereby reply respectfully, and I ask for your consideration.

Ambassador Shigemitsu and Chief of Staff Kawabe Hosted the Generals Attending the Meeting

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Ambassador Shigemitsu hosted a banquet at his official residence yesterday (17th) at noon, inviting representatives attending our country's Second Military Conference. Those present included Xiao Shuxuan, Director of the Military Council of the Military Affairs Commission of our country and Acting Chief of Staff, Navy Minister Ren Yuandao, Qi Yanyuan, Commander-in-Chief of the North China Pacification Army, and generals attending the meeting. The guests and hosts toasted each other and wished each other good health. For a time, cups and plates were intertwined, showing a grand occasion. It ended after about two o'clock.

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Lieutenant General Kawabe, Chief of Staff of the Japanese China Dispatch Army, held a tea party at the International Club here at 4:30 p.m. on the 16th, inviting 80 Chinese generals, including General Qi Yanyuan, attending the Second National Military Conference of the National Government's Military Council. The gist of Chief of Staff Kawabe's welcome speech is as follows: Your country has declared war on the Anglo-American aggressors in order to share adversity with Japan and cooperate in completing the construction of Greater East Asia. This has added a distinctive color to the history of Greater East Asia. I am deeply grateful for the wise decision of your government authorities and the sincere attitude of your people. The Greater East Asia War has now entered a decisive stage. The one billion people of East Asia, centered on China, Japan, and Manchukuo, are now united and working hard to complete the war. The necessary resources have now all fallen into our hands. Strategic strongholds from Burma, Malaya, the East Indies, New Guinea, to the Aleutian Islands in the west have also been completed. Our posture of certain victory has been completely established here. The righteousness of our allied nations is also completely overwhelming the enemy. In particular, the achievements of German submarines echo the great land and sea battles in the South Pacific, and the United States has gradually failed in the war of attrition. Our war certainly has a bright future, which is something for all the nations of Greater East Asia to celebrate. Looking at the new China under the leadership of Chairman Wang, its recovery momentum can be described as thriving. Thanks to the efforts of the government and the military, domestic security is also improving day by day. The friendship between China and Japan has become even more solid. The resolution of the China-Japan case has also gradually been put on the right track, which is also something for both countries to celebrate. Furthermore, Japan is now using all its strength and is determined to move towards success. Therefore, I ask you generals to inherit your country's four thousand-year tradition, strive for your country's revival, lead the unity of the Greater East Asian nations, strengthen the belief in defeating the Anglo-American aggressors, guide your people, strengthen the training of your subordinates, and make them a truly revived Chinese military, do your best to ensure security and strengthen defense, so that China and Japan can join hands and devote all their efforts to completing the Greater East Asia War.

After Chief of Staff Kawabe's speech, General Xiao Shuxuan, the acting chief of staff of the Chinese government's military council, delivered a reply on behalf of the Chinese side. The main points are as follows: The Chinese government's military is working hard to advance, with the Chinese government's staff as an opportunity, and will firmly cooperate with friendly nation Japan to obtain the glory of engaging in the Greater East Asia War. With the belief of sharing adversity and sharing life and death, we pledge to devote all our efforts to achieve a comprehensive victory on both fronts. After we return to our defense areas, we will convey the opinions of the Chief of Staff to the entire army, so that the national army can create a brilliant record in the history of the new world with its spirit of struggle and magic.

### Zhejiang Province Mass Demonstration Supports National Government's Entry into War; Over 50,000 Participants, Minister Lin Attends and Addresses

Hangzhou, 17th (Central News Agency) Following the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States, the entire nation unanimously supported it. The Zhejiang Provincial Government held a mass demonstration at the Zhejiang Provincial Stadium at 9:00 AM on the 17th to support the entry into war and defeat Britain and the United States. The Central Government sent Propaganda Minister Lin to attend and address the assembly. Over 50,000 people participated, including representatives from the provincial and municipal governments, the Hangzhou County government, elementary school students, and various mass organizations. At 10:00 AM, the meeting was declared open, and formalities were observed. The chairman of the presidium, Governor Chuan, read the declaration of war and delivered the opening remarks. Afterwards, Minister Lin addressed the 50,000 attendees, elaborating on the essence of the National Government's entry into war, its historical inevitability, and the understanding that the Chinese people should have. This was followed by a speech by the Standing Committee member of the Provincial Party Department. After the speech, a representative of the people, Wang Wu, delivered a speech. Finally, slogans were shouted, and the meeting adjourned. The assembled organizations and people marched out in orderly lines for a demonstration parade.

Key Points of Propaganda Minister Lin's Speech

Today, I am in Hangzhou participating in the mass demonstration supporting the entry into war and defeating Britain and the United States. I deeply understand that all of you compatriots already have a clear understanding of the Greater East Asia War. We firmly believe that today, every Chinese person must not forget the blood debts of British and American aggression in East Asia and aggression in China over the past century. Let us shout in unison: "Down with Britain and the United States! Defend East Asia! Revive China!" To complete the war and achieve peace, we must be comrades-in-arms with our friendly nation, Japan, enduring hardship and being brave and divine. Why should we enter the war? Why should we be comrades-in-arms with Japan? These are things you already know. What I want to talk about is how to enter the war and how to be comrades-in-arms with Japan. First, we must achieve "sharing life and death." What does a defeated nation take to share death with a victorious nation? What does it take to share life with a victorious nation? Why would a victorious nation share death with a defeated nation? And why would it share life with a defeated nation? This is entirely determined by the common destiny of our two nations' histories, and it is entirely inspired by the spirit of Eastern morality. The Communist bandits slander and injure, claiming that the peace movement cannot be achieved. But now, the reality of Sino-Japanese peace is unfolding step by step before our eyes. Therefore, the Communist bandits, with sharp tongues, claim that the Sino-Japanese treaty is just a blank sheet of paper. Our friendly nation respects our sovereignty, aids our independence, returns the concessions, abolishes extraterritoriality, and even transfers the British and American enemy assets acquired by our friendly nation in the Greater East Asia War to us. Why does our friendly nation treat us so kindly? It is because of the spirit of morality and the determination to share life and death. We, deeply grateful for the kind assistance of our friendly nation, Japan, should make even greater efforts with greater sincerity to fulfill the responsibilities we should bear. We can only strive, strive to make ourselves worthy of being a comrade, worthy of sharing life. Second, we must achieve "total war effort." Supporting the entry into war and demonstrating is an expression that everyone should have, standing from the position of a citizen after the National Government issued the declaration of war. However, today we have reached the time for action, not just the time for expression. Entering the war is China entering the war; it is China and Japan fighting side by side. It is not the National Government entering the war and the people just supporting; rather, it is the people entering the war. The people of the whole country must put forth their full spirit and energy, making a total war effort. It is to bring together China's total strength and Japan's total strength to strive for victory in the war and to shoulder the construction of East Asia. We must use the four words "total war effort" as the goal of our efforts. How to make a total war effort? War requires military force. On the one hand, there must be military force to defend the front lines and charge into battle; on the other hand, there must be military force to consolidate the rear and ensure security. If we do not work hard in this regard, how can we say that we are sharing the burden of our friendly nation and fulfilling the responsibility of entering the war? This is one point. This war is a total war and a long-term war. What is needed for a total war and a long-term war is not just military force, but especially economic power. We should similarly put forth the strength of the whole country, not just the existing strength, but also increase even greater strength, and contribute it to the war of reviving China and defending East Asia. In addition to ensuring security, we must increase production, constantly develop strength, and constantly increase strength. Only in this way can we have the strength to defend East Asia, revive China, achieve peace, and improve people's livelihoods, allowing them to live and work in peace. This is the second point. This Greater East Asia War is not just a war of military force, nor is it just an economic war; it is also a war of power. We must not only eliminate the invasion of British and American military force, but also eradicate the invasion of British and American culture. We must thoroughly fight the East Asia War, and the task that the gods want is to contribute everything to the country and then to East Asia, sacrificing individual freedom to exchange for national freedom and the liberation of East Asia. This is the third point. In summary, to be comrades-in-arms with Japan, we must achieve "sharing life and death" and "total war effort." We must inspire the hearts of all our compatriots to love China, love Japan, and love East Asia, so that they are united as one. We must unite the conscience of our 450 million compatriots who love China, love Japan, and love East Asia as one heart. We must make the people of East Asia love their country, love each other, and love East Asia together with a unified conscience. This heart is the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War and the foundation for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As long as our 400 million compatriots still have this undying conscience, this is our strength to enter the war, this is the condition for invincibility, and this is the certainty that both countries will succeed and that Asia will win. Let us shout: "Victory in the Greater East Asia War! Long live Sino-Japanese cooperation! Long live Chairman Wang! Long live the Republic of China!"

This resolution has been broadcast to all parts of the world.

### Japanese Naval Authorities Clarify Military and Political Policies in Occupied Territories; Maintain Full Liaison with the Government; Closer Liaison with the Greater East Asia Ministry

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) Since the Japanese military has implemented military administration in the occupied territories in the Western Pacific, it has achieved results exceeding expectations. Regarding the army's military administration policies and current situation, the army authorities have already clarified them. On the 16th, the naval authorities also explained in detail the navy's military administration policies, organization, and current situation as follows: Because military administration in the occupied territories must adapt to local conditions, its methods and forms are different. The fundamental policies for implementation, from the perspective of governance and resource development, should be handled in a unified manner. The army and navy have fully established close liaison at the central level, and relations with the Greater East Asia Ministry are also being closely coordinated and adjusted in order to improve administration and avoid conflicts. The main points of the fundamental policies of military administration are listed as follows:

Military Administration Organs

In terms of governance, grasp the fundamentals of governance, make maximum use of the remaining governing institutions, and appoint local indigenous officials and civil leaders who are sincere and trustworthy to smoothly promote military administration. At the same time, respect past social organizations, religions, and national customs, etc., and do not interfere within the scope possible, in order to stabilize popular sentiment.

Regarding Development

For key national defense resources, strive to achieve results quickly, and maximize the abilities and experience of private businesses and merchants. Most undertakings are designated and entrusted to suitable persons by the central government for operation. Special ones are operated directly by the military, and some are entrusted to operate in the form of state-owned enterprises. In short, everything is aimed at adapting to the needs of rapidly promoting the war. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the economic life of the residents is bound to have some difficulties. However, within the scope that does not hinder the acquisition of national defense resources, we will do our best to provide relief and strive to maintain the necessary level of life. At the same time, according to overall policies, we will thoroughly make the natives understand the true meaning of the Greater East Asia War in order to increase their trust in the Japanese army.

Regarding Transportation

We will make the greatest efforts to enhance transportation and the transport of goods. We are currently planning to complete port facilities and rapidly promote shipbuilding, especially focusing on the construction of wooden ships.

Regarding Education

In addition to educating the people with existing religions, inherent beliefs, and social customs, we will also rapidly restore and enrich the schools of the natives in order to popularize and promote technical education. At the same time, we will popularize the Japanese language and Japanese culture so that they will fully cooperate with us.

Regarding Currency

Local currencies and military scrip are used in combination. We are currently planning to use currencies that can replace military scrip as soon as possible. As for the current situation of military administration, the natives fully trust our army and understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, expressing their heartfelt cooperation with the military administration. Public security is extremely good, and there is no anxiety in terms of governance. We pay special attention to the lives of the natives. Regarding economic development, the large-scale extraction of oil in places such as Borneo and the restoration of coal mines, as well as national defense resources such as cotton production in Sulawesi and the Lesser Sunda Islands, have achieved the expected results. In addition, the restoration of transportation, the enhancement of local transportation capacity, the adjustment of the financial system, and the vigorous promotion of development and reconstruction work are all explained in detail.

### Japanese Prime Minister and Greater East Asia Minister Clarify Attitudes Towards Thailand and Vietnam

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) Today, in the general budget meeting of the House of Peers, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki answered questions raised by Doctor Yamakawa Taneo, a member of the House of Peers. He asked what measures the Japanese government would take towards Thailand and Vietnam in order to make these two countries fully cooperate to complete the common mission of the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tojo generally said that Thailand had completed the authority necessary for an independent country since breaking away from British shackles, and it had joined hands with Japan to participate in the Greater East Asia War to defeat Britain and the United States. Japan has infinite respect for this and will naturally respect Thailand's independence. As for Vietnam, although it is in this complex and delicate world situation, it still expresses its attitude of cooperating with Japan. Japan also expresses its respect for this. Greater East Asia Minister Aoki generally said that when the Greater East Asia Ministry was established, the enemy took advantage of this issue to try to alienate relations between the countries of Greater East Asia, falsely claiming that the purpose of Japan's establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry was to treat the entire Greater East Asia region as a colony. In fact, Japan's policy towards the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia will not be changed in the slightest by this change in the organization. Japan's consistent policy is to respect the position and intentions of each country, and to hope that they will spontaneously cooperate to complete the common goals of the war and build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Since the establishment of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Japan has also strived to thoroughly make Thailand and Vietnam understand this intention. Japan has also transported necessary materials to its ally Thailand as much as possible within the possible range. Regarding the policy towards Vietnam, there is no change. Japan and Vietnam have already established an agreement to transport Vietnamese rice to Japan. Currently, various issues regarding the economic and political cooperation between the two countries are also proceeding smoothly.

### US Navy Department Bulletin Admits Losses in South Pacific Naval Battle; Two More Ships Sunk Not Yet Announced

Lisbon, 17th (Allied News Agency) According to Washington dispatches, the US Navy Department issued a bulletin yesterday, delaying the admission of the loss of the US cruiser Chicago, one destroyer, three motor torpedo boats, and 28 aircraft in the South Pacific from January 29 to February 4. It is found that the losses admitted by the Washington authorities this time still conceal the two battleships and four cruisers sunk and one battleship and two cruisers damaged in the naval battles of Rennell Island and Espiritu Santo on January 29, 30 and February 1, as announced by the Tokyo Imperial Headquarters. It is expected that the US side will continue to admit these losses. According to the US bulletin, on the evening of January 29, a US cruiser and destroyer team escorting transport operations near Rennell Island, a few miles south of Guadalcanal Island, was attacked by Japanese torpedo planes. The US ship Chicago was severely damaged by a torpedo and was towed by another cruiser. It was then handed over to a tugboat for towing. On the afternoon of the next day, January 30, the Chicago was attacked again by torpedo planes and sank as a result. On February 1, Japanese fighters and US aircraft engaged in combat, and two US aircraft were shot down. Ten more US aircraft were lost in the Guadalcanal area. In the afternoon, a Japanese dive bomber squadron, guarded by fighters, sank one US destroyer between Cape Esperance and Savo Island.

### German Radio Denies Changes in Military Leaders; Italian Newspaper Points Out that the Establishment of a Regency Council is also a Rumor Released by the Enemy

Medved, 17th (Allied News Agency) According to German radio broadcasts last night, Berlin firmly denied the rumors spread by London that German military leaders have been replaced. The broadcast said that Swedish and Swiss newspapers have carried London's rumors that the German head of state has handed over the supreme command of the German army on the Eastern Front to General von Manstein (the victor of the Battle of Sevastopol). Regarding this statement, responsible persons in Berlin declared that it was untrue and that it was a rumor arbitrarily fabricated by the British side, which unfortunately found an echo in the newspapers of neutral countries.

Rome, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Among the enemy rumors published daily in the Italian newspapers, one is a dispatch from Washington by the Caracas News Agency, stating that Mussolini is preparing to establish a regency council within the Fascist Party. This is a backup measure in case the Italian Prime Minister is forced to resign. The recent reorganization of the Italian government has seen the addition of many unimportant people, which is the preliminary preparation plan for the establishment of a regency council. As for the members of the regency council, they include former Minister of Justice Grandi, former Commander of the Fascist Militia Starace, and Generals Cavallero and Bastico.

Rome, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The Vatican stated that the claim that it is willing to receive a Soviet delegation is completely unfounded. There is absolutely no relationship between the Vatican and Moscow.

### Soviet Generals Promoted

Ankara, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Moscow dispatch, the Supreme Soviet has ordered the promotion of General Vasilyevsky to the rank of General.

### German Army Completes Retreat from Kharkov According to Plan; Donets Tank Units Enter Soviet Positions to a Depth of 20 Miles, Destroying Soviet Military Equipment and Storage Depots

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Military sources said last night that the German army's retreat from Kharkov City, which was carried out according to plan, has been fully completed. Before the German army completely withdrew, all important military equipment and supply stations were destroyed. A German army and assault troops were responsible for covering the retreat and have surrounded and annihilated several Soviet units.

Stockholm, 17th (Allied News Agency) The German army in Kharkov began to retreat yesterday, conducting street fighting to block the attack of the large Soviet army. However, the Soviet army paid a heavy price. According to indirect news from Berlin, in one day alone, Monday, the German army eliminated six Soviet rapid-fire divisions, three cavalry divisions, five tank brigades, and several special units in various key areas of the Eastern Front. Military sources in Berlin disclosed last night that the German army's retreat from Kharkov is about to be completed. During the retreat, powerful units of the army and assault troops provided cover and surrounded several Soviet units. When the German army retreated from Kharkov City, it thoroughly destroyed military equipment and supply lines. Yesterday, Soviet armored units entered Kharkov, and street fighting broke out. It is reported that the Soviet army attacked Kharkov City from three directions: the northwest, east, and southeast of the Drohobych area. According to announcements from Berlin, the German army in the Voroshilovgrad area repelled the Soviet army's advance, destroying 21 Soviet tanks and annihilating several Soviet cavalry units. German tank units in the Donets Basin industrial area broke into Soviet positions to a depth of 20 miles, destroying military supply depots and cutting off supply routes. In this battle, the Soviet army lost seven tanks. The German army downstream of the Don River acted according to its planned, and the Soviet army's attempt to intercept it failed and was heavily damaged. After the German army withdrew from Rostov, it repeatedly repelled Soviet troops who attempted to pursue them. On Monday, the German army counterattacked and destroyed 20 Soviet tanks. The German army downstream of the Kuban River in northwestern Caucasus again repelled the Soviet army's attack, destroying four tanks and about 30 vehicles.

Third Offensive on Lake Ilmen; Germans Discover the Plan and Prepare in Advance

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Winter is coming to an end, and the period when the ice and snow melt is not far off. At that time, the large-scale war on the Eastern Front will also come to an end. The Soviet command knows that the only chance for the Soviet army is in the winter, so before the winter ends, it is intensifying its pressure on the German army. According to observations by military experts in neutral countries, the mobilization of Soviet manpower has reached its saturation point this winter. However, whether this theory is correct remains to be verified. The Soviet command does not want heavy sacrifices this time and hopes to make some decisions in the war before spring arrives. Therefore, the Soviet army launched a third offensive south of Lake Ilmen yesterday, but it was repelled everywhere and suffered heavy losses. The situation on the southern route of the Eastern Front is roughly as follows: The pressure from the enemy north of Kursk towards Orel has intensified. The purpose seems to be to encircle the German army between Orel and Livny. However, the Soviet army did not achieve any success on Monday. The battle for Kharkov is now in full swing. The situation in the southwestern Donets Basin has not changed. This is strategically important. In the area east of the Donets and west of Rostov, the Soviet army occupied several cities without resistance, as the German army had planned to withdraw in advance to shorten its front lines.

The Japanese Akatsuki Unit-sponsored seaman training school in a certain place in India recently held an entrance ceremony. The Indonesian trainees, aged from sixteen to thirty-six, numbered 200 seaman. They wore white hats and yellow uniforms, undergoing rigorous training with high spirits.

### The Chongqing Regime's Encounters in the Northwest: Intervention in Xinjiang Arouses Resentment

(Dispatch from Taiyuan) The Chongqing side, in promoting its Northwest work, has encountered subtle friction with local Muslim residents. Xinjiang newspapers have also raised this issue, expressing growing discontent with Chongqing. A Uyghur-language newspaper published in Lanzhou, asserting the natural right of Xinjiang people to Xinjiang, offered the following critique of Chongqing's Northwest work, revealing the residents' resentment towards Chongqing, which is quite noteworthy:

"Chongqing's centralization efforts in the Northwest region focus on economic construction. However, Xinjiang is ultimately the Xinjiang of the Xinjiang people. Chinese officials coming here to carry out political work for the Chinese government, and the influx of many Chinese into Turkestan, require careful consideration of the relative benefits and drawbacks. Most of Xinjiang consists of mountains and deserts. The only irrigable areas are the three regions of the Ili River, the Mu River, the Gatta River, and the Ili River. If these are utilized, there may be some hope for agricultural development. However, in the eyes of Europeans and Chinese, agricultural development is absolutely impossible and must rely on the labor of Turkestanis familiar with local land affairs and customs. Ningxia, Gansu, and Qinghai have all been developed by Uyghur people with considerable success, which serves as clear evidence."

The above remarks imply dissatisfaction with Chongqing's work in Xinjiang. From this, one can glimpse the frustration in the hearts of the Xinjiang people, leading to resentment towards Chongqing. Previously, when Bai Chongxi visited Lanzhou, newspapers once wrote articles welcoming him. Subsequently, they repeatedly expressed dissatisfaction with the Chinese government's oppression of Muslims and neglect of Muslim education. Each time Chongqing advances into the Northwest, it invariably provokes local resentment.

Difficult Engineering, Hard to Develop

(Special Dispatch from Yuncheng) The Chongqing side, in order to prolong its survival, has no choice but to devote its efforts to developing the Northwest route in order to obtain supplies. Therefore, Yu and Chiang are single-mindedly begging for aid from the United States. Recently, the "Zhongyuan Xinbao" of Luoyang published an article on the current state of the Northwest. This is part of what Yu's news reporter An Dunli recorded after inspecting the extension project of the Longhai Railway. The article is quite interesting, and reading it allows one to understand a glimpse of the difficulty of developing the Northwest.

"Long-distance buses on the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway, except for military needs, have other transportation scheduled to run every other day. However, the Shaanxi Provincial Government and the Northwest Highway Administration coordinate and strictly inspect, so passengers must stay in Baoji for about ten days due to complicated inspection procedures. This seems to be a measure to prevent Communist personnel from infiltrating the Northwest. In case of rain, fog, or dew, it is difficult to distinguish the first journey, and there are many dangers, so even if it is scheduled to run, it can only be temporarily suspended. From Baoji, it is necessary to pass through 15 to 16 kilometers of the Qinling Mountains, which is very dangerous. It is not easy for cars to pass through here, and passengers are all alarmed. After about 20 kilometers, you reach the watershed. Although it is in the middle of October, the Qinling Mountains are already covered in white snow, and the cold is biting from afar. Therefore, this highway is closed in winter and can only be used for a few months of the year when the weather is good.

At noon, we arrived at Shuangshipu, which is the dividing point between the Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway and the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway.

The Xi'an-Lanzhou Highway is the most dangerous and accidents are prone to occur. The section of the Shaanxi-Sichuan Highway from Hanzhong to Guangyuan also needs to cross the treacherous Tian Mountains. In short, the Northwest route is full of difficulties. From Shuangshipu, the road gradually narrows, with cliffs on both sides and abysses dozens of feet deep underground. If you accidentally lose your footing, your life is in danger. After crossing this section, you enter Huixian County in Gansu Province. Huixian to Dashui is a distance of one hundred and eighty kilometers, the road is very wide and relatively flat. Recently, the city of Tianshui has been very prosperous, especially since August, when railway project workers have arrived one after another, so many new houses have been built. This place was originally for the import and export of raw lacquer and wood skins, but due to overly strict control, all but export goods are restricted, so herdsmen also have little benefit to gain. Since June 19th last year, a new electric light factory has been opened, but the electricity is extremely weak, not much brighter than an oil lamp. Qingshui is a difficult pass on the Longhai Railway extension project, and also the first important gateway through the Qinling Mountains. From Tianshui to Qingshui, it is about 130 kilometers. The current means of transportation are mules and horses, etc., but mules and horses cost 80 yuan each time, and sedan chairs are even more expensive, costing 160 yuan. The sedan chair carriers are all from Sichuan. The Sichuan people, due to the difficulty of life, come here from Yu and Rong to carry sedan chairs for a living. However, due to long-term malnutrition, most of them are emaciated, obviously struggling on the line of life due to financial pressure, and often fall ill on the road. Recently, this group of sedan chair carriers have mostly gone to work on highway construction sites. The lives of the people here are extremely miserable. Girls over ten months old mostly have no pants to keep warm, and bedding is also inadequate.

All of this is caused by the unreasonable control of materials. This place has never produced cotton. Usually, it relies on Shaanxi and Henan provinces, but recently, since it has been controlled materials, and transportation tools are all for military use, people's needs cannot be met, and cotton is even more scarce. Although many people make clothes with wool yarn, a specialty of Gansu Province, ordinary small cities cannot afford to buy clothes made of all yarn at 40 yuan a pound, so they all wear dog and sheep skins to work, just like people in the primitive age. Seeing this situation, I deeply feel that the Northwest region is still the Northwest of a dozen centuries ago, without an inch of progress. (Ren Zhi translated from the February 9th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### All Industries Begin Registering Inventory: Fair Allocation of Various Goods; Standard Price Limits Set According to Cost; Illegal Trading Exceeding Price Limits Will Be Severely Punished

In order to adapt to the current economic situation, trade associations in this city have separately launched "Goods Allocation Groups" in their respective industries, aiming to achieve reasonable allocation of materials and eliminate illegal hoarding, manipulation, and monopolies. Although the relevant authorities have already strictly controlled major commodities, speculative merchants still engage in illegal activities. Now, various industries, under the pressure of law, are planning reasonable allocation separately.

Inventory Registration

A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency inquired with various trade associations yesterday and learned that several trade associations have already established "Goods Allocation Bureaus," which are now being promoted smoothly. However, in order to achieve both control and relief, trade associations need to thoroughly understand the current inventory amounts of their members. Therefore, they have separately carried out inventory registration of member trades. Members must register according to regulations, with items including: (1) Business Name, (2) Address, (3) Total Inventory, (4) Types, (5) Purchase Price, (6) Selling Market Price, (7) Storage Location, (8) Purchase Date, (9) Whether Sold, (10) Other items.

Replenishing Sales

As for member trades that are retailers, efforts will be made to gradually increase the current goods needed daily for their stores, so as not to be short of goods to meet market demand. As for manufacturing trades, in addition to actively communicating with the relevant authorities to dredge the required raw materials, they will also be urged to gradually increase production. Regarding the fuel they need and other difficulties, trade associations will comprehensively plan on a unified front to gradually resolve them. However, according to news yesterday, trade associations still feel that there are some difficulties in the above points, so they urgently need the relevant authorities to provide practical assistance.

Setting Price Limits

While trade associations have successively established goods allocation groups, they have also established evaluation committees, inviting experts in the industry to participate and be responsible for evaluation work. After a certain type of goods is fairly allocated by the allocation group, the evaluation committee will assess and set standard price limits according to cost, list them in tables, and notify all trades to comply. At the same time, a document will be sent to the authorities for record. After the price limit is assessed, all trades must not violate it under any pretext and sell at prices exceeding the limit, otherwise, they will be severely punished according to regulations. The assessment of price limits for various industries must obtain the consent of the relevant authorities in advance and be given reasonable profits.

Strict Investigation

According to the Allied News Agency in this city, the authorities of the Public Concession and the French Concession, in view of the soaring prices here and in order to fundamentally control production and difficult distribution, are currently planning strict measures to investigate illegal merchants who sell yarn and silver above the limit, and are expected to impose fines.

### Qianzhuang Banks Fund Speculation; Price Increase Resurges

According to the authorities, when the old lunar new year was approaching last year, the various qianzhuang banks stopped lending loans to speculative hoarders without restrictions, and the rising prices temporarily stopped. However, after the new year, the various qianzhuang banks again funded black market speculators and arbitrarily raised prices, so the price increase surged again, disrupting people's living standards. Another reason for the high prices is that starting in October last year, speculators fabricated rumors, arousing the public to compete to purchase goods and hoard them, resulting in soaring prices, so speculators can take the opportunity to obtain huge profits. In the past, high prices were attributed to the imperfect purchasing and distribution system and insufficient control. However, the plans currently being prepared by the Japanese authorities, in addition to cracking down on illegal speculation, will also improve the above deficiencies.

### Jiading, Baoshan, Chongming: "Qingxiang" Campaigns Imminent

The third phase of the "Qingxiang" campaign in Shanghai will be expanded to the three districts of Jiading, Baoshan, and Chongming. In order to select specialized personnel, the "Qingxiang" Association is holding training for cadre personnel in various classes of Zuo Zhi, Bao Jia, blockade, and political work. Therefore, Su Wanyao, director of the Traffic Section of the Blockade Management Office, has been dispatched to Chongming to handle the recruitment and examination matters together with the district government.

### Japanese Consul-General Orders Enemy Nationals to Move into "Assembly Centers" by a Deadline; This Measure Is Only for Military Needs; Technical Personnel Are Still Allowed to Leave the Center Daily for Work

Hirota, the information director of the Japanese Embassy, confirmed at the news reporting meeting yesterday that the Japanese authorities will concentrate the British, American, and other enemy nationals currently staying in Shanghai at the highest speed. The Japanese Consul-General Yano issued a circular letter to each enemy national or household, ordering them to go to the designated location to assemble at the specified time, and then move into the "People's Assembly Centers" that have been arranged in advance. There are many such assembly centers, scattered in various places, some of which are far away in Wusong and Pudong. However, because there are many enemy nationals in this city, the concentration work has to be carried out in batches, generally single men first, followed by those with families, and finally women and children. It is expected that it can be completed within this month. According to Director Hirota, this measure by the Japanese authorities is only for "military needs" and is not intended to impose adverse treatment on enemy nationals. If specialized technical personnel are employed in public offices and their work cannot be replaced by others, they may be specially allowed to enter and leave the "assembly center" daily to maintain their jobs, even after moving into the "assembly center." However, this situation is very rare. As for other people, when entering the center, they can bring bedding, clothes, personal items, and tableware, etc., packed in small boxes or small bags, limited to four pieces. Furniture and other items must be left in the original residence and will be kept by the Japanese authorities in the future.

### Nanshi Held Health Inspection Yesterday; Areas Where Cholera Was Discovered Last Year Were Temporarily Blockaded and House-to-House Injections Were Administered

Recently, the weather has gradually warmed up, which is the vigorous period of spring epidemics. In order to eliminate the epidemic atmosphere and ensure the health of the citizens in the South District, the Nanshi Military Police, together with Wang Delin, director of the Nanshi Police Bureau, etc., specially selected areas where cholera was discovered last year to implement inspections and administer preventive injections from house to house yesterday morning. The areas inspected yesterday include Nanshi, Nan Zhong, Liang Wang, Yi Ma Lane, etc., which were temporarily sealed off. At the same time, similar events occurred in the Zhonghua Road and Xieqiao areas, in order to eradicate the source of cholera.

### Information Director Hirota Delivers Speech

Yesterday, Japanese Ambassador Hirota, information director, customarily hosted a group of Chinese journalists and refuted the groundless and absurd propaganda of anti-Axis forces. According to him, there is no doubt about the Japanese side's repeated victories in the naval battles of the Solomon Islands. In Europe, the military progress of Germany and Italy has also achieved unprecedented victories. However, recently, the British and American sides took the opportunity to land in Morocco and other areas of North Africa and exaggeratedly publicized it as a major event. Secondly, the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting in Casablanca, the publication of a joint statement, the visits of Chongqing envoys to the United Kingdom and the United States, and the various activities of Chongqing sending personnel to India for negotiations are actually a cover for failures. This kind of propaganda that does not compensate for the facts is sufficient to reveal their state of external strength but internal weakness. In contrast, the unprecedented victories of the Axis in the past can be estimated to be no less than ten to one. Moreover, the Axis of Japan, Germany, and Italy will exert even stronger combat power in future operations. The strength of the Soviet Union's counter-offensive this time has been used to its peak and will never be strengthened again. As for the United Kingdom and Chongqing, it is even less likely. Therefore, the United Kingdom, Chongqing, and the Soviet Union still dream of relying on American aid. Although the United States promised to provide support, under the Axis's crushing defeat of the American navy, whether it has the ability to fulfill it, the United States, in its statement in 1941, declared a large-scale build-up of the air force, building 50,000 aircraft. According to the United States' manpower, it is in a state of dispersing its forces, and its combat power is often difficult to increase, as well as building an army of 7.5 million to train, which is absurd. Even if it is completed, the transportation of funds and the allocation of support for combat will be difficult to obtain ships for a while. The American warships have been crushed by Axis submarines, and material resources have been greatly reduced. It is deeply believed that it has encountered major difficulties. The United Kingdom and the Soviet Union's plea for American aid is actually a dream, and it will be difficult to do in fact. Subsequently, Lieutenant Yantian of the Naval Authority briefly reported, and it was not until about 5 o'clock that it ended.

### Income Tax Office: Office Affairs Meeting Concludes

A total of 36 proposals in the tax policy section were classified and combined into 23 for discussion and approval. A total of 9 proposals in the economic section were combined into 3 for discussion and approval. Among them, the most important proposals concerning tax policy include the wartime promotion of the rectification of the income tax system, the increase in tax rates, the determination of tax revenue quotas, and the punishment for disobeying the declaration and payment of income tax, and the regulations are quite strict. The three-day meeting has been successfully concluded.

### Foreign Minister Chu Left Shanghai Yesterday

### Authorities Order Resumption of Business; Four Major Silver Shops Reopened; Strictly Enforcing the 3,000 Yuan Price Limit

Since the four silver shops, including Xinfengxiang, Laofengxian, Fang Wanxia, and Qiu Tianbao, were sealed up by the Materials Control Department of the Engineering Bureau for selling gold jewelry above the price limit, more than 60 Dahang and Xinhang shops in the city, including Yang Qinghe, Fei Wenyuan, and Yongfengyu, have automatically suspended business temporarily. The Silver Shop Trade Association convened an emergency meeting and resolved to send representatives to petition the authorities, requesting that the price limit for gold jewelry sales be relaxed in order to maintain business. It also immediately dispatched representatives to petition Chairman Yuan Lvdeng of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce and the Materials Control Department for relief, and stated the situation of gold jewelry sales in the silver shop industry.

All Silver Shops in the City Resume Business

It is heard that the authorities believe that the silver shops' unauthorized suspension of business is inappropriate and ordered them to resume business immediately. Since noon yesterday, silver shops in the French Concession, such as Baocheng, have completely resumed business after receiving notification from the French authorities. Silver shops in the Public Concession will announce the resumption of business from today. As for the sealed silver shops, such as Xinfengxiang, they have complied with the order to pay off the fines yesterday, and the Materials Control Department has removed the seals, so they are expected to resume business at the same time from today.

Request for Relaxation of Price Limit Not Approved

This newspaper reporter inquired with the silver shop industry and learned that the price limits stipulated by the authorities are: (1) the price limit for the sale of gold bars between gold industry members and trades is 27,500 yuan per bar, and (2) the price limit for gold jewelry sold in silver shop counters is 3,000 yuan per tael. On February 2, the silver shop industry requested the authorities to relax the price limit, arguing that the price of raw gold materials has exceeded 3,300 yuan, and the cost is high, so it is necessary to increase it with the market in order to maintain it, but it was not approved by the authorities at that time.

The Control Department Decides to Strictly Enforce It

The Materials Control Department has decided to strictly enforce the price limit of 3,000 yuan per tael for the sale of gold jewelry in the counters of various silver shops, and those who violate it will be investigated according to law. As for the four silver shops, Xinfengxiang, Laofengxiang, Fang Jiuxia, and Qiu Tianbao, which were previously sealed up, although they have paid off the fines and are allowed to resume business, they must absolutely not exceed the price limit after resuming business. Other silver shop counters must also follow the price limit for sale.

### Japanese Naval Administration Section: Handling Enemy Property

The Japanese Shanghai Naval Attaché's Office Reconstruction Department, which was dissolved on the 15th of this month, has already been reported. This department was established in August of the 26th year of the Republic of China, following the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident. Since its establishment, it has been responsible for organizing the residential areas of Chinese refugees in the Zhabei, Hongkou, and Yangshupu areas, protecting houses and land where owners were absent, as well as enemy property, and cracking down on illegal activities involving the above houses, land, and enemy property, as well as assisting Japanese residents. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it also handled the investigation and disposition of enemy property acquired after the Japanese army entered the concession. Furthermore, it mediated and resolved disputes arising from businesses opened by Chinese, Japanese, and third-country nationals within the naval garrison area. Currently, the Chinese refugees have returned, the reconstruction work after the street battles has come to an end, and public order has been established. At the same time, the Greater East Asia Ministry has been established. Therefore, the navy no longer needs to be responsible for mediating disputes and other such business. The department has now been dissolved. The newly established Supervisory Section will handle matters concerning enemy property and land/houses where the owners are absent within the naval garrison area, for which the navy is responsible. In the future, if any sector has any concerns regarding this matter, they can contact the Supervisory Section within the Naval Attaché's Office as before.

### Strictly Enforce Price Controls on Side Dishes
— Meng Yu

Regarding the enforcement of price controls on side dishes, there is still room for improvement. Here is a temporary plan, hoping that the authorities will pay attention to it.

(1) Establish a price control enforcement office in each small vegetable market in the city, appoint one person to preside over it, and assign two police officers to assist.

(2) Meat already has price controls, but vegetables do not. If the authorities can refer to the highest prices sold in each central market on the same day or the previous month, and then add a reasonable profit, a uniform and fair price control for vegetables can be set.

(3) The set price control for vegetables should be copied onto a large blackboard or whiteboard every morning by the staff stationed at each vegetable market and placed in a prominent location in each vegetable market.

(4) The staff stationed at each small vegetable market must accept citizens' reports regarding vendors exceeding price controls as much as possible. There should be separate regulations for punishment, so as to avoid the staff stationed at the vegetable market engaging in favoritism and corruption. For example, it can be stipulated that (A) first-time offenders exceeding price controls will be temporarily suspended from business for one day as a warning. (B) Repeat offenders exceeding price controls will be suspended from business for one day. (C) Third-time offenders will have their licenses revoked and permanently suspended from business. (D) If anyone refuses punishment and uses illegal means to deal with the stationed staff, the two assisting police officers will arrest them, send them to the police station, deduct their citizen certificates, expel them from the country, or take other severe measures.

(5) In order to prevent corruption by the stationed staff, establish another investigation agency to investigate the enforcement of price controls in each vegetable market every day. At the same time, write the address and phone number of the highest price control enforcement office at the stationed staff’s office, hoping that citizens will report irresponsible stationed staff.

(6) The lives of the stationed staff must first be stabilized, and rewards and punishments must be clear. At the same time, they are not allowed to accept gifts from vegetable vendors.

### Public Works Bureau Decides to Demolish Bund Statues Soon, Rename Roads Named After Citizens of Enemy Nations

Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the road names on this city’s Bund named after British and American citizens, as well as the statues, must be changed and destroyed in response to the demands of the people. The Shanghai Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association has spared no effort to promote road name changes and statue destruction for the past six months. It has sent several letters to the Public Works Bureau and jointly suggested prompt implementation to the Public Works Bureau with hundreds of Shanghai citizens including prominent Shanghai figures Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Binhe, Li Zulai, and Li Guohua. Now that China has declared war on Britain and the United States, there is no reason to allow the remaining traces of Britain and the United States to remain in the soon-to-be-recovered concession. In order to urge the implementation of road name changes and the destruction of statues and implement the association’s proposition, it specially sent representatives to visit the Public Works Bureau yesterday (the 17th) morning. The Director of the General Affairs Bureau, Noguchi, met with them. The representatives of the association stated their intentions. According to Director Noguchi, the Public Works Bureau has accepted the construction principles of the Anti-British and Anti-American Association regarding such issues and is currently considering concrete methods of implementation. He also said that it would be announced and implemented in the near future to comfort the wishes of the Chinese people.

Committee Formed for Special Study

Our newspaper reports that the Public Works Bureau held a meeting the day before yesterday (the 16th) and decided to accept the suggestions of the citizens of this city and the Anti-British and Anti-American Association to demolish the statues of Hart and Parkes on the Bund and change the names of roads named after citizens of enemy nations. For this reason, a small committee has been established, composed of Bordeaux, Toraji Nishikimoto, Tang Bingyuan, Wu Yunqi, and Zhu Boquan, to specialize in the implementation methods of Du Xiang's issues, hoping to realize it in the near future.

### Burmese Rice Harvest, Trying to Ship to Shanghai for Relief, Prices and Transportation Issues Under Consideration

Hirota, the Director of Information of the Japanese Embassy, ​​announced that regarding the supply of rice in this port, a large amount of foreign rice had previously been shipped from Thailand for relief. However, it is now reported that Thailand is suffering from floods and the situation is different. However, in Burma, the rice harvest has been abundant, so if necessary, rice can be shipped to Shanghai from Burma, but the authorities are considering the two major issues of price and transportation. The 27th term household rice is two and a half sheng, of which one sheng is broken rice, and one and a half sheng is white rice or brown rice. The so-called "white rice or brown rice" depends on the rice obtained by the rice store. If the rice store gets white rice, it sells white rice; if it gets brown rice, it sells brown rice.

This Term's Rations on Sale Today

422 rice stores in the Public Concession and 242 rice stores in the French Concession have completed the full extraction of the 27th term household rice from (1) Taikoo Wharf, (2) Asia Xing Wharf, (3) Zhejiang Xingye Wharf, (4) Mitsubishi Jiangxi Pier Wharf, (5) Huashun Wharf yesterday and can be sold from 8 am tomorrow.

### Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League Holds Meeting to Assist Gandhi's Release from Prison; All Indian Overseas Chinese in Shanghai Hold Hunger Strike Protest, Hold Prayers to Care for Health

Our newspaper reports that the Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence Movement League held a meeting at the Japanese Youth Association Auditorium on North Sichuan Road at 3 pm yesterday to assist Gandhi's release from prison due to hunger strike. More than 200 Indian overseas Chinese men and women attended. The person in charge of the branch, Chet Singh, Bobby, and Santra, attended and presided over the meeting.

Indian Overseas Chinese Hunger Strike, Chinese Side Expresses Condolences

The meeting was first opened by the Branch President Chet Singh, and Bobby was elected as the Chairman of the meeting. Then two matters were decided: (1) All Indian overseas Chinese in Shanghai will hold a one-day hunger strike on the 20th of this month to protest against the imprisonment and abuse of Gandhi by British imperialists; (2) Indian overseas Chinese will gather at the Indian Temple on Baoshan Road on the 21st to pray for Gandhi's health. Afterwards, Chen Binhe, the representative of the director of the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association, gave a speech to express condolences to Gandhi and expressed the Chinese people's concern for his health. Finally, the guest of honor Yoshida Toyosuke and representatives of the Japanese Youth Association successively gave speeches, expressing admiration for Gandhi's spirit and encouraging the Indian revolutionary movement. The meeting adjourned at 5 pm.

According to Santra, the person in charge of the branch, Gandhi is currently 76 years old, and this hunger strike is the sixth time. All Indians around the world are concerned about his health and hate the tyranny of the British. The independence movement branches in Burma, Saigon, Thailand, Malaya, Japan, and the Philippines will soon rise up in anger to rescue Gandhi from prison. He also said that there were 6,000 Indian overseas Chinese in Shanghai before the war, but now it has been reduced to 2,000.

Anti-British and Anti-American Association Expresses Sympathy

Since Mahatma Gandhi of India was imprisoned, the British government's oppression of the Indian independence movement has become even more serious, which is extremely hateful. In order to request an early release from prison, he has been on hunger strike for as long as seven days. The Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association expressed admiration for Mr. Gandhi's courageous and outstanding spirit and sent a letter to the Shanghai Indian Independence League yesterday to forward a telegram to the Indian representative expressing condolences from the Chinese people to Gandhi, who is on hunger strike. The original letter is recorded below, "Respected Sir, I have recently learned that Mr. Gandhi has been on hunger strike in prison for seven days for your country's independence and liberation movement. This kind of oppression of our East Asian nations is even more infuriating and hateful. I hope that your people will be of one mind and persevere in their struggle. The light is in sight and the future can be expected. Our association hereby sends a letter on behalf of the Chinese people to your association, requesting you to forward a telegram to India to express condolences to Mr. Gandhi, in order to express our respect. Sincerely, Shanghai Indian Independence League."

### Great Merchants and Scholars Care About Aiding Education, Serve As a Social Model, Extremely Sincere In Their Intention To Protect The Younger Generation

Yesterday, our newspaper continued to receive donations from all walks of life for the educational aid fund. The elder Qian Wenxuan aided education with his writings, the veteran of the Qian industry Feng Shouzhi established an educational fund in commemoration, and the great merchant Chuan Xiangcheng transferred his horse carriage fees to aid education. All of these are worthy of being social models. The details are as follows:

Accumulating Sand Into a Tower, Gathering Fur Into a Robe, Mr. Chuan Xiangcheng wrote in a letter, "Respected Sir, I recently read your newspaper about the detailed methods of the educational aid fund for relieving poor children. I am deeply impressed by your kind heart and kindness. Out of admiration, I will transfer the 800 yuan of horse carriage fees sent by the Dazhong Insurance Company to my late father, Nanxuan Gong, during his term as chairman in the 31st year, together with the 1,200 yuan of horse carriage fees from other companies, for a total of 2,000 yuan, to your newspaper as an educational aid fund for poor children. Although the amount is small, it is intended to form a robe. I hope that all benevolent gentlemen will work together to accumulate sand into a tower, which will not be without small benefits. Respectfully, Chuan Zhixiangcheng" Also, the Feng Shouzhi Public Education Fund Management Committee wrote, "Respected Sir, the late Cixi Feng Shouzhi operated the Qian industry in Shanghai for more than 40 years. He always took promoting education and helping the masses as his mission. He once allocated a part of his savings as an educational fund for the poor in his hometown, which was managed by colleagues. I recently learned that your newspaper has established an educational aid fund, which coincides with Mr. Feng's original intention of establishing the fund. Therefore, we specially allocated 1,000 yuan of Central Reserve Certificates from the above fund to assist your organization, in order to attach to the end of the horse's tail and to commemorate Mr. Feng's establishment of the fund. Please accept it."

Mr. Qian Aids Education With His Writings

Among the donations received yesterday, there was an aid fund of 500 yuan from Mr. Qian Wenxuan Shiqing, an old reader of our newspaper. Mr. Qian also favored us with ten copies of the Commercial Press edition of "Shiqing Complete Works", instructing us to sell them on his behalf (see attached letter). Mr. Qian held official positions at home and abroad in his early years, with remarkable political reputation. He once served as the supervisor of students studying in the UK and investigated educational affairs and politics in various countries. Later, he presided over the salt administration in various provinces and made many reforms. Mr. Qian's footprints have traversed famous mountains and rivers, and his writings are always related to economic and industrial affairs, which cannot be compared with articles of fleeting interest. In addition, Mr. Cai Songpo, Tang Yingeng, and Liang Rengong overturned the imperial system during the Yunnan Uprising. Mr. Qian personally experienced the event, and his descriptions are mostly unknown to outsiders, which can be used for historians to adopt. The complete book was praised by modern scholars such as Xu Shichang, Sun Baoqi, Yan Xiu, Chen Kuilong, Xu Shiying, and Tang Wenzhi as sufficient for modern history reading. Mr. Qian believes that our newspaper's educational aid movement is beneficial to society and is used for the aid fund. In addition to the aid fund, he is willing to aid education with his writings. The contemporary celebrity cares for the younger generation, and his sincerity is admirable. Mr. Shiqing's original letter is recorded below:

Ten Copies Of The Exquisitely Printed Shiqing Complete Works

"Respected Sir, in honor of my 70th birthday, I received poems and articles from relatives and friends. I should have prepared some refreshments to repay their kindness. However, due to the extraordinary times, I do not want to take any action. I specially donated 900 yuan in new currency to your newspaper's educational aid fund to benefit relatives and friends. I also donated ten copies of my book "Shiqing Complete Works", each with more than 1.2 million words, exquisitely bound in cloth with gold letters, printed on Daolin paper. The Daolin paper set by the Commercial Press originally cost 10 yuan and 8 jiao per ream, but now it has risen to dozens of times. I am now selling it at a low price of 60 yuan per copy. All the money from the sale will be donated to the educational aid fund. There are not many copies of this book currently in stock, and it is not sold elsewhere. This is a combined statement. The money is sent together. Please check and reply. Qian Shiqing"

In the Wuhan area, the association will plant 2,700 mu itself and lease 5,000 mu to tenant farmers. Regarding the increase in cotton production, there will be a new improvement method this year, implementing the "collective cotton planting system", that is, organizing farmer groups, roughly forming 1,000 units of this kind in Central China, with each unit planting 500 mu as the standard. The association will, through these groups, provide cotton seeds or subsidies to assist farmers who feel the need. The above-mentioned collective cotton planting system can be completed before the end of March.

### The Treasure Trove of the Greater East Asia: The Nanyang

— Voter

Business of Nanyang

The Nanyang region (Southeast Asia) holds a very important position in world trade and has long been a commodity market fought over by European and American imperialists. In 1938, the total import value reached US$495.9 million, with Malaya ranking first at US$188.5 million; followed by the Dutch East Indies at US$158 million. The combined amount accounted for approximately 74% of the total. The remaining were: the Philippines, US$76.2 million; Vietnam, US$32.4 million; Thailand, US$29 million; British Borneo, US$9.4 million; and Portuguese Timor, US$2.4 million.

Nanyang's total import value only accounts for approximately 3.5% of the world's total, which may seem small. However, compared to Asia's total import value of the same year, which accounts for 23.5%, and considering that Asia has a population of 1.1 billion while Nanyang only has 130 million, the former is quite considerable. The following table shows the individual import values of Nanyang countries and their respective positions in the world and Asia in recent years (unit: million US dollars):

The biggest feature of the Nanyang consumer market is its dependence on imperialism, and the fact that the imported goods are mainly industrial products, which fully demonstrates its colonial nature.

Regarding the former feature, except for Thailand, which is nominally an independent country, the Nanyang countries are all colonies of Britain, the United States, France, and the Netherlands, and their economic lifelines are all in the hands of the suzerain states. They mainly serve as consumer markets for the suzerain states' commodities. The Philippines and Vietnam are the most prominent examples. Taking 1938 as an example, 68% of the Philippines' total import value was accounted for by the United States, while 56% of Vietnam's total import value was accounted for by France and its colonies. Imports to the Dutch East Indies mainly came from Japan, but after the Sino-Japanese Incident, this trend changed, and the proportion accounted for by the Netherlands itself increased significantly, once accounting for 22%, ranking first. Although Thailand is an independent country, it is highly dependent on the United States due to its geographical and political location. However, since the Sino-Japanese Incident, its dependence on Japan has become increasingly apparent.

The following table shows the position of imports from the suzerain states in the total import value of Nanyang (unit: %):

Regarding the latter feature, the Nanyang region is generally still an agricultural region, and its industry is still in its infancy. Therefore, the demand for manufactured and semi-manufactured products mostly relies on countries such as Japan, Britain, the United States, Germany, France, and Italy. Manufactured and semi-manufactured products account for 78% of the total import value of the Nanyang countries. These are mainly cotton products, silks, rayon fabrics, general merchandise, machinery, processed food, etc. The following table proves this:

(Note) The numbers in parentheses indicate the percentage of the total import category.

The important commodities exported by the major powers to the Nanyang countries are: cotton products, iron, steel and their products, machinery, vehicles, chemical industrial products, and woolen products by Britain; petroleum products, machinery, vehicles, iron and steel materials and their products by the United States; chemical industrial products, steel and its products, machinery, and electrical appliances by Germany; fiber industrial products, steel, machinery, and chemical products by France; and cotton products, silk products, paper, machinery, yarn products, and general merchandise by Japan.

After the Sino-Japanese Incident, Japan's exports to Nanyang have declined significantly, and German goods have taken their place. After the Second European War, American goods rose to a dominant position. However, since the Greater East Asia War, the situation has changed. Everything in the Nanyang countries is demanding self-sufficiency and striving for development. This is truly a glorious and great era of national self-determination and self-government in the Nanyang region!

Note: Most of the statistical figures in this article are based on "New Knowledge of Nanyang" published by the Japanese Nanyang Economic Research Institute.

### Commodity Prices and People's Livelihood

Commodities—all concrete things—are the units that satisfy human desires, and commodity prices are the usual conditions for people to obtain goods. However, human desires are different, including luxurious desires, pleasurable desires? The lowest—and also the most important—is the desire to maintain life. Generally, those with the lowest desires have the weakest purchasing power. In other words, ordinary people who purchase goods merely to maintain their lives have a purchasing power that is generally imaginablely weak. Therefore, the relationship between commodity prices and people's livelihood is too close and too important.

As the editorial of this newspaper said on the 16th: in wartime, fluctuations and rises in commodity prices are inevitable in various countries. As long as the social organization is strict, the state's orders are implemented, and the people's psychology is stable, serious consequences will not occur. For the past six years of war in Japan, even for over a year since the war against the richest and most powerful Britain and the United States, no serious commodity price problem has occurred. This is the reason. However, in our China, the commodity price problem has created a few extremely wealthy people and posed a tremendous threat to the daily lives of the majority of the people. Of course, this is a major obstacle to stabilizing people's hearts during wartime.

Fortunately, the method of price limits on goods has begun to be implemented successively. For example, a few days ago, the four major silver shops were sealed up by the authorities for raising the listed prices of gold ornaments. Also, in order to lower the selling price of leather shoes, the authorities recently ordered all wholesalers and manufacturers in Shanghai not to exceed the selling prices on January 23 of this year. These are two clear examples of the authorities strictly prohibiting exceeding the price limits. This kind of vigorous approach is a definite manifestation of the authorities' concern for the people's livelihood during wartime. While feeling full of hope, we still have to look forward to the most ideal and most satisfactory result—the comprehensive price limits and reasonable control of people's daily necessities.

### New National Economic Commission Advisor Mr. Hirose Expresses Ambitions: Willing to Exert Full Effort to Strengthen the National Government's Finances

Mr. Hirose Keīchi, former director of the Kobe Customs Office, recently accepted an invitation from the National Government to serve as an advisor to the National Economic Commission. Accompanied by assistant advisor Mr. Yoshitake Hisaka, attendants Mr. Matsushita Hikojūrō, Mr. Kuroiwa Yoshinobu, and Mr. Arao Zenpei, he arrived in Shanghai on the 18th of last month and hurriedly went to Nanjing. A few days ago, he returned to Shanghai from Nanjing. On the 16th, he expressed his ambitions after taking office to reporters from the Continental News at the Tax Affairs Department of the Ministry of Finance on the Bund. He said that most of the National Government's agencies are in Nanjing, but the Tax Affairs Department and the Income Tax Department are both in Shanghai, with branch offices in Nanjing. This point proves how important Shanghai's position is in the National Government's finance and economy. Now that China and Japan are of one heart and mind, striving to defeat Britain and the United States, focusing on strengthening the National Government's finances is a basic work for building the Greater East Asia. In any country, those who serve in the government's tax revenue agencies bear a major mission in the country's finances. He is willing to contribute his efforts and fully assist Director Shao Shijun of the Tax Affairs Department, so as not to betray Mr. Shao's expectations. At the beginning of his tenure, he has no special ambitions to speak of. As Supreme Economic Advisor Ishiwata has said, the National Government's tax revenue is gradually increasing. China's tax system is centered on indirect taxes, while income tax is a direct tax with a short history and little revenue. Although extraterritoriality has been abolished, the indirect tax burden of Japanese residents has not changed much at present. Even without raising tax rates, it is expected that tax revenue can still be increased. Regarding the direct tax of income tax, there is a need for research. In order to promote work, he hopes that people from all walks of life will often provide guidance and direction, and he has high hopes for them.

Brief Biography of Economic Advisor Hirose Keiichi: Originally from Kagawa Prefecture, he graduated from the Department of Politics at Kyoto University in the 9th year of Taisho (1920). He has held important positions in the Ministry of Finance, Matsuyama Tax Office, Tamatsukuri Tax Office, Osaka Customs, Banking Bureau, Sapporo Finance Bureau Director, Nagoya Finance Bureau Director, and Kobe Customs Director.

### The Current Stage of Developing North China's Resources

According to the Continental News of the 17th, Mr. Bekkūya Kiyomatsu, director of the North China Development Company (Chinese name: Huabei Kaifa Gongsi), attended the Provisional North China Economic Symposium held in Beijing on the 15th and explained the current stage of developing North China's industries. The outline is as follows:

Coal

The recent coal production has increased by 50-60% compared to before the incident. Regarding its distribution and prices, reasonable and fair control measures are adopted based on the usage situation. Consumption in the producing area accounts for 55.9% of the total production, and exports to Japan, Manchuria, and Central China account for 36%.

Iron Ore

In addition to the Longyan Iron Mine in Jiachang, iron mines in Jinlingzhen, Likou in Shandong Province, Sijiaying in Jidong, and Shanxi are also being developed. At the end of last year, the North China Iron and Steel Plant was established. Taking advantage of the convenience of the producing area, it is believed that North China's iron and steel industry will surely develop rapidly in the future.

Other Mineral Resources

In addition to being used as refractory materials and abrasive materials, claystone can also be refined into refined steel and ore, making it the most valuable raw material. Gypsum is a raw material for ammonium sulfate and an essential substance for fertilizers. Last summer, the North China Nitrogen Fertilizer Company was specially established in Taiyuan, Shanxi Province to manufacture this product, which contributes greatly to increasing agricultural production and cotton production in North China.

Salt

The salt fields in Changlu and Shandong have the advantage of favorable weather and geographical conditions. In addition, with the improvement of technology in recent years, their production is considerable. Together with coal, they are one of North China's important resources. At the same time, the soda industry is being promoted, with many successes.

Cotton

All sectors have great expectations for the increase in cotton production in the north. Therefore, related parties are making their best efforts to engage in cotton planting, and the future is very promising.

### Cooperating to Control Commodity Prices

### Promoting Grain Control　Five Procurement Offices Established in Jiangbei

According to the Continental News of the 17th, Mitsui & Co. and other six major commercial firms have established a control headquarters in Zhenjiang in order to promote the control of wheat and miscellaneous grains in Jiangbei. It has also been decided to establish procurement offices in Gaoyou, Taixian, Yangzhou, Xinghua, and Shiying in order to ensure complete control. The controlled materials include wheat, barley, naked barley, and oil raw materials.

### Amidst Sharp Rise in Grain Prices in Beijing, the Authorities Implement a Rationing System

According to China Intelligence, grain prices in Beijing have recently been soaring, and the market price is already five times that of the same period last year. In order to stabilize the people's livelihood, the authorities have stopped putting grain on the market and instead distributing it through the Food Office. The amount of rations per person for ten days is as follows: first-class flour: 1.73 yuan per jin; second-class flour: 1.39 yuan per jin; rice: 0.19 yuan per jin; millet: 0.56 yuan per jin; corn: 0.49 yuan per jin. All prices are in joint banknotes, and the price is equal to half the market price, it is said.

### North China Economic Inspection Group　Arrives in Shanghai a Few Days Ago　Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry　Holds Banquet to Welcome Them

According to the Continental News of the 17th, the economic delegation to inspect Central China, jointly organized by the Beijing Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, the Beijing Railway Station, and the East Asia Travel Agency, led by Mr. Hatada Eitoku, a group of twenty-eight people, has already arrived in Shanghai. To express their welcome, the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry specially held a reception at the Japanese Club at 10:30 a.m. on the 16th. Vice-Chairmen Aoki and Takagaki, Managing Director Takeuchi, and various members attended.

The meeting ended at around 1:00 p.m. It is also learned that the inspection group is scheduled to go to Hangzhou on the 17th for inspection and will return to Beijing via Qingdao after the inspection.

### New York Stocks Plunge

Lisbon, 16th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from New York, the New York trading market yesterday saw a unanimous drop in most stocks due to setbacks suffered by the U.S. military in southern Tunisia.

### The Reviving National Government's Economy (Part 2)

3. Strengthening Joint Ventures:

Strengthening Sino-Japanese joint ventures is not limited to acquisition agencies; it is also necessary to implement it throughout production and distribution. In the early days of the incident, when the foundation of the National Government was not yet consolidated and it did not have the ability to revive various industries on its own, it was inevitable and necessary to some extent for Japanese enterprises to independently undertake the production, distribution, and acquisition sectors. However, it is only natural that the policy should be changed today, now that the foundation of the National Government has been consolidated and it is able to confront the independent Chongqing, Britain, and the United States. In any case, humans always plan for themselves first. Similarly, reviving China's economy is for the Chinese people themselves. Through the hands of the Chinese people themselves, it is possible to effectively mobilize China's human and material resources, as well as the current huge amount of 500 million to 700 million Shanghai floating capital, and apply them flexibly. Only in this way can the true essence of getting everything one wants be achieved.

To achieve this goal, the following matters must first be considered:

1. The branch companies in the Central China Revitalization Company that should be transferred to China should be transferred as soon as possible.

2. Raw materials and power must be distributed fairly to Chinese factories. At the same time, low-interest loans should be adopted to encourage production in terms of capital turnover.

3. Not only should Sino-Japanese joint ventures be strengthened by absorbing Chinese people into the distribution and acquisition agencies that have always been monopolized by Chinese people, but also active assistance should be given to Chinese operators.

Regarding these points, the military has first established a model. Ninety-six of the factories managed by the 140th Army have been returned to China and have become Sino-Japanese economic cooperation institutions. Since the National Government promulgated the declaration of war, eight more factories were returned on the 14th, further strengthening this step. In addition, in the private sector, the Central China Cotton Control Association and the Tobacco Distribution Association established last year have both Sino-Japanese parties equally allocated in terms of capital and personnel management. This has already demonstrated this position. At the same time, the adjustment of Central China silk, Central China salt industry, Central China urban public buses, Central China aquatic products, and other issues is being studied. Taking advantage of the National Government's participation in the war, it is planned to further strengthen Sino-Japanese joint ventures.

Of course, given the current situation, this kind of joint venture is still insufficient, and it is not easy to achieve it overnight. However, taking the opportunity of the National Government's participation in the war to make this step more concrete and clear is obviously the biggest key to reviving the Chinese economy. Therefore, while strengthening China's productivity in this way, efforts should be made to absorb Chinese capital for joint ventures. If everything is on track, the reserve coupons can be consolidated and play their greatest role, and commodity prices can be stabilized. Then, the National Government's economy will also be enriched simultaneously with the military and political aspects. (Translated by Rong from the Tokyo Economist of January 27)

### The Desire to Acquire Intensifies, Chinese Stocks Reach Unprecedented Highs

Yesterday's Chinese stock market situation was still shrouded in the buying frenzy of new and old investors, and the upward trend continued to expand. With everyone's hearts united and moving upward, holders were watching and not selling, and those seeking stocks were not afraid of high prices. Public utilities, cultural stocks, department stores, and Nanyang Tobacco Company were all being bought with one mind. Unprecedented highs continued to emerge. For example, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose to 142.5 yuan amidst the chaos. At noon, it fell back slightly to 135 yuan, still rising by a staggering 7.5 yuan compared to the previous day. It has risen for 13 consecutive days, with a total increase of 77.5 yuan. The current upward trend began on January 21 from 64.5 yuan and has more than doubled. China Electric also hit 95 yuan, 91 yuan at noon, up 4.5 yuan, rising a total of 46.5 yuan. In the cultural industry, the World Bookstore was the most active buyer, pulling up the price the most sharply and rising the most. Initially, it was raised to a high price of 195 yuan. After 10:30, selling at high prices caused it to fall back by 5 yuan to 190 yuan, still a huge increase of 20 yuan. Commercial Press rose 25 yuan, reaching 850 yuan, but there was little sales due to few buyers. China Publishing Company rose 12.5 yuan, knocking on the 310 yuan mark. In the department store industry, Sincere Company jumped out of 200 yuan, reaching a high of 210 yuan. At noon, it fell back to 205 yuan, up 7.5 yuan. Wing On Company appeared at a high of 193.5 yuan, then 189 yuan, up 3 yuan. National Goods Company hovered around 97 yuan, up 1 yuan; the momentum was relatively stable. Underwear was at 35 yuan. The Nanyang Tobacco Company had ever-increasing buyers, making the price soar to 232.5 yuan. At noon, the asking price was 30 yuan for buying, a huge increase of 25 yuan. Great China Match was raised to between 440 and 450 yuan, up another 10 yuan. Wing On Textile Mill once rose to 485 yuan, then fell back to 470 yuan, still up 20 yuan. Dasheng No. 1 Mill was at 650 yuan, and No. 3 Mill was at 540 yuan, but there were still few sales. Wuhe Weaving was around 165 yuan. Small denominations also rose. Hongxing Weaving had buyers at 9 yuan. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing was around 24 yuan. Xinfu had buyers at 20.05 yuan. Yousheng Dyeing and Weaving was around 15 yuan. Tongji was at 16 yuan. In the new pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmacy stood out at over 40 yuan, reaching 40.05 yuan, up another 2.75 yuan. Xin Asia saw a high price of 29.25 yuan again, also up 0.75 yuan. Minyi had few transactions at 65 yuan. Xinyi rose sharply by 10 yuan to 320 yuan. China-Western Pharmacy once saw 500 yuan, and Kaimeikeang was at 19 yuan. Lianhua Land and Real Estate shares traded at 12 to 2.5 yuan. Jinxing Timber rose to around 13 yuan.

### Promoting Increased Cotton Production, 1,000 Associations Established

According to the Continental News of the 16th, the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association has decided to establish 1,000 production implementation associations (the word "association" is the original Japanese name, meaning "guild") during the spring planting season in order to improve the effectiveness of guiding increased production, so as to organize cotton farmers and provide effective guidance. The detailed number of establishments planned for each region is as follows:

1. Jiangsu Province Shanghai City Central District 10,

Chuansha 30, Baoshan 30, West Shanghai 15,

Fengxian 30, North Shanghai 15, Chongming 30,

### Call Loan and Military Notes at Par

The call loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained at 18% yesterday morning and did not change.

Japanese military notes have stabilized again. The inter-bank trading price is still 5.5535 yuan, and the retail price of small money shops and silver houses is 5.56 yuan and 5.545 yuan for buying and selling. United Reserve Bank notes decreased by 0.02 yuan. Operators sold them for 3.98 yuan and bought them for 3.93 yuan.

### Government Bonds with Minor Fluctuations

Yesterday, the government bond market was somewhat sluggish due to the closure of silver shops and public apprehension. Although various bonds were initially strong, they later weakened due to more selling. They did not reach 80% of the par value, so sellers took the opportunity to put pressure on the market, causing prices to temporarily subside. However, new prices have been found for other varieties. The current fluctuations are just caused by those who are holding too much and cannot hold on. Class C initially traded at 7.20 yuan, rose to 8.30 yuan, then fell to 7 yuan, and finally traded at 7.10 yuan. Class A initially traded at a new price of 6.80 yuan, then fell to 4.80 yuan, and finally traded at 5.50 yuan. Class B initially traded at 5 yuan, saw a new price of 5.50 yuan, then fell to 4.50 yuan. Class D traded at 3.50 yuan, continued to see a new price of 4 yuan, and finally traded at 3.50 yuan. Class E initially traded at a new price of 5.30 yuan, then fell to 4.56 yuan. In total, Class D and E continued to rise by several jiao to 1.30 yuan, while the rest were flat. Class B and C were down by 0.50 and 0.90 yuan respectively.

### Cotton Cloth Market Weak

Yesterday morning, the cloth market was weak and prices trended lower. Fine cloth fell by about 8 to 10 yuan. Four Gentlemen Serge fell from 13.30 yuan to 12.90 yuan, and slightly recovered to about 13.20 yuan at noon, which was 0.20 yuan lower than the previous day. Peach Blossom Nüshilin was at 530 yuan.

### Cigarette Market Hovering

The cigarette market trended flat and sluggish. The time when the Central China Tobacco Association and the factory will release goods is still uncertain, which has caused some public anxiety and made it difficult for prices to stabilize. The market situation is quite hovering. Great Britain brand was at 13,600 yuan, Old Knife brand was at 10,700 yuan, Pinhai brand was at 8,650 yuan, Fairy brand was at 8,150 yuan, and Wuhua brand was at 7,300 yuan. Japanese cigarettes: Golden Spear brand was at 3,320 yuan, Golden Building was at 4,300 yuan, Red Rose was at 2,750 yuan, Quanlu brand was at 3,950 yuan, 20-stick was at 3,550 yuan, and Guide brand was at 3,400 yuan. National cigarettes: Pyramid was at 7,800 yuan, Beauty was at 7,400 yuan, Golden Mouse was at 4,300 yuan, and White Golden Dragon was at 4,450 yuan. The selling prices of all brands were generally flat and sluggish compared to the previous day.

### Daily Necessities' Rising Trend Turns Stable, But Still Few Buyers Inquire

The daily necessities market has stabilized in its rising trend. Because the selling prices are too high, few people can afford them. Phoenix brand matches were at 4,900 yuan, Beauty brand was at 5,200 yuan, Golden Ding brand was at 4,300 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were at 2,900 yuan. Gu Mu soap was at 970 yuan, Bai Xiangmao was at 920 yuan, Huang Xiangmao was at 830 yuan, and Scissors soap was at 950 yuan. White Rice Western candles were at 580 yuan, Monk Hat brand was at 530 yuan, and miscellaneous brands were at 380 yuan. There was not much difference.

### Bean Cake Rises Due to High Demand

The bean cake market was still strong and rising yesterday due to strong demand. The Central Factory slightly sold off its holdings, which briefly stabilized the price. But the result was still an increase. Yuanlong bean cake traded three carloads at a price of 117 yuan to 120 yuan. Feizi bean cake traded two carloads at a price of 120 yuan to 122.5 yuan. Changji bean cake traded 1,000 pieces at a price of 122 yuan. Shengji bean cake traded 2,000 pieces for delivery at the end of February at a price of 123 yuan. Another 1,000 pieces were traded for delivery in February at a price of 122 yuan. Shanghai Factory bean cake traded 5,000 pieces for delivery in March, with the price falling from 122 yuan to 119 yuan. The price finally rose back to 122.5 yuan.

### The Demise of Iron from U.S. Steel Companies Leads to Increasingly Firm and High Prices

Two-hundred-pound American steel from U.S. Steel Companies has long been out of stock on the market. The current remaining stock is mostly mixed brands and sub-standard products. The majority are of uneven sizes, thicknesses. The types available in Shanghai are on the verge of disappearing. Therefore, it is practically difficult for general canneries to collect a large amount of spot goods. At the same time, industry players are particularly shrewd, and standard prices are becoming increasingly firm and high. Yesterday, the market price for each two-hundred-pound box was around three thousand yuan, while sub-standard narrow strip iron also required twenty-five hundred yuan per box. In addition, three-point sesame nails were sold at nineteen hundred yuan per box, four-point at eighteen hundred yuan, five-point at seventeen hundred yuan, and six-point at sixteen hundred yuan. Our factory's nails were sold at thirteen hundred yuan per barrel, four-point nails at seventeen hundred and fifty yuan, five-point at sixteen hundred and fifty yuan, and six-point at sixteen hundred yuan. Three-seven-foot plain iron sheets were priced at two hundred and seventy yuan each. Three-six-foot plain iron sheets were priced at two hundred and twenty yuan each. Forty-foot bamboo-joint steel bars were quoted at sixteen thousand yuan per ton.

### Revitalization of Medicinal Euryale Ferox Seed Sales to Guangdong

Previously, medicinal Euryale ferox seeds were needed by congee shops, and the stock was becoming thin. Therefore, since the beginning of spring, due to the revitalization of actual sales to Guangdong, prices have gradually risen by thirty to forty percent. Upon investigation, the supply remains scarce, and the tight situation has not eased.

### Lungkou Vermicelli Continues to Rise in Price as Supply Dwindles

Lungkou vermicelli is experiencing a continuous rise in price due to the lack of ongoing supply. Although there are imitations, the quality is ultimately considered inferior. Therefore, the asking price has been raised repeatedly, without any sign of easing. Yesterday, the market price for four-bundle vermicelli rose again by fifty yuan, with the overall increase reaching approximately twenty percent.

### Shortage of Soft Biscuits Leads to Higher Asking Prices

The supply of soft biscuits has been hindered, and market stocks were already small. Coupled with the high cost of raw materials, asking prices have risen by approximately forty percent. There is no sign of loosening in the short term, and prices are bound to increase further in the future.

### Daily Necessities Beyond Rice and Grain Under Consideration for Rationing

The "Times" reported on February 17th that the most challenging task for municipal authorities during wartime is the rationing of daily necessities for the people and the establishment of a sound system. Regarding the rationing system, firstly, it must be properly allocated to meet the original intent of rationing; secondly, the method must be simple to facilitate the execution process. Currently, the rationing system for rice and flour in Shanghai is gradually approaching perfection, but other daily necessities, such as sugar and cooking oil, as well as other equally important items, have not yet achieved a satisfactory level of distribution. Cooking oil has been rationed according to the "Baojia" system (neighborhood watch system), but the effectiveness has not been widely adopted. Sugar has been rationed based on housing tax receipts, but the results have not been entirely satisfactory. It is now heard that the oil merchants' association and the sugar merchants' association are re-planning the rationing system, which should be implemented soon. The report also stated that before the rationing system is implemented, the needs of all parties should be fully studied. For example, bakeries and confectionery factories are the largest consumers of sugar. If their manufacturing operations comply with the regulations set by the authorities, they should be allocated supplies; otherwise, they may be ordered to close down. The selling prices must also be strictly controlled to prevent them from exceeding the price limit and seeking excessive profits. As for the individual consumption of sugar, the rationing procedure could be handled by commercial firms, which would be simpler, but individual applications for the amount of sugar needed must be strictly reviewed to ensure accuracy.

Judging from the recent sugar and oil rationing situation, the sugar rationing is more widespread and appropriate, while the effectiveness of oil rationing, as the "Times" pointed out, has not been widely adopted. However, with oil wholesalers actively seeking ways to procure goods, the panic over oil may soon be alleviated on the surface, but the implementation of the "oil-by-mouth" method for the Shanghai public is still like hoping for rain during a severe drought.

### Comparison of Shanghai's Rubber Industry Before and After the Incident

According to the "Shanghai Economic Yearbook" this year, 70% of Shanghai's rubber products are shoes, 15% are tires, and the remaining 15% are other items. Before the incident, the production capacity of Chinese-owned factories for rubber shoes was 100,000 pairs per day. Japanese-owned factories emerged after the incident, with very simple production equipment. In 1940, the production capacity of Japanese-owned factories was less than 7,000 pairs per day. The demand in Central China before the incident was 30 million pairs, but after the incident (in 1940), it decreased to 13 million pairs, and then gradually decreased. Currently, it is about 10 million pairs. As of last October, there were 10 Japanese-owned rubber factories and 29 Chinese-owned rubber factories in Shanghai (these are the ones registered with the Sino-Japanese Rubber Industry Association, with many other factories outside the association), with a production capacity of about 200,000 pairs per day. Due to insufficient raw materials and electricity restrictions, the operating rate in recent years has been about 30%. A comparison of the production volume of Shanghai rubber shoes before and after the incident is as follows:

(1) Before the incident (1937): Shanghai Chinese factories: 100,000 pairs (daily output).

(2) After the incident (1940): Shanghai Chinese factories: 50,000 pairs. Shanghai Japanese factories: 7,000 pairs.

(3) First half of 1941: Chinese factories: 40,000 pairs. Japanese factories: 10,000 pairs. Second half of 1941: Chinese factories: 25,000 pairs. Japanese factories: 10,000 pairs.

The Japanese authorities plan to increase the operating rate of Shanghai's rubber industry from 30% to 70% this year (1943).

### On Becoming a Monk

— Ru Zhen

Half a month ago, a friend of mine, frustrated by a losing business venture, came to me complaining, "I've seen through the world and decided to become a monk." His words suggested he would renounce the world immediately. Recently, he visited me again, looking radiant. I knew at once that his business was going smoothly, and his thoughts of becoming a monk had probably vanished into thin air.

This friend's desire to become a monk was merely a momentary outburst. Even so, I know that becoming a monk these days is no easy feat. Zheng Banqiao said, "Monks fill the world, not sent from the Western Regions, but our own Chinese fathers, brothers, and sons, impoverished and without refuge, entering (monkhood) with difficulty, and unable to return." Most monks are born of poverty, able to endure a life of cold meals and ancient temples, with very few possessing true wisdom. Young masters, experiencing a little emotion, cry out to shave their heads and become monks, which is truly laughable. I've heard that Ji Gong (the Mad Monk) was originally from a wealthy family; while Lu Zhishen, who became a monk halfway through his life, still enjoyed large bowls of wine and chunks of meat. However, there is also a "refined guest" type among monks, like Chen Meigong, the "mountain recluse" of the late Ming Dynasty, who frequented the doors of high officials, and was mocked by Jiang Tiaosheng as "A crane in the clouds, flying to and fro in the mansions of ministers." In large cities, monks of the "crane in the clouds" type are as numerous as crucian carp crossing a river. They are eloquent and skilled in speaking heretical Zen, able to cook excellent vegetarian dishes, write a few decent essays, and understand some basic calligraphy and painting. These people rely entirely on a few wealthy patrons for their livelihood. Therefore, their worldliness and understanding of human affairs are more sophisticated and thorough than even secular merchants. If you want to become this kind of monk, forget it, forget it. There is another type who originally had some family wealth and wanted to enjoy a life of leisure, so they became monks. In the past, giving the abbot five or six hundred yuan was enough to have plain rice and simple meals, and live a peaceful monastic life, whether or not you chanted scriptures or performed rituals was up to you. Now, it's different; no temple will take you in, even if you offer ten or twenty thousand yuan. Therefore, if you want to become a monk, you can only become a small monk who burns incense and chants sutras. Before becoming a monk, you still have to ask acquaintances to vouch for you. Once you are a monk, everything must be done according to temple rules. You have a share in everything, from the Buddhist services of the eastern household to the releasing of hungry ghosts in the western household, busy from morning to night. Can you endure the life of "doing one day's work as a monk, striking one day's bell?"

Therefore, in a busy and chaotic world, it is not easy to find a quiet place to hide. Yuan Zi said, "Before wearing the robe, one is tired of many things; after wearing the robe, there are even more things." Renouncing the world or remaining secular is the same. Shaving one's head makes one a monk, keeping one's hair makes one oneself. Life in this world is only a hundred years, so it is better to work hard early. Why be pessimistic at a young age?

### On "Habits"

— Xiao Lin

Everyone who repeats an action often develops a habit. With a habit, one gains a character.

Good habits formed through wisdom often become the foundation of one's success. Conversely, if one develops a bad habit due to momentary negligence, it will spread like weeds, vigorously hindering the growth of plants and burying one's life.

The biggest reason for people's failure is allowing bad habits to develop freely in their bodies. Because it's easy to become a worthless degenerate. Going to gambling dens, bars, and dance halls a few times will lead to habitual behavior. Because it's always easier to do something a second time than the first, and after a few times, it becomes effortless.

The reason why criminals willingly fall into the net of the law is entirely due to the natural success of their bad habits. Their inferior nature doesn't allow them to engage in honest work, and they always feel that robbing or stealing a little is less effort. Moreover, their "hands" naturally reach out for other people's belongings due to habit.

Similarly, if one can cultivate good habits through self-control and self-training, they will lead us to the path of success forever.

If you have already discovered some bad habits in yourself and want to quit them, I think it's still not too late. As long as you can resolutely, painfully, and earnestly use all your willpower to break them, and walk on a bright road, and absolutely do not have a pessimistic will that you cannot change for a while and have no hope of becoming a new person again, this will instead allow bad habits to become more deeply rooted, and you will never have a day to look back. Because breaking bad habits is originally something that takes a long time. For example, if a tree that has been bent is to be straightened again, you must set up another upright wooden stake next to the tree, tie the tree tightly, and after a considerable period of time, there is hope of straightening it. The meaning of this example is to tell you that it is okay to have a model next to you, learn from him patiently, and after a long time you can naturally change this bad habit.

If you can understand the impact of habits on life, then you must cultivate some good habits to get rid of those bad habits.

### Working Women and Education

— Yi Qun

Whenever working women are mentioned, people quickly conjure up images of slender young women with painted faces and high-heeled shoes. Logically speaking, working women use their own labor to support themselves, and should be superior to women who rely on men for their livelihoods. They should be particularly respected and valued by society. But the current impression of working women is that they are "vases" or lowly "playthings of men." Working women have not only failed to raise their status in society, but on the contrary, they are generally despised. This is a shame and weakness of working women themselves, and also something that working women should strive to overcome.

The issue most relevant to this is naturally the education of working women. Many people believe that women's abilities are lower than men's, because women are only capable of mechanical and stereotypical work. This harsh criticism cannot be ignored. But rather than saying that women lack ability, it is better to say that most women still do not truly understand their work and are constantly striving to learn for their work. Therefore, if working women hope to achieve true equality in society, they must use their perseverance to understand society, understand work, and understand the interrelationship between the individual, work, and society, and continue to learn.

The establishment of night schools for working women is also to respond to and encourage women's learning. But the deformed Shanghai society, the commercialization of schools is a common phenomenon. Therefore, working women should pay special attention when choosing a school. Some time ago, I saw in the newspaper that the Shanghai YWCA opened a women's supplementary night school at Hongyi Middle School on Gordon Road. As a social service organization and leader in women's liberation, the YWCA should naturally promote the education of working women. Perhaps this school is also worth recommending to the women's community.

Scientific Essay

### On the Value of Napping

— Zi He

Historically, there were two famous people who slept the least, they only slept four hours each night, one was Napoleon, and the other was Edison. In fact, we have not noticed this point, that is, they are both accustomed to napping during the day. Napoleon often napped in the stagecoach. Edison, according to his colleagues, also liked to steal a nap on the table or on the floor during work. If it were not for these short naps, it would be very difficult for them to support themselves year after year with so little sleep. In addition, Goethe, Shelley, and Wagner also had the same preference as Napoleon and Edison.

We sleep the sweetest when we first fall asleep. The first three hours of sleep at night are the most comfortable rest and the most valuable. The remaining five hours of sleep are only superficial and shallow, and not of much value. Some people even say that instead of sleeping eight hours as usual, it is better to sleep two three-hour naps in twenty-four hours. This is fundamentally a revolution against the old tradition, and I believe that no one dares to implement it.

Adults' blood pressure always increases, and the pulse vessels are also prone to exceeding the norm. Over-fatigue and nervous excitement are very common. Therefore, the effect of napping is even more difficult to ignore. Because during a nap, blood pressure drops by fifteen to thirty beats, arterial tension can be reduced, and the heart and pulse also slow down, which is beneficial to the body. Lying down relaxes the brain nerves and muscles. Therefore, lying flat saves more energy than sitting in an armchair.

Should one nap before a meal? Or after a meal. Experts have different opinions. However, napping after a meal can help digestion, which is more reasonable in comparison. At the same time, a midday nap divides the day's work into two equal parts, which is also very logical. In fact, historical nappers chose different times for their naps. The most suitable time is after considerable work and before fatigue. Whether it is mental fatigue or physical fatigue, it is the same. As a French sleep scholar said: "Before we are exhausted, sleep is the laziness given to us by nature." This explains why we should rest before we are too tired, and also suggests the value of daytime napping to assist nighttime sleep. It prevents the accumulation of fatigue and tension, which leads to difficulty falling asleep at night.

Therefore, generally speaking, the long sleep around dawn can be shortened, and a nap can be taken during the day. This is beneficial to health, especially in today's situation where one cannot afford to be sick, and medicines have become tools for making money. Let us cultivate the habit of napping as a free nutritional supplement.

### Impressions of "Two Generations of Women"

— Cun Hou

This is a literary masterpiece worth recommending and praising! The entire film has only five actors, two locations - the Fei mansion in Hangzhou and Liu Zhuang on the edge of West Lake, and the time is only three days from beginning to end: but it is acted very tensely, with twists and turns, humor, and depth, keeping the audience's emotions excited and breathless. This is the most outstanding and perfect film among the many recent films of China Film Union! When I first entered the theater, I never expected to see such a satisfactory film!

However, it also has its shortcomings: its standard is too high, and I am afraid that the general audience who likes low-level tastes will not easily accept it.

Now let me list its unique points below:

(1) Rich in literary quality. The entire film from beginning to end is full of fluent and beautiful dialogue; there are sorrowful and touching dialogues, impassioned dialogues, tit-for-tat dialogues, and beautiful and moving dialogues. It is simply not like a movie but rather a good play. The film with the most dialogue in Chinese films is probably this one.

(2) The director's technique is quick and clean. One scene follows another, the rhythm and speed are very high, and it is crisp and neat, unlike general slow-moving films that drag on and on. It gets straight to the point, the scenes are compact, clear and clean, and refreshing. This kind of directing is close to the American film directing method.

(3) The theme is full of significance. It depicts the problem of conflicts between mothers-in-law and daughters-in-law in thousands of Chinese families. Many families have lost their happiness because of this. This problem is extremely serious, and it is related to the future of the Chinese nation. The author's original intention is to advocate the small family system, which is very obvious. Therefore, this play has the value of social reform and the significance of increasing family happiness.

(4) The characters are portrayed quite deeply. The mother-in-law, Mrs. Fei, represents the general stubborn old woman, selfish and self-interested, using her children as her sacrifices. Xu Ying represents the modern Chinese progressive woman, a scientist, with a clear mind and scientific understanding; she is not afraid of difficulties, and she has the courage to fight. She is the ideal woman of our contemporary China. The other characters, Jia Qi, Jia Lin, and Miss Xu Guifen, all have vivid portrayals and lively performances.

(5) The scenes are beautiful, with the antique Chinese old family setting, beautiful and winding corridors, and beautiful natural scenery. The director's angles are very beautiful, and the close-up shots also have special beauty and deep expression.

I have written too much rambling, but after watching it, I was so excited that I couldn't help but say a few words of praise. I don't usually like to say good things about others, but this film really touched me so much that I have to carefully introduce it to the Shanghai audience who really understand drama.

### The Model Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

Fifteen

Once, on a night of bright full moon, Chips was taking Junior Fourth Form in Latin, when the air-raid alarm went. The guns began almost immediately, and since there were plenty of shrapnel shells dropping outside, it seemed to Chips that they were as well where they were, on the ground floor of the school buildings. The buildings were substantially built and made a pretty good air-raid shelter for Brookfield; as for a direct hit, well, they would not be any more alive anywhere else.

Therefore he continued with his Latin lesson, speaking a little louder against the increasing noise of the guns and anti-aircraft barrage. Some of the boys were restless; few could keep their minds on the work. He said gently: 'Robertson, at this particular time in world history--to you, perhaps--er--roughly two thousand years ago--the doings of Caesar in Gaul--are--er--somewhat secondary, and--er--the irregular usages of the verb Tollod--er--even more so. Yet believe me--er--my dear Robertson--things do not genuinely alter.' Just then there was a particularly loud explosion--quite near. 'You cannot--er--judge the importance of things--er--by the noise they make. Oh no, indeed.' A small titter. 'Things that have mattered for thousands of years--are not going to be--wiped out--because some bally bounder--in his laboratory--has invented a new nasty.' More unrestful giggle: for Buffles, the pale, thin, medically unfit science master, was known as 'the bally bounder.' Another explosion--still nearer. 'Let us--um--resume our work. If Fate intends us to be--er--interrupted imminently, let us be doing something appropriate--er--to show them. Will somebody volunteer to construe?'

Maynard, fat, bold, adroit, bumptious, said: 'I will, sir.' (39)
