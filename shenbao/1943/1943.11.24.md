### The Fate of Chongqing (Part 1) – The Inevitability of the Kuomintang Split in Chongqing

— Yoshida Toyosuke

Introduction

One day, Iemitsu Tokugawa, the third Shogun of the Tokugawa dynasty, visited the temple of the famous monk Takuan. At that time, pointing to a ship sailing on the sea, he asked the two Zen monks: Is there a way to stop that ship immediately? One Zen monk immediately left his seat and quietly closed the paper sliding door in front of him; the other Zen monk remained seated, with his eyes closed. It is said that this was the famous answer given by Zen Buddhism to Iemitsu at that time. If everything is but a reflection of human thought, then stopping the thought of the ship sailing naturally means that the real ship has stopped sailing! Indeed, for absolute idealists, the cessation of all thought means the disappearance of all things. However, from a zoological point of view, the attitude of these two Zen monks is somewhat similar to that of the ostrich in the great African desert. It is said that when ostriches are chased by enemies and have nowhere to escape, they bury their heads in the sand. Let us briefly analyze the psychological effect of the ostrich; perhaps it thinks that if it cannot see the enemy, then the enemy is already gone. Nowadays, there are countless people who behave like ostriches, especially among those engaged in political work. I believe that Chiang Kai-shek, who recently wrote the book "China's Destiny," can also be classified as a human ostrich. What is the reason for this? In a nutshell, this book deliberately avoids discussing the biggest current problem facing the Kuomintang in Chongqing today – whether to compromise with Japan or hand over political power to the Chinese Communist Party – a choice between two options, one of which must be taken. Instead, it buries its head in the sand of the fantasy of the final victory of the war of resistance, seeking to avoid seeing the danger of the Kuomintang split that exists in the current reality. The reality that is developing inside and outside China, whether he is subjectively aware of it or not, the dangerous demon is still striding forward. Here, we analyze the current reality of China and point out the inevitability of danger, which may be of some help even to Chiang Kai-shek (or to those who are truly concerned about the fate of China)!

Reply to Optimists

In my article "Reply to Pessimists" in the Shanghai Shen Bao Weekly Review on October 24th, I said: "Since the surrender of Badoglio and the retreat of Germany on the Eastern Front, it must be admitted that pessimism is developing among some Chinese people. For example, they are beginning to suspect that Germany will soon follow the same fate as Italy! If this becomes a reality, then Japan and the Nanjing government, located in the Greater East Asia region, will encounter unprecedented difficulties!" This pessimism in Shanghai is optimism from the perspective of Chongqing. It seems that Chongqing believes that the European problem will definitely be resolved this year. If the United Kingdom and the United States resolve the European problem, then, of course, as Roosevelt and Churchill said, they will use the full fighting power of the world's two major capitalist countries to strike Japan. Then Japan will definitely not be able to withstand this blow and will collapse! According to those who hold this view, the so-called "final victory of the War of Resistance" will, within this year, be brought to Chongqing by the power of the United Kingdom and the United States. In other words, Chongqing only needs to open its arms and wait for the development of the world situation.

### Fierce Battle on Gilbert Islands Sinks Seven American Ships; Two Japanese Lieutenants Practice the Spirit of the Navy

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 23rd: Fierce battles are still underway in the Gilbert Islands area, especially on Tarawa Island, where intense fighting is taking place around the landing points. Since the 19th, the results achieved by our naval air force and ground forces are as follows: The naval air force has sunk one enemy medium-sized aircraft carrier and one destroyer, and damaged two enemy large-sized aircraft carriers (one of which was severely damaged or may have sunk), one medium-sized aircraft carrier (severely damaged or may have sunk), one battleship (or cruiser) (severely damaged and on fire), and one transport ship (severely damaged and on fire). Thirty-six enemy aircraft were shot down (including three unconfirmed). The ground forces shot down eighty-nine enemy aircraft (including twenty-two unconfirmed). A total of fifteen of our aircraft were self-detonated or did not return to base.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to military experts here: The Gilbert Islands are adjacent to the Japanese-controlled Marshall Islands and are strategically important. The U.S. military's operations in the Gilbert Islands are like stealing at someone else's doorstep. Entering the South Seas area is the strategic zone of the Japanese Navy, which is also the zone of absolute development of Japan's national power. It is expected that the sacrifices of the U.S. military in this area will be no less than those in the Solomon Islands campaign. The war has shifted from the South Pacific to the central South Pacific. This has already hinted that in the future, the Japanese and U.S. fleets will officially engage in decisive battles. At that time, the Japanese Navy will be able to fully demonstrate the true value of its invincible navy.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese naval air force launched a fierce attack on the U.S. military mobile force attacking the Gilbert Islands and achieved remarkable results. In this battle, the Japanese commander's aircraft, after aiming a torpedo that was guaranteed to hit at a large enemy aircraft carrier, collided with the enemy ship in a heroic self-detonation. According to reports, the pilots of the commander's aircraft were Lieutenant Nobumiya Miyamae and Lieutenant Yoshiaki Akiyama. On the evening of the 21st of this month, when a large U.S. aircraft carrier appeared in the sea area near Betio and Tarawa Island, Lieutenant Miyamae's aircraft immediately aimed a torpedo at the ship, which hit immediately. Then, he drove his beloved aircraft into the ship and heroically self-detonated on the right side of the ship. The aircraft carrier was hit by several torpedoes, and the stern caught fire and burned, causing a huge explosion. The rear side of the right ship tilted, and there was a high possibility of it sinking. In addition, the aircraft piloted by Lieutenant Yoshiaki Akiyama also launched a torpedo that hit another aircraft carrier, and then dived into the ship's bridge, causing the ship to suffer severe damage. The great spirit of Lieutenant Miyamae and Lieutenant Akiyama in destroying the enemy can be said to be the practitioners of the traditional Japanese naval soul, and their names will be immortalized in war history.

### Industrial and Economic Policies Actively Being Promoted; Philippine Minister of Agriculture and Commerce Answers Reporter's Questions

Second, efforts will be made to increase the production of general agriculture, fisheries, forestry, and animal husbandry. In addition, it is planned to expand and rectify the rational production status of manufacturing and household handicrafts. Third, to solve the price problem, which is the basis for promoting these policies, and to increase the number of agricultural experimental fields, which has also been started. In addition, it is planned to increase the production of salt and essential goods in order to achieve the goal of Philippine economic self-sufficiency.

### Representatives of the News Conference Inspect Nagoya

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Representatives from various regions attending the Greater East Asia New Construction Conference have been visiting the Army Officer School, the Airborne Corps, and various facilities in Tokyo for several days. In order to inspect the Kansai region, they departed from Tokyo Station at 10:00 AM on the 23rd for Nagoya.

### Many Japanese Diplomats Return Home Via Turkey

Istanbul, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Japanese Minister to Budapest, Okubo, and First Secretary of the Embassy in Berlin, Ushiba, arrived in Istanbul yesterday and plan to return to Tokyo via Ankara, accompanied by many other Japanese diplomats.

### U.S. Plane Crash

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Reuter reports: According to U.S. sources, a U.S. Army bomber crashed into the Roxteth Hills near the town of Wilmaquay, Pennsylvania, killing seven people.

### Fierce Japanese Counterattack in the Central Pacific; U.S. Acknowledges Difficulties in the Future of the Battle

Buenos Aires, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The U.S. Pacific Fleet Command announced on the 21st that the U.S. military had landed in the Gilbert Islands. In the past, whenever the U.S. launched a new landing operation, it mobilized all propaganda agencies to publicize it extensively. This time, after the announcement, it did not make any publicity and took a wait-and-see attitude. This is in sharp contrast to the remarks made twice by Admiral Chester Nimitz, Commander of the U.S. Pacific Fleet, that a major offensive would be launched in the central Pacific. Due to the geographical difficulties of this landing operation, it is difficult to predict its progress. On the 21st, a radio station in Los Angeles, broadcasting to the U.S. military, predicted the difficulties of the future of the battle and issued a warning that Tarawa and Makin Islands are both small coral islands that can be strongly defended with a small number of troops. If the landing U.S. military does not quickly eliminate the Japanese army, there is a risk of being annihilated. Associated Press reporter Haitaawa also predicted before the landing that the difficulties of the central Pacific offensive would increase in the next few days due to the fierce Japanese counterattacks in the central Pacific. A U.S. naval expert said that no matter where, if Japan cannot attack the advancing U.S. military, once it gets the opportunity, the U.S. Navy should fight a decisive battle with its main fleet. The Japanese main fleet still has a terrible power, which poses a great threat to the U.S. military because the Japanese fleet can attack in its limited waters, while the U.S. fleet has to defend in a wide area. The intention of the U.S. reporter is to warn the U.S. military to be careful of attacks by the B fleet when implementing the landing operation, so as to avoid repeating the mistakes made on the surface of Bougainville Island.

### Representatives of the North China Propaganda Conference Return to Beijing

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The representatives of the North China region who attended the Second National Propaganda Conference, after being led to Beijing by Guan Yixian, Director of the Information Bureau of the General Affairs Office of the North China Political Affairs Commission, have completed their tasks.

Those who went to the station to see them off included Shi Kechun, Director of the Guidance Department of the Propaganda Department, Zhao Muru, President of the Central News Agency, and many people from the press.

### Philippine President Hosts Banquet; Bose Delivers Speech, Vowing to Strive Together for the Construction of Greater East Asia

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) – After arriving in Manila on the 22nd, Subhas Chandra Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, attended a welcoming banquet hosted by President Laurel and delivered a speech on the spot. The main points are as follows: British imperialism is about to collapse, and American imperialism is trying to replace it. Today, countries around the world must either maintain this imperialism or build a new order based on justice. In the past, some Asian nations relied on the United States, but now they feel the serious threat of American colonial policy. I always oppose the oppression of the enemy and continue to fight. Individuals are not important and must die sooner or later. We must strive for the eternal life of our countries.

### Tokyo Overseas Chinese Gather to Celebrate the Sino-Japanese Alliance; Ambassador Cai Pei Attends and Delivers a Speech

### Japan Decides to Mobilize Students to Cooperate in Increasing Food Production from This Month to March Next Year

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The national land improvement project to be launched in Japan this winter is a major part of the second food production increase plan, so all parties have high expectations for its results. The area to be implemented by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce this time is about 1.6 million hectares, which is a very large scale. In order to carefully implement the plan, it has been reviewed many times, and recently the implementation plan has been completely decided. It is estimated that the total cost of the land improvement project will be 420 million yen. According to this estimate, it can increase the harvest of 2,178,700 koku of rice and 1,217,800 koku of wheat by the end of Showa 20 (1945). In addition, regarding a part of the labor force required for land improvement, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has obtained the cooperation of the Ministry of Education and has decided to mobilize students to participate. After active discussions, the plan has been approved, and on the 22nd, the "Essential Guidelines for Mobilizing Students to Complete Land Improvement" was announced to local governors across the country. It is planned to mobilize 18 million people (cumulative number) during the five months from November to March next year. The main points of the outline are as follows: The labor force required for land improvement is a total of 180 million people, of which students will be responsible for one-tenth, which is 18 million people, that is, it is planned to mobilize 600,000 people to work for 30 days. The students to be mobilized are schoolchildren in the fourth grade and above of national primary schools, as well as students of youth schools, normal schools, higher vocational schools, and universities. Considering the particularity of industrial school students, it is planned to mobilize them for 20 days. When implementing the mobilization of students, close contact should be made with the agricultural production patriotic promotion team, the food production increase team, and the Manchurian Pioneer Youth Volunteer Team to contribute to the promotion of the national movement. Regarding the mobilization plan, it will end in March next year, and plans for April and May will be established separately.

### German Forces Control Samos Island in the Aegean Sea, British Forces Surrender; Germany's Position in Southeastern Europe Becomes More Consolidated

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German authorities announced on the afternoon of the 22nd that the British forces and Badoglio's troops on Samos Island in the Dodecanese Islands in the Aegean Sea had surrendered, and German forces had occupied the island's important military facilities. Samos Island has an area of 180 square miles and is located northeast of Nikaria Island.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German News Agency reports: Since the fall of Samos Island, Germany's position in the Aegean Sea has become more consolidated, which has a far-reaching impact on the position of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Mediterranean Sea. The United Kingdom and the United States have fallen into a political deadlock, and their only way out is military salvation, especially on the Italian battlefield. On Sunday, the enemy forces again attempted to regain their defeat in the Dodecanese Islands with limited military actions, but the result was still a failure. There is no doubt that this limited activity must be a misjudgment in the anti-Axis military. General Clark and General Montgomery are well aware that the harsh weather in Italy makes it impossible to use heavy artillery and hinders the supply of all supplies and reinforcements. In addition, they are also well aware that the German positions cannot be broken, as the British and American forces have bombarded the German positions for a long time without success.

The Soft Underbelly of Europe Turns Tough

On this point, there is one more thing that is quite interesting, that is, most of the captured British and American soldiers say that "the soft underbelly of Europe is very hard." Each time General Eisenhower's troops attempted to attack Mount Sampugaro and Mount Corno with a squadron, but they all failed under the artillery fire of the German outposts. In western Italy, the activities of the U.S. military are limited to artillery, but German artillery and mortars destroyed seven enemy gun emplacements. In the central area of the Apennine Mountains, German outposts repelled the British reconnaissance team's sudden attack without much effort, while a strong U.S. reconnaissance team was blocked in the mountainous area of Castel del Sangro and was repelled in a counterattack. The British Eighth Army attempted to enter the flooded area of the Sangro River, but was blocked by German heavy artillery. A German reconnaissance team engaged the reassembled British forces east of the Sangro River and captured several prisoners of war. The actions of the British army in the past few days have been constantly limited by the bad weather and difficult terrain.

### Japanese Army Attacks Changde; Yu Army in the Lishui Area Suffers Annihilation Blow

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Chongqing, the Yu Military Commission announced on the 22nd the battle situation in the area west of Dongting Lake in Hunan Province as follows: The Japanese army attacked Changde from the north and northwest on the 20th and is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the Yu army outside the city. The Japanese air force and artillery units are also covering their ground forces, bombing Changde extensively. Another part of the Japanese army is detouring east of Changde to attack the transportation hub from Changde to Changsha. In addition, the Japanese army in the south of Cili is also launching a fierce attack on the Yu army with strong artillery and mobile units.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese army broke through the Yu army positions along the Lishui River. The Yu army's counterattack was also very fierce, and reserve troops were transferred from the rear positions in an attempt to stop the Japanese army from advancing south. However, it was too late. Most of the Yu army fell under the encirclement of the Japanese army and suffered an annihilation blow. The main force of the 74th Army, a direct line unit of the Yu army, moved north from the defense line along the Yuanjiang River in an attempt to stop the Japanese army's fierce attack. Its main force, the 51st Division and the 58th Division, had advanced to the triangular area near Leiyuyan (20 kilometers south of Cili) since the 19th, but was encircled by the Japanese army. The Japanese army launched a major annihilation battle starting on the 19th. Furthermore, because the Japanese army's advance units suddenly reached the Longtan River, the Yu army's retreat was cut off, so it had collapsed by the 21st. The Japanese army advancing south from the Linfeng area attacked the 166th Division of the 44th Yu Army at Qijiahe (47 kilometers southwest of Linfeng) and the 100th Yu Central Direct Line Army from the area east of Changsha from the front, completely annihilating them. It has now completed the posture of approaching Taoyuan, an important stronghold of the Yu army. In addition, the Japanese army advancing southwest of Linli is advancing like a hot knife through butter. It had advanced to Zuoshi on the night of the 20th, and Changde, the main stronghold of the Sixth War Zone of the Yu army, will fall soon.

Yu Army on the Yuehan Line Suffers a Defeat

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese army base on the Huaizhong front line, the 133rd Yu Army took advantage of the Japanese army's operations west of Dongting Lake and began to move restlessly on the Yuehan Line. The Japanese army launched a surprise attack on its source, Hengxi, at dawn on the 20th and completely annihilated it. The Japanese army began to attack the 133rd Yu Army entrenched in the area near Bailifan at 3:30 AM on the 20th, annihilating it. It then pursued the defeated army and entered Hengxi at 10:30 AM, occupying the area. Another unit of the Japanese army also launched an attack on the reinforcement unit of the 133rd Yu Army with four mortars southwest of Hengxi at 6:30 AM on the same morning. After about five hours of battle, it was defeated and attacked Mapu, occupying it. In this battle, 800 Yu soldiers were killed and a large number of war spoils were seized. The Yu army's attempt to move restlessly has been completely crushed.

### North China Political Affairs Commission Announces New Personnel Appointments

### British Planes Bomb Berlin in Night Raid

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: British planes launched a large-scale raid on Berlin last night, causing significant damage to many areas of the city, especially working-class residential areas. Civilians also suffered losses, and some irreplaceable cultural monuments were destroyed. The residences of diplomatic representatives from several neutral countries were also affected and damaged.

### The Balkan Situation After the Moscow Talks

According to a London dispatch from the Norwegian Zurich Newspaper, new political disputes have recently arisen between Britain and the Soviet Union regarding the Balkan issue. This is said to be due to a review of the content of the Moscow talks from a new perspective, revealing the true situation. After the talks, the British and American newspapers spread optimistic views about the Soviet Union's intentions, but the events that followed were very different from what was expressed at the Moscow joint talks. The first issue is the Polish question. According to the Zurich Newspaper, the tension between the Soviet government and the Polish government-in-exile in London has not eased.

This is clearly inconsistent with the British and American claims before the Moscow talks that diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland were about to reopen.

The second issue is Yugoslavia and Greece.

British Foreign Secretary Eden recently met with former Yugoslav King Peter and his Prime Minister, as well as Greek King George II and his Prime Minister, in Cairo. To this day, it is unknown whether the Balkan issue was discussed during the Moscow talks, but diplomatic circles in London believe that there is some tension between the Yugoslav government-in-exile and the Greek government-in-exile.

The Two Factions in Greece

There are currently two major political groups in Greece. One is called the EAM, which is republican and takes a somewhat left-wing policy. The other is the ELAS, which has a strong communist flavor. The EAM was previously regarded by the British and Americans as a right-wing group, but in reality, it is a left-wing republican faction that also disagrees with the ELAS on local issues.

It is noteworthy that there is almost no support for the royalists and right-wing parties in Greece. This fact also indicates that the British and American plan to rebuild Greece using a monarchy is fundamentally losing its foundation. The EAM, which previously had a pro-monarchist tendency and was trusted by the British and Americans, is now gradually becoming an anti-monarchist group, which is worth noting.

Inside Story of Yugoslavia

Similar changes are taking place in Yugoslavia. In view of the same internal situation in Yugoslavia as in Greece, the British government has recently been forced to change its policy towards former Yugoslavia. The British government has exiled Mihailović, the leader of a party that it has always supported, and has abandoned its policy of supporting that group. Britain and the United States have also lost the substantial basis for implementing a reconstruction policy in former Yugoslavia using pre-war organizations.

In this regard, neutral sources are also paying particular attention to the recent developments in the French Committee of National Liberation. Giraud, the darling of the British and Americans, has lost his influence for the same reasons as in Greece and Yugoslavia.

British and American diplomacy is losing its ground in the Mediterranean countries, while the Soviet Union is taking advantage of this situation to support developments in that direction, which is a perfect contrast. Whether British Foreign Secretary Eden's talks with Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu in Cairo involved the issue of Turkey's participation in the war, or simply informed Turkey of the situation of the Moscow Tripartite Talks, is another matter. Undoubtedly, Britain's intention in the Cairo talks was to re-establish Britain's position in the Balkans in view of the Soviet Union's active diplomacy in the Mediterranean countries.

Britain has this intention, as can be seen from Eden's meetings in Cairo with the Turkish Foreign Minister and the heads of the former Yugoslav and Greek governments-in-exile. However, these heads of government-in-exile are isolated from the actual guerrilla movements in their countries, so it is no longer realistic for Britain to restore the pre-war organization through these few governments-in-exile. Therefore, the British talks with Turkish and former Yugoslav and Greek politicians can be seen as a further manifestation of British anxiety. (Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, January 13th)

### German Air Force Active in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, Difficult for Anti-Axis Forces to Transport

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – German military authorities announced: On the afternoon of the 21st, the German Air Force attacked an anti-Axis convoy in the Atlantic, heavily damaging two large transport ships of 10,000 and 8,000 tons, escorted by cruisers, destroyers, and other warships. The two ships appeared to have sunk. In addition, three other ships, totaling 15,000 tons, were damaged. One German plane was lost in the operation.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency has learned from military authorities that enemy troops and documents captured in southern Italy consistently confirm that the German Air Force's bombing of enemy convoys in the Mediterranean Sea and facilities in the port of Naples in the past few weeks has been extremely effective. American prisoners of war have testified that at least thirty-six ships, fully loaded with troops and supplies, were sunk on the route from Gibraltar to Bizerte in the first half of November. The difficulties currently faced by Generals Clark and Montgomery's troops are due to the fact that the Anglo-American forces are unable to obtain sufficient supplies due to the German aircraft's attacks on convoys. For example, in mid-November, the US Fifth Army needed several divisions to replace the heavy casualties suffered in the Salerno area. These reinforcements were sent to the Italian front by transport ships. However, on the evening of November 6th, they were attacked by a strong German air force off the coast of North Africa, so very few ships arrived in Italy. According to eyewitnesses, seven transport ships were sunk. The troops on board drifted at sea without rescue, while other ships scattered and fled to avoid disaster.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German News Agency reports: The German army launched a defensive battle in the Dnieper bend, achieving great results on the 21st.

### The New Union Screened the Film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea" Yesterday; Reporting Director Matsushima Gave a Speech

Central News Agency: This year's December 8th marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The Shanghai News Union specially pre-celebrated the event with three programs: A film screening was held yesterday (the 23rd) at 3:30 PM on the eighth floor of the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road, featuring the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea," newly obtained from the enemy lines, as well as the Shochiku film "Young Flying General" and the newsreel "Japanese Students Enlisting to Serve the Nation." The union specially invited Director Matsushima of the Japanese Fleet Reporting Department to give a speech. Many people from various circles in Shanghai, both Chinese and Japanese, attended enthusiastically, creating a lively atmosphere. Details are as follows:

Grand Occasion of the Film Screening

Attendees included Zhang Yipeng, Chen Dongbai, Zhang Chao, Wan Xuefang, Jin Zongcheng, Chen Zhengzhang, etc., as well as cadres from the Shanghai Magazine Union's Civic Thrift Movement and reporters from various newspapers in the city. Allied guests included Director Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department, Captain Shioda, and Yaji Motora. Xu Liqiu, the union's rotating managing director, represented the union and warmly welcomed the guests, along with Director-General Ren Yunzhu. The ceremony was hosted by Di Ze. Xu Jiabao, the union's rotating managing director, gave a report, stating: Next month, the 8th, marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. To commemorate the occasion, the union is holding a film festival today, screening the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea." This film was not produced by Chinese or Japanese film companies but was shot by enemy military reporters, capturing the naval battle in the South Pacific at the time. The screening today, as the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War approaches, is of great significance. We have specially invited Reporting Director Matsushima to speak about the significance of the film. Then, Fleet Reporting Director Matsushima explained the significance of the film and the current situation of the South Pacific operations. The union's Director-General Ren served as the translator. The film was then screened. In particular, the film "Bloody Battle in the South Sea" vividly depicted the valiant bombing by the Japanese air force and the sinking of the American aircraft carrier Hornet, presenting the scene before their eyes. The film was very valuable. The films "Japanese Students Enlisting to Serve the Nation" and "Young Flying General" further revealed the fervent patriotism of the Japanese people. The event lasted three hours.

Matsushima's Speech

Fleet Reporting Director Matsushima's speech roughly stated: "I am honored that everyone took time out of their busy schedules to attend and watch the film shot by the military reporters of the enemy nation, in which the valiant Japanese air force sank the American aircraft carrier Hornet. As we celebrate the upcoming second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, introducing this film today has profound significance." Director Matsushima continued to say that the film was brought to Shanghai through the efforts of the China Film Company. The film includes aerial and naval battles in the South Pacific, with the Japanese air force launching a fierce attack centered on the enemy aircraft carrier. This film, taken by enemy military reporters, exposes America's own defeats. Therefore, this film not only introduces the fierce battle at the front but also allows us to glimpse the true strength of Japan's military. The United States has conducted thorough research on this battle, and our valiant air force calmly defeated the enemy. It has been a year and a half since the fierce battle of the Solomon Islands began. The Japanese military's brave and fearless operations have inflicted significant damage on the enemy with ingenious tactics, but the United States has always been unwilling to announce the truth about their defeats, covering up the outrage among the domestic population. Japan has long been prepared to destroy the enemy, and we are confident that the most important task at present is to destroy the British and American enemies. Operations are also actively underway in Europe, and the formation of the Chinese air force is also participating in the joint destruction of the British and American enemies.

### Second Police Bureau to Continue Running the Third Detective Training Class

### German Embassy Tea Party Receives Dr. Walther; The Situation in Sino-Japanese Circles is Enthusiastic

Dr. Walther, a renowned German economist and current German State Councilor, came to China from Tokyo last month to study the current economic situation in our country. He recently arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing. Kurt, the Information Minister of the German Embassy in the city, hosted a grand welcome tea party at the Hua Mao Hotel on the eighth floor yesterday afternoon. Diplomatic figures from our country, including Ambassador Liang Li, attended, as well as figures from the city's press circles, including Li Zhaozhi of the China Guide, Yan Jiabao of the China B Report, Jin Xiongbo of the Ping Bao, Ren Yunzhu of the News Union, and Gu Lu of the Central News Agency. Allied guests included Izubuchi, the Army Reporting Minister, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Matsushima, the Fleet Reporting Minister, Hirota, the Embassy Information Minister, and Secretary Manabe. Participants from the German side included Minister Guode of the Embassy, Consul General Siewillem, Economic Minister Dr. Tramtiek, Consul General Fersiel, Consul Lorton Schlegel, and Commercial Counselor Wendefei, totaling no fewer than 500 people. The scene was unprecedentedly grand and crowded. Information Minister Kurt personally hosted the event, and successively introduced Walther to the arriving guests. He then gave an introductory speech.

Dr. Walther Gave an Impromptu Speech

Walther then gave a speech, roughly stating: "I have traveled through Beijing, Tianjin, Nanjing, and now Shanghai, and everywhere I have seen the remarkable achievements of the new Chinese policy, whether in North or Central China. In particular, the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese authorities has made great progress, which is truly gratifying. The improvement and stabilization of the supply of people's food and necessities, as well as the utilization of China's economic strength in the Greater East Asia War, are all goals of this cooperation. By reducing the difficulty of moving materials and limiting the ability to control the Chinese economy through necessary supervision of production and distribution, it will surely make rapid progress in the future. China's agricultural production capacity and the trading achievements of Chinese merchants have always been praised by the world. The more widespread Sino-Japanese cooperation becomes, and the more the basis of trust in the cooperative work for the benefit of both great nations increases, the sooner China's national economic power will be exerted. German economy has always had a very close relationship with China. Most of the many German expatriates in China represent them, and a large part of them have been engaged in business in East Asia for several generations, which is known to all. As citizens of a friendly and allied nation, Germans are particularly concerned about China's development in unification. All Germans are willing to work hard and cooperate in the planned economic measures for the Chinese military in the areas divided by the war. It is still difficult to predict when this war will end, but on the Axis side, both in Europe and in East Asia, we have not only a strong military force but also a solid economic resource preparation sufficient to cope with a long-term war. The Japanese government in East Asia, as the German government does in Europe, plans to develop this strength and resolutely use it to achieve final victory," and so on.

### Charity and Education Undertaken by Japanese People: Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf

At 271 Dongbaoxing Road, south of Yokohama Bridge, Hongkou, "Old Shanghai" or old Shanghai Christians may still remember that there was a grand and magnificent Christian Huai'en Church there. It was a building that was built with extreme sophistication and in a particularly elegant environment. The withered red old house that inserted into the clouds, below it there were low walls, and on a pair of villa-style gates, now hangs a wooden sign that is a special adornment for the entrance of a Japanese residence, labeled "Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf."

Ringing the doorbell, a kind old woman opened the door, "Ah! You are a Chinese gentleman, coming to visit? I have to ask the Japanese gentleman!"

Crossing the stone-paved courtyard, inside the mansion standing on the right. A Japanese female teacher came out and enthusiastically led the visit to various parts. After a while, the Chinese teacher Mr. Hong Zongyuan finished class and was more willing to talk about everything in the school.

Its predecessor was the "Shanghai Yucai School" at 566 Old Baizi Road. Because the enterprise expanded and deaf students were added, it was renamed "Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf". It specializes in admitting blind and deaf teenagers and young men and women students, teaching them national knowledge and medical school essentials, with the purpose of training personnel in acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and tuina medicine.

School Organization

The organization of the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf stipulates the length of study: one year for the primary grade, two years for the middle school, one year for the vocational course, and annually for the research course. The so-called vocational course includes subjects such as acupuncture, moxibustion, massage, and friction therapy. The research course focuses on the research of "Braille" (i.e., blind people's writing). Each year is divided into two semesters, the same as ordinary schools.

The subjects of blind and deaf education mainly include self-cultivation, Japanese language, history, geography, arithmetic, science, physical education, singing, nosology, anatomy, hygiene, physiology, acupuncture, moxibustion, friction therapy, massage, etc.

The enrollment age is stipulated to be 15 years old for primary school students, 25 years old for middle school students, and those who have graduated from primary school or have equivalent academic qualifications from other schools can also enter the class. The age limit for vocational course students is 35 years old, and they can freely audit classes. The class time is stipulated to be from 9 AM to 3 PM every day. Students who wish to register only need to pay a registration fee of one yuan and submit supporting documents to the school's admissions committee. If they are deemed qualified, they can enroll.

From the perspective of scale, organization, and educational methods, the Shanghai School for the Blind and Deaf is undoubtedly a rare institution for the blind and deaf in Shanghai today.

Intense Teaching

The sound of the piano is melodious in this tall old building. Under the crucifix, the blind students are practicing singing Christian hymns with the blind teacher Mr. Mizutani Gichi. The sound is so loud that it reaches outside the school, as if dozens or hundreds of people are praying and praising. Who knew there were only five students! The teacher said that this is a seed, and he hopes that soon there will be dozens or hundreds of poor and helpless children who will come to praise the final success of the spirit of Christ.

In the literature classroom, the Chinese teacher Mr. Hong Zongyuan is raising his voice and teaching in relatively accurate Mandarin. The blind students, ranging in age from ten to thirty years old, are all copying in notebooks, using special styluses and wax paper to copy Braille. The teachers and students are teaching and learning with all their attention, and the classroom is so tense. However, when you leave the classroom, 閉上門, it is so quiet again, like an old house that has never been inhabited!

Even for Chinese students, Japanese language is still the most important subject. The Japanese language textbooks used are also specially made "Braille" versions. This type of Japanese language "Braille" has fifty basic characters for clear vowel letters, twenty-five characters for voiced consonant letters, thirty characters for contracted sound phonetic Braille, and one hundred and thirty basic letters in total for other long sounds, pauses, beam point symbols, foreign characters, number symbols, Arabic numerals, etc. After being familiar with the spelling of this type of letter, you can use auditory recordings of speeches and speeches, and you can use tactile reading to recite textbooks, books, and magazines. Japan publishes quite a few books and newspapers for the blind. The main one is "Braille Daily," which is edited and published by Suko Kiyoshi and issued by the Mainichi Shimbun. It is published every Thursday, and each issue is about sixteen open pages with ten pages. It already has a history of one thousand one hundred and several dozens of issues, and the school can often receive it as the main spiritual food for blind students.

In order to improve the effectiveness of blind and deaf education, there are also some books on blind and deaf education in the staff room, forming a simple reading room. If the funding is more sufficient and can be expanded a little, it may be more helpful for blind and deaf teachers and students!

Physical Education

### Post-War Monetary System Issues

Recently, bank newsletters have been discussing "the inflation and rectification of the German currency during the previous European War." The intention seems to be to use this as a springboard to draw the attention of the Chinese people to the issue of post-war monetary system rectification in our country. This column also wishes to take this opportunity to join this discussion.

Originally, the war is not over yet. Rectification of the monetary system is fundamentally impossible to talk about. However, as the saying goes, "If you prepare, you will succeed; if you don't prepare, you will fail." We should put in some research efforts on the issue of post-war monetary system rectification before the war is over, as a measure of planning ahead.

Western countries are not short of precedents for post-war monetary system rectification. Further back, there was the monetary system rectification after the American Civil War in the mid-19th century. The pre-war monetary system was restored seven or eight years after the war, so that creditors and long-term savings depositors suffered no losses. Closer to the present, there was Britain's restoration of the gold standard after the last European War, so that creditors and long-term savers did not suffer losses; France's devaluation and restoration of the new gold standard, so that creditors and long-term savers suffered losses together; and Germany's cancellation of old banknotes and adoption of the new gold standard, so that creditors and long-term savers suffered heavy losses.

The direction of our country's post-war monetary system rectification, ideally, will naturally not go beyond one of the four examples mentioned above. However, if we do not talk about the issue of the post-war monetary system, then it is over. Otherwise, the so-called devaluation policy or the policy of maintaining the old currency must be studied one by one, taking the best and making up for the shortcomings, to make the most rational and ideal plan, and to make the people's confidence in the currency its only key. From this, we can achieve the results of stabilizing the people's hearts and suppressing prices. We believe that a strong and people-loving central government must have the ability and methods to formulate and implement a post-war monetary system rectification policy. Because countries around the world today like to talk about post-war recovery plans, we specially raised the issue of the post-war monetary system.

### Rural Welfare Association Promotes Loan Work, Signs Cooperation Agreement with Bank of Communications

Since its establishment, the Chinese Rural Welfare Association has spared no effort in promoting welfare work. To revitalize the rural economy, it has specifically agreed with the Bank of Communications on a temporary method for jointly promoting agricultural finance. After the two parties exchanged documents and formally signed the agreement, a notice was issued to all district rural service centers to establish farmer loan offices immediately upon receiving the order in Pudong to handle agricultural loans. Loan services began on the 20th of this month. A reporter obtained the following details of the method:

Loan Method in Pudong District

Any farmer residing within Pudong District who genuinely needs the funds for agricultural purposes must submit an application form with the seal of the guarantor and a certificate from the local township head to this office (No. 61, Yangjing Baoren Road). After verification, the office will issue a letter of introduction to the Bank of Communications. Upon receiving the application, the Bank of Communications will conduct a review, dispatch personnel for verification, and then issue a notice and a blank IOU to the applicant to complete the loan procedures at the bank. Merchants acting as guarantors are acceptable, without requiring any collateral. The addresses of the stores are limited to Yangjing, Qichang, Dongchang, and Shanghai. The total loan amount is tentatively set at one million yuan, with a monthly interest rate limited to three percent. The loan term is determined based on the actual situation but should not exceed one year. The loan amount per household ranges from one thousand to five thousand yuan, with a maximum of ten thousand yuan. The application period is from November 20th of this year to January 19th of next year, limited to two months, with no extensions.

### Banks and Pawnshops to Change Business Hours from Next Month

The Shanghai Banking Association sent a letter to its member banks stating: "We are writing to inform you that the joint meeting of the banking and pawnshop industries has resolved that, starting from December 1st (Wednesday), the business hours of all banks and pawnshops will be changed to 10:00 AM to 4:00 PM, and on Saturdays from 10:00 AM to 1:00 PM.

### Flour and Wheat Committee's Operations Becoming Increasingly Smooth

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency): Since the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commercial and Trade Commission began handling the purchase of wheat and its distribution to flour mills in various regions, as well as the supply and demand of wheat flour, its operations have become increasingly smooth. It has been learned that for any movement, export, or import of wheat or bran, a transport permit is required. Even with a permit, it must be stamped by the local branch office of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee; otherwise, it will be confiscated. The Commercial and Trade Commission has also obtained the cooperation of the Central China Railway Company and inland waterway shipping companies to implement this measure.

### Restrictions on Applying for Moving Soap-Making Raw Materials Such as Asphalt

The Soap and Candle Industry Association recently wrote to the Commercial and Trade Commission to inquire whether the movement of asphalt is restricted, so as to facilitate its transportation. According to a reporter's inquiry, there are many types of non-edible oils that can be used as raw materials for making soap and candles. The oils commonly used by soap and candle factories in Shanghai include coconut oil, asphalt, green oil, and cottonseed oil. Given the current shortage of the aforementioned raw materials for various factories in Shanghai, and the difficulty in procuring them, to maintain the production volume of Shanghai's soap and candle factories, any applications for moving these materials out will not be approved. The Commercial and Trade Commission has already conveyed this intention to the association in a written response.

### Permits and Approval Letters Must Be Returned on Time

According to a reporter's inquiry with the Commercial and Trade Commission, the material transport permit and material removal approval letter issued by the Commission's Material Movement Permit Office stipulate that the original documents must be returned upon completion of the shipment or expiration of the validity period; otherwise, penalties will be imposed based on the severity of the circumstances.

### Stock Market Trends in Chinese Shares

Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose across the board. The trend of small investors driving up prices has subsided slightly. Some investors are again favoring old stocks, and there is a renewed trend of buying them. As help reappeared, the yarn companies came in, so the latter rose more than the former. Trading was brisk throughout the day. The minds of people from all sides were flustered. The condition of the stocks in each industry are recorded below:

Department Stores: Wing On Company outside the eight passes for a long time, after coming out, returned, and in the end it, Sincere Company, and National Goods all rose slightly. Innerwear and Guohua Department Stores both remained stable.

Jiu An Industrial retreated after knocking on the gate. China-Asia Construction rose again by more than one yuan. China Investment, Standard Flavoring Powder, remained stable. Dahua Livestock buyers are still enthusiastic, and Xinghua buyers are stable. San Le Industrial was bought at 70% above face value, and the momentum was very strong.

Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Unified Public Bonds are flat and weak in the gray market, still suppressed by sales seeking to cash out. Type C rose slightly. Types A, B, D, and E each saw slight increases, but the overall mood remained weak.

Call Loan Interest Rates: The call loan interest rate of the Money Industry Association remained unchanged at 1.7%.

Grain: National rice continued to fall, with 5,000 to 6,000 bags arriving by train. The city's rice reserves are abundant, and there is a sense of oversupply. New japonica rice and Nanjing pointed rice all saw small declines. Small eaters did not enter, and the market mood weakened further.

Miscellaneous Grains: Prices also fell sharply. Sha Huang, selected green beans, and Fatty beans all showed signs of oversupply.

Cigarettes: Mei Li brand alone saw increases. British-American goods have stabilized. Great Britain, Old Knife, Great Front Gate, and Quan Lu were all flat.

Daily Necessities: Transactions were not numerous. Gu Ben White, Xiang Mao Yellow, and Xiang Mao Scissors Soaps were all flat. Mei Li and Phoenix firecrackers were also stable.

### Editorial (Continued from Page One)

However, in my previous paper, I already clearly pointed out that if Germany and Italy were to fail, the wall blocking Soviet influence from infiltrating Europe would be completely gone. At the same time, this means that the pressure suppressing liberalism and communism on the European continent would suddenly disappear. After the demise of fascism in Europe, what will fill the political "vacuum"? One can imagine that the European liberalism and communism, which had been suppressed with great effort due to the existence of the German and Italian regimes, would develop rapidly like bamboo shoots after a spring rain. In particular, the post-war poverty of the masses will provide communism with the best ground for development. This can be understood by referring to the situation after the last World War. During the last World War, there was no large communist base. However, this time, there is a communist Soviet Union in the form of a world power. If the wall of Germany and Italy collapses completely and the Soviet Union takes advantage of its victory to infiltrate post-war Europe, the consequences are self-evident. In that situation, can the United Kingdom and the United States replace Germany and Italy in preventing communism from infiltrating Europe? As a result of the Three-Power Conference, the Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States reached a "compromise," so the Soviet Union may not want to intervene in the West? However, today's problem is not simply whether the Soviet Union wants to, but the rise of communism throughout Europe. The unprecedented and astonishingly huge war of attrition currently taking place in Europe will inevitably cause poverty that is not limited to Germany and Italy. Germany has now transformed the whole of Europe into a great production organization centered on Germany (including a great political institution centered on Germany). So, to take a step back, if, as Chongqing is "sweetly dreaming," Germany disintegrates within this year, then, of course, the entire European production mechanism (including the entire European political mechanism) will also disintegrate accordingly. As a result, one can imagine that the whole of Europe will face unprecedented economic chaos and poverty. If one considers this poverty, it will be exploited by the communists who have been unable to raise their heads in places like Germany, Italy, France, Spain, Hungary, and Poland. What will the European political situation be like at that time? Even an idiot can imagine this problem. However, at that time, the United Kingdom and the United States are still engaged in a large-scale war of attrition with Japan. No matter how hard the United Kingdom and the United States try, they cannot save Europe's economic poverty. What is more, the people of the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the people of the United Kingdom, are also suffering from economic poverty that they do not know when it will end! Therefore, the tide of European communism will probably also spark communist movements in the United Kingdom and the United States, especially the communist movement in the United Kingdom, which will then most likely threaten the status of the ruling classes of the United Kingdom and the United States, who are currently waging war. Given this, the "sweet dream" that the United Kingdom and the United States will solve the European problem, withdraw from Europe, use all their energy to deal with the Greater East Asia battle line, launch a major offensive, defeat Japan, and then offer "final victory" to Chongqing with both hands, cannot but arouse great suspicion.

Of course, the politicians in Chongqing and the United Kingdom and the United States can also foresee this danger. It is precisely because of this reason that they convened the Three-Power Conference in Moscow from October 19th to 30th. They declared that this meeting was "satisfactorily" completed. They bragged that after the end of the war, the Soviet Union vowed to cooperate with the United Kingdom and the United States on European issues. However, this does not mean that after the collapse of Germany, Stalin vowed to jointly suppress the activities of the communist parties in European countries with the United Kingdom and the United States. In his speech on the 26th anniversary of the Soviet Union's October Revolution, which was held shortly after the end of the Three-Power Conference, Stalin said: "After European countries, such as France, Belgium, Yugoslavia, Poland, Greece, etc., are liberated from Hitler's hands, the people of each country will freely decide their political system." In this situation, what does the people's right to self-determination of their political system mean? If the people like the Hitler regime, will they be allowed to freely decide such a political system? Obviously not. Stalin clearly foresaw what kind of political system the European people would "freely decide" at that time. It is precisely for this reason that he made this statement. Waiting for the revolutionary conditions in each country to mature, this is Stalin's consistent policy. Although Trotsky exported Soviet-made revolutions to countries around the world, Stalin, as he clearly stated when he met H.G. Wells, will adopt the policy of "not exporting revolutions abroad." The Soviet Union's attitude at the Three-Power Conference is sufficient to prove its great confidence in the political situation in post-war Europe, that is, in the maturing of the conditions for the communist revolution. As the German Foreign Ministry declared on November 2nd, the Three-Power Conference: "Is the Soviet Union's victory in Europe, the United Kingdom and the United States' failure, is nothing more than the fact that the whole of Europe will succumb to Bolshevism." Although the United Kingdom and the United States and Chongqing know the danger of Bolshevism, they have to use the Soviet Union's statement as a way to quench their thirst with poison. This proves the urgent situation. This is just like an opium addict who knows that smoking opium will lead to death, but cannot help but continue to smoke it. And the most obvious example of this disease is, of course, the Chongqing government, the weakest link in what they call the "world's four major powers."

Stalin also said in the same speech: "Last year, the Axis forces on the Eastern Front numbered 240 divisions, of which 179 were German divisions, but this year there are 257 divisions, of which the German army reached 207 divisions." This is clearly a veiled reference to the powerlessness of the United Kingdom and the United States. Looking at this, one can also understand that if Germany fails in Europe one day, the Soviet Union will declare its position to the world—I am the one who defeated Germany. The Soviet Union's prestige in the world will immediately directly affect the development of the communist forces in various countries. Especially in China, which is connected to the Soviet Union's border and has the largest communist party after the Soviet Communist Party, its political influence will definitely be greater. What will be the fate of the Chongqing regime at that time? This is a question that Chiang Kai-shek must consider again and again. But the answer to this question, of course, is not to be found in the mind, but must be found in the course of the cooperation between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party.

### YMCA Holds Charity Bazaar to Collect Winter Clothing, Uses Vouchers Instead of Cash

To actively carry out the winter clothing drive, the YMCA of Shanghai will hold a charity bazaar on the second floor of the Baisen Building from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 28th of this month, with a target of 100,000 yuan. The items for sale will be products, antiques, calligraphy, paintings, jewelry, etc., that have been solicited from major companies, manufacturers, or private individuals. Since the preparations began, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have responded with assistance, donating items worth approximately 60,000 to 70,000 yuan. However, the goal has not yet been reached. It is hoped that major companies, manufacturers, and enthusiastic people will donate items. It is also hoped that philanthropists in the city will respond and compete to purchase, both obtaining real objects and helping the poor. The "Fu Lu Chang Chun" painting is now scheduled to be displayed in the YMCA Library in Baisen Bridge starting this Thursday. All are welcome to visit.

All items sold at this charity bazaar will not use cash, but will use vouchers specially printed by the YMCA. These vouchers are divided into four types: 5 yuan, 10 yuan, 50 yuan, and 100 yuan. They are now on sale at the YMCA information centers on Sichuan Road and Baisen Bridge. It is hoped that all sectors will actively purchase them.

### Children's Welfare Association Distributes Winter Clothing Early

The China Children's Welfare Association has a remaining stock of 500 sets of new cotton-padded clothes and trousers for children aged four to fourteen from the winter clothing drive for poor children in the city last year. Due to the sudden cold at the beginning of winter, the Association is distributing these winter clothes early so that general poor children can have the necessary items to protect themselves from the cold and get through the severe winter. Children who need winter clothing can go directly to the Association (Room 208, Zhonghui Building, Edward Road) to apply for distribution. According to Ding Bingnan, the general affairs officer of the Association, the price of each set of winter clothing last year was 30 yuan, but this year it must be over 300 yuan. Moreover, due to the fabric situation, it is not possible to produce them in large quantities at present. The Association welcomes donations of new or used cotton-padded clothes, sanitary shirts, shoes, socks, etc., and will distribute them on your behalf.

### Two Ms. Wangs' Paintings Support Education

Ms. Wang Dezhu and Ms. Wang Shiru are holding an exhibition and charity sale of their recent works at the Shanghai Art Gallery (intersection of Zhejiang Road and Xiepo Road). Half of the proceeds will be donated to the school's scholarship fund and the Xinwen Bao's scholarship loan fund. The opening was held the day before yesterday (until the 28th). The reporter visited yesterday. The calligraphy is old and vigorous, which is rare among women. The paintings, including figures, landscapes, flowers, and birds, are all vivid and lifelike. People from all walks of life are contributing to the purchase, both obtaining valuable calligraphy and paintings and benefiting the Confucian community and poor students. A double benefit, don't miss it. (Sun Choucheng)

### Letter from the Chinese Health Association to All Physicians

The Chinese Health Association is conducting a free X-ray examination of 10,000 citizens' lungs this month. In addition to the Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao Social Service Departments distributing the free X-ray examination vouchers, the Association is also requesting all physicians of the Physicians' Association to distribute them uniformly. To aid the poor and sick, the letter states that pulmonary tuberculosis is rampant in the city. The Association, despite its limited resources, is conducting free X-ray examinations for 10,000 people. On the principle of not increasing the burden on citizens, the Association aims to raise social awareness of tuberculosis prevention and provide opportunities for early diagnosis and treatment. We are now sending ten examination vouchers and request that you distribute them to poor patients. If they come for examination, a report will be immediately provided. The examination report will still be reviewed by your esteemed physicians, so that patients can be diagnosed early and treatment can be started as soon as possible. We hope to use the power of the community to achieve the great effect of prevention.
