### European War Situation Review

Since the Tehran Conference of the United States, the Soviet Union, and Great Britain, there has been much speculation about the international war situation, especially regarding the so-called "Second Front," which has attracted much attention. However, after reviewing the entire war situation, we must still recognize that the focus of the European war is still on the Eastern Front. Regardless of how the so-called "Second Front" will perform, the future direction of the European situation will ultimately depend on the trend of the Eastern Front. This is because the Eastern Front still absorbs the largest number of troops and combat power from both sides, which cannot be compared with the forces in the Mediterranean or the Northwest European seas. In reality, it seems that Britain and the United States are still adhering to the principle of not making a reckless gamble until Germany and the Soviet Union have staged a decisive battle on the Eastern Front and suffered huge losses on both sides.

So, what particularly noteworthy phenomena are there on the Eastern Front today? From a seasonal perspective, the vast war zone on the Eastern Front has entered its third winter of combat. Based on the experience of the German-Soviet war, "General Winter" was originally the Soviet Union's greatest ally, and the Soviet side repeatedly used the harsh winter to launch major offensives. Here, people cannot help but recall the "Tragedy of Stalingrad" at this time last year. However, "General Winter," who was once a friend of the Soviet army, has now arrived on the Eastern Front, but a phenomenon very different from last year has occurred.

Since launching continuous fierce attacks in July of this year, the Soviet army has attempted to take advantage of the autumn-winter transition and seasonal changes to force the German army to withdraw. However, to the surprise of international observers, after continuously conducting its defensive and retreating battles, the German army, at the time of the autumn-winter transition, which was generally considered unfavorable to them, actually launched a fierce offensive, taking back the strategic key point of Zhytomyr in the central sector in one fell swoop, causing the main Soviet force in Kyiv to feel a great threat. Strategically speaking, the Soviet army originally planned to advance in a wedge shape from the central sector, cutting off the German army in the western part of the Dnieper River into two sections, encircling the German army in Crimea in the south, and forcing the German army to withdraw from Ukraine and even the borders of Belarus in the north. However, after extreme forbearance, the German army finally launched a counter-offensive, initially thwarting the Soviet plan. It can be seen that the prelude to this winter's battle is very different from last year's situation.

Since summer and autumn, the Soviet army's certain degree of advantage in terms of territory is a fact. But on the other hand, it should be noted that the destruction work carried out by the German army when abandoning a certain occupied territory is actually the most serious burden for the Soviet side, both militarily and politically. The Soviet Union must not only expend huge amounts of manpower and materials on this vast ruin, transportation equipment and other expenses, but also consume a large amount of troops for defensive purposes, making it virtually impossible to carry out a fierce counter-offensive this winter. On the contrary, the German army's combat power has been concentrated and strengthened, and the counter-offensive in Zhytomyr is just a small test of its capabilities.

Now, the Soviet Union still admits the strength of the German army and cannot but redouble its concentration of combat power. The intensity of the battles in various sectors of the Eastern Front is also intensifying because the Soviet army dares not temporarily relax its continued offensive. This winter on the Eastern Front is destined to continue a staggering war of attrition. What we should pay attention to now is whether Britain and the United States, which have always harbored the conspiracy of letting Germany and the Soviet Union exhaust each other, can still watch from the sidelines after granting the Soviet Union's demands at the Tehran Conference, at this turning point in the Eastern Front war? It is no wonder that Churchill is ill and Roosevelt is busy dealing with domestic labor unrest and economic crises.

### Results of Bombing Japanese Naval Air Force Near Magas: Over Forty Ships Sunk or Damaged in Two Attacks

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:05 PM on the 22nd: The Japanese in-depth and meticulous military air force conducted an air raid on enemy transport convoys near Magas Village on the morning of the 21st, achieving the following results: In the first attack, two enemy large transport ships, four or five special transport ships (or medium-sized transport ships), two cruisers (or large destroyers), and one landing ship were sunk; one enemy destroyer was damaged (severely damaged and on fire); and many small boats were damaged. In this operation, a total of five Japanese aircraft self-destructed or did not return. In the second attack, two enemy special transport ships, two torpedo boats, and approximately thirty landing craft were sunk; one factory destroyer was damaged (severely damaged and on fire); one submarine chaser was damaged (severely damaged); one transport ship was damaged (severely damaged); and many landing craft were damaged (severely damaged). Four or more enemy aircraft were shot down. In this operation, a total of five Japanese aircraft self-destructed or did not return. Furthermore, enemy transport ships and landing craft were all fully loaded with naval personnel and military supplies.

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – The enemy landing forces at Cape Magas and the islands of Bileru and Aroe in New Britain suffered extremely heavy damage due to repeated fierce attacks by Japanese army and navy aircraft and ground forces. However, on the morning of the 21st, enemy ships escorted transport ships and sailed to Cape Magas. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese forces bravely launched an attack, tracking and inflicting heavy damage on the enemy convoy loaded with soldiers and military supplies. The results have already been announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters. However, the enemy, disregarding sacrifices, launched another series of landing operations in the afternoon, with large ships and aircraft providing cover. Japanese naval aircraft immediately dispatched and launched a fierce attack before the enemy could land. Combining the results of these two attacks, a total of 43 to 44 enemy ships were sunk, and more than four were damaged. It is reported that the enemy dispatched more than 60 ships in total, so their losses have reached five-sevenths of the total.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 22nd that Japanese aircraft attacked Goodenough Island on the 20th, causing considerable damage and casualties.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from San Francisco, the Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese aircraft had launched a large-scale attack on an Anti-Axis convoy off the coast of the Huon Peninsula, sinking one merchant ship.

### Battle on New Britain Island Intensifies: Japanese Forces Crush Enemy Attempts with Strong Attacks

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Since a part of the enemy forces landed on a part of Cape Magas on New Britain Island and the islands of Bileru and Aroe on the 15th, the battle situation has become increasingly fierce. The enemy forces, attempting to establish a beachhead at the landing site, have been using aircraft and boats to carry out fierce shelling of the landing forces daily, attempting to resupply and reinforce them. The Japanese naval air force, in close cooperation with the ground forces and army aircraft, has repeatedly launched strong attacks on the enemy forces and their boats, thwarting their attempts, and the enemy landing forces have encountered a crisis. However, the enemy forces are still repeatedly reinforcing with transport convoys in the sea area under Japanese air supremacy, so the enemy's losses are also increasing daily, as the Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 22nd. Geographically speaking, this sea area is different from the central Pacific sea area or the sea area near Bougainville Island. It is under the strong air control of the Japanese forces. Although the enemy has many bases on the Trobriand Islands, Goodenough Island, Woodlark Island, and New Guinea, it cannot compare with the distance from Rabaul to Magas for the Japanese forces. Although the enemy has already landed at Cape Magas, Bileru Island, and Aroe Island, if they cannot establish air force bases in these areas, then the enemy's ambition to occupy New Britain Island will definitely be difficult to achieve.

Content of the Address

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently Minister of Munitions, delivered an address at the Japanese Provisional Local Governors' Conference on the 22nd. The main points are as follows: Today, the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia are cooperating and uniting as one with Japan, making the abundant resources of Greater East Asia into war capabilities day by day. As a result, Japan's war capabilities are increasing dramatically, while the suffering of the enemy, Britain and the United States, in both material and spiritual terms, is gradually deepening. Therefore, their politicians must defeat Japan before they find themselves in a desperate situation, otherwise the outcome of this war will definitely not be what they hope for. It is expected that the fighting in the future will become even more intense, as now is a good opportunity to attack the enemy. If we crush the enemy's counter-offensive at this time, their will to fight will definitely be lost. To deal with the above situation, our urgent task is to enhance our air war capabilities. Regarding guidance in this area, I hope that you will make even greater efforts. The convening of this local governors' conference is centered on the issue of enhancing air war capabilities. I will briefly describe the main points of increasing production at this time: Regarding munitions production, especially the increase in aircraft production, when considering all related departments, it is essential to maintain balance as a basic condition. However, what needs to be recognized more deeply is that the two most important conditions for production are transportation and labor. Today, transportation has become the lifeline for completing the war. In order to ensure and strengthen transportation capacity, the entire nation must work together to devise countermeasures. The government has made great efforts in this regard so far, and is also actively implementing policies in close coordination with the Imperial Headquarters. As for the labor issue, it does not only refer to increasing the number of people, but also to improving the productivity of workers as the top priority. Therefore, the current urgent tasks are to rationalize labor allocation, thoroughly implement the principle of placing the right person in the right job, and improve labor management. Furthermore, the number of domestic factories and establishments has increased sharply in recent years, with many new establishments or expansions. The government will fully utilize these, striving to supervise their increased production of aircraft, artillery, warships, etc., for use on the front lines. I deeply hope for your concern and cooperation in this regard. Finally, I would like to say a word about boosting national morale. In short, today's war is a war between people and people, a war between wills and wills. Japan has absolutely no possibility of defeat. With three years of complete and flawless unity, and the spirit of a hundred million people serving the country with loyalty, we will surely preserve the glory of our tradition. Moreover, the Greater East Asia War is a war of righteousness. The war situation at any given time may inevitably experience advances and retreats, but the final victory will surely belong to us. Therefore, all the nations and peoples of Greater East Asia are cooperating closely with each other under the firm determination expressed in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, moving towards a common goal. With the unified strength of the minds and bodies of these one billion people, we can defeat Britain and the United States. Therefore, I firmly believe that we will surely achieve final victory.

### Chairman Wang's Removal of a Bullet Fragment from His Back; Publicity Department Announces Positive Results; Chen, Zhou, and Bao to Assume Separate Responsibilities for Political Affairs

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The Publicity Department issued the following public announcement at 5:00 PM on December 22nd: "Chairman Wang underwent surgery on the morning of the 19th to remove a bullet fragment lodged in his back from an injury sustained eight years ago. The bullet was completely extracted, and the procedure went extremely well."

During the treatment period, the Supreme National Defense Council and the Military Affairs Commission will be handled by Committee Member Chen Bo. Administrative Yuan meetings and daily political affairs will be overseen by Deputy Director Fo Hai. Daily affairs of the Military Affairs Commission will be handled by Chief of General Staff Bao Wen-yue, each responsible for their respective areas. Major military, political, and diplomatic strategies will still involve summoning relevant officials for personal instructions as needed.

It is to be noted that Chairman Wang was injured in an assassination attempt on November 1st of the 24th year of the Republic (1935), after a group photo following the opening ceremony of the Sixth Plenary Session of the Kuomintang. At that time, international affairs were brewing major changes. Although Sino-Japanese relations had a chance to improve, Britain and the United States favored a Sino-Japanese conflict and promoted the so-called "Leith-Ross currency plan." This plan aimed to both fuel the flames of the resistance faction and exploit our cash reserves, control our financial institutions, and dominate our lifeline for overseas purchases. Simultaneously, Soviet Russia, while making diplomatic compromises to advance into Europe, was also stirring up unrest in East Asia through communist activities. The conspiracy of both was nothing more than to ignite the flames of war on the East Asian continent first, to delay the opportunity for war in Europe and to fulfill their desire to control and manipulate. In such a precarious and volatile situation, whether the stability of the overall situation in East Asia could be maintained to cope with global changes, or whether it would be the first to bear the brunt and ultimately be sacrificed, was truly the boundary between fortune, misfortune, safety, and danger for China's future and the future of East Asia. At that time, Chairman Wang, serving as both Premier and Foreign Minister, carefully examined the national situation and observed the broader trends, deeply concerned about the dangers and anticipating potential disasters. The policy he set was to seek an improvement in Sino-Japanese relations, and even if that was not possible, to prevent them from deteriorating. He spared no effort in crushing the activities of disguised communists. He firmly rejected the sweetened poison offered by Britain and the United States. As Premier and Foreign Minister, Chairman Wang's signature was required for the Leith-Ross currency agreement to take effect. Unfortunately, apart from a few who embraced Britain and the United States and were used by them, most of those who loudly advocated resistance believed that the agreement's completion would ensure financial security. They completely ignored Chairman Wang's painstaking foresight, even viewing it with hostility. The conspirators seized the opportunity, plotting every scheme imaginable, leading to Chairman Wang being attacked. His injuries were too severe, forcing him to resign, and the precarious and volatile situation ultimately became unmanageable. A year later, the Xi'an Incident occurred, and in July of the following year, the flames of the Marco Polo Bridge Incident were ignited.

Chairman Wang suffered three gunshot wounds. One passed through his left arm, and another was in his left cheek, with fragments and bone splinters removed seven days after the injury. A third bullet entered from behind, lodging next to the fifth lumbar vertebra. For eight years, he periodically experienced numbness and pain in his back. Chairman Wang was preoccupied with national affairs and did not have time to address it. In August of this year, he began experiencing pain in his back, chest, and both sides, traveling between Nanjing and Shanghai for months, crossing to Japan for meetings and lectures, inspecting Qingxiang, managing the military, and diligently administering the government, working even harder than usual. The numbness and pain intensified accordingly. Cadres, comrades, and Allied authorities were deeply concerned and recommended specialized physicians for examination, who believed it was related to the bullet in his back. Subsequently, they consulted with Allied military doctors, who conducted thorough examinations at the Allied Army Hospital, concluding that it was caused by the bullet in his back, and a decision was made to perform surgery. Commander Goto led the surgical team, conducting meticulous examinations, making a clear diagnosis, and preparing thoroughly. The surgery was swift, taking only twenty minutes to extract the bullet completely, and the procedure went extremely well. The Allied medical skills were truly admirable. Moreover, Chairman Wang was not only impressed by the high level of surgical skill at the Army Hospital but also by the thoughtful and sincere treatment he received. Cadres and comrades were equally impressed, and Foreign Minister Chu immediately expressed gratitude to the Allied authorities on behalf of our government.

Talks by Commander Horii

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Chairman Wang underwent surgery on the morning of the 19th to remove a bullet fragment lodged in his back from an injury sustained eight years ago. The bullet was completely extracted, and the procedure went extremely well. Allied Commander Horii made the following statement regarding this: After undergoing X-ray examinations and thorough preparations at the Army Hospital, Chairman Wang was operated on by Commander Goto on the morning of the 19th at 10:40 AM to remove the bullet from his back. Approximately twenty minutes later, the bullet was completely extracted. Chairman Wang did not experience any pain during the surgery, and his recovery has been very smooth. There is minimal pain in the surgical area, his sleep is sound, his appetite is normal, and his temperature and pulse are all within normal ranges. He is expected to make a full recovery in about a week. It is believed that this surgery will completely remove all previous obstacles to his health. In the future, Chairman Wang's health will be even better than before, which is a cause for mutual celebration.

The Entire Nation Feels the Same Joy

Nanjing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the announcement of the positive results of Chairman Wang's surgery to remove the bullet fragment from his back, government officials, the entire nation, and friends from Allied countries have expressed their deep joy and relief beyond words. During Chairman Wang's surgery at the Army Hospital, not only were the military doctors highly skilled, quickly removing the bullet, but the treatment was also particularly thoughtful and sincere. The entire nation, both high and low, is deeply impressed by the genuine enthusiasm and advanced medical skills of the Allies. Especially at this time when China and Japan are sharing life and death together, and East Asian nations are sincerely united in striving for a decisive victory, recalling Chairman Wang's painstaking foresight eight years ago, bearing the burden for the nation and for East Asia, and his spirit of remaining calm and composed in the face of danger at the time of his injury, shining through the pool of blood, is still deeply imprinted in our hearts, filling us with a mixture of emotions, turning sorrow into strength, and increasing our courage. We are further reminded of the events that have unfolded in Sino-Japanese relations, the overall situation in East Asia, and the global situation over the past eight years, how the unfortunate incidents occurred, how the peace movement overcame obstacles to advance, how the Greater East Asia War victoriously unfolded, and how the alliance treaty and joint declaration were established. This has deepened the nation's understanding of the ferocious face of Anglo-American aggression, deepened its recognition of the Allies' sincerity in befriending and assisting us, and deepened its belief in reviving China and protecting East Asia. Under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we will fulfill the alliance treaty, implement the declaration, defeat Anglo-America, complete the war, save China, and protect East Asia.

US Air Force in Chongqing Suffers Deadly Blow

Tokyo, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to a Japanese military base report, the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing took advantage of the rainy season in Burma to vigorously strengthen its forces via the air transport route between Tinsukia and Kunming. It placed its main bomber force around Kunming and used Guilin, Lingling, and Suichuan as forward bases, intending to launch a guerrilla counterattack at the opportunity. In response, the Japanese army air force frequently launched attacks on their bases, intercepting their counterattacks, repeatedly inflicting deadly blows. At the same time, they blockaded the air transport route between Tinsukia and Kunming, forcing the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing into dire straits. It is reported that since the beginning of this year, the elite Japanese army air force in Burma has shot down approximately 700 enemy planes. Furthermore, since November 17th, they have repeatedly intercepted the China-India air transport route and fiercely attacked the Tinsukia airfield, continuously shooting down or destroying 69 enemy planes. On the 18th, they unexpectedly attacked the Kunming airfield, shooting down or destroying 22 enemy planes.

### The Third Batch of Enemy Property in North China Continues to Be Transferred to Our Country, Totaling Fifty-Eight Items Including Churches and Schools

Beijing, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - Since the Japanese government's second notification on October 28th of this year to transfer the administration of enemy property in North China to the Chinese side, preparations have been underway.

### Bolivia's New Cabinet Announces Policy Guidelines

No Change in Foreign Policy

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - The new Bolivian cabinet was officially formed on the afternoon of the 21st, with Easton Soruco taking office as Prime Minister. After the establishment of the new cabinet, a declaration was issued as follows: The old government squandered national funds, acted improperly, abused its power for personal gain, and failed to uphold national interests. The Bolivian people and young Bolivian soldiers have resolutely risen up and overthrown the regime. In addition, Secretary-General Pinsba Mousse announced the new government's political program as follows: Bolivia's natural resources must be developed as much as possible for the benefit of the majority of Bolivian citizens. In the past, foreign companies have not considered Bolivia's interests in the development of these natural resources. We will closely cooperate with the United States, but we must safeguard Bolivia's interests. Many Bolivian citizens are still backward in economic and educational aspects, so we will strive for the rapid development of the general public in the economic and educational fields in the future.

Buenos Aires, 22nd (Central News Agency Dispatch) - According to the German news agency: Bolivia has formally notified South American countries of the change of government.

### The Future of the North China Development Company and the Central China Development Company (2)

As mentioned above, both companies can hardly rely on share capital for funding and will inevitably have to continue receiving government subsidies in the future. Although nominally joint-stock companies, they can actually be regarded as similar to public corporations. Therefore, based on the current situation, it can be seen that their character as public corporations will be further strengthened in the future. As a result, some people advocate that they should be decisively reorganized into public corporations. With a clearer character, their work would be easier. Although this reporter may not necessarily advocate for reorganization into public corporations, I feel that there is a real need for reorganization if the current institutions are to be responsible for operations. In essence, only after transforming into public corporations can they abandon their insistence on profits and implement the ideal of moving towards the nation.

In the case of new equipment construction for mining in Central China, the Central China Development Company's lending rates are too high, so they rely on the Industrial Equipment Public Corporation. This situation occurred because the Central China Development Company insisted on the concept of a joint-stock company and could not provide low-interest loans. With changes in the environment and character of the aforementioned two companies, future operations must correspond to this. If they insist on the concept of a joint-stock company and cannot engage in national policy operations, then a change in the structure seems necessary! In short, from the perspective of private shares, because a six-percent dividend is guaranteed, it can be regarded as Dongsi, which has securitized fixed interest.

The current situation of the two companies is reported as follows:

North China Development

First, to adapt to the decisive battle, the organization is being reformed. The head office is being moved from Tokyo to Beijing to thoroughly implement the principle of emphasizing on-site operations. The previously complex structures are being consolidated into the President's Office, the First Management Department (responsible for transportation, communication, and electricity), the Second Management Department (responsible for coal mining, mining, iron and steel manufacturing, chemical industry, and others), the Planning Bureau, and the Investigation Department.

The company is currently focusing on the chemical industry, iron and steel manufacturing, and so on. Last year, it jointly established the North China Nitrogen Fertilizer Company (capital of 40 million yen) with a Japanese company, and the North China Iron and Steel Company (capital of 100 million yen, with equal investment) with Nippon Steel. Both companies have already started operations. Companies that are about to be established include Qingdao Iron and Steel and North China Light Metals. The former is in cooperation with Nippon Kokan, using the iron ore in Jinchenzhen to produce iron and steel, with a capital of approximately 50 million yen. Part of the project has been completed and is about to start operations. North China Light Metals is in cooperation with the Light Metals Control Company, planning to use alumina shale to produce aluminum, with a planned capital of 30 million yen. The company must make huge investments in these new ventures.

The company's performance in the seventeenth fiscal year was good. Although expenses increased due to rising prices, the profit increased by 816,000 yen compared to the previous year. In addition, government subsidies decreased by 748,000 yen, while repayments increased by 3.157 million yen, so the overall performance actually improved significantly. Given that North China Transportation's first dividend is expected to be 8.687 million yen this year, it seems that there will be at least that much profit increase. However, due to rising prices and increased investment and lending, it is difficult to predict how much the performance can improve.

Central China Development

Central China plans to adjust the companies under its umbrella. The adjustments have already been implemented for Central China Silk and Central China Salt. In terms of Central China Silk, the 31 factories and 3 warehouses contributed in kind by the Chinese side will be appropriately evaluated and transferred to the original owners, and the company will be temporarily dissolved. The short-fiber silk weaving and wool processing departments will be transferred to a new company to be established in the future. In terms of the salt industry, the Haizhou salt fields and the shares held by the Japanese side (2 million yen for the Development Company and 500,000 yen for other Japanese entities) will be transferred to the Chinese side, becoming a purely Chinese company. A new company will be established to inherit the business (capital of approximately 5 million yen), and it is planned to engage in the chemical industry of salt raw materials in a Sino-Japanese cooperative manner. Due to the aforementioned adjustments, the company's income has decreased. The silk company's dividend is 8 percent, and the salt industry's dividend is 10 percent. The company's investment in each is 2 million yen, so the total reduction is 360,000 yen. Fortunately, the company's recent performance has been quite good. The government subsidy from the previous year has also been repaid, but considering the rising prices and increased investment in the future, the aforementioned reduction in income will indeed have a significant impact. However, the aforementioned income problem should not be the concern of the company. (End) (Xiang: Translated from Toyo Keizai Shinpo, No. 2099)

### Regulations for Registering Specially Taxed Imported Goods Established; Tax Bureau Sets Implementation Date for January

Central News Agency Report: The Ministry of Finance's Tax Bureau believes that the Provisional Regulations for Special Temporary Taxes on Tung Oil, Tea, Bristles, and Down apply only to domestically produced goods of those categories. Since there are no tax provisions for goods imported from abroad, they are exempt from taxation. As a result, merchants often mix domestically produced goods with imported goods to evade taxes for profit, which hinders tax revenue. The bureau has established nine Provisional Measures for Registering Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down Subject to Special Temporary Taxes. These measures have been submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval in conjunction with the Customs Administration, instructing all merchants to comply with the measures from January 1, 1944. All those engaged in the import of Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down must register with the bureau or complete procedures for separate transport, transfer, or repackaging.

Measures for Registering Specially Taxed Imported Goods

Article 1: Tung Oil, Tea, Hog Bristles, and Down imported from abroad shall be subject to the registration procedures according to these measures, in addition to the exemption from temporary special taxes as stipulated in the Temporary Special Tax Regulations. Article 2: When specially taxed goods arrive from abroad, the original transporting merchant shall fill out an application form, and submit it together with the customs import tax bill to the Tax Bureau for registration. The quantity and quality of the goods shall be verified, and after approval, a "Registration Certificate for Specially Taxed Imported Goods" shall be issued. In addition, a "Inspection Certificate for Specially Taxed Imported Goods" shall be affixed to each package's important sealed portions, with the official stamp and date stamp to serve as proof. Article 3: If registered specially taxed imported goods need to be transported separately, transferred, or repackaged and sold, the merchant shall fill out a separate application form and submit it along with the original certificate to the Tax Bureau for verification and issuance of a separate transport permit, transfer certificate, or repackaging transport permit. If repackaging is involved, the original inspection certificate must be removed, and a new repackaging inspection certificate must be affixed. All permits and certificates must be stamped with the words "Specially Taxed Imported Goods" to facilitate inspection and release. Article 4: If a merchant imports specially taxed goods without registering as required upon arrival and is discovered by the inspection authorities, in addition to completing the registration, a fine of up to 2,000 yuan shall be imposed. Article 5: If registered specially taxed imported goods need to be transported separately, transferred, or repackaged without applying for a separate transport permit, transfer certificate, or repackaging transport permit, and are moved without authorization, a fine of up to 1,000 yuan shall be imposed. Article 6: If a merchant uses old containers of specially taxed imported goods to package domestic specially taxed goods, hoping to fraudulently evade taxes, the goods shall be confiscated and confiscated after confirmation, and a fine of up to ten times the tax amount shall be imposed. Article 7: If a merchant forges registration certificates and inspection certificate stamps for specially taxed imported goods, hoping to simplify the process and avoid registration, they shall be transferred to the judicial authorities for investigation and prosecution once verified. Article 8: These measures may be amended at any time if there are any unaddressed matters. Article 9: These measures shall take effect from the date of approval.

### New Price Limits for Coal Balls Revised Today; 1,260 Yuan per Ton Delivered to Users

### Recent Battle Situation of Japanese Army in China and Burma: Remarks by Japanese Army Spokesman

Central News Agency report: The spokesman of the reporting department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai, yesterday at 3:00 PM, made a statement on the battle situation of the Japanese Army in China and Burma at the regular reporting session, which is recorded as follows:

Regarding land operations, the spokesman first discussed the situation of the Japanese Army's operations against the Chongqing Communists in China. Since the start of the Japanese Army's operation to clear the Communist forces in northern Jiangsu, the Communist base areas have been thoroughly destroyed, and the operation concluded on November 8th of this year. During this operation, 143 enemy ships were sunk, and a large amount of spoils of war were seized. As for the winter offensive launched by the Chongqing side in central China around Dongting Lake, after the capture of Changde in the sixth war zone of Chongqing, the Chongqing's second reinforcement army, the 58th Army and the 3rd Army, moved north from the ninth war zone to provide assistance. The Japanese Army Air Force launched a dense attack on them and launched an annihilation battle. As of today, the Chongqing troops annihilated, defeated, and destroyed in this battle include the 73rd Army, the 100th Army, the 99th Army, the 44th Army, the 19th Army, the 74th Army, the 79th Army, the 66th Army, the 18th Army, and other units, totaling 28 divisions. No fewer than 11 division commanders were killed in battle. Therefore, Chongqing suffered a significant blow in this battle, especially in terms of material, spiritual, military, and economic aspects. Xue Yue, commander of the Ninth War Zone in Chongqing, once told the local people that the Japanese troops stationed in China were strong and that past estimates had been too low. He warned them not to be complacent, as the Japanese army might launch another attack. This shows Chongqing's fear of the Japanese army. Moreover, the biggest weakness of the Chongqing army is that it concentrates its forces on the front line, while the rear is weakly deployed. If the elite troops on the front line are defeated by the Japanese army, a chaotic collapse is unimaginable. From this perspective, after Changde was captured by the Japanese army, the situation in its rear can be imagined.

Air War Situation

Continuing to describe the air operations, the Japanese Air Force stationed in China directly assisted the land operations troops, continuously attacking Chongqing's base areas and the US Air Force base areas in Chongqing, and continuously bombing them, ultimately inflicting considerable damage. This month, from the 4th to the 12th, the Japanese Air Force continuously bombed Hengyang, Lingling, Wuzhou, Shaoguan, and other Chongqing base areas, shooting down 44 enemy aircraft and setting 40 on fire. And on the morning of the "21st", a joint large formation of the most elite fighter-bombers of the Japanese army also raided the Guilin Airport in Guangxi, fiercely bombing Chongqing's latest facilities, dropping bombs like rain. The airport was hit at the time, and it was extremely chaotic. Since then, many battle results have been obtained. At that time, due to the heavy fog, detailed battle results could not be counted, but the damage to the airport was obviously not light. In addition, a joint large formation of fighter-bombers flew to Changsha, an important gateway to Chongqing, attacking Hengyang Airport and various facilities, causing considerable damage. Moreover, since Changde was occupied by the Japanese army, the Changsha area was most frightened, and its embarrassment was beyond description.

Burma Battle Situation

Next, the battle situation in Burma was described. Since the Japanese army drove the Chongqing-based expeditionary force stationed in Burma, which attempted to launch an offensive, east of the Nujiang River, and has been preparing to wait for orders to start another offensive, there have been small-scale movements by the enemy in the Pochiton area on the border between India and Burma, which have been defeated by the Japanese army at any time. The enemy air force carried out guerrilla warfare or disturbances in the front line and rear base areas of the Japanese army, totaling 140 sorties around the beginning of this month, with 1,530 aircraft dispatched, averaging 44 sorties per day. The Japanese air force gave surprise attacks every time, so the Japanese air force units stationed there calmly repelled the enemy at any time. The air raids shattered the Chongqing-US Air Force's supply base in Dinsukia, causing heavy losses and destroying a large number of aircraft, which was a fatal blow to Chongqing and the United States. Therefore, the Anglo-American offensive in Burma cannot be said to be without an active stage, but because it has been severely attacked by the Japanese army every time, it has been unable to carry out large-scale disturbances. At the same time, the East Asian National United Army in India has launched an offensive towards Hossama in Bengal. The future outcome and how the enemy will stir are foreseeable.

Economic Commentary

### Extinguishing the Flames of Rampant Price Increases

Recently, the price increase trend in this city has been rampant, forming a prairie fire, and speculative merchants, seduced by the idea of ​​profiteering, are not hesitating to add fuel to the fire. Looking around every corner of the city, the prices marked on goods, from inside the shop windows to on the edges of the roads, change several times a day, each change becoming higher, which is a phenomenon rarely seen in countries participating in the war that implement price controls.

Such a rampant flame of price increases only plunges the public into deep water and scorching fire, and finally makes the authorities feel that they cannot sit idly by. Therefore, the city's Price Review Committee is scheduled to convene an emergency meeting today to discuss emergency effective measures. The attendees of the meeting will include the heads of the city's Economic, Food, and Police Bureaus, as well as the Commercial Control Committee, the Rice Control Committee, the Cotton Control Committee, and the Economic Offices of the First and Eighth Districts. The situation is very similar to the concentration of fire trucks from all sides to put out a major fire, which fully shows the seriousness of the price situation in the city.

The so-called how to increase the source of materials? How to smooth the transportation of materials? How to enable commercial associations and consumer groups to jointly assist the government in adjusting consumption? Although these are all fundamental ways to suppress price increases, considering the current situation, it feels like they are slow to take effect. Therefore, we can only seek temporary solutions first, just like a patient in the throes of a fever, we must first suppress the heat before slowly conditioning. The Allied country of Japan had a so-called "September 18" price freeze order on September 18th of Showa 14 (1939), stipulating that for the past four years, all kinds of goods must be marked with officially set prices and quality standards, and no violation is allowed. This is what our Price Review Committee should learn from today.

### Trade Associations Request Establishment of District Offices for Convenient Control and Guidance

Recently, the main trade associations in this city have stated that the districts of Fengxian, Nansi, Beiqiao, Chuansha, and Chongming, which they belong to, are too far away from the association's headquarters, making it inevitable that they will be unable to attend to all concerns in terms of control and guidance. Therefore, they have all requested the Commercial Control Committee to allow them to establish branch offices in each district. It is now understood that the Commercial Control Committee has added consideration, that various trade associations may establish offices in various districts when there is a need in their business.

### Egg Trade Associations in Various Regions Revise Membership Regulations

In order to strengthen the association structure, the egg trade associations in various regions have specially revised the new membership restriction regulations, which have been submitted to the relevant authorities for approval and will be implemented immediately. The details of the regulations are as follows: Newly established egg businesses in each district, whose store owners or managers have been in the egg business for more than three years, and have the business equipment and directly employ more than three people, have been approved by the food authorities of each district, and have obtained a registration certificate or registration certificate, and are introduced by two members of the egg trade association of each district, can only join the association after passing the review and being approved by the board of directors. Newly established egg businesses in each district that have obtained approval documents or receipt of submissions from the food authorities of each district, but have not obtained a certificate, shall not be allowed to join the association. The food authorities mentioned in these regulations are the Ministry of Food at the central level, the Food Bureau at the provincial and municipal levels, and the county and municipal governments at the district and municipal levels.

### Secondhand Goods Association Handles Member Registration

The Shanghai Special Municipality Secondhand Goods Trade Association has been formally established and has started working. It will handle member registration on [date]. All businesses engaged in the secondhand goods industry must join the association in order to comply with the government's key purpose of adjusting the economic structure and to promote the business of the industry.

### New Products from Cotton Weaving Factories Still Need to be Registered

Central News Agency report: According to reporter inquiries, the amount of reserved goods requested by each cotton weaving factory has been approved by the Commercial Control Committee, and notifications are now being sent separately. If it is within the scope of the reserved amount, work can be started and used. Those who store the outer power can apply to the Cotton Industry Management Office of the association to handle the transfer procedures. However, new products still need to be registered with the association and cannot be disposed of without authorization. The association has sent a letter to the Cotton Weaving Factory Industry Association for reference and notification.

Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: The market became increasingly depressed yesterday, and most issues failed to open. As the end of the year approaches, debt matters are sparse. Why are stocks any different? The news is positive, but credit is tight, making it temporarily impossible to rally. Category C bonds opened steadily, then rebounded. After that, they relapsed into their old ways and gradually declined. The price was the lowest in recent times, and at the end of the morning, it was two and a half yuan lower than the previous day. The trading of other grains was even scarcer. Category A was down one yuan, and there were no transactions at all for the rest. There were price quotations for Category E bonds, but no inquiries for Category B and D bonds.

Interbank Lending Rate: Yesterday's interbank lending rate quoted by the Money Industry Association was two cents, which actually rose by two points again. This is because the end of the lunar year is approaching, and the financial sector is recovering loans, causing credit to tighten.

Grain: The market was stable yesterday. In addition, with the announcement of the distribution of household rice, people's hearts gradually became more stable. Demand was relatively balanced. Both ordinary and thin japonica rice were around 2.6 yuan. The trend of oil and grain was first firm and then stable, and in the end, it was similar to the previous day.

### Hua Stocks Inevitably Downstream; Investment Stocks Still Firm Yesterday

The situation where Hua stocks had been fluctuating for several days has become difficult to maintain. Yesterday, a tragic decline suddenly unfolded. In the morning, amidst the tightening of credit and continuing the weakness of the previous day, they collapsed and did not return. In the afternoon, there were finally buyers who saw low prices, but in the end, they still squeezed out a small amount. However, the market turned firmer after the close of trading in the evening. Department stores, such as Wing On, fell to as low as 200 yuan. Among the textile industry, Zhenfeng was uniquely firm. Wing On, Sino, and other yarn factories were all weak. In the pharmaceutical industry, New Asia and Sino-French were both cleared. In the real estate industry, Yongxing rose to over 40 yuan, but then fell back. Among the investment stocks, New China and Lyra were firm, and Xinghua and Greater China were slightly higher. Trading was not active throughout the day. According to the notice, the stock exchange will be closed from the sixth issue of this period, waiting for the reopening after the New Year holidays.

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road: A Visit to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital

The medical department includes internal medicine, pulmonology, pediatrics, surgery, orthopedics, urology, thoracic surgery, obstetrics, gynecology, ophthalmology, otolaryngology, and radiology, all of which are headed by experts. In terms of physicians, in addition to the original Zheng Yingshi in internal medicine, Zheng Xien in obstetrics and gynecology, Tang Enmin in pediatrics, Zhi Weiru in pulmonology, and Qian Shaoji in ophthalmology, Dr. Wu Zhaoren, a doctor of internal medicine, was hired as the director of the internal medicine department this summer. Dr. Wu was previously a professor of internal medicine and director of the department of infectious diseases at Peking Union Medical College. He was also a physician of internal medicine at Harvard University in the United States. Dr. Gu Kaishi was hired as the chief surgeon. He is a Bachelor of Science from Nankai University and a Doctor of Medicine from the National Shanghai Medical College. He has served as a resident physician, director, and attending physician in the Department of Surgery at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital. In addition, there is Dr. Ding Zhongxiu, director of pulmonology, who is also a Doctor of Medicine from the National Shanghai Medical College. He has served as an attending physician in the Department of Pulmonology at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital. Dr. Gan Zhilin is the chief physician of otolaryngology. He is an expert in otolaryngology and has served as the chief physician of the Department of Otolaryngology at the Chinese Red Cross General Hospital. It is said that all the directors and full-time physicians of Nanyang Hospital are full-time, which is the hospital's central policy and a major feature of the hospital. Therefore, in addition to clinical treatment, each physician does not have to be busy with other work, and has ample time to conduct research and patiently guide interns.

The nursing department is divided into two systems. One system is hospital academic nurses, and there are currently twenty-five of them. They are all members of the Chinese Nurses Association. In addition to serving the patients in the hospital, they are also responsible for teaching nurses' aides. The other system is the nursing school, namely the Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Advanced Nursing Vocational School, which was founded in the autumn of 1934. It has always been aimed at imparting medical knowledge and nursing principles and techniques, and cultivating nursing talents to serve the society. Since last year, Ms. Wu Zheying, a graduate of the nursing school of Jin Hospital in the United States, the originator of the nursing profession in China, has served as the principal, further improving all important administrative affairs of the school, and has registered with the Chinese Nurses Association, laying an excellent foundation for this year's graduates to participate in the Chinese Nurses Association's examination. Therefore, the nursing department of Nanyang Hospital shoulders the two major tasks of serving patients and nurturing nursing talents, moving towards a bright future.

In addition to the medical and nursing departments, all other business is handled by the general affairs department. This department has one director, and is divided into accounting, personnel, social, and affairs departments, which manage all important internal and external matters of the hospital. It is roughly the same as an ordinary large hospital, and I will not ask about it much.

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Youth (3)

The Second Middle School in Shanghai-machi is a newly built, modern three-story building. Kagoshima, this place, is particularly fond of spending huge sums of money on the construction of schools and government offices. Both Makoto and Takao were assigned to Class 2 of the first grade, the same classroom. From the window, you can see the vast sports field surrounded by trees. Unlike elementary school, many of the friends in the same grade are "country bumpkins" - that is, students from the countryside.

They, like middle school students in Tokyo, like to make noise and play games. However, their attitude towards teachers and upperclassmen is different. Because Kagoshima values ​​the order of seniority, they naturally show great respect for their elders. At the same time, they are particularly sensitive to current affairs issues. Unlike middle school students in Tokyo, because the stimulation of current events is too strong, they have become indifferent to them.

"What caused the Shanghai Incident?" During recess, students were talking about such questions.

In September of the previous year, the Manchurian Incident broke out, and the sound of gunfire at the Beida Camp in Fengtian stimulated the emotions of young people more than adults. Later, in January of this year, the flames of war shifted to Shanghai. The battles of the Lin Regiment and the suicide of Lieutenant Colonel Kuida deeply imprinted themselves in their minds. And what excited them even more was the story of the three brave soldiers who became human bombs. They have already recited the three names of Sakue, Kitagawa, and Ezaki. The image of the three holding green bamboo filled with explosive cylinders and moving forward constantly appeared in their eyes.

Although the Shanghai Incident temporarily ceased fighting on the 3rd of last month, it was still not over. The boys learned from the newspapers that the United Kingdom and the United States were instigating things behind the scenes.

"Those arrogant guys should be completely wiped out with warships and cannons," Takao said, as if he had already become a naval officer. Makoto just smiled happily and said nothing.

Soon the class bell rang. It was the first English class. Mr. Ogata, who was round, slightly fat, and unkempt, came to the classroom. Because it was a small place, the students already knew everything about Mr. Ogata before they met him. The Ogata family is a very historical samurai family. So everyone thought he would be a very strict teacher, but when they met him, he seemed to have been influenced by the popular American comics of the time, with a cheerful face and voice like a young man in "The Happy Hooligan."

"I am Ogata, your English teacher," he said. When standing on the podium, all teachers speak in standard language, but Mr. Ogata's tone was purely the local dialect. "Today is the first class, so I won't talk about the book! I want to tell you the story of the three brave soldiers who became human bombs..."

The students all shouted in uproar.

### Donations of Winter Clothing from All Sectors

Mr. Zhang Wenrui wrote yesterday: "My late mother, Madam Liu, was compassionate and caring in her lifetime. She secretly sent people to help the destitute every year as her responsibility. She was self-denying and benefited others, and was truly an outstanding talent among women. I have not fulfilled my filial piety during her lifetime, nor have I done anything for her after her death. My heart is painful, and there is no time to release it. Recently, the weather is about to become severely cold, which is the time for my mother to give alms. I especially donate 5,000 yuan to purchase winter clothing on her behalf, to fulfill my mother's unfinished aspirations, and perhaps slightly atone for my previous transgressions, and pray that my mother smiles in the afterlife."

Mr. Qian Mingshan wrote yesterday, sending 5,000 yuan saved from banquet expenses, and an additional 2,500 yuan for distribution. According to various items
