### Petitioning for the People Suffering in the North China Famine

"The province has suffered successive years of poor harvests, with last year being particularly severe. Now, at this time of year when the old grain is gone and the new has not yet arrived, grass roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up and consumed. Suicides by hanging and jumping into ravines are frequently heard of. Yesterday, I went to inspect the area under the Donglin Circuit and found the land like a desert, with no water or vegetation. Witnessing such a tragic scene, my heart burned with grief. The telegrams from various places reporting the dire situation are largely the same." This is an excerpt from a report on the 10th of this month, quoting Shandong Governor Tang's urgent plea for disaster relief.

"It has been found that the disaster situation in the North this year is severe, and the people are unable to make a living. Rice bran and wheat chaff are treasures that sustain the lives of starving people." This is an explanation in a report from Wang Yintai, Supervisor of the North China Industrial Bureau, on the disaster situation in Shandong, Henan, and other provinces, as reported on the 10th of this month.

"Delicacies and fine wines that one never tires of eating and drinking, music and dances that one never tires of seeing and hearing, gardens and dance floors that one never tires of visiting." This is a sentence from an advertisement for a certain grand restaurant in this city, as reported on the 15th of this month.

What feelings will readers have after comparing these paragraphs? Shandong and Henan, like Shanghai, are both parts of China's land, and the people of the North and the people of Shanghai are all compatriots of the Republic of China. However, why is it that in the North, "grass roots and tree bark have been almost completely dug up and consumed," while Shanghai still has "delicacies and fine wines that one never tires of eating and drinking"? Shouldn't those in Shanghai who "never tire of eating and drinking," "never tire of seeing and hearing," and "never tire of visiting" show some concern for our suffering compatriots in the North? We firmly believe that every reader will answer that this is "a matter of course" and "absolutely right"! Not to mention that the disaster victims in provinces like Shandong and Henan are all our compatriots, even if they were foreigners, we should inherit the teachings of our ancient sages and virtuous men, "treat the drowning as if we were drowning ourselves, and treat the hungry as if we were hungry ourselves," and uphold the spirit of "embracing all people as our brothers and sisters," and do our best to donate aid.

According to news reports, the current government is very concerned about the unprecedented disaster situation in the provinces of North China, and the Ministry of Social Affairs is already preparing relief efforts. What we hope from the authorities in charge is that, under the premise of "disaster relief is like fighting a fire," they will quickly and effectively carry out relief work, on the one hand providing food for the disaster victims, and on the other hand preventing epidemics. They should further promote active measures to enable the displaced disaster victims to find places to settle down and gain employment, to prevent the disaster area from expanding, and to gradually reduce the severity of the disaster. The governments and relevant authorities in areas close to the disaster area should also do their best to provide shelter for refugees, and to provide organized and planned resettlement, relief, and employment guidance. Of course, we also hope that experts will work hard to devise methods to prevent natural disasters, and cooperate with the government to prevent future calamities.

However, the most urgent matter is the immediate relief of millions of disaster victims in the vast disaster areas of Henan and Shandong provinces in North China. If this problem is not immediately addressed through joint efforts, the impact will not only be on North China, but will inevitably affect other regions as well. Furthermore, the solution to the problem cannot rely solely on government agencies, but requires the urgent relief efforts of people across the country. Currently, fellow North China natives residing in Beijing, Shanghai, and other places, as well as prominent figures in the private sector, have already consulted with the Ministry of Social Affairs and are voluntarily organizing a North China Emergency Relief Association to assist the government in handling fundraising and relief matters. We deeply believe that this is a righteous act that deserves active promotion. However, compatriots in provinces other than North China, especially those in all circles of Shanghai, should step forward bravely and advocate for relief efforts everywhere. In the past, Shanghai's charitable organizations, philanthropists, and social leaders have always been in a leading position in national disaster relief efforts. They have all left behind glorious records. At this time of unprecedented disaster in North China, they should step forward again, cooperate, and work together to raise funds, in order to supplement the government's efforts and demonstrate the great righteousness of mutual assistance among compatriots. We further suggest: (1) North China natives and organizations in Nanjing should contact North China natives and organizations in Shanghai to work together. (2) North China native organizations in Shanghai should contact various charitable organizations and civic welfare organizations in Shanghai to discuss joint action. (3) Government agencies in charge, such as the Ministry of Social Affairs, should jointly lead and promote with the Shanghai Municipal Government. Propaganda, fundraising, and collection of funds should all be decided upon in a unified manner to achieve rapid results.

The most important thing for the emergency relief of disaster victims in North China is to ask for the voluntary donations of Shanghai citizens. Shanghai's economic situation may not be as good as before, but compared to other parts of the country, it is still one of the wealthiest regions. Considering that Shanghai has four million citizens, at least one million people have the ability to donate ten yuan per month, so ten million yuan per month should be the minimum target. In reality, there are still many wealthy people who are capable of donating one thousand or even ten thousand or more per month. We firmly believe that most of today's rich people are deeply aware of righteousness and will automatically make large donations without the need for solicitation. Although the colleagues of this newspaper are in difficult circumstances, we have勉强凑集 gathered five thousand yuan to fulfill our national obligations and take the lead in advocating for relief. At the same time, we are willing to collect donations from all walks of life for the disaster victims in North China. We sincerely hope that readers will show compassion and empathy, and generously contribute. We will collect the funds and hand them over to the organizing group.

At the same time, we sincerely hope that leaders from all walks of life and charitable organizations will carry out fundraising campaigns in a planned manner, striving to reach the minimum target of ten million yuan in the shortest possible time. In addition to voluntary donations from all walks of life, we hope that major restaurants, major restaurants, and major entertainment venues will voluntarily donate all or part of their profits for one or several days. In addition, we also hope that all sectors will work together on charity sales in the business community, charity football games, charity horse racing, etc.

In short, at present, disaster victims in North China fill the fields, and hundreds and thousands of people die every day. If we Shanghai citizens can save a little on food, then let alone ten million, even a larger number is not difficult. Moreover, the righteousness of our Shanghai compatriots will surely inspire the hearts of the people throughout the country, so the effectiveness of mutual assistance among compatriots will surely eliminate the disaster situation at an early date. This will have a great significance for the future of the country!

### The Taihang Mountain War Zone Expands: Japanese Troops Advance Towards the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan Railway Line; The Encirclement Net Near Junji Pass is Completed, Launching Fierce Attacks on the Communist Troops in the Deep Mountains

Taiyuan, Shanxi, 16th (Central News Agency): Since the Japanese army's elite units launched the Taihang Mountain operation, they have repeatedly demonstrated astonishing power. Within less than ten days, they shattered the Chongqing army and then turned their attack to encircle the headquarters of the Communist 18th Group Army and Liu Bocheng's 129th Division. They also captured the communist base areas of Matian Town and Zhi County. Now, they are encircling and suppressing the communist troops hiding in the mountains north of Junji Pass, completing a clever encirclement net and launching fierce attacks. The local Japanese military authorities announced at noon today that the Japanese army has expanded the Taihang Mountain war zone and began attacking communist troops south of the Shijiazhuang-Taiyuan railway line starting on the 15th.

Taiyuan, Shanxi, 16th (Central News Agency): After completing the encirclement of the communist anti-Japanese camp in the dangerous areas of the Taihang Mountains on the 15th, the Japanese army's elite units began to destroy the communist organization and are gradually tightening the encirclement. As of noon on the 16th, the battle situation is as follows: Japanese units advancing north from the vicinity of Zhi County reached the vicinity of Junji Pass on the 13th, crushing all the Chongqing and communist troops in the area. By the 15th, 22 bodies of Chongqing and communist troops were found, and 12 people were captured. The Japanese army seized 17 rifles, 212 rounds of ammunition, 4 pistols, 10 hand grenades, and 30 bayonets, and then continued their attack. The Japanese troops advancing from the north echoed this and defeated a part of the Pinghan guerrilla unit under the Chongqing 129th Regiment southeast of Xiyang on the afternoon of the 14th, and then continued to attack about 100 Chongqing troops in Changjiangte, 15 kilometers to the east, capturing 25 people, seizing 9 rifles, 150 rounds of ammunition, and 20 military horses before continuing south.

### Japanese Troops in Northern Hunan Expand Their Gains: The Chongqing Army's Retreat Route is Cut Off; Japanese Air Force Fiercely Bombs Nuanshui Street

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): The main road for the Chongqing army in Hunan has been cut off after the Japanese army annihilated the Chongqing 10th Army Group. As a result, the Chongqing army there is wandering in the mountainous triangle of Xiqi, Mengxi Temple, and Gong'an. The Japanese army's air force, in order to assist the ground offensive troops in annihilating the besieged Chongqing army, launched a large-scale operation on the morning of the 16th, fiercely bombing the Chongqing army crossing the river near Nuanshui Street, and strafing with machine guns, crushing them. Another Japanese air squadron also fiercely bombed a large force of the Chongqing army gathered near the Zhaikou area southwest of Nuanshui Street, inflicting heavy casualties. Because of the fierce air and ground attacks by the Japanese army, the Chongqing army has completely lost its will to fight, and it is expected that it will be completely annihilated within a day or two. Since the Japanese army launched the annihilation battle on the shore of Dongting Lake, it has only been ten days, and it has thoroughly shattered the Chongqing 29th Army Group and the 10th Army Group, totaling about nine divisions and 90,000 people. In terms of area, the Japanese army has controlled a vast area of 200 kilometers wide and 80 kilometers long from the southern shore of Dongting Lake, north of Yuanjiang, north of Anxiang Jinshi, to the vicinity of Xuandu. By advancing towards Changsha and Changde from here, they can establish a situation that puts Chongqing in a deadly position. Moreover, the Chongqing 6th War Zone has greatly reduced its strength after losing the two strongest army groups at the front, and has to ask Chongqing for help.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the southern Hunan front line on the 12th, the Japanese army on the northern route of southern Hunan is pursuing the Chongqing army in the mountains and fields of Jiangnan, advancing like a hot knife through butter. After three days of fierce fighting near Dazhongyan, Shunlinjin, Mengxi Temple, and Pengjia Factory, they completely defeated about 2,000 people from the Chongqing "43rd Division," "327th and 128th Regiments," and a part of the "50th Division, 118th Regiment." In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 650 bodies and 330 people were captured, including five generals and officers. The Japanese army seized 2 mortars, 6 heavy machine guns, 12 light machine guns, 120 rifles, 5 grenade launchers, 650 hand grenades, and 35 horses.

Hankou, 16th (Central News Agency): According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 16th, the Japanese army's northward troops encircled the Chongqing "118th Division" in the Jiangnan area. Since the evening of the 13th, they fiercely attacked the retreating Chongqing army at Pengjia Factory (35 kilometers southwest of Gong'an), defeating the headquarters of the Chongqing "118th Division." The division commander, Wang Yan, disguised himself and fled to Dayan (30 kilometers northwest of Feng County).

### Regular Implementation of Bonded and Supervised Transportation between Tianjin and Shanhaiguan

Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency): Since the Greater East Asia War has progressed steadily, land transportation between China, Japan, and Manchukuo has become increasingly important. In the past, it was difficult to expect smooth freight transportation and increased transportation volume between the northern provinces and cities of China and Manchukuo due to the need to handle Sino-Manchurian customs affairs in Shanhaiguan. In view of this, the relevant authorities have been actively studying countermeasures and have now decided to implement a bonded transportation and supervised transportation system between Dalian, Tianjin, and Shanhaiguan. It is scheduled to be implemented from June 1st. The Tianjin Customs Superintendent issued a notice stating that bonded transportation of goods transported by rail to Tianjin previously required permission from the Shanhaiguan sub-customs. Starting from June 1st, import procedures can be handled at Tianjin Customs. In addition, supervised transportation to Shanhaiguan, which previously required permission from Tianjin Customs, can now be handled with export procedures at Tianjin Customs starting from June 1st. It is expected that the implementation of this method will not only eliminate the problem of freight transportation in Shanhaiguan, but also shorten the transportation time of goods, reduce accidents during transportation, reduce transportation costs, and simplify customs clearance procedures. In addition, trade control and exchange institutions in Tianjin can also greatly facilitate customs clearance procedures, so the benefits to all parties are not small.

### Implementation of National Health Movement in Japan to Strengthen National Physique and Spirit, Aiming to Complete the War

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – Recognizing that strengthening the national physique and spirit is essential for completing the war, the Japanese authorities previously designated May 1st to 10th as the intensive period for the National Health Movement to thoroughly convey this message to the people. Throughout the country, various health promotion activities were held during this period, with the aim of not only improving the health of the people, but also of vigorously boosting national spirit to resolutely complete the war. The key points of this National Health Movement are six: (1) To elevate the spirit of the Japanese nation, (2) to strive for the thorough implementation of wartime life, (3) to increase production and encourage marriage, (4) to promote maternal and child health, (5) to protect the health of the people and prevent and eliminate tuberculosis and venereal diseases. It is imperative to rapidly and continuously increase the population in order to carry out the war. As the war prolongs, the number of war-related departments will inevitably increase, and each department will need people to manage it. Replenishing combat forces requires young people, increasing military production requires industrial fighters, and those involved in reconstruction and construction to strengthen the rear also need a healthy physique and spirit to shoulder the heavy responsibilities. This is necessary for national development, for achieving the ideal of constructing East Asia, and for the permanent survival of the nation. Therefore, Japan is simultaneously striving to ensure the regeneration of human resources in both quality and quantity. The main reason for launching this National Health Movement is precisely this. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan is mobilizing all state-related agencies, such as newspapers, magazines, radio, and television, as well as basic units of national organizations, such as neighborhood associations, schools, companies, and factories, to thoroughly implement this movement. Pulmonary tuberculosis, the so-called "disease of civilization," has been the target of the greatest efforts by the world's medical community to eradicate. Japan is also making various efforts to ensure manpower and enhance war capabilities. Young people, as important members of the military and industrial fighters, must be prevented from contracting the disease. Tuberculosis screening will be conducted, and health exhibitions will be held to encourage the prevention of tuberculosis. In order to quickly restore the health of early-stage patients, a national conference of sanatorium directors will be convened to establish "Health Promotion Residences" to benefit patients. Those who need treatment will be forced to seek medical attention. Furthermore, children are the future masters of the country, and efforts should be made to improve their health for the survival and development of the nation. Therefore, the Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan will also hold children's training and infant screening sessions in various places to deepen public awareness. In order to protect mothers and pregnant women raising children, "Mother and Child Associations" and laboring mothers' conferences have been held to commend laboring mothers who have given birth to many children. A conference on childcare for national service will be held to popularize childcare knowledge. Pregnant and postpartum women will be given priority in the allocation of food and other essential supplies to protect the mother's body. After the launch of this movement, free physical examinations for pregnant women will be universally implemented to ensure the health of pregnant women. At the same time, in order to cultivate healthy bodies, martial arts training, exercise sessions, and walking events will be held throughout the country to train the national physique and spirit, with the aim of simultaneously enhancing intelligence, skills, and physical strength. In addition, Japan believes that increasing the population is a prerequisite for enhancing national strength. Therefore, taking advantage of the launch of this movement, sound marriages and appropriate early marriages will be encouraged, and standards for marriage age will be set at 25 years or older for men and 21 years or older for women. At the same time, various groups and neighborhood associations will mediate marriages. Furthermore, the Japanese authorities believe that war and life are closely intertwined during this wartime period, but prolonged tension in national life will inevitably affect the front lines. Therefore, it is necessary to thoroughly reform wartime life, starting with reforms in clothing, food, and housing, to cultivate a spirit of hardship and endurance. On the other hand, the goal is to cultivate courage, advancement, simplicity, and robust character. Street broadcasts and exercises are conducted, and neighborhood sports meetings are held using open spaces. Dr. Takata Yasuma, director of the Japanese National Research Institute, once said, "The ability to overcome poverty and hardship is the driving force for the permanent survival and development of a nation." Today, the survival of the Japanese people is based on this maxim of Dr. Takata, consolidating the determination and confidence to win, thoroughly reforming wartime life, and defeating the United States and Britain. This National Health Movement has just concluded, so it is impossible to expect immediate results, but its spiritual impact on the Japanese people is indeed profound. Although this movement has ended, the Japanese people are still moving forward every day, continuing to train their bodies with the aim of defeating the United States and Britain. As the war intensifies, the Japanese people's training of body and mind is becoming more thorough and fulfilling.

### British Forces Repeatedly Defeated in Burma, Soldiers Have Lost the Will to Fight, Maungdaw Endangered After the Fall of Buthidaung

Hikkie, 16th (Central News Agency) – Since the fall of Burma, the British Indian Army has been deeply distressed and has been actively trying to recapture Hikkie. Recently, they have changed their past passive strategy of using Indian troops on the front lines and have instead used British troops as the first line of defense. Their main force is the 6th Brigade, the most elite of the British Indian Army. However, this attempt was cleverly defeated by the Japanese army, and Buthidaung, located 20 kilometers from India, has already been occupied by the Japanese army. According to a Reuters dispatch from Calcutta, Maungdaw on the Burma-India border is also in danger. A special dispatch from the London Times lists the reasons for the British Indian Army's defeat in attacking Hikkie as follows: (1) The British failed to capitalize on their initial advantage. (2) The rear supply was inadequate. (3) The Governor-General of India neglected land transport between India and Burma. The article particularly emphasizes the inadequacy of the rear supply, attempting to deflect responsibility for the British military defeat from the anti-Axis forces and the Indian people. However, according to investigations, the enemy has built a relatively flat motor road from Dombek to Maungdaw, west of the Mayu Mountains, and a solid post road along the eastern foot of the Mayu Mountains. In order to connect the rapid road with the military motor road, they have opened a post road across the mountains between Apawdine south (east of the Mayu Mountains) and Burma-India. However, this was conveniently used by the Japanese army as a route of attack. The enemy has built field hospitals to defend against the rainy season in Khabakupe, and food warehouses in Indian and Kizzo. In addition, supply organizations have been set up in various important locations. From all this, it can be seen that the reason for the British Indian Army's defeat is still due to the loss of morale after repeated and rapid defeats, and the long-simmering mutual friction between the British and Indian troops has now surfaced.

### Name Changes in Japanese-Occupied Territories, Special Committee Established

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced on May 14th that American troops had landed on Attu Island in the Aleutian Islands, and that Japanese troops were currently engaged in fierce fighting with them. Attu Island was renamed Hotta Island after being occupied by Japanese troops on June 8th of last year. The reason why the General Headquarters did not use the name Hotta Island in this announcement is that the name Hotta Island was originally given by the local Japanese military unit and has not yet been officially decided. Therefore, the old name Attu Island is still used in official documents. Other names, such as Narukami Island and Daikarasu, were also given by local Japanese military units and have not yet been officially decided. Regarding the renaming of occupied territories, a Committee for the Names of Occupied Territories has been established within the Cabinet to handle the matter. Currently, Malaya, Syonan, Java, Jakarta, etc., have all been officially renamed after being decided by this committee.

### Borneo Authorities Organize Inland Survey Team

Makassar, 16th (Central News Agency) – In order to inspect the situation in the interior of Borneo and investigate its resources, the Japanese military government authorities here have organized a "Borneo Inland Survey Team" consisting of members of the resource investigation team, civil administration officials, and local police. The team departed from here yesterday, and it is expected that this trip will make a great contribution to the development plan of Borneo.

### Universities in Beijing

— Student

This year, Beijing's spring is particularly short. Three weeks ago, a cold snap took away many lives, and now, men in light-colored suits are already appearing on Wangfujing Street. However, this year's spring is very bright. The lilacs in the Li Park are blooming exceptionally beautifully, and Chairman Zhu even invited friends to his private residence to hold a "Spirit Appreciation Banquet." The crabapple blossoms at the home of an old friend are said to be more fragrant and abundant than ever before, causing him to say with a smile, "This year should bring good luck!"

Here, let's see how the educational sector, where Beijing's floral spirit resides, is faring.

Before the incident, Beijing was the headquarters of China's education sector. Just in terms of universities, besides the so-called "Big Five Universities"—Peking University, Yenching University, Tsinghua University, Normal University, and Fu Jen Catholic University—there were also Peking Normal University and various colleges, Peking Union Medical College, Sino-French University, the Art College, Chinese University, Chaoyang University, Northeastern University, etc., with tens of thousands of university students. Of course, at that time, these university students occasionally caused a stir, making the elders dizzy, but they never broke the string of songs. Now, only Yenching, Peking Union Medical College, Fu Jen, and Sino-French remain, and in the private university sector, Chinese University still exists as before. Later, Normal University and Peking University were restored, and a New People's College was added, but like trying to prop up the east while the west falls, Sino-French University was the first to close after the defeat of France, followed by Yenching and Peking Union Medical College.

The restoration of Normal University and Peking University took place under extremely difficult circumstances. Although a very modern new Peking University campus was built behind the red building in Sandakan, the splendor of the architecture could not enrich the content. The library's collection is not as rich as before. When Yenching University was closed, there was a brief period of excitement at the various schools. With the efforts of the government, most of the Yenching students were assigned to the various colleges of Peking University to continue their studies, and some of the Yenching faculty naturally transferred to Peking University and Normal University. However, the Yenching personnel were limited, and after the distribution to Fu Jen and Chinese University, the number was extremely small, and most of the famous professors had retired, so it did not actually increase the strength much.

However, Fu Jen and Chinese University became lively. Fu Jen, which was in the rearguard of the Big Five and was in danger of not being selected, suddenly stood at the forefront of the education sector after Yenching University was closed, at least in the opinion of the general public. However, it is now also inferior due to the social and economic environment. Chinese University is also lucky. No matter what it did before the incident, it could not revitalize the school, but now it is a first-class private university. Some of the better Yenching professors were actually invited here by President He, and the number of students increased accordingly. However, because the foundation is not solid and there are economic difficulties, whether it will still be able to retain professors and students next year has become a question.

The reasons for this recession are not only the lack of faculty and subjects, but also the decrease in the number of students. Where did these students go? Due to economic pressure, many have had to change careers, but most are staying at home and not attending classes. Not attending classes is originally something that some young people like, especially now that there is an economic reason!

The burden of life is too heavy. The price of rice has risen from about one mao per catty to more than three yuan. The cost for each student is at least two thousand gold per year, and even if they find a noble profession after graduation, they probably won't get half of that as a reward. This is the time to calculate. A maid costs one hundred one-yuan bills per month. Even if you use economical methods, you can go to the street stalls next to the road after class and buy one or two sesame cakes or corn buns to cope with the rumbling hunger. Sometimes you can also encounter teachers who no longer consider themselves superior, stare at each other, and smile at each other. However, it is never as good as sitting idly in the garden, where you can also sweep away the dust and sand brought to the courtyard from the Gobi Desert by the northwest wind, make tea, and cook food. This can save two to three thousand gold per year in tuition fees and one hundred one-yuan bills per month in maid fees. It is under the calculation of this era that Fu Jen wanted to implement the new economic policy last year, thinking of relying on recruiting more new students to maintain school expenses. It actually admitted nearly one thousand out of about one thousand two hundred applicants, and for a time it proudly proclaimed its success. However, it soon published advertisements in the newspaper to continue recruiting new students, because only two to three hundred of the one thousand or so admitted students reported, and conversely, about five hundred students dropped out this semester.

The professors are running around all day to earn a living. In addition to teaching part-time everywhere to hunt for jobs, they have eaten enough chalk dust, carry their bags, and argue with rickshaw pullers who are closely following and demanding rides, their faces red with anger. After walking angrily to their front doors, they still have to do the labor themselves. The students, after taking their book boxes back home, have to run errands, wash clothes, and dump out the dirt. They no longer have time to write love letters. The so-called "labor is sacred," which has only been seen on paper for more than ten years, has silently climbed into real life under the huge arm of this environment. Therefore, the authorities came out to advocate "production education." In addition to promoting it in newspapers, they also ordered all schools to hold teacher-student farming campaigns during the spring break. However, this did not arouse the interest of teachers and students who were fighting poverty. As a result, those who could escape work escaped, and those who had to do it did it perfunctorily. On that newly cultivated farm, which had been transformed from a tennis court, no oily green shoots grew.

"Production education" is indeed a method to remedy current ills, and the work-study system does have the possibility of pulling lost students back to the lecture hall. However, how to realize it is a problem worth studying. (May 10)

### Italy Takes Full Defense Measures on Mediterranean Islands, Confident of Crushing Enemy Attack Attempts, Heavy Casualties If Britain and the United States Attempt Landing in Europe

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – Italian Lieutenant General Lucis Quino praised the bravery of the Italian forces in Tunisia and the fervent spirit of the Italian people at the Finance Committee held in the Upper House on the 15th. Regarding the future war situation, he said that the Mediterranean islands have been placed under the command of the Italian General Staff and that full defense measures have been taken. In the future, with the great strategy of the Italian Army's leadership and the bravery of the Italian soldiers, the enemy's attack attempts will surely be crushed. Admiral Regal Diti then declared that the Italian Navy has prepared to deal with any situation, saying that the Italian Navy's maritime supply operations in the North African campaign have been in constant fierce battles with the enemy's large fleet and air force. In the past six months, the enemy has concentrated all their ships in narrow waters, making the operations extremely difficult. When Italy first joined the war, naval authorities predicted that the Italian Navy's ability to resist in various waters would be difficult to sustain for several months. However, more than three years have passed, and we still pose a significant threat to the enemy. Finally, General Puji Erda announced that since the Italian Air Force joined the war, it has sunk 145 enemy merchant ships, totaling 1,060,000 tons, and 67 enemy warships, including 20 cruisers, 21 destroyers, and 7 submarines. It has also shot down 2,342 enemy aircraft, of which 1,944 were shot down in aerial combat. In addition, it has severely damaged approximately 1,000 enemy aircraft. At the same time, the Italian Air Force has transported 610,000 troops and 42,000 tons of military supplies to the front lines.

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Italian military headquarters announced a battle report on the 15th: (1) German bomber squadrons bombed Porto Velo on the night of the 14th, sinking an oil tanker and damaging a medium-sized cargo ship. (2) Enemy aircraft attacked Palermo and the Sardinian Islands on the 14th, causing slight casualties among the citizens. Italian anti-aircraft guns shot down eleven of them. (3) Italian aircraft engaged in aerial combat with enemy aircraft on the east coast of Sardinia, shooting down two enemy aircraft.

Rome, 16th (Central News Agency) – The Italian Post Office said today that the Mediterranean coast from Western France to the Turkish-Greek border and the largest islands in the Mediterranean are now under Axis control. During World War I, the Mediterranean belonged to the British sphere of influence, and the coastal areas were ruled by countries allied with Britain. Only British fleets could freely enter and exit the ports and bases. At that time, only ten to sixteen German submarines were active in the Mediterranean, but they were still able to inflict a huge loss of 2.5 million tons on the British, forcing Britain to reroute most of its shipping around the Cape of Good Hope. Under the current circumstances, Britain must be careful to prevent the power of Italian ships, submarines, German light cruisers, and the large air force in the Mediterranean. It is definitely not as easy as it was during World War I. Regarding the British and American plans to land in the Mediterranean, the report stated that Churchill admitted two years ago that the British suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Crete due to inadequate supplies and difficulty in landing. The landing forces must maintain close contact with ships at sea, and the Dardanelles adventure can be considered a warning.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) – After the end of the North African campaign, the development of the war situation in the Mediterranean is of great concern to the general public. The forced withdrawal of the Axis forces from North Africa is only the prelude to the British and American forces attacking the European continent, so it is difficult to influence the overall situation of the war. It is not difficult to imagine that the British and American forces intend to attack the southern part of Europe from their bases in North Africa. It is generally believed that this matter was discussed in Canada long ago by the British and Americans, but whether the British and Americans can implement this plan is still in doubt. Speaking of the southern side of Europe, from the Balkans in the east to Iberia in the west, the coastline is extremely long. Since the Battle of Dunkirk, Germany has not continued to attack the British mainland, so British defenses will gradually become consolidated. Taking Iberia as an example, now that the war in Tunisia has ended, if Britain and the United States do not immediately carry out landing operations in Europe, their difficulties will inevitably increase. It is generally believed that the current large-scale bombing of Pantelleria, Sicily, Sardinia, and other islands by the British and Americans is also a preparation for new operations. However, this time is very different from the North African landing operation last autumn, that is, landing on the territory of a belligerent country. From a common sense perspective, carrying out such an operation requires enduring great sacrifices. It is not yet possible to judge whether the United States and Britain will make a desperate bet to completely dominate the Strait of Sicily, or whether they will carry out landing operations in other locations. Ever since the Cairo combat talks were held, the world has been closely watching the situation in the Balkans, but judging from the situation of the British and American forces in the Near East and Turkey's attitude, it will inevitably become a problem in the near future. On the one hand, the British and Americans seem to be carrying out various activities in the Iberian Peninsula, but the Axis forces' fierce fighting in Tunisia for six months proves the solidity of the defenses on the southern side of the European continent and allows them to deploy large forces. Furthermore, Corsica, Sardinia, Sicily, Crete, Rhodes, and other islands are all safe and sound. The Axis forces will definitely use this to defend to the death and prevent the British and American forces from approaching the mainland.

### Discord in the Washington Conference: Difficult to Have New Actions on the Pacific

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The most significant issue currently emerging at the Washington Conference is the revision of the Casablanca Conference resolutions and whether Japan should be considered the greatest enemy of the Axis powers. The participation of Field Marshal Wavell, Admiral Somerville, Field Marshal Brooke, Lieutenant General Stilwell, and Foreign Minister Evatt indicates that the discussions concern not only the European theater but also the war in the East. This view is based on the following facts: first, since the beginning of this year, General MacArthur's headquarters and the government in China have repeatedly requested more manpower and resources, pointing out that Japan is preparing to take further action in the southwestern Pacific. Second, converted isolationists have begun to loudly demand that the United States focus on actions in the Pacific, as they understand that the United States has little say in the post-war issues of Europe, as can be seen from the recent Polish-Soviet dispute. Third, since it was revealed that Japan has sufficient ships to engage in new ambitions in the Pacific, the United States is even more worried that Japan will become invincible after stabilizing Greater East Asia. All these facts can illustrate the recent trend of American public opinion. The following points can show the British perspective: first, in December of last year, "The Economist" did not attach importance to Japan's activities in the South Seas, believing that although Japan's strength would greatly increase after organizing the region, it lacked sufficient merchant ships. Second, the "Daily Telegraph" of London commented on the Washington Conference on Thursday, strongly advocating for new actions in the Pacific but also emphasizing that "British and American leaders are still united in thinking that their primary task is to defeat Hitler and destroy the German army." Observers believe that Britain hopes to resolve the European war as soon as possible, which will affect Australia, India, and other eastern regions. This is the biggest difference in opinion between Britain and the United States. Therefore, it is expected that the main discussions in Washington will focus on determining a new world strategy for Britain and the United States to deal with the new situation and resolving fundamental conflicts in opinions. However, observers believe that this conflict cannot be fully resolved. Without the cooperation of the Soviet Union, Britain and the United States cannot take any new action in the Pacific. Observers pointed out that the Soviet Union has not indicated any desire to break the non-aggression pact with Japan. Therefore, the anti-Axis strategy seems to be to allocate part of its military force to the West and part to the East.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch) - As the North African war situation is urgent and the Allied forces are rumored to be launching a landing operation in Europe, the White House suddenly announced on the 11th that British Prime Minister Churchill, accompanied by the heads of the British Army, Navy, and Air Force, was visiting the United States and was currently in talks with President Roosevelt. The announcement did not mention the time of Churchill's arrival in Washington or the content of the talks. However, according to observers with access to British sources, the focus of this meeting seems to be: first, an agreement on the time and place of the Second Front in Europe; second, a revision of the strategies discussed at the Casablanca Conference; and third, mediation of the Polish-Soviet disputes. Tracing back to the Allied camp, since the start of the Tunisian campaign, there has been grand publicity about launching a landing operation in Europe. Furthermore, there were calls from a corner of the Soviet Union, and the voice of the Second Front was temporarily very loud. However, before the postwar management of Europe (i.e., the spheres of influence of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union) had been delineated, Britain and the United States were unwilling to sacrifice their own countries to seek benefits for the Soviet Union and risk attacking Europe. Therefore, it was natural that the Second Front could not be established at that time. Secondly, even if they were to revise the measures discussed at the Casablanca Conference, Chongqing, Australia, New Zealand, and others have always expressed opposition to the Europe-centric policies of Britain and the United States. There are significant differences of opinion between the Allied Joint Operations Headquarters in Washington and the Allied Southwest Pacific Command in Australia. Therefore, today, it is indeed necessary to revise the Europe-centric policies of the Casablanca Conference. However, the prerequisite question is the landing operation in Europe. However, the spheres of influence determined by the Allied camp in Europe are sufficient to influence the unfolding of the landing operation in Europe. The first agreement on the method of mediating the Polish-Soviet disputes will be the only question of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks. Since the end of the Tunisian war, the Polish-Soviet disputes have become not only a problem for the two countries but also the most important political problem for the Allied camp. If the Polish-Soviet disputes are not resolved first, and the spheres of influence in Europe are not determined, then the European landing operation will ultimately be difficult to implement. British Foreign Secretary Eden went to Washington to mediate the Polish-Soviet disputes and stayed for a long time, working hard, but ultimately without success. It is unpredictable whether Churchill's hard work and talks with Roosevelt will be successful.

Kuybyshev, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Soviet newspapers have not yet commented on the meeting between British Prime Minister Churchill and US President Roosevelt currently being held in Washington. Soviet newspapers have only published announcements from the British Information Agency and the White House regarding Churchill's visit to Washington.

### German Assault Teams in Kuban Region Launch Surprise Attack on Major Soviet Positions; Heavy Casualties Among Soviet Troops; Germans Also Launch Offensive in Leningrad Region

Stockholm, Swedish Capital, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to frontline reports, German assault teams in the Kuban bridgehead region launched a surprise attack on heavily fortified Soviet positions. After fierce fighting, they captured important Soviet positions. In this operation, 1,500 Soviet soldiers were killed, and approximately the same number were captured. The Soviet army also lost many weapons and other materials. On the other hand, German anti-aircraft gun units sank twenty-eight Soviet boats full of soldiers attempting to land at the mouth of the river in the Dimlyuki area. It is reported that German forces on the Leningrad front also launched an offensive after heavy shelling. The Soviet military newspaper "Red Star" has admitted that the German army has begun an offensive in a certain area and expressed concern about the German offensive. According to reports from the German News Agency, German assault teams also broke into Soviet positions in the central Donets region and south of Lake Ladoga, capturing many Soviet fortresses and infantry positions.

Helsinki, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Stefani Agency quoted yesterday's communique from the Finnish High Command as saying that in the past twenty-four hours, there had been local reconnaissance activities and artillery exchanges in the Karelian Isthmus. On the western section of the same battle line, a Soviet unit launched an attack but was repelled and suffered heavy losses. There were no other important news on other fronts.

Bern, 15th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Berlin dispatch states that German forces attacked Soviet positions in the Kuban bridgehead and annihilated several enemy units. Other areas remained quiet. German forces shelled railways and factories south of Lake Ladoga and in Leningrad. Taking advantage of the lull in the fighting, the German and Romanian armies were rushing to make various preparations to prevent a large-scale Soviet offensive, as the Soviet army has been frequently moving troops and transporting large quantities of heavy weapons from the rear. The German side used bombers to heavily attack Soviet transport units, artillery positions, airfields, and railways. The Soviet mouthpiece "Svesda" reported that the German spring offensive was expected, but it was difficult to predict where it would be launched first. The German army has concentrated a large number of troops in several areas and is making preparations in the Orel and Kursk areas south of Moscow, indicating that the German army may attack Moscow. The newspaper also urged the Soviet army to be prepared without complacency.

### Strong Anti-British Sentiment Among Natives in Syria, Iran, and Other Places

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to indirect reports from here, Palestine and Syria remain turbulent, with nationalists in the region resisting British aggressors. The office of the Palestinian Communist Party in Natanya, near Haifa, was vandalized by unidentified individuals, who destroyed all documents, furniture, and photos of Lenin and Stalin. These offices are the headquarters of the Communist Party and the center of communist propaganda for the British army stationed near Natanya. According to a Stefani Agency report citing Damascus, Syrian nationalists blew up the railway bridge over the Litani River near Sidon, causing train traffic on the line to be suspended for several days. British military authorities have arrested 150 farmers in the area in an attempt to find the perpetrators. Another Stefani Agency report states that in Tya-el-Syio-Gaur, Syria, tax collectors ordered to collect wheat were attacked by farmers with rifles. The tax collectors requested assistance from the British army, who opened fire on the villagers, killing several people and wounding many more. In addition, the British army set fire to several villages in retaliation.

Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Disturbances occur frequently throughout Iran. Although they have been repeatedly suppressed by the Allied forces, they have not been reduced at all. According to reports from Tehran, a large-scale disturbance occurred in the Kerman region. A large number of Iranians, divided into three teams, attacked British troops, destroying all facilities, looting food and weapons, and killing several British soldiers. The Iranian gendarmerie and a large unit of the Indian army rushed to the scene and clashed with the Iranians. It is reported that many Iranian gendarmes were killed or injured.

### Argentina Supplies Wheat to Spain

Madrid, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It was revealed here yesterday that Argentina is still shipping wheat to Spain at regular intervals in accordance with the agreement signed with Spain at the end of last year. All wheat transported from Argentina to Spain is loaded by Spanish ships. The Spanish cargo ship "Monte Os" is expected to soon sail from Buenos Aires, carrying 3,600 tons of wheat and 5,000 tons of barley to Spain.

### British Radio Broadcast Denies German Landings

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - It has recently been rumored that German forces have landed at several locations on the British coast. Therefore, the British Broadcasting Corporation broadcast yesterday to officially deny this. It is said that Prime Minister Churchill mentioned the possibility of a German invasion of Britain in a broadcast in Washington, causing the rumor to resurface.

### US Republican Party Plans to Nominate MacArthur for President

Akira, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Stefani Agency relayed a Washington report stating that Senator Vandenberg of Michigan and other important Republicans have begun campaigning to nominate General MacArthur as the Republican candidate to compete against President Roosevelt in the next presidential election. It is generally believed that General MacArthur is most supported by the public, and that all presidents elected in the past, except for those in the previous world war, have been military figures, such as Washington, Jackson, Tyler, and Grant. Therefore, General MacArthur's election as president is a matter of course.

### Presidents of Bolivia and US Issue Joint Declaration

Akira, 16th (Central News Agency dispatch) - After Bolivian President Castillo arrived in Washington, he and the US president issued a joint statement stating that they had discussed issues of mutual interest. Bolivia is currently supplying the United States with tin, rubber, and quinine, and the two countries have signed an agreement to strengthen cooperation.

### A Great Tragedy in World History (5)

- Tokutomi Iichiro

(5) A Country Destroyed by Empty Talk

One of the most notable trends in British party politics is that they argue not for the sake of political views, but for the sake of arguing. In a word, it is a country destroyed by empty talk. The British were originally a nation of common sense and a nation of action; however, since the establishment of party politics, the British have become a nation of words. The nation of words gradually becomes the nation of empty talk, which is a natural trend.

Morley once said:

"The greatest hardship for us party members is that no matter how similar the opinions of the parties are in reality, they always insist on saying that they are completely different and irreconcilable, so that the general public can agree."

Morley has always had the reputation of "Honest John" (John is Morley's name), and is one of the most outstanding personalities in the party. He is also known for being Gladstone's right-hand man on the issue of Irish autonomy. If he said this, I'm afraid no one would disbelieve him, right?

Regardless of compromise, it was originally the nature of the British. For the sake of party politics, not only is there no question of compromise, but they also have to go to extremes and treat each other as if they are irreconcilable, confronting each other in words in order to gain power or maintain the power they have already obtained.

In this way, since the implementation of parliamentary politics, Britain has had no economists or politicians. The British parliament has almost become a nest for mere debaters, skilled debaters, sophists, and verbose speakers to display their useless debates. Therefore, the leaders of the parties, not to mention those with ambition, if they want to establish themselves and advance, they can only immerse themselves in parliamentary debates in order to hunt for high or the highest positions in the political world.

This is just like how all politicians in China are generally skilled in writing, British politicians, even with the difference between eloquence and ineloquence, can never be without garrulity; otherwise, they cannot become politicians. Therefore, even in times of national crisis, what they are wholeheartedly focused on is not so much presenting their opinions to the people as it is on how to present model eloquent speeches.

At the beginning of the First World War, how wonderful, concise, clear, sincere, and moving were the speeches of the then Foreign Secretary Grey and others, they are still praised by people today. Even in this Second World War, the parliamentary speeches or broadcasts of people like Churchill are evaluated in Britain as so-and-so good or so-and-so bad, just like how in our country's theaters, people evaluate the performances of actors Kikugoro and Kichiemon.

Therefore, British politicians are not so much national economists as they are artists of the mouth. Then it is by no means inconceivable how many British politicians come from the legal profession.

After Pitt the Younger, the longest-serving prime minister, Asquith (H.H. Asquith) was also a lawyer. Lloyd George, who initially served as Asquith's colleague, then his subordinate, and finally replaced Asquith, was originally a low-ranking rural lawyer. Someone like Simon, who has gone from the Liberal Party through various changes to become the Lord Chancellor, is also a lawyer.

In the Conservative Party, Birkenhead (F.E.S. Birkenhead) was a famous barrister of the common people. Carson, the last brave general of the Conservative Party opposing the Irish Home Rule Act, was also one of the most powerful advocates in the courtroom. Although lawyers are necessary in the courtroom, for the cause of national economy, one must rely on economists.

As for the economists, they cannot be filled by eloquence. People like Okubo Toshimichi and Saigo Takamori of Japan, except when it is necessary to state their opinions, do not easily open their mouths. There are occasional exceptions in Britain as well - for example, General Kitchener (H.H. Kitchener). When parliamentary politics reaches its peak, it is precisely when British politics degenerates to its lowest ebb.

Let's talk about the Irish Home Rule Bill, which is the worst example of parliamentary politics. Ireland has always been Britain's cancer, and it is still a cancer now, and it will probably still be a cancer in the future. Gladstone was the one who determined that Ireland was a cancer and wanted to apply surgical treatment. Many people in the world believe that the reason why Gladstone shook hands with the Irish Home Rule Party was because he wanted to obtain or maintain his power with the assistance of the Home Rule Party. Whether or not the fact is really like this, that I do not know.

In short, this was indeed a wise measure. If Irish autonomy had been allowed at that time, then Ireland would now have become the country of Ireland, and would have nothing to do with Britain at all, and would not have taken the attitude of sticking a dagger in the throat of Britain. However, the Chamberlain faction, which split from the Conservative Party that opposed the Home Rule Bill and the Liberal Party, united with the Conservative Party under the name of the Unionist Party to monopolize power. It was not until 1906 that the Liberal Party finally saw the dawn. However, although the Home Rule Party had temporarily gained power in the meantime, from Gladstone's last cabinet (August 1892 to March 1894) to Rosebery's (A.P.P. Rosebery) most recent cabinet (March 1894 to June 1895), power was soon returned to the original Conservative Party.

When the Liberal Party gained power and re-passed the Irish Home Rule Bill, they encountered the opposition of the House of Lords, and ultimately it was not implemented. Just when they were about to reach their goal after all their hard work and were about to implement it, Edward VII died and George V took office. At the beginning of his new government, a compromise conference between the two parties was opened in the palace by order of the king, but even with the king's mediation, they could not reach an agreement. Just when they were about to implement it, the Conservative Party, which was the opposition party, disregarded the resolution of parliament and resolutely imported weapons into Ireland and recruited soldiers, with the most hardcore Carson-Smith of the non-Home Rule Party as the commander-in-chief, and was about to launch a civil war when the First World War broke out. Therefore, the problem was suspended. After five years of delay, just as it was about to be brought up again, Ireland no longer agreed to the original Home Rule Bill and faced Britain with almost the attitude of an independent country.

Because of this situation, people's hearts were agitated, assassinations were rampant, and Anning's order could not be maintained. Britain had no choice but to make the final concession, and the Republic of Ireland was established. As a result, Ireland was completely separated from the country, drove away the governor-general installed by Britain, and now changed its national title to Eire. Regardless of Britain's declaration of war on Germany, Ireland resolutely maintained neutrality, almost in a completely independent posture. Although the other colonies promised to be part of the British Commonwealth by following their loyalty to the British king, Ireland even refused the official words of loyalty.

From the Home Rule Bill to independence, the historical relationship between Britain and Ireland for fifty years cannot be said to be a major crime of establishing evidence that party politics has misled the important national affairs of the country. When Cromwell issued the order to dissolve the Long Parliament, he declared as follows:

On April 20, 1653, Commander-in-Chief Cromwell walked to the Parliament, sat on a chair, and listened attentively. But finally he could not bear it anymore, stood up and said, "Get out of here!" "It's enough, I hope you stop chattering! ... You still call yourselves a parliament, even if it is a parliament, what are you doing.... Among you, there are either drunkards or butt-fuckers, ... How can you guys maintain God's favor and be a parliament. Ugh! Go! I order..." He raised the giant mallet, which was the sacred symbol of parliamentary power, and said, "How can this piece of trash be cleaned up? Or should I just throw it away?"

Like this, the British parliament is simply a place of cicada chirps and frog croaks, and their long garrulity will eventually send Britain to decline, like the cicadas chirping away the evening. (Ding: Translated from the Eastern Daily News of May 2)

### The Commerce Control Council Will Handle All Material Management; The Authorities Are Actively Undertaking This Matter; Material Movement Certificates Have Begun to be Issued

According to reliable sources from authoritative circles yesterday, the management of all important or non-important materials will be authorized by the authorities to be handled by the National Commerce Control Council. For example, allocation, control, procurement, permission or non-permission, etc. For this reason, the material control agencies will have a comprehensive innovation. Merchants can obtain unified guidance, and the commercial market can gradually move towards the right track. The authorities are still actively working on this matter.

Spot Check of Yarn Cloth

The supplementary registration of cotton yarn cloth inventory has expired on the day before yesterday (Saturday), according to the National Commerce Control Council. All merchants or individuals who have not fulfilled the registration procedures will not be allowed to enjoy the right to move or sell. In order to crack down on hoarding, the council will send personnel for spot checks. If any unregistered cotton yarn cloth is found, it will be dealt with according to law.

Material Movement

The council has now begun to handle the issuance of permits for the movement of 25 important materials. All merchants can directly apply to the Material Permit Office of the council in the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road for a movement permit. However, these goods are only allowed to be transported to the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and the North China and South China areas (including Guangdong, Shantou, Xiamen, etc.).

### Economic Special High Police: Deadline for Trainees of the Fifth Training Class to Report

The fourth economic police and special high police training classes of the Central Police Academy will expire on the fourth of next month. The fifth training class should continue to be organized. However, it has been found that the trainees of each previous training class often reported after the deadline, and even after the start of the class, there were still continuous reports, which is very detrimental to the course. Therefore, the Ministry of Interior ordered the police agencies of all provinces and cities one month in advance that all trainees must report according to the deadline of the Ministry of Interior and must not delay in order to show uniformity and avoid delaying their studies.

### Expelling Beggars in the South City

Recently, prices have skyrocketed, and the livelihood of the common people has become more serious. Street beggars wander around all day long, unable to eat when hungry and unable to drink when thirsty, and their situation is especially pitiful. However, these people often seize food from women and children to satisfy their hunger. It has been found that this act not only harms the appearance of the city but also disturbs local security. This trend must not be allowed to continue. The South City District Baojia Self-Defense Corps, in order to help maintain the safety of pedestrians, under the close connection between the police and Baojia, will expel all beggars in the entire South City from the country and are not allowed to stay. The members of each group have been implementing it universally since yesterday, and in the future, beggars in the entire South City will disappear from the streets.

### Responsibility for Riding the Tram Without a Ticket

Although the tram company authorities have repeatedly cracked down on the bad habit of ticket sellers skimming profits, it has not been effective so far, resulting in a great impact on the company's revenue. Yesterday, a senior official of the tram company said: Regarding the matter of ticket selling skimming profits, the authorities have repeatedly tried to make up for the shortcomings. In addition to adding plainclothes ticket inspectors, the only way is to hope that passengers can closely contact the authorities. Passengers must obtain tickets from the ticket seller that match the price paid, otherwise they can secretly record the number of the ticket seller and notify the company. The company will have severe penalties. The official also said: If the ticket seller holds back the passenger's ticket money and the passenger does not negotiate, then once the ticket inspector discovers it, the responsibility for not having a ticket must be borne by the passenger himself. Therefore, for the sake of his own interests, the passenger should also pay close attention to the ticket seller's skimming profits. It has been found that the company should effectively crack down on ticket selling skimming profits. If the passenger refuses to pay the fare, then the responsibility for not having a ticket should be borne by the passenger. If the fare has been paid, or the ticket seller deliberately delays collecting it, or has collected it but delays paying the ticket, then where does the responsibility lie? It seems that this should be distinguished. On the other hand, the livelihood problem of ticket sellers can also be studied.

### Second Phase Household Oil Sales End Today

The second phase of household oil sales citywide, which began on the 7th of this month, has now lasted for ten days. Each resident can purchase four ounces of oil at a price of five yuan and ten cents. It is understood that this phase of cooking oil sales will end today. All retailers will complete their closing procedures today and report the sales situation to the wholesale distributors. At the same time, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, preparations for the third phase of household oil sales are already underway.

### 1.8 Sheng of Grain Per Person in West Shanghai

The West Shanghai District's first and second districts' household rice, consisting of 4,500 bags, has been collected by the first trade allocation meeting of the district's public grain united office. Sales are scheduled to begin simultaneously from 55 public grain distribution points in the district today (the 17th). It is learned that the total amount of grain allocated to the district this time is estimated at 5,300 shi (石) of pure rice. For this phase of grain allocation, the authorities are allocating an average of 1.8 sheng (升) of whole rice per person, priced at five yuan and forty cents, based on the district's population of 282,757 in February of this year. According to the person in charge of the public grain distribution points, some citizens in the district do not collect their rice at the designated public grain distribution points on time, which greatly delays subsequent work. It is hoped that citizens will adhere to the schedule to facilitate public grain distribution and benefit grain administration.

### Millet's Crimes to be Finalized Soon; Consul Court to Announce Verdict, Case Unlikely to Move to Saigon

A Central News Agency report from Shanghai states that the case of Zhang Jinhai, a young man who tragically died from injuries sustained under torture during interrogation, has reached a conclusion after authorities argued on the basis of reason. However, after the main culprit, Millet, was formally prosecuted by the French Consul Court, a hearing was held, but a formal verdict has not yet been issued. Now, according to a Central News Agency reporter, after further questioning by the French Consul Court, the entire case will be finalized, and Millet will be severely punished. Whether the court has the authority to pronounce Millet's crimes will be instructed by the Saigon authorities, so the announcement of Millet's crimes may not be transferred to Saigon.

### Poor People's Mat Sheds on North Zhejiang Road Urgently Need Donations for Repairs; Over a Thousand Refugees Living in a Swamp; Repair Costs Exceed 100,000 Yuan

The Shanghai Charity Organization United Disaster Relief Association yesterday appealed to all sectors for funds to repair shelters. According to the association, the Cilian Nursing Home and Ciji Children's Education Center currently accommodate over a thousand elderly, weak, orphaned, and poor people in approximately one hundred straw sheds built about six years ago at the former Ciyuan Shelter at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. Most of the sheds are damaged, and leaks occur whenever it rains. Hiring craftsmen for repairs is expensive, and the estimated cost is no less than 100,000 yuan. As the rainy season approaches, the matter cannot be delayed any longer. It is hoped that people from all walks of life will extend their compassionate wishes and generously donate to provide shelter for these thousand-plus poor people, whose merits would be boundless.

### Kangxi Dynasty Court Music; Famous Musical Performance

Mrs. Della Chiesa, wife of the Italian Ambassador to China, will host a concert at the Italian Auditorium, 2001 Jing'an Temple Road, Shanghai, on May 29th. The concert will feature performances by renowned pianist Neri, violinist Bellini, and cellist Bellezza. The program is exceptionally brilliant, including a sonata composed by the Italian musician Father Teodorico Pedrini, who was favored by Emperor Kangxi of the early Qing Dynasty. This work will be performed publicly for the first time in the world using modern instruments – piano and violin. It is said that the original score consisted of twelve pieces, which were lost for two centuries but were recently discovered in the archives in Beiping. Mr. Bellezza has selected one piece and carefully arranged it for the aforementioned instruments. In addition to the performance of Beethoven's beautiful trio, the program will also include Corelli's Adagio, Bach's Italian Concerto, Sammartini's Sonata, and famous pieces by Veracini, Boccherini, MacGrini, and others, interspersed throughout the program. It is anticipated that the concert will be deeply moving and inspire listeners. It is reported that tickets can be purchased from Fowler & Co. at 430 Sichuan Road, the Asia Credit Bureau at 303 Avenue Edward VII, Savoy Restaurant at 316 Avenue Albert, or the Italian Club at 10 Route Ghisi.

### Central China Cotton Control Association Halts Private Cotton Smuggling; Large Quantities of Cotton in Jiangsu and Zhejiang; Association Sends Personnel to Purchase

The Central China Cotton Control Association, in view of the shortage of raw cotton materials and the high demand for cotton, has noticed that some individuals are secretly smuggling cotton for profit. The association is now taking measures to prevent this. Furthermore, the association is also aware that a large amount of cotton from Jiangbei (north of the Yangtze River) is being transported to Jiangnan (south of the Yangtze River) and is seeking to stop this as well. At the same time, in order to increase cotton production, the association has dispatched technical personnel to various cotton-producing areas to guide fertilization and other work after planting. According to the association's estimates, before the new cotton crop enters the market, there may be a large amount of stored cotton in various cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang that can be purchased. Therefore, in order to solve the problem of raw cotton materials in the city, the association has sent personnel to the areas with stored cotton to carry out purchasing work.

### A Commoner's Plea

(1) Abolish Miscellaneous Taxes - Wang Zhengxiang

Social prices are rising daily, and taxes are increasing monthly. These taxes contribute little to government revenue but heavily burden the people. Because these miscellaneous taxes are often contracted out, taking the banquet tax in the urban area as an example (now collected by the municipal government), the contractor remits only 30,000 yuan per month, while the actual collection exceeds 500,000 yuan. Even the most basic plain noodles are not spared, enriching a small number of contractors and harming the majority of common people. It is hoped that the authorities will find a way to correct this.

(2) Strictly Prohibit Demolition of Houses - Jun Ba

Most of the houses in the South City were burned down in the war, leaving rubble-strewn streets. This has made it difficult for the residents who used to live in the South City to move back due to the shortage of houses. Demand far exceeds supply, allowing landlords to hoard properties and demand exorbitant key money. Furthermore, businesses lack the funds to rebuild due to the high cost of materials. It is outrageous that some unscrupulous individuals, due to the shortage of timber, are buying houses, demolishing them, and selling the materials for huge profits, disregarding the authorities' efforts to restore the city. Although the authorities have repeatedly issued strict prohibitions, these individuals continue to find ways to evade them, resulting in a gradual decrease in the number of houses in the South City and an increase in vacant land. I implore the authorities to immediately reiterate the strict orders, effectively implement them, assist in banning the demolition of any remaining houses for which contracts have been signed, and severely punish those who bribe officials and secretly demolish houses. Only then will there be hope for the revitalization of the South City.

(3) Eradicate Opium and Gambling - Yan Yi

After Mr. Chen Gongbo took office as the Special Mayor of Shanghai, he stated that he was determined to eradicate opium and gambling in Shanghai. However, until now, all we have seen is that gambling dens and opium dens in the South City have replaced those in West Shanghai, while smaller ones are gradually spreading in Zhabei and Hongkou. However, we believe that this is not due to the municipal authorities' lack of strict enforcement, but perhaps due to the obstruction of certain individuals with special influence, which has prevented the complete eradication.

Clubs and rehabilitation centers, which are harmful to the people and the nation, are springing up all over the country. We earnestly hope that enlightened rulers will clean them up and eradicate them, and never allow gambling dens and opium dens that harm the people and endanger the country to exist again, so that the peace zone can truly become a bright and happy land.

### Sino-Japanese Stars Hold Friendship Tea Party; China Film Company Hosts Toho's Famous Performers

The China Film Company held a tea party at the Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 16th) to entertain Chinese and Japanese opera and film stars and members of the press.

It is said that Taiko Fukumoto is a leading figure in the group and has recently received high praise for singing "China Nights" at the Nanjing Grand Theater. She is very fond of Chinese songs and yesterday, under the guidance of Ms. Gong Qiuxia, practiced the two songs "Dream Lover" and "Don't Forget Tonight." It is said that these activities will continue in the future and that she wishes to teach Japanese dance to Chinese stars to facilitate artistic exchange. It is also learned that they plan to co-star in a film soon to commemorate the occasion. Yesterday was their first meeting and it was very enjoyable.

### Gao Hang District Organizes Anti-Thief Corps; Rotational Night Watch to Stop the Stealing of Agricultural Products

Recently, as the beans and wheat in the Shanghai suburbs are nearing maturity, theft cases have been occurring frequently. Local ruffians, hooligans, and petty criminals often take advantage of the night to steal agricultural products from the fields and sell them for cash. This not only disrupts public order but also harms the livelihoods of farmers. Therefore, the Gao Hang District, in order to effectively curb theft, has made use of the existing Baojia system to organize a night watch anti-thief corps, drawing on residents to take turns on night watch, helping each other to maintain order and suppress theft.

### Brief News

Meal Plan Prices: The Shanghai Kitchen Industry Trade Association, in view of the recent inconsistencies in meal plan prices in the city, has decided through public discussion to adjust prices into four categories: Category A at 10 yuan per meal per day, Category B at 9 yuan per meal per day, Category C at 8 yuan per meal per day, and Category D at 7 yuan per meal per day, all calculated per person. These prices were implemented uniformly yesterday. All members of the industry must strictly comply with them and must not compete for business or make unauthorized increases or decreases in prices in order to maintain industry regulations.

Child Welfare Association Fundraising: The China Child Welfare Association's fundraising campaign for the education and care of refugee children has received enthusiastic support from all sectors, with generous donations.

### The Science of Victory (5)

The reason why the Japanese army and navy have achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War is not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers who devoted themselves to serving the country, but also to the aircraft, tanks, guns, various excellent scientific weapons, as well as provisions, medicines, construction materials, etc., supplied to the battlefield. The army has awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal to inventors of these victorious weapons. The recipients of the medals and the main inventors are introduced below: (Tao: Translated from the April 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Research on the Manufacture of Optical Lenses...Dr. Takashi Matsu, Director of the Osaka Industrial Experiment Station of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry...

Mr. Matsu was born at 10 Nishiki-cho, Kurume City. After graduating from the Department of Applied Chemistry at Kyushu University, he joined the station and has remained there ever since. He has been diligently researching optical lenses for over twenty years. During this war, he provided the air force with a type of "search eye." Previously, the manufacturing technology of optical lenses was entirely monopolized by Germany. When he was studying at Kyushu University, he believed that the reason why Germany consistently troubled Britain in the Battle of Jutland during the previous World War was because it had excellent range-finding equipment. Therefore, Mr. Matsu decided to devote himself to the study of optical lenses as his lifelong career, and to ensure that his own country could manufacture such equipment. At one point, the temperature in the laboratory, with a high-temperature furnace of 1400 degrees, reached over 40 degrees Celsius, like a steaming oven. He continued his research for two weeks, focusing on testing magnifying glasses, and invented a magnifying glass called "Boron-Silicon Crown" that was no less than German quality. Most recently, he broke the method of manufacturing magnifying glasses using a one-ton furnace and used a two-ton furnace. The price is 60-80% cheaper than before, and the quality is excellent, and the manufacturing is easy and convenient.

Mr. Matsu said, "Almost all optical lenses are monopolized by the Schott factory in Germany, and the manufacturing method is very mysterious. Although we can buy these items, we have never known how they are made so well. Fortunately, by racking our brains and following the traces of their manufacturing, we have achieved results that are no less than the best German products. Of course, this success is not achieved by me alone, but is the result of the joint efforts of all members of the sixth division of this experiment station, so I am willing to spend the prize money as useful research funds. I think the sinking of the Ford by the German battleship Bismarck was also due to the excellence of the range-finding equipment. In order to win the Greater East Asia War, we must have even better search eyes. I am determined to continue this research."

### Research on Large Wooden Buildings Using Nail-Jointing...Architect Captain Takashi Takayama and other collaborators...

It is unwise to hesitate and stop because there is no iron or cement. Marshal Togo often said at pre-war meetings when the army formulated the 5:5:3 naval ratio, "Training can be unlimited!" It can be said that wisdom, effort, and persistence are unlimited. For example, aircraft hangars have always been made of steel, but hangars of the same size have been made of a large amount of wood, and their use is not only without any problems, but also has achieved great results. It can be said that this is thanks to the in-depth research of Captain Takayama, an architect in the Air Force's main construction division.

Architect Captain Takayama completely overcame the shortage of steel and completed a large wooden hangar. The captain and his collaborators wanted to improve the steel hangars of the past into wooden ones, with the ends connected by nails. However, this connection method started with a thorough scientific analysis, but the result was always breaking. After breaking, they reconnected it. This continued research finally completed the nail-jointing method between large buildings. Now, thanks to this connection method, 40 magnificent large hangars have been built for the use of the army.

The amount of iron required for this construction is only less than 10% of that required for a 20-30 ton steel structure, or 1.8 tons. Building 40 units can save 8,500 tons of steel, and the cost can be reduced by 2.5 million yuan. This is a huge saving of steel. In addition, based on this concept, the largest 40-meter iron factory has been successfully converted into a 42-meter wooden structure, and the construction speed is 30% faster than that of iron, and the cost is only 65% of that of iron. This is nothing short of a miracle.

This great new invention of Captain Takayama and others was produced in response to the demands of the military and political authorities, and also provides great benefits to the private sector. After three years of construction, the "Volt" Architectural Society's wartime specifications have gradually adopted this new method. (The End)

Economic Commentary

### The Importance of Universally Establishing Farm Granaries

At this extraordinary time, the government regards stabilizing people's livelihoods as one of its important national policies. To stabilize people's livelihoods, the first priority is to ensure sufficient food. To ensure sufficient food, the active emphasis is on increasing production, and the passive emphasis is on famine prevention. Therefore, universally establishing granaries and adjusting surpluses and shortages is also an important part of grain administration. Before the war, the establishment of farm granaries in various places in our country had achieved considerable results, but unfortunately, in recent years, due to the unstable situation, most of them have been suspended. Recently, I heard that the Ministry of Food has a plan to widely establish farm granaries, which is naturally a good policy for revitalizing rural areas and solving the people's food problem.

Universally establishing farm granaries can be carried out through two channels: First, actively urge people's organizations to universally establish them. Before the establishment is complete, simple farm granaries can be set up first, using rural public houses, ancestral halls, or farmhouses as grain warehouses. The stored grain can be discussed with local financial institutions to facilitate funding, but its entry and exit must be strictly supervised by the local government to prevent private hoarding and profiteering. Efforts must be made to make farm granaries a public welfare undertaking for the people, and the government should provide appropriate rewards.

Second, the local government or food adjustment agency should quickly find ways to restore the old farm granaries before the war and appropriately increase them in other suitable locations to handle the purchase, processing, storage, and transportation of food in order to adjust surpluses and deficits and balance prices. It would be best if they could also investigate the storage and demand of food in various places and supply the surplus food to places with shortages. Farmers should be allowed to store and mortgage their grain to facilitate agricultural production funds. In this way, the effectiveness of farm granaries will not only be static storage, but also dynamic adjustment. It is not only for passive famine prevention, but also for active production increase. Therefore, universally establishing farm granaries is a matter of urgency today.

Bank of Communications

### Actively Handling Agricultural Loans Confirmed. Outline of Agricultural Financial Operations: Focusing on the Jing, Su, and Sujia Areas for Agricultural Loans.

The Bank of Communications, as a bank dedicated to developing national industries, has always considered agricultural lending as one of its primary businesses. After receiving orders from both the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industries to implement rural loans, the bank successively dispatched personnel to various counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, to conduct on-site investigations into the rural economic conditions. Based on the investigation results, following the government's national policy, and referring to precedents of agricultural banks in various countries engaging in agricultural financial operations, the bank formulated a detailed outline of specific methods for handling agricultural financial operations and various loans. To this end, an Agricultural Economics Department was established within the head office a few days ago, specifically responsible for handling agricultural financial operations. The details are as follows:

Initial Investigation Results of Rural Areas

Upon receiving the order to implement rural loans, the bank dispatched personnel to various counties in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, as well as the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, to conduct on-site investigations into the rural economic conditions. The results indicated that although agricultural product prices are currently high, the prices of various agricultural supplies and daily necessities are even higher than those of agricultural products. The general situation of small tenant farmers lacking operating funds is very common. The majority are unable to purchase fertilizers and feed, which significantly affects production. At a time when the production of materials is urgently needed during the Greater East Asia War, it is imperative to change agricultural land management from extensive to intensive. Therefore, the need for financial support in rural areas is indeed urgent. Expanding rural loans is in line with the government's wartime economic policy guidelines and the aim of actively increasing production.

Outline of Agricultural Business Operations

In order to comply with the government's intentions and expedite the preparation of agricultural loans, the bank has established an Agricultural Economics Department within the bank, appointing Zhang Enjin as the head of the department, and Liang Dingshu and Fu Dichen as deputy heads, specifically responsible for handling agricultural financial operations. However, the nature of this business is special and different from ordinary banking operations. Because it promotes agricultural economic policies and aims to establish a new rural financial system and institution, it is not profit-oriented. Therefore, in addition to drafting agricultural financial business regulations and various loan rules and submitting them to the government for approval and granting of special operating rights, and conducting operations under the guidance and supervision of the government, the bank has carefully studied and determined the following business outline in accordance with the government's national policy, the actual situation in various regions, and the precedents of agricultural banks in various countries engaging in agricultural financial operations: (1) Improve rural economic conditions; (2) Increase agricultural production and assist in agricultural advancement and promotion; (3) Guide farmers to establish a financial system and financial institutions with self-ownership, self-management, and self-enjoyment; (4) Support and establish owner-cultivator farmers.

Steps for Implementing Agricultural Loan Focus

The bank will conduct a second detailed investigation of the rural economy in the near future. Once the investigation is completed, it will, based on the actual situation, first focus on Nanjing, Wuhu, Suzhou, and Jiaxing as the core areas for agricultural loans, and then gradually expand to the surrounding counties, towns, and villages in the four core areas. The implementation steps, in the first two years of operation, will focus on rural credit and production cooperative loans, increasing the operating funds for small farmers' farmland, so as to improve the production and net income per mu, and ensure that farmland management is changed from extensive to intensive, so that farmers' lives become more prosperous and the rural economic situation is improved. After one or two years, when the cooperative foundation is stable, it will further guide the establishment of cooperative treasuries in various counties and cities, and assist in the establishment of agricultural treasuries at all levels affiliated to the cooperative system, so that the cooperative system can be smoothly integrated with the agricultural warehouse network.

### Japanese Consulate General Holds Liaison Meeting on Material Control

The Japanese Consulate General, in order to prevent Japanese people from violating control measures, the Economic Section police have decided to hold a liaison meeting on countermeasures against Japanese people's violations of material control once a month. The first meeting was held on the 14th of this month in the conference room on the fifth floor of the consulate, to discuss issues such as the punishment of Japanese people who have violated the measures.

### Developments in Trade Associations

Trade associations in this city have been ordered to adjust their structures to adapt to the wartime system. Some of the trade associations for various major goods have been established one after another, and trade associations for minor goods are also preparing under orders. The developments in the various trade associations are summarized as follows:

Iron and Copper Association

The Iron and Copper Trade Association has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Zhang Haoru, Jiang Guiqing, and others as initiators, and a preparatory committee has been established to begin preparatory work and register members. The original Iron Industry Association and Steel Bar and Old Weaving Industry Association have also been instructed to merge. Members of the above two associations must also join this association and register for membership starting today (17th).

Silk Association

In addition, the Silk Cocoon Industry Federation, which was originally ordered to be in preparation, has now received an order from the Special Commodity Marketing and Administration Bureau of the Ministry of Industries, because the Ministry of Industries has designated initiators to start preparing for the silk industry. Since the nature of silk cocoons is the same as silk, and the Silk Cocoon Industry Federation does not fully comply with the newly promulgated laws and regulations, it should immediately stop preparing. Therefore, the association has stopped organizing and has merged into the Silk Association, which is being prepared by Cai Shengbai and others. It is stipulated that trade associations for silk cocoon, silk, and silk product manufacturing, sales, production, and marketing in various regions must join this association as members as soon as possible in order to unify association affairs.

Rubber Association

The Rubber Manufacturing Trade Association of this city has been ordered to organize and is actively preparing. Membership registration will be conducted for three days from today (17th) to the 20th. All rubber manufacturers in this city must join the association according to law in order to protect their business rights and interests.

Electrical Appliance Industry

The Electrical Appliance Industry Trade Association of this city has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Ye Youcai and others responsible for preparation, and they are required to complete the report by the 20th of this month. Therefore, membership registration will be handled immediately. All large and small manufacturers related to the electrical appliance industry in this city, including electric motors, electric wires, light bulbs, radios, lightning rods, bakelite batteries, and small light bulbs, regardless of whether they have joined the association before, must register for membership by the 19th of this month.

### Financial, Industrial, and Commercial Market Conditions in Shanghai Last Week

The weak trend in Shanghai's financial, industrial, and commercial market conditions remained last week. People are stable and quite optimistic about the future, because (1) the government authorities are expanding the scope of investigation and seriously enforcing the law against speculation and hoarding, causing great panic among hoarders who are eager to sell, thus completely eliminating the phenomenon of past hoarding of materials and the resulting lack of market demand; (2) credit is tight, and the branch of the Central Reserve Bank is assisting the National Government in curbing speculation and suppressing prices by stopping interbank lending and shrinking existing loans. Various banks and firms are tightening loans to customers, making it difficult for idle funds to flow into domestic speculation and hoarding; (3) although the Commercial Control Association is actively promoting the organization of subordinate institutions, it is emphasizing the smooth exchange of materials. At the same time, powerful banks and firms are paying serious attention to rural lending, revitalizing the rural economy and increasing agricultural production. Under a consistent optimistic outlook, finance is stabilized, industry and commerce are gradually promoted, and the prices of fixed goods do not move. Even the prices of non-fixed black market transactions are trending lower.

Rice Noodle Association

In addition, the Shanghai Rice Noodle Trade Association was ordered to reorganize into the Shanghai Area Rice Noodle Trade Association, and Luo Haitao and others were designated to be responsible for the preparation, which is required to be completed within a limited time. All Hubei-style rice noodle shops operating in this city must join the association and register their flour, rice, oil, sugar, alkali, and sweet potato flour.

Chemical Industry

The Shanghai Special Municipality Chemical Industry Trade Association has been designated by the Economic Bureau to have Wei Bangjun and six others initiate the preparation of organizational regulations. Yesterday, the first preparatory meeting was held and the following important resolutions were made: (1) Zhou Bangjun was elected as the director of preparation; (2) Drafting of the articles of association was started; (3) Personnel were appointed, etc. It is heard that the association's business includes cosmetics manufacturers, ink manufacturers, and kerosene manufacturers, who can all apply for membership. A public announcement will be made in the newspaper to re-register members in the near future.

### We Await the Manifestation of Facts

— Sheng Dayuan

We, who are suffering in the depths of misery due to unscrupulous merchants hoarding and speculating, manipulating prices, felt as if we were seeing a rainbow after a long drought when we saw the regulations on punishing hoarding of commodities passed by the National Defense Council on the 4th of May. Especially the severity of the penalties stipulated this time made us see the government's determination. However, in the midst of joy, we could not help but feel apprehensive. Facts tell us that although the stipulated regulations are strict, those who implement them are human, and the difficulties they will inevitably encounter during implementation are within imagination. Will the rainbow ultimately remain a rainbow and not bring rain, or will it only bring a few drops of insignificant rain? We eagerly await the manifestation of facts.

Not long ago, the authorities vigorously investigated bank account books and cracked down on speculation, resulting in the punishment of a Morningstar Bank and a Han Gongbei. Of course, this was 100% appropriate, but it gave people the impression of "catching small fish instead of big fish" and, at the same time, led to countless rumors. The regulations passed by the National Defense Council this time are a continuation of the previous investigation and crackdown and are obviously a step forward, which we are of course delighted about. However, we hope even more for facts that will delight the public, and the sooner the better, because we really cannot bear it anymore.

After the regulations were announced on May 4th, prices fell on the same day. This proves that it is possible to suppress prices, as long as it is done. However, where there are generous illegal profits, speculators and hoarders will certainly spare no effort to find ways to evade the law or take advantage of loopholes and commit fraud. Therefore, in implementing these regulations, the government really needs the cooperation and supervision of the majority of people. The article "Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding" published in the Japanese-language Continental New Report has stated that "Hoarding is the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the new economic policy. We will not hesitate to discuss it again and again, no matter how much we say." We hope that all newspapers and magazines in Shanghai will unanimously supervise, report, and support the government in implementing these regulations, so that all hoarders have nowhere to hide and those who implement the regulations have no way to be negligent or accommodate. In this way, the last days of hoarders are not far away, and the public is saved.

### Strengthening the National Government and the Problem of Hoarding (6)

Having classified and described national capital above and criticized the relationship between national capital and hoarding, we will now examine the relationship between various enterprises in the concessions and hoarding. At present, there is a popular saying in the concessions: "Setting up a factory is not as good as opening a store, and opening a store is not as good as hoarding goods." Listening to these two sentences, you can see most of the distorted economic situation in the concessions. No matter how depressed production is, the concessions are still showing a golden age of investment. Moreover, under the current situation in Shanghai, investment has long lost its normal significance. Speculation and investment are simply not easy to distinguish. Considering this situation, let's criticize the activities of banks, business companies, insurance companies, and various factories. From the criticism, we raise the question of how the National Government should crack down on speculation, how to thoroughly investigate speculation, and how to seek to strengthen the National Government and stabilize people's livelihoods.

The Problem of Banks and Hoarding Since the Greater East Asia War, small banks have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. Before and after the occurrence of the hoarding problem, this newspaper has detailed the issue of the reorganization and merger of small banks. Although Fu Feng Bank was punished for the hoarding problem this time, it is not just one or two banks that are engaged in hoarding. Observed objectively, the motivation, capital, deposits, and profit status of most banks, as well as other factors, are directly or indirectly suspicious of hoarding.

For example, a small bank with 3 million yuan of capital, even if all its capital is used for industrial loans or even agricultural loans, its profits may not be enough to maintain the bank's expenses. Furthermore, even if a small bank absorbs a huge amount of deposits, judging from the general trend of current deposits, it can be determined that only demand deposits account for the largest number. Then, how can it maintain expenses and operations by relying solely on loans? This is a very clear principle. Moreover, the motivation for opening a small bank is not to open it as a normal financial institution to carry out normal financial capital activities, but to use the bank as a facade to pursue commercial profits with high interest rates. However, they have learned from the experience since the Incident that the greatest commercial profits can only be obtained through hoarding.

When a small bank engages in hoarding itself or allows others to do so, it cannot engage in large-scale hoarding with its limited capital. Due to this reality, small banks have also developed the nature of institutions that mediate hoarding funds between large banks and hoarders. From the perspective of large banks, since the promulgation of the order prohibiting the commercial activities of financial institutions last year, they have not been allowed to engage in it openly. If they want to profit commercially, they have to rely on commercial institutions or even small banks that are not listed as financial institutions. As a result, all banks have become hoarding financial stations.

The Problem of Business Companies and Hoarding There are more than 500 large and small business companies. This has been said many times. Most of the more than 500 business companies were established around the time the financial institutions' ban was announced last year. It is clear that they are another agency for banks to do business. This is one person's view. Among business companies, there are of course powerful business companies with a long history that are not part of the speculative group. However, strictly speaking, it can be affirmed that business companies are groups that use people's trust in them to engage in speculative commercial activities between banks and enterprises.

In various countries in the world with modern industrial development, there are also forms of trusts and business contracts. In China, which is lagging behind in modern industry, the forms of trusts, business alliances, and business contracts have also been formed. However, Chinese business companies are different from needle organizations. Most of them take advantage of the purchase of factories, the search for Chinese shares, and other special phenomena to engage in speculation. They use the same form to invest in factories for the purpose of centralized management. Therefore, it can also be determined that they have a large amount of speculative hoarding.

However, the powerful people in business companies are all managers or chairmen of top financial giants in the concessions, and they all have powerful banks as their background and cooperate closely. Their future movements and the crackdown on them, as well as their proper development, are more noteworthy than the hoarding incident.

### Thoughts on Six Years of Urban Life

— Ling Zuren

Someone far away in my province recently asked me to tell him some of my thoughts on "urban life" over the past six years, and also said a lot of admiring things, the underlying meaning seems to be really in love with this international metropolis - Shanghai! But, I said to him like this:

…Whenever a clear object or event is placed before you, you always passionately love it at first, but if it never changes its image and quality and always maintains its consistent tone, then gradually you will tire of it. Is life not like this!

Of course, before I came to this city, I really loved it as you do now. However, after six years of friendship, I gradually feel that this old friend is bland and unremarkable, like a setting sun in the evening that has lost the climax of its previous strong radiance.

Although those magnificent 20th-century modern buildings—towering foreign buildings and wide streets—still build this city on the basis of prosperity and beauty, it is still worthy of praise, but to me, the impression it gives me is like a diluted cup of coffee.

You may not believe my words for the time being, but if you have the opportunity to live in this city for a few years in the future, you will remember these words of mine.

Perhaps someone as ordinary as me is not capable of obtaining the treasures of the advantages of "urban life" in the kind of ordinary life I am living now.

Indeed, I am vague enough about the advantages of life in this city.

Perhaps the comfort of those material enjoyments and the pursuit of sensual pleasures are the advantages of "urban life"! However, this advantage has only swallowed up the reputation and future of many people. Perhaps you also understand this level of advantage! Therefore, you are always worried that I may also be tempted by it.

Yes, in this city, who can grasp the firm belief that they will not be tempted? The soft and sweet jazz music, the soft jade and warm fragrance, the girls with red lips and white legs, charming eyes, and snake-like waists are enough to be tiring! Mai Mian Nao, Tai Er Meng coffee, has a strong fragrance!

Quickstep, waltz, fox trot, blues…beautiful melody! Here, I don't want to use words to lay out a clever smoke screen and obscure the facts, I have also been dominated by this beautiful melody!

One year, two years, three years…six years, I have lived in these urban advantages. In theory, I should praise this "urban life", but, where is its advantage; where is its beauty? I still don't understand, maybe I'm a little too stupid.

In just a few thousand words, it is of course impossible for me to fully explain my thoughts on urban life over the past six years, but I give it a conclusion: "Urban life", on a personal level, I feel that it is bland, not an ideal and fulfilling life.

Of course! When you read these words of mine, you should also be deeply disappointed!………

### Remembering Mr. Wei Jinzhi

— Zhang Xinju

When I remember Mr. Wei Jinzhi, a figure with a flat top, a small beard, and a "Lu Xun style" who speaks Shaoxing Mandarin emerges in my mind.

Wei Jinzhi was a disciple of Lu Xun. He personally admired Lu Xun very much, and Lu Xun also praised him as an excellent peasant writer. He was from the same hometown as Lu Xun. Not only did he resemble Lu Xun in appearance, but his writing style also deliberately imitated Lu Xun. Mr. Wei always only wrote novels, and there were not many works. The collections include "Nanny One", "White Flag Bearer", "Autobiography of Seven Letters", etc.

Mr. Wei had a very long period of time teaching at McLaren Middle School. At that time, the author was studying at McLaren, and Mr. Wei was our Chinese and history teacher. His personality was very strong, his temper was straightforward, he liked to scold people face to face, and he never fired cold arrows behind people's backs to speak ill of people. This is what made Mr. Wei lovable, so the students respected and feared him.

Because Mr. Wei was from Shaoxing, his accent was quite humorous. His voice was rapid and short, which often caused laughter in the hall. The students always loved to imitate his tone—"Eunuchs are going to kill their wives," teasing each other. Sometimes we talked to him about Lu Xun's works, and he shook his head and smiled: "You are young and you don't understand Lu Xun yet. You can't understand Lu Xun's articles yet." Listening to his tone, it seemed that we were not qualified to read Lu Xun's works.

In 1937, Mr. Wei married his wife. The wedding ceremony was held in the auditorium of McLaren Middle School. I did not go to watch the ceremony that day. I heard that she was also a writer. I don't know her surname or name. I didn't have the chance to meet her. I don't know what she looked like.

Around August 13th, I only saw one of his short stories, "Mrs. Wang's Struggle," in the "Lu Xun Style." After that, I never saw his works again. I heard that he recently wrote a classical Chinese novel in the Society Daily under the pen name "Wei Niyong". I don't know if it is true.

Now he has given up teaching and gone into business. His eternally firm idea is that he is unwilling to work hard in any occasion, and he is unwilling to do anything that he does not want to do. As I am drafting this superficial and incomprehensible article, he does not know where he is running around.

### A Poet's Sorrow

— Song Lian

Shaped like a swan but thin and long, having suffered the poison of education, this young man has little chance of success.

Indeed, literature is utterly powerless, a parasitic plant of long standing, the leader of all empty movements, so it is in times of war, so it is in times of peace, so it is now, so it will be in the future. Human art is about making money, building guns and cannons, manufacturing airplanes, creating madmen; it is certainly not something that can be accomplished with the twisting and turning of a pen.

However, what happens when one engages in literature! He, like other humans, needs to eat, to marry, fears the cold, needs to sleep, even at his busiest times, even at his most passive moments. Speaking of accomplishments, he was never behind in school, but the moment he leaves school, he loses his swaggering spirit and is squeezed at the tail end of "life," and with the slightest exertion, he will be flung ten thousand eight thousand miles away.

He never understands his friends, how can they be so at ease. Speaking of published works, there aren't many; speaking of the degree of effort, it doesn't seem to be as great as his. This will be a mysterious riddle. Can he explore it? Can he learn from it? Hmm! He really doesn't understand, really doesn't understand!

The wall is covered with vines, the bright green window is wide open, and if the sun shines on it during the day, it is so dazzling that it is almost impossible to find where the window is. To make it seem even more mysterious, the window glass is in the style of a church, yellow, red, blue, orange, making one recall the great architecture of the city of Babylon three or four thousand years ago, the "Hanging Gardens," longing and yearning, but never able to understand the exact number.

This is the residence of the ××× famous poet.

The poet, of course, cannot escape poetic sentiment anywhere; disheveled hair is poetic, clever speech is poetic, extravagant spending is poetic, shiny pants are poetic. And especially poetic, of course, is when inspiration comes, closing the window and letting the sunlight pour through the multicolored glass onto the writing desk, when our poet brushes his hair and sits down to write his masterpiece.

This swan-shaped young man now intends to consult such a handsome figure, although they are classmates, but when a frog sees it, it always can't help but scurry into the paddy field!

A gaunt figure began to wander at the foot of the beautiful wall. The moon emits a bleak light, and seems to show a feeling of being overwhelmed with emotion towards these two superficially disparate figures.

Two pairs of eyes finally met, one like a demon, one like a ghost, the poet poked a messy head out of the window:

"Who is it, groping around, are you planning something bad?"

"No! I, Chanming!"

"............"

The poet is writing poetry, sparsely filling a few lines on a scarlet letter with green ink. Next to it are seven or eight square glass-topped envelopes, all filled in with "No. 1, Village A, New Village, Taierfeisi Road, Miss Hu Yunzhi."

The poet quickly put away the letter, but a few lines had already leaked their scenery:

............

............

Cold Night—:

I want to gaze at your star-like eyes,

The god of love smiles,

The land sighs:

Obstinate humans

For you,

I bear so much cold.

For you

I have endured so much struggle to expand you

............

"Poet, is that all there is to it! I thought you deserved the title of 'Folk Poet'." The gaunt figure is now a hundred times braver!

The poet's answer is to cast a suggestive glance at the envelopes on the table, then slowly pull out something from the drawer and display it in front of the visitor—:

"Summary of royalties for last month: fifty-seven yuan!"

Using the pen to cross out words that are choked in the throat: "Tomorrow I'll give you something else to see in the ×× newspaper."

Tomorrow, on the newspaper with the smell of stale oil, it is clearly printed:

"..................

Cold Night—:

I am gazing directly at—

The beggar's eyes,

The stars sneer

The land only sighs:

Obstinate humans

For you

I bear so much cold. For you, I have endured so much struggle to expand you.

..............."

He then understood the poet's sorrow, the poet's expenses could not possibly rely solely on these fifty-seven yuan, he then calculated his own income, ah! Heaven ultimately does have eyes.

### A Sketch of a "New" Woman

— Jin Ruting

Dedicated to W

It was already past ten o'clock, the sunlight that had been peeking outside the window at first, now boldly strolled in and lay quietly in front of the window. Downstairs, the voices of the servants discussing groceries were loud.

Miss Mei was still wearing a dressing gown, combing her hair in front of the mirror - she sat like that for a full hour, but in reality, it would be more accurate to say that she was scrutinizing her face, discovering the lines of beauty, rather than combing her hair.

"How beautiful..." She dropped the tongs, stared blankly at her face, and whispered softly. At this moment, along with the complacent joy, a feeling of being ridiculed surged into her heart. —

Yesterday, for her marriage, guests were invited to her home; the "bridegroom" was Associate Manager Zhang of ×× Bank, only twenty-five years old.

"A good match, a high marriage, the child is promising, and the family is noble..." After the guests left in the evening, the father shook his big belly and praised with satisfaction.

"Yes, that child is truly what is called refined and gentle, sits upright, and is extremely elegant in conversation..." The mother echoed: "You probably didn't notice, did you? The bridge of his nose is straight..." This was the mother's special discovery.

"In short, he has a blessed appearance and is promising!" The father drew the conclusion. Undoubtedly, he had already agreed to the marriage.

However, Miss Mei's evaluation was quite the opposite. In principle, she was a modern young lady of the 1940s. She had progressive, trendy new ideas, so naturally she would not agree with their pedantic views.

"Damn, blockhead!" In her dreams, she would never have imagined that such a marriage would fall on her. First of all, she fundamentally disliked the "matchmaker introducing, inviting guests" routine; "What matchmaker introduction! How could it be that a modern woman like me wouldn't have someone fall in love with me and propose to me!" And, according to her past fantasies, her "ideal husband" should be united with her in this way: for example, in the bright spring sunshine, when a hundred flowers are in bloom, she leans against the window and sings a sweet love song; somehow, his loud singing voice rises, and then the two embrace and entrust themselves to each other for life... Secondly, she believed that her lover would definitely be as burly as Errol Flynn or Liu Qiong; she often fantasized about romantic pictures: her lover suddenly hugs her, jumps on a magnificent horse, and gallops away. As for why he had to gallop away, she had not yet thought about it, but in short, her lover would never, and should never, be so bland, wearing a long gown, like a little old man; at the same time, the two of them would not be united in such a bland way. — Everything is not romantic enough.

"Does he think he's worthy of me?" She stood up straight, threw away the comb in her hand; a sarcastic sneer floated on her face: "Mom and Dad are behind the times! Their horizons are narrow!"

Thus, after admiring her standing, beautiful posture for a while, she walked to the desk in front of the window. According to her daily habit, after combing her hair, she would start coloring the photos of celebrities - the morning was spent like this. Coloring photos is an extraordinary art, so no matter the monthly exams or major exams in school, she never interrupted this compulsory art course.

Today, her job was to continue completing Diana Durbin's singing photo. Dipping some lipstick, she carefully applied it to the slightly opened small mouth. Suddenly, she stood up as if she had realized something, ran to the mirror, stretched out her mouth, and tried to imitate a charming look.

"As beautiful as Durbin!" Feeling satisfied, she returned to the desk and buried herself in her work.

"Mom told you to go eat, sister!" Her younger brother's voice, he didn't know when, was standing beside her.

"Got it, I'll be right there!" She said faintly, still working seriously.

"Sister, who is this going to be given to?"

"None of your business!" She seemed to be impatient.

"Can I see it?" The younger brother asked softly, reaching out his hand.

"Don't move!" She stopped his hand.

"What's the matter with letting me see?"

"I won't let you see it, what's wrong!"

"I have to see it!" The younger brother didn't show weakness either, simply snatching it away.

A romantic female artist is not to be trifled with. She flared up and punched him heavily: "Get out, you're not allowed to come into my room!"

"Okay! You hit me! I'm going to tell Mom!" The younger brother tore his throat with all his might, crying loudly, and stubbornly ran downstairs.

Then, the mother shouted loudly downstairs: "Mei, why did you hit your brother! Mom hasn't died yet! If your brother is wrong, you can come and tell me; it's not your turn to hit him!"

"I just want to hit him!"

"Oh dear! How can you be so rude! ... I'm telling you, it doesn't matter if you throw a tantrum in front of Mom! In a few days, when you get to the Zhang family, if you still have this temperament, your mother-in-law won't forgive you!" The mother babbled a lot, leading her younger brother upstairs!

"What Zhang family! I would want this kind of man!"

"What? What are you saying..." The mother was alarmed.

"Nothing! I don't want to!"

"Mei, girls shouldn't be so aggressive! The marriage with the Zhang family is my decision, you have no say!" The father, who was sleeping on the third floor, was awakened by the noise, his deep voice pressing down like a large stone, with great weight.

"I don't want to!" The father's scolding dissolved her stubborn defense, but this quickly turned into tears, and she burst into tears, falling on the bed.

"You have to want to, even if you don't want to!" The father did not pity her at all.

Miss Mei cried and cried - besides coloring celebrity photos, this should be her special art! The mother came to persuade her several times, but the answer to this gentle stroking was only impatient shouting! Thus, the mother, who could figure out her daughter's temper, simply avoided her!

At first, she kept cursing the Zhang family, her father, her mother, and her younger brother... Later, she gradually felt tired, and she sighed long, wiping the taut eyelids from crying; her whole body slowly relaxed.

"This is what is called a good match!" She was suddenly startled, and then, unconsciously, she thought of Chen Yanyan in Butterfly Dream; this was a victim of feudal forces. At this time, she couldn't help but feel complacent; however, after all, she had too few similarities with Butterfly Dream, she wasn't a prostitute, not to mention that she didn't have a Smart lover like Liu Qiong at all. This was inevitably a bit disappointing. So, she thought of "if only we had met before marriage," the heroines in the wedding night didn't match her.

"Got it! I am Hui in Spring!" Finally, she finally caught someone, overjoyed, and greatly excited! What Zhang family, what the father's categorical scolding were all thrown to the back of her mind! — It should be romantic enough for her fate to be the same as the characters in the movie!

So, she sang The Manchurian Girl...

In the evening, the mother bought a lot of sweets to resolve the grievances she had suffered in the morning, and also invited Miss Fang from next door to accompany her. The two of them talked, from Chen Yanyan's marital change to Gao Zhanfei's arrival in Shanghai, and then to Diana Durbin's marriage...

"I just finished coloring a photo of Diana Durbin today, you haven't seen it yet!" Saying this, Miss Mei opened the drawer and took out the photo.

"It's a pity the flesh color is too dark!" That one didn't appreciate it.

"That's not necessarily..." Miss Mei felt a slight annoyance, and then she pointed to the photo and said: "Look how beautiful this mouth is!" The answer she was looking forward to was: "Don't say it! Yours is even more beautiful than hers!"

"Mei, I recently got a personally signed photo from Chen Yunshang, it's really beautiful!" Miss Fang didn't join in the fun again, changing the topic and boasting.

"What's so rare about that! Just write a letter to Ziming Apartment and you'll get it!" Miss Mei pouted, unwilling to echo her.

"But she doesn't live there anymore!" Miss Fang smiled, "And she doesn't easily give photos to fans now!"

"Who said, that's not wrong, she still lives there!" Mei was not convinced.

"Really, she moved!"

"Nonsense, this is the 'air' she's putting out!" She shouted sharply, as if arguing about a serious, personal question; she said contemptuously in her heart: "In any case, I know more about things in the film circle than you do!"

"This can't be 'air'!" Miss Fang said with a smile: "Mei, this is what I bought yesterday. - The latest style!" She pointed to the leather shoes on her feet:

"There's nothing good-looking about them!" Miss Mei was completely sulking!

The conversation didn't mesh, and Miss Fang went home before ten o'clock.

"Yes, Mei! You can sleep too. Don't tire yourself out, Associate Manager Zhang will invite you to see a movie tomorrow!" The mother sent Miss Fang out and advised her with a smile.

"No, I'm not going!" She said coyly.

"Child! You're not being obedient again!"

"I'm not going, I don't have shoes!" Seizing the opportunity, she made her request.

"I just bought a pair of leather shoes last month, and now you say you don't have shoes?" The mother asked strangely.

"The style of those shoes is too old, I want to buy the kind that Miss Fang is wearing on her feet!"

"Don't make a fuss! Go to sleep quickly, we'll talk about it in a few days!" The mother secretly agreed!

"But, without shoes, I'm not going!" She acted spoiled, smiling inwardly - another pair of leather shoes!
