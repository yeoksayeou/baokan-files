### Private Thoughts on Courts After the Recovery of Concessions

— Zhang Yipeng

The Public Concession has been confirmed to be recovered on August 1st, and the French Concession has also been decided to be recovered. The various preparations and plans after the recovery concern national policy, and we cannot make specific criticisms. However, the public has been discussing it, causing great concern. Regarding major issues such as public security, economy, foreign relations, and education, we hear about them in teahouses and taverns, and see them in magazines and newspapers. Even enlightened people from friendly countries are taking a bystander attitude, offering advice. However, the issue of the courts is never mentioned, which can be said to be a slight oversight. I believe that the political system as a whole is similar to the human body. The driving force of the human body relies entirely on sufficient blood and strong bones. If only the blood is replenished properly, but one cannot stand or walk, and there is no strength to support dressing, eating, sitting, and grasping, then the blood will also lose its effectiveness. As for education, it is a nourishing agent; public security is a vaccination; and foreign relations are a blood transfusion device. Although none of them can be missing, they are ultimately acquired. The economy is the blood of politics, valued for its flow; the law is the backbone of politics, valued for its stability. Flexibility and rigidity complement each other; metaphysics and physics are fundamentally interconnected in principle.

Now, let's talk about the judiciary of the concessions, which is the current court system. Currently, the courts in the two concessions, in the Public Concession, are named the Second Branch of the Jiangsu High Court and the Shanghai First Special District Local Court. They were formally established on April 1st of the 19th year (1930) after the National Government sent personnel to negotiate with the diplomatic missions of various countries and signed the "Agreement on Chinese Courts in the Shanghai Public Concession" in February of the same year. In the French Concession, they are named the Third Branch and the Shanghai Second Special District Local Court. The same agreement was signed in the 20th year (1931), and they were formally established on August 1st of that year. Before the establishment of the courts, dating back to the seventh year of Tongzhi (1868), most judicial cases in the two concessions were handled by an official called the Huayang Yan'an Tongzhi, who jointly deliberated and questioned cases with the consuls of various countries on a daily basis, hence the name "Mixed Court." Although in the 15th year of the Republic (1926), the Jiangsu Provincial Government sent personnel to consult with the consular corps and recovered the public offices of the Public Concession, reorganizing the Provisional Court, the French Concession remained the same. During the Mixed Court era, not only was there no distinction between civil and criminal cases, and the people suffered from litigation burdens, but the consuls of the Mixed Court, nominally serving as jurors, were in fact acting as supervisors, interfering in the judgment of cases with stern expressions and harsh words. Moreover, there were no judgments, and the case files were also extremely sloppy. Since the establishment of the courts, they have been determined to innovate, and the appearance has naturally become more orderly. However, due to the constraints of the agreement, all criminal arrests, investigations, and prosecutions were solely decided by the police, and the prosecutorial authority was almost non-existent. This kind of deformed judiciary must be actively corrected, which has long been the unanimous hope of both the government and the public.

From the 32nd year of Guangxu (1906) until the end of last December, for 38 years, Yipeng has never left the judiciary in his public and private life. Although I dare not say I am an "old horse that knows the way," I should be considered a "pioneer." Now that I am over seventy years old and suddenly see this unprecedented event, I would like to contribute my humble opinion and share my superficial views. Below, I will analyze the outline and express it concisely. I call it "private thoughts" to show that I am not in a position to make policy.

First Outline: Regarding the Organization of the Courts:

First Item—Area—The areas of the two concessions were originally carved out of the Shanghai County territory. Now they have been changed to be directly under the jurisdiction of the Shanghai Special Municipality. After the recovery of the concessions, it is only right and proper that they remain under the jurisdiction of the Municipal Government. However, there are currently three local courts, which is inconsistent with Article 9 of the Court Organization Law. They should be merged into one. If it is believed that the area is vast, branch courts can be established according to law. There are also two high court branches, which is inconsistent with Article 16 of the same law. They should be abolished as well. One civil and one criminal division should be added to the Suzhou High Court to handle appeals, or merged into one high court branch, or the Suzhou High Court should establish a separate criminal division stationed in Shanghai to handle criminal appeals, so as to avoid the labor and expense of transporting prisoners.

Second Item—Personnel—After the merger of the three local courts, the number of judges will definitely be sufficient, or even excessive. However, with the strengthening of the prosecutors' duties, the original number of personnel in the three locations may not be enough. It is necessary to consider increasing it appropriately, but it will not be too expensive. The situation of judicial police and enforcement personnel is complicated. On the one hand, the weak must be eliminated and the strong retained; on the other hand, a proper system must be established. In particular, judicial police and the police bureau have close ties. I believe that it is possible to follow the Japanese system, where all administrative police also hold the title of judicial police. Every fifty people form a team, and the original police detectives should be selected and appointed as captains of the judicial police team, so that everyone can be put to good use.

Third Item—Prisons—Prisons should be organized in the same way as prisons in the interior, using place names to indicate their differences. For example, Caohejing can be called the Shanghai South Prison, and Tashupu can be called the Shanghai North Prison. The distribution and movement of prisoners should be adjusted according to the density of inmates in each prison. However, a separate prison room for foreigners must be established, and they cannot be mixed with domestic prisoners. It is best to combine the detention centers into one place. If it is not easy to do so in practice, the original ones can be used as branches. The prison expenses should be discussed with the Municipal Government and included in the budget. The original sources of funding should be retained for separate use. This is necessary to plan and determine in advance.

Regarding the Authority of the Courts:

First Item—Trial—The trial procedures for civil cases are the same as those of the courts in the interior, so there is no major problem. In criminal cases, police lawyers often appear in court to replace the prosecutorial authority. After the recovery of the concessions, the right to prosecute belongs to the prosecutor, and there is no need for police lawyers to express their opinions. Even if the court needs to investigate the details of the case, they should be treated the same as ordinary witnesses after being legally summoned. As for the legal application regulations, it is said that the ministry is revising them, so I will not repeat them here.

Second Item—Prosecution—Due to the constraints of the agreement, the prosecutorial authority was reduced to nothing to do. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the agreement has been completely abolished, and since July 1st, the office has been upgraded to a department, and the chief prosecutor is independent as the head, how to develop its effectiveness is still constrained by the agreement. Once it is lifted, it will be able to do its best to innovate. The first thing that should be paid attention to is the actual good use of the special power to command the judicial police. Secondly, the excellent achievements of the police in autopsy, chemical testing, and fingerprints should also be received and preserved, and don't abandon food because of choking.

Regarding the Integrity of the Courts:

First Item—Prohibitions—Officials are the parents of the people, and have an obligation to set an example. It is stricter than administrative officials. Like not being allowed to cohabit with lawyers, and not being allowed to socialize, are not included in the official service regulations. The atmosphere of concession judges is gradually improving, but they are influenced by the environment. Local gentry try to contact them in every possible way. If they slightly degrade their integrity, they can easily become corrupted, resulting in damage to the dignity of national law, inviting gossip from the outside world, and causing major cases. Even if the authorities enforce the law, it is only a post-event remedy. After the recovery of the concessions, it is urgent to reiterate various prohibitions. It is better to prevent problems before they occur than to be burnt out.

Second Item—Maintaining Integrity—Integrity is the key to being an official, although it is the same for all officials, but the lifeline of the judiciary lies in this. However, the integrity of officials depends on the cultivation of the country. In the past, the Qing Dynasty gave allowances for maintaining integrity in addition to other salaries, which was really reasonable. Now, can the salaries of judges, including public expenses and subsidies, take care of family life? Even passersby know that it is impossible. I believe that the salaries of low-level judges should be at least equal to the income of rickshaw pullers (ordinary rickshaw pullers earn 50 to 60 yuan per day, about 20,000 yuan per year); the salaries of mid-level judges should be at least equal to the income of barbers (ordinary barbers earn 70 to 80 yuan per day, about 26,000 to 27,000 yuan per year); the salaries of senior judges should be at least equal to the income of managers of general stores and companies (although the monthly salary is not very high, the annual bonus and salary increase are about 40,000 yuan or more per year). Moreover, prices are rising without end. It seems that more contingency funds should be provided, and the president or director should be authorized to increase them as needed with approval. It is necessary to ensure that life can be maintained, and then they can serve calmly. This is an urgent matter that cannot be delayed after the recovery of the concessions.

### In the Decisive Battle in the South Pacific, the Japanese Army Establishes a Sure Victory Posture. The US Army, Despite Sacrificing Repeated Counterattacks, Suffers Heavy Losses. Significant Losses in Ships, Personnel, Military Supplies, and Materials.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - A military expert here, discussing the situation in the decisive battle in the South Pacific, said that the Japanese and American armies have been engaged in a decisive battle centered on Rendova Island and New Georgia Island in the South Pacific since June 30th. The situation is now becoming increasingly fierce. Although the enemy army has repeatedly tried to counterattack at the cost of sacrifice, the Japanese army has repelled them each time and achieved brilliant results. This operation, which has been repeatedly announced by the Japanese General Headquarters, is characterized as a decisive battle to determine victory or defeat, which is different from past wars where victory or defeat was determined by a single battle. The situation is different because both sides are continuously launching decisive battles anytime and anywhere. Since June 30th to this day, only naval operations have taken place in the New Georgia area, but the enemy army has lost six cruisers, six large destroyers, and thirty-four other ships and transport ships. At the same time, it has also lost a large number of personnel and military supplies. However, new battles will be launched in this area. There are two reasons: 1. The US military's counterattack operation this time is based on the experience gained from repeated decisive battles since the beginning of the war until about May of this year. It has abandoned the past mobile troop strength, that is, the centrism of ships and their personnel, and adopted the so-called "base air force" centrism, that is, stationing the air force on various islands in the Pacific, and at the same time using the attack power and high speed of its air force to quickly transport personnel and materials to supply them. Moreover, the strategic line from Hawaii to the outer islands of the South Pacific has recently become a powerful counterattack force of the US military. 2. The Japanese army's southern strategic line, starting from the Malay Peninsula in the west and extending to the Solomon Islands in the east, and its north, including the East Indies, which is one of the world's leading resource areas, has established an absolutely invincible and lasting posture, and has formed a strong and powerful sphere of influence that can be used to suppress the US military's counterattack. Now that the Japanese and American sides are in contact with each other in a decisive strategic posture, it is actually hinting at the future war situation, so it is very serious, and Japan will definitely win. It is expected that the situation will become more intense and more tragic.

Japanese Army Shatters US Counterattack Attempt on the Munda Front

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - As the Japanese General Headquarters announced, the Japanese army has repeatedly defeated the US landing forces in the operation to defend Munda on the front line of the South Pacific and achieved considerable results. However, the enemy army's counterattack attempt is still extremely stubborn, and it is constantly strengthening its land and air forces in order to seize Munda. Therefore, the Japanese naval air force, in order to shatter the factory army's counterattack operation, has continuously bombed the enemy army there in order to secure air superiority. For example, on the afternoon of the 21st, when the Japanese army learned of the enemy's supply ships concentrating in Rendova Harbor, it immediately launched an air raid on the harbor. In addition to sinking an enemy medium-sized transport ship, it also bombed the enemy's large transport ships. At that time, two of them were destroyed. It also sank an enemy large destroyer and more than ten landing craft. On the same day, when it completed the bombing mission and flew back to its defense area, it encountered about 20 enemy aircraft on the way. In this battle, about 20 Japanese aircraft immediately engaged in air combat with some of the enemy aircraft. In this battle, one Japanese aircraft was also lost. While the Japanese army was doing its best to prevent the enemy army's supply and reinforcement, it also engaged in supply and reinforcement missions with several special ships and destroyers, and escort air forces in the Solomon Islands area. On the 22nd, it was attacked by 94 enemy aircraft. The Japanese convoy fiercely attacked amidst the enemy aircraft's rain of bombs. A total of nine enemy aircraft were shot down. In this battle, one Japanese special ship was sunk, but it had achieved the supply and reinforcement mission. Moreover, after the enemy army landed on Rendova Island on June 30th, the Japanese naval force achieved great results in the vicinity of New Georgia Island. It sank six enemy cruisers, six large destroyers, one torpedo boat, one destroyer, nine transport ships, and one special ship. It damaged two enemy cruisers, one destroyer, six transport ships, and shot down 374 enemy aircraft.

Tokyo, 24th - The Japanese army air force engaged in air combat with 20 enemy P38 aircraft south of Madang, New Guinea, on the 21st. It immediately shot down nine of them. In this battle, three enemy aircraft also self-destructed. On the same day, Japanese aircraft also attacked the enemy landing point in Nassau Bay, bombed the enemy troops fiercely, causing great losses. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval air force had previously bombed Funafuti Island in the Ellice Islands, an enemy base south of the Solomon Islands, on the 19th. On the night of the 21st, it attacked the island again, setting fire to the enemy's fuel storage depot and several military facilities, and destroying part of the enemy's supply line. Although the enemy's anti-aircraft lights were very intense that night, the Japanese side suffered no losses.

### Germany Actively Strengthens Wartime Total War System

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - Since the failure of the Battle of Stalingrad, Germany has risen up to launch a counterattack and adopt a decisive battle posture. It has been four months since then, and various lineups have been prepared, and the total war posture has been further strengthened. Now, with the severity of the war situation on the Eastern Front and the Southern Italian Front, it is gradually strengthening and unifying the domestic front in order to compete with the enemy.

On February 3rd of this year, the German government, based on the order of the Ministry of Economy, stipulated the closure and reorganization of all unnecessary and non-urgent stores, handicrafts, hotels, and restaurants, etc., in order to release the remaining labor force for urgent needs such as military industries. Since then, this emergency measure has progressed very smoothly and has achieved the expected new results. On the 22nd, the German Ministry of Economy and the Ministry of Food and Agriculture jointly issued a departmental order announcing the completion of the reorganization and disposal of stores. It also explained that after taking this measure, the German middle class has contributed greatly to the development of national power. According to reports, the German middle class accounts for a considerable number, so it has a great surplus of labor for military industries. Now, floating labor has been extracted from this class and used in military industries. Therefore, the middle class will directly devote all its strength to

Strengthen Military Power

The preparation of Germany's decisive battle posture has also been promoted as a result. At the same time, German women are not weaker than men and have become a new source of labor supply. In particular, the labor of young women has contributed greatly to the increase in productivity. Since the winter of 1941, in addition to serving in labor service for half a year, German women have also served the country for a total of one year due to the establishment of a wartime auxiliary labor system by the authorities. According to the recently published "Treasury of Labor Service," this wartime auxiliary service has been very effective since its implementation and has contributed greatly to the increase in productivity.

Much Contribution

Because women directly participating in the work of military factories account for 60% of the total. From this, it can be seen that the number of women directly supplying labor in military industries has increased rapidly. In addition, the temporary supply of labor is by male and female students. In the past, German universities and specialized schools always had a long vacation from the end of July to the end of November, but this year, due to the seriousness of the situation, it has been decided to undertake more thorough labor obligations than in the past, that is, except for special circumstances, most students will follow the instructions of the school authorities to temporarily

Put Down Their Pens

And start working in military factories. The German government authorities not only require students, but also the general public, to refrain from wasting holidays, and strongly discourage health travel, etc., which may hinder transportation work. Looking at the current situation, it can be seen that Germany is strengthening the total war system in this severe autumn of the war and disposing of and reorganizing the domestic front. Therefore, the domestic decisive battle color is even stronger. That is to say, the German people are now working hard to gather their total strength to consolidate the system of sure victory and invincibility.

### Axis Military Defenses of Western Sicily Concentrated in the Northeast Short-term Combat Power Will Show Increase British and American Forces Divided and Difficult to Succeed

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Haitian News Agency, a reporter from the Haitian News Agency, Setholis, said that the Axis military command concentrated the defense of Sicily in the northeastern part of the island. The western part of the island, including the major cities of Palermo, Marsala, and Trapani, is undergoing a planned retreat. The enemy's attempt to hinder the Axis military's strategy and intercept the Axis military has not succeeded. There is fierce fighting in the central part of the front line. Although the American troops in the Caltagirone, Caltanissetta, and Enna regions attacked with elite troops, they failed to reach the north coast. The American troops encountered stubborn resistance south of the mountainous area on the north coast of Sicily and suffered heavy losses. The news released by the British and American news agencies that the Allied forces had advanced to the port of San Stefano on the north coast of Sicily is probably a misrepresentation of the city of the same name on the south coast of Sicily, which the Axis military withdrew from the day before yesterday. The war situation in Catania in eastern Sicily and on the southern front has not changed. The British Eighth Army, which suffered heavy losses during the attack last week, had only artillery battles and reconnaissance activities the day before yesterday. The German and Italian artillery teams counterattacked and immediately gained an advantage. It is expected that after the Axis military withdraws from western Sicily and consolidates its defenses in the northeastern part of the island, it will be able to show an increase in its combat power in a short period of time. And the Allied forces must divide their troops to garrison in the occupied areas of Sicily, and the Allied forces have suffered considerable losses in manpower and material resources. The Allied command must transfer reinforcements before launching a large-scale offensive against the Axis military in northeastern Sicily.

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a message from the German News Agency special correspondent Blei, the war situation in Sicily is as follows: The British and Canadian forces attempted to break through the German line near the northern part of the plain of Catania, were wounded and retreated. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces seem to be focusing on the western front of Sicily. The Axis air force bombed the American military supply warehouse in the port of Egadi on the 22nd, causing it to catch fire. At the same time, it also bombed the enemy's military supply warehouse in the port of Gela. In addition, the Axis air force sank two enemy cargo ships with a total of 7,000 tons and destroyed three western ships with a total of 11,000 tons in the southeastern coastal area of Sicily. In the air battle, the Axis fighters shot down seven enemy aircraft.

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced on the 23rd that the results achieved by the Axis naval and air forces in the Mediterranean from July 5th to 21st were as follows: 1. Sinking one enemy cruiser, eight destroyers, and two submarines. 2. Heavily damaging 17 enemy cruisers and four destroyers.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Bomb Crete Island Ten Shot Down by Anti-Aircraft Guns

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the German News Agency in Thessaloniki, it has been learned here that Allied aircraft invaded Crete Island yesterday and ten were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. The enemy aircraft targeted the Axis air force base and the three major cities on the island as their bombing targets, but suffered very little damage. This is the first bombing of the island since the Allied forces invaded Sicily, as an attempt to probe the Axis military's defense strength on Crete Island.

### Japanese Ambassador to Italy Visits Italian Prime Minister Presents Prime Minister Tojo's Document Holds Cordial Talks on Sicilian War and International Situation

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Hidaka, following the instructions of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, visited Prime Minister Mussolini on the morning of the 21st and delivered Prime Minister Tojo's document in response to the Italian Prime Minister's praise of the Greater East Asia New Policy. Prime Minister Mussolini received him with pleasure and had previously stated strongly that the Italian people greatly admired Prime Minister Tojo's Greater East Asia Policy. Afterwards, they had cordial talks on the war in Sicily and the international situation. The Japanese Ministry of Foreign Affairs issued a written statement on the 24th, stating briefly that Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Mr. Hidaka, visited Prime Minister Mussolini on the morning of July 21st, delivered Prime Minister Tojo's document to Prime Minister Mussolini, and held cordial talks on current affairs.

### Thai Journalist Delegation Visits Shonan

Shonan, 24th (Central News Agency) - A group of Thai journalists, led by members of the Thai Propaganda Bureau, arrived in Shonan on the night of the 23rd to investigate the current situation in the new Malaya. The group was amazed by the magnificent night view of Shonan. After visiting various related parties on the 24th, the group began to inspect the battle sites in Shonan and study the actual situation of the emerging Malaya in detail. It is scheduled to stay for three days before returning home via Kuala Lumpur and Penang.

### Commander Harada Inspects Wartime Defense Corps

One Claw Jakarta, 24th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Supreme Commander Harada in Central Java, in order to inspect the wartime defense-related organizations in Java, departed with accompanying officials for various parts of central and southern Java on the 16th. Over the course of a week, he inspected in detail the state of alert training of the Japanese army units and the state of training of the defense corps, youth corps, fire brigades, Japanese training corps, women's associations, etc., which were cooperatively undertaking defense, and returned to his defense area on the 21st.

### Fierce Battles at Orel Salient: Heavy Tank Warfare Between Two Armies, Soviet Attempts Fail, German Objectives Achieved

Berlin, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Tongsher [likely Reuters] report, military correspondent Setoris of the Haitong News Agency noted that the Red Army applied extreme pressure to the Orel Salient last week. Over the past two days, pressure has continued against the city's east and south, with concentrated artillery bombardment and the deployment of large numbers of reinforcements and tanks. The fighting has been exceptionally fierce, with advances and retreats by both sides. However, the enemy has failed to achieve its objective of breaking through our lines. The German army has adopted a flexible defense strategy, inflicting extremely heavy losses on the Soviets, thanks to the effectiveness of new German tank weaponry. Yesterday alone, 566 enemy tanks were destroyed at Orel. This summer's war can truly be called a tank duel, with both sides deploying new types of tanks and anti-tank weapons, vying for supremacy. The outcome of this battle remains undecided. The Soviet army continues to launch group offensives at Bei-yu-ge-luo-de, the middle reaches of the Donets River, and the Mius front, but the fighting is not as intense as in the Orel sector. The Soviet army has yet to claim any victories. Its breakthrough attempt northwest of Ku-bi-xi-fu has also failed. The spread of this summer's war to the vicinity of Leningrad does not surprise the German army. If the Soviet army intends to use this as a diversion to tie down German forces, it is miscalculating.

Soviet Tank Units Ambushed and Destroyed

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hama reported that on Thursday the German army destroyed 667 Soviet tanks and 205 aircraft during the great eastern defensive battle. German army units destroyed no fewer than 566 tanks, most of which were destroyed at short range. The effectiveness of German direct-fire artillery is devastating to the enemy. Eighty-three Soviet tanks, either individually or in groups, penetrated German lines at various strongpoints and were ambushed, destroyed, or disabled by direct-fire artillery squads of German grenadiers or determined direct-fire gunners. Another thirteen undamaged Soviet tanks fell into German hands. In the Kuban bridgehead area, three Soviet tanks penetrated German lines and began attacking German artillery positions but were destroyed by German heavy anti-aircraft guns. In addition, 98 tanks were destroyed by the German air force in the Kuban, Mius, central Donets, and Orel areas. German aircraft and Stuka dive bombers launched intense attacks on the enemy, causing a major collapse. Many tanks caught fire and exploded. By nightfall, the Soviets were only able to remove a fraction of their tanks. Since the start of the major summer offensive on the Eastern Front, nearly 6,000 Soviet tanks have been captured or destroyed by the German army. This figure demonstrates the depth of Moscow's hopes for the summer offensive.

Soviet Offensives Repulsed

Thursday, the Soviet high command apparently intended to deploy all its forces in various focal points, even at the cost of the greatest sacrifice, in a desperate attempt to achieve success. From the Kuban bridgehead to the Orel region and near Leningrad, elite Soviet infantry divisions, under the cover of large numbers of tanks, launched fierce attacks on German lines from dawn to dusk. In this great battle, the Soviet army also deployed hundreds of bombers and warplanes. Despite the Soviet army's willingness to commit large numbers of manpower and heavy weaponry, it failed to breach German defenses anywhere. Minor, unimportant local breakthroughs were either immediately filled in or cut off, preventing the Soviet army from exploiting them. After more than an hour of artillery preparation, the Soviet army launched an attack on German mountain positions in the Kuban bridgehead with three infantry divisions and two tank brigades, covered by a large number of bombers and warplanes. In this fierce battle from dawn to dusk, the outcome was undecided; all Soviet attacks were repulsed, suffering heavy losses. One local breakthrough was filled in by a German counterattack. The Soviets lost 16 tanks in this area. German ground troops shot down 29 Soviet aircraft, including two low-flying Soviet aircraft shot down by machine-gun fire.

German Victory in the Mius Region

On the Mius front, German lines were under constant attack by large numbers of Soviet troops and tank units on Thursday afternoon. All Soviet infantry attacks collapsed before German defensive fire. Only one Soviet tank unit, under artillery cover, penetrated German lines, threatening German rear-area communications. However, a German artillery commander quickly recognized the danger of the situation and was able to concentrate sufficient defensive weapons in the shortest possible time to counter the Soviet tank unit. As a result, the Soviet breakthrough of German lines was destroyed or forced to surrender just 30 minutes later. Eighteen undamaged Soviet tanks fell into German hands. At the same time, another 32 tanks were destroyed and abandoned on the battlefield.

German Mobile Warfare Highly Effective

In the central Donets region, the Soviet army could only launch weak attacks due to the heavy losses it had suffered in previous days, and these were easily repulsed by the German army. On Thursday, German positions in the Orel sector were repeatedly attacked by enemy infantry and tank units from the south, southeast, and northeast. The German command adopted mobile tactics to conserve forces in the Orel region as much as possible, while inflicting the greatest possible losses on the enemy, which proved highly effective. After a German retreat, a concentrated counterattack was launched under the cover of large numbers of tanks. After this fierce battle, the Soviets lost nearly 400 tanks. The Soviet army attempted to break through the eastern lines around Leningrad, attacking German positions with heavy artillery fire. Although the enemy deployed large numbers of tanks and warplanes, it ultimately failed to overrun German positions. One German division alone destroyed 30 Soviet tanks. Minor, unimportant local breakthroughs in German lines were filled in during counterattacks. The Soviet army lost a total of 45 tanks on the Leningrad front. The German air force assisted the army effectively at various focal points, especially in the south and center. Many four-wheeled vehicles carrying enemy troops, war materiel, and heavy artillery, totaling one hundred, were destroyed by bombs and machine-gun fire. A munitions depot, a trainload of ammunition, and two armored trains were also destroyed.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Disregard Vatican Protest: Cite Military Necessity, Abandon Political Considerations

Stockholm, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the Haitong News Agency, well-informed British sources say that Roosevelt and Churchill have decided to ignore the Pope's protest against the bombing of Rome. Allied leaders have discussed the Pope's protest for several days and have decided to abandon political considerations for the sake of military necessity.

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington report, President Roosevelt declared at a press conference yesterday that he had not received any message from the Pope regarding the anti-Axis bombing of Rome. At the same time, the President declined to comment on the Pope's letter to Roman Archbishop Selvagiani expressing regret over the bombing of Rome. President Roosevelt also defended the bombing of Rome, stating that Rome is an important military and transportation hub.

Rome, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Stefani News Agency reports that Pope Pius XII yesterday granted a special audience to Roman Archbishop and Vatican Supreme Council Secretary Selvagiani. A few days ago, the Pope wrote to the Archbishop expressing his regret over the anti-Axis air raid on Rome on Monday. According to the Vatican newspaper, the Pope has received many letters from clergy and laity around the world expressing regret over the attack on Rome.

Vatican City, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Haitong News Agency learned here last night that British Minister to the Holy See Oswater and American Minister Titman were both absent from the regular reception held by Vatican Secretary of State McKiernan on Friday. Since visiting the Vatican Secretary of State on Monday, American Minister Titman has hardly participated in public life. He and his family have not taken advantage of the Italian government's permission to go to the Frigen beach.

### U.S. Republican Leaders to Convene Meeting

Lisbon, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Haitong News Agency reports from Washington that leading figures of the Republican Party will convene a meeting on September 6th and 7th to decide on a program of work for the coming year. This meeting is the first gathering of the so-called Republican Caucus. Congressmen and administrators and members of the Republican National Committee all belong to this Republican Caucus. The main items on the agenda are foreign policy, tax issues, the conversion of wartime industry to peacetime industry, and the simplification of government administration.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Japanese military base report, a Japanese army air squadron launched a surprise attack on the U.S. air base in Guilin, Chongqing [likely referring to the location where the US Air Base was supporting]. At that time, twenty American 40-type and 28-type aircraft took off and immediately engaged in a fierce air battle. Japanese aircraft immediately shot down four of the enemy aircraft, and the remaining enemy aircraft, seeing the unfavorable situation, fled in succession. The Japanese aircraft, after completing their mission, returned to their original defenses in formation and triumphantly.

### Second Class of Police Officers Graduates: Chairman Personally Attends to Give Instructions

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Forty-five students from the second advanced police officer training class of the Central Police Academy of the Ministry of Interior have completed their training since arriving in Nanjing.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – At the graduation ceremony of the second advanced police officer training class of the Central Police Academy, the Chairman personally delivered a speech, stating that "the purpose of the Central Police Academy's establishment of advanced training classes is threefold: (1) to enable police officers from various regions to deeply understand the current situation and the central government's policies; (2) to enable police officers from various regions to learn about the actual police situation in various regions; (3) to enable police officers from various regions to receive further training and enhance their knowledge and skills. Now that the training period has been completed, I sincerely hope that after you return to your respective regions, you will all work together with your colleagues and subordinates based on what you have learned. The current situation is at a turning point in the Greater East Asia War, where we are completing the revival of China and defending East Asia. It is extremely exciting that we have encountered such a great situation in our decades of life. However, the economic difficulties and hardships of today's life are also unprecedented. This situation is coming with the great situation. Enduring these difficulties and hardships is precisely the price to be paid for fulfilling the mission of a great situation. We are confident that the war will be won, and the future of reviving China and defending East Asia is infinitely bright. We are determined to practice the New National Movement, with the spirit and courage of hard work and endurance, to pay the price of the times. We must make the people understand the current situation, work hard to increase production, and we must guarantee the security of producers so that the people's strength can be inexhaustible. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government put forward the slogan of 'living and dying together.' The Greater East Asia War is related to the safety and survival of China and other East Asian countries. If we win, we will coexist and prosper together; if we fail, we will perish together. Now that the war is in progress, we must first have the determination to die together before we can enjoy the fate of living together in the future. We will continue to pay the price of the times with the spirit of hard work and endurance, which is the expression of our determination to share hardships."

### Capital City Circles Prepare to Celebrate the Return of the Shanghai Concession: Wang Manyun Received Central News Agency Reporter Yesterday, Discussing How the Return of the Concession is Beneficial to Clearing the Countryside

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Shanghai International Settlement is scheduled to be returned on the first day of next month. The Capital Municipal Government Cloth Industry Department is specially preparing for the "Capital City People's Congress to Celebrate the Return of the Concession by Allied Nations and Overthrow the British and Americans." A discussion meeting was held at 3:00 p.m. on the 24th. Approximately 50 representatives from various Yuan, ministries, and commissions, as well as people's organizations, attended. In order to facilitate the progress of the work, Vice Minister Guo of the Propaganda Department will personally preside over the meeting. The order of the congress, the selection of the presidium members, the layout of the venue, the number of office staff, and the decorations on the streets were all carefully reviewed and smoothly passed.

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement by allied nation Japan, the reporter interviewed Wang Manyun, director of the Clearing the Countryside Affairs Bureau, and asked about the topic of recovering the International Settlement and clearing the countryside. He stated that the only base for British and American aggression against China in the Far East was the Shanghai International Settlement. They used this place, which occupied more than 33,000 acres, to carry out political, cultural, and economic aggression against China. From beginning to end, it has been more than 80 years, making China gradually degenerate into a semi-colonial status. Countless Chinese compatriots have directly and indirectly accepted their brutal killings and harm. Therefore, China will not be independent until the Shanghai International Settlement is returned. This epoch-making Greater East Asia War has brought our country and allied nation Japan from a spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to a state of living and dying together. In order to fully demonstrate its efforts to assist China and fulfill its aspirations for independence, allied nation Japan first advocated the return of our country's concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. The special concessions in Beijing, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Hangzhou, Suzhou, and Xiamen have all been returned first. Now, it is willing to return the Shanghai International Settlement. In addition to feeling excited and gratified, we should show how to Japan's sincerity. The peace movement is a re-departure of the Chinese National Revolution. The purpose is to seek China's freedom and liberation, and then to jointly seek the freedom and liberation of all ethnic groups in East Asia with allied nation Japan. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has intended to protect the peaceful areas and increasingly develop these peaceful areas. In July of the year before last, the implementation of the Great Clearing the Countryside began. For two years, clearing the countryside has been carried out in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Shanghai, and Anhui. Now, Guangdong and Beijing are also preparing. The biggest target of clearing the countryside is to eliminate the communists. Only then can local security be established and the people's livelihood be improved. In the past, before the Incident [likely referring to the Marco Polo Bridge Incident], our country's provinces also handled clearing the countryside, but they were costly and ineffective. The reason for this is undoubtedly related to the Shanghai International Settlement. Generally, the leaders of bandits and thieves often hid in the concession and echoed the mainland from afar, planning the economy, purchasing guns, smuggling drugs, and so the source of chaos in the mainland would never disappear. The government's efforts would eventually be ineffective. Now that British and American forces have been eliminated in East Asia and the International Settlement has been recovered by our country, the root of the disasters in the mainland has been cut off. This will greatly increase the convenience of clearing the countryside in the Shanghai area and the clearing of the countryside in various provinces of the mainland in the future.

### Status of Education in Jiangxi

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Jiangxi Province Education Director Zhao arrived in the capital yesterday with Governor Deng to report on his duties.

The funding is largely coordinated locally by the local governments. After the provincial government was established, in addition to strengthening guidance and assistance to education in various cities and counties, the provincial-level educational institutions will also be prepared for recovery in order.

### Deng Zuyu Pays Respects to the Chairman Yesterday

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Jiangxi Province Governor Deng Zuyu went to the Chairman's official residence at 9:00 a.m. on the 24th to pay respects to the Chairman and report on the progress of the province's administration and to request instructions.

### Conflict Between Chongqing and Communists Intensifies

Taiyuan, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The conflict between Chongqing and the Communists is intensifying.

It is reported that Chiang Kai-shek has issued instructions: (1) Closely monitor the political work of the Communist Party and the work of the Communist army in expanding its territory; (2) Construct a strict blockade line against them; (3) Resolutely annihilate the Communist army for its unreasonable intrusions and no longer compromise.

### Minister Chen Jian Returns to the Capital: Expresses Impressions of His Visit to Japan: Allied People Can Meet the Needs of the Wartime System: Domestic Efforts Should Assist the Government in Construction

Nanjing, 24th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Minister Chen Jian of the Ministry of Construction visited Japan at the beginning of this month to inspect construction projects. He returned to Shanghai by plane from Fukuoka on the 23rd and returned to the capital from Shanghai yesterday. He expressed his impressions and experiences as follows: During my visit to Japan, I arrived in Tokyo, Osaka, and other places, and I had ample opportunity to thoroughly inspect all important agricultural, water conservancy, transportation, agricultural, and industrial aspects. In recent years, under the wartime system, the production efficiency of allied nations has been increasing daily, and the people throughout the country can directly and indirectly meet the needs of the wartime system. There are many places in various parts of China where drainage and reclamation can be carried out to increase agricultural production. We should develop them immediately. On the one hand, the government should actively promote this, and on the other hand, it is hoped that the people will do their best to assist. In addition, various construction projects that are directly and indirectly related to production are also being advanced at the same time.

### Wartime Social Policy

— Ding Mocun

Speech at the Civil Servants' Youth Summer Camp Training Session

What is Social Policy?

Why is there social policy? The reason is that social problems have arisen in society, so there is a need for social policies. Then why are there social problems? It can be said that the more advanced the human race, the more complex the human relationships become, and the more possibilities for problems to arise. From a foreign perspective, problems became more complex after the Industrial Revolution. From China's perspective, social problems have also become more complex since the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement. This is not to say that there were no problems in China before the Xinhai Revolution and the May Fourth Movement, but there were relatively fewer. Whether in China or abroad, the direction of the problems is always two-fold: one belongs to the mental and ideological aspect, and the other belongs to the material and economic aspect. The social problems generally referred to usually refer to the material and economic aspects; to put it simply, the main issue is the problem of eating. Other issues such as housing, occupation, wages, strikes, health, disease, death, childbirth, and famine are all included. In addition, the elderly, the weak, the disabled, women, infants, and refugees are also part of social problems. In short, the so-called social problems encompass all the problems encountered in daily life. Social policy is the government's strategy to help society and remedy various social ills.

Wartime Labor Issues

Wartime situations are more difficult than peacetime in all respects. Therefore, the social problems that arise during wartime are more complex and profound. Taking European and American countries as examples, the center of social problems in peacetime is the labor problem, which becomes even more serious during wartime. On the one hand, there is a shortage of labor, and on the other hand, the class consciousness of the working class is too strong, and the idea of class struggle is too prevalent, often leading to labor unrest. Labor problems do not seem to be a widespread and serious issue in China. However, the government should naturally be very concerned about the protection of laborers and has done everything possible to organize all kinds of labor welfare undertakings. Especially during the current war, the concept of the supremacy of the state and the supremacy of the nation should be the basic concept, and all class concepts should be eliminated. Therefore, efforts should also be made to guide the thinking of laborers so that they can develop in the right direction. At the same time, the government should assist both labor and management in resolving their various disputes so that labor and management can effectively coordinate and cooperate. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, labor strikes have been rare. This is the first point of social policy regarding labor issues.

Furthermore, there are some points that need to be supplemented regarding the protection of laborers, such as labor health, working hours, minimum wages, job security, education, pensions, and policies for female workers, all of which have been closely monitored. Countermeasures are implemented based on wartime needs and objective conditions. In short, the government's principle for wartime labor issues is to eliminate class struggle and promote labor-management coordination, using the protection of laborers as a positive means, and ultimately aiming to increase production and cooperate in the war. For example, regarding the joint ventures, China and Japan have recently jointly formed the Industrial Co-prosperity Association, which is a policy implemented jointly with this goal in mind.

Relief for Refugees

During wartime, the displacement of people is unavoidable. These refugees are far from their homes, and their lives and residences have lost their reliance, so the state must be responsible for providing relief. Therefore, relief for refugees is also a noteworthy issue in wartime social policy. The government has contacted all parties to find solutions together. At times, it may not be able to reach the expected level due to economic constraints, but it is always making the greatest effort. Furthermore, natural disasters, such as the disaster caused by the drought in the northern provinces last year, were relieved by central government funding. This is also an issue that should be paid attention to in the implementation of social policy.

Promote Thrift Movement

In addition, the thrift movement recently promoted in newspapers is also a way to relieve the people's livelihood during wartime and increase national resources. Because extravagance in people's lives is equivalent to wasting the country's resources, which is an invisible loss to the country. During wartime, the thrift movement should be widely promoted to awaken the general public and save as much material resources as possible, contributing to the country, which is also to maintain a little more strength for the country to cope with the current war. We can see that countries such as Japan, Germany, and even the Allied countries of Britain and the United States are all vigorously practicing thrift.

Improve National Health

Furthermore, national health is also a part of social policy. To hope that a country is strong, it is necessary to first make the people healthy. If individual physical strength is not sound, there is no hope for individual career, and the impact on the country is also very significant. For example, Japan has a specialized agency responsible for physical training to pay attention to the physical strength of the general public, and the government also has a special unit in charge of this. Everyone knows that the most important conditions for a country in wartime are manpower and material resources. Therefore, training the physical strength of the people can be said to be a very important policy now. In addition, attention should also be paid to eugenics. Countries such as Japan, Germany, and Italy all have special protection measures and laws for the general public, while China is just beginning to implement them. Policies to protect women and children have a positive effect on the country and are particularly important during wartime.

Solve Employment Issues

Of particular concern in social policy are employment and unemployment issues. This problem is also quite serious in China. In the past, students often could not find jobs after leaving school. Recently, most countries around the world have set up specialized agencies to deal with this problem. The Ministry of Social Welfare of the National Government also has institutions such as vocational guidance centers and job placement centers. Wartime employment countermeasures pay special attention to the adjustment of supply and demand. Because sometimes there is a need for certain talents—such as talents in military industry—that are not easy to find, while workers who are not needed during wartime—such as those who manufacture luxury goods—cannot find jobs for a while. Therefore, the government is considering relief for employment issues.

Organize Social Insurance

Furthermore, social insurance is an important relief undertaking in social policy. Laborers and general workers who participate in social insurance in peacetime can get economic assistance and life security in the event of injury, illness, unemployment, or death. It also has the function of promoting the habit of national savings and is even more necessary during wartime. Social insurance is particularly developed in Italy and has long been popular in other countries. China has not yet organized it in the past, but the Ministry of Social Welfare is now starting to organize it.

Expand Cooperative Enterprises

In addition, cooperative enterprises are also an important policy for solving social problems. Cooperatives have long been very developed in Japan and European and American countries. China has also had a history of more than ten years. During the era of the Social Department, it was actively promoted and has now been transferred to the Department of Industry. If cooperative enterprises can be universally promoted, it will indeed be of great help to the lives of the general public and civil servants. (July 15)

### Record of Annihilation of the Enemy on Sicily

On the 17th, all German newspapers simultaneously published the war diary of the German propaganda team member Lutz, Hoch of Sicily. The chronicle describes the fierce battle between British General Montgomery, who is attracting attention, and the Axis forces in the Catania area. It also describes the tragic situation of the use of paratroopers by the modern army, navy, and air force. The war is recorded as follows:

The enemy has gained experience on the Libyan and Tunisian fronts, so when landing on Sicily, they were prepared with absolutely superior forces and weapons. When landing, they first used artillery to attack the current defenses from the sea, or bombed them with air force to silence them, taking advantage of this to try to land tanks and infantry units. The Montgomery army, which landed on the eastern part of Sicily, moved north from Syracuse and Augusta under the cover of fierce naval artillery fire. By the fourth day, they tried to break through to Catania. However, the Axis forces skillfully avoided the enemy's shelling, and the superior British forces that landed from Augusta inflicted considerable blows on every step of the advancing British forces, preventing Montgomery's army from advancing along the coast with heavy tanks toward Catania. In response to this unexpected and stubborn resistance from the Axis forces, from the 13th to the night of the 14th, they suddenly carried out continuous bombing of the airfield south of Catania from the air and sea, attempting to disrupt the rear positions of the Axis forces, and took the opportunity to drop paratroopers from low altitude above the airfield, but this first wave of paratroopers was immediately annihilated because it happened to be in the center of the German positions on a moonlit night. Soon, the enemy dropped paratroopers southeast of Catania, attacking despite fierce artillery fire. In the moonlit sky, the sound of artillery fire exploding on the ground, the sound of aircraft engines, and the whistling sound of shells passing overhead were mixed together. From afar, the sound of heavy artillery rumbled. Then, the enemy's paratroopers that we had expected began to fall. At this time, countless searchlights on the ground shone in the sky, and the paratroopers were immediately surrounded by concentrated artillery fire launched from the ground. In the middle of this, most of the paratroopers either had their parachutes on fire, or turned into fireballs, just like countless fireballs falling from the sky. In this scorching hell, the enemy paratroopers were completely annihilated. The next day, Montgomery's vehicles launched another assault under the moonlight, attempting to make contact with the paratroopers who had landed at night. However, because the paratroopers had been annihilated, the assault force was repulsed due to the Axis forces' counterattack and suffered heavy losses. (Xiang: Translated from the Berlin telegram of the Asahi Shimbun, July 17)

### Edible Oil Supply to Be Handled by Oil and Grain Committee - Oil Factories Increase Production

Since its establishment, the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has been actively starting work and has developed a detailed plan for future oil and grain regulation and submitted it to the authorities. The rationing of edible oil in this city was originally the responsibility of the military distribution group. It is now heard that starting next month, it will be transferred to the Oil and Grain Professional Committee. However, the per capita oil distribution will continue and will not change. Currently, in order to ensure a sufficient supply, the Oil and Grain Committee is actively purchasing and transporting large quantities of edible oil from North China and is trying to transport it to Shanghai in succession.

Another message, since the implementation of the rationing system by the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office in this province, it has been four periods so far, and the results have been quite good. However, all sectors are eagerly expecting an increase in quantity. A Commercial News reporter recently learned from authoritative sources in the industry that the oil factories in this city are currently trying to increase production, using military-distributed oil-pressing raw materials and purchasing raw materials from production areas to seek ample output. Currently, a large batch of raw materials has arrived in Shanghai from Manchuria, and a small amount has also arrived from North China. The oil factories currently in operation include Yoshida, Wanggu, Rihua, Coating, Chuannan, Oil, Lisheng, and Taishan. There are also Dayouyu and Dade Xin 2 companies that will soon start operating.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stock trading was quite lively on Saturday. The momentum of resuming exchange operations boosted　 the morale of all parties. New buyers were active, and those who had sold in the past three days resumed buying. Sellers raised prices, and the rise was electric, with some stocks reaching unprecedented highs. In the cultural industry, World Book Company rose the most strongly. Commercial Press and China Press each created peaks. Yongxiang Printing had news of capital increase, and buyers continued to purchase it. The department store industry 　　was also strong, and Wing On, Sincere, and China Goods　 each broke through. The Li'an Department Store soared four levels immediately. Underwear made a sudden leap, and Jingfu socks rose sharply. Jinglun was firm and persistent. The textile industry accelerated its rise at noon. It rose a hundred points　. It was still rising in the afternoon. Xin　, Rongfeng, Xinfeng, Guoguang, Guoxin, Greater China Weaving, and Zhen　 Cotton Weaving all rose steadily. Hongsheng Weaving was difficult to buy after going out of the gate. The rise in Xinle Industry was the most　. China-France rose two levels in a row in the news of interest on investment rights. Xin Asia also rose 　. Xinyi and others also progressed quickly. Nanyang Tobacco also rose two levels in a row. Greater China Match rose slowly. The number of tickets for Jubei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric in the public utilities industry was so large that it was difficult to collect and dissolve. Some colleagues have stopped trading, and the market price is also rising. Jiu'an Industrial came out of the gate again, the buying price of China and Guohua Investment and New Asia Construction was rising day by day, New Benefit and Lian Real Estate rose sharply, Chinese Wood Industry, Fumin Dairy, Defeng Knitting, Chinese Brick and Tile, and Huafeng Enamel were searched by people, 　Yuan system　 was seen being raised again. The long-calm Jimin Food was suddenly favored by new investors, and the promotion was strong. Renfeng Dyeing and Weaving New Shares, which is about to debut tomorrow, has a complete equipment and a magnificent scale. It is heard that 80% to 90% of the 40 million yuan of capital is held by major shareholders. There are very few tradable shares. Investors can't find a way to search, and the price has exceeded several times the face value, and it is still not easy to enter.

Also, 　Jingfu Shirt Factory has recently purchased the original site on Xujiahui Road to build a brand-new factory building. Because the factory stores a lot of yarn, the profits are huge. Therefore, the factory's stock has jumped to a major level and has received the favor of investment.

### Shanghai's First Orphanage: A Tour of the Tushanwan Orphanage (Part 1) Taking Tram No. 2 of the French Concession westward until you reach Xujiahui Station, get off and walk out of the "wire fence." Turn left, and you will see the Pu River, commonly known as Caojiabang. Along the river is a long gravel road. After walking several hundred paces, you will see a paifang (archway) with the characters "Tushanwan" written on it. Inside, on the whitewashed wall, is the Latin inscription "Tou-se-we." This is Shanghai's first orphanage—the Tushan Orphanage in Xujiahui, Shanghai.

A Legendary History

At the southern end of Xujiahui, there used to be an earthen hill. It was probably formed by the accumulation of earth due to the terrain and human activities. People in Shanghai rarely saw real mountains, so they exaggeratedly called it a mountain. To the southeast of this hill, the Pu River flowed meanderingly. The villagers combined the earthen hill and the winding water to name it Tushanwan. Since the opening of the orphanage, the earthen hill has been leveled, and buildings have been erected. Today, on both banks of the Pu River stand magnificent buildings: a Catholic church, an astronomical observatory, a seminary, a convent, and an orphanage, making it a famous scenic area in the south of Shanghai. Deep in the greenery, the sound of church bells, hymns, and textbook recitations can be heard from time to time. The tranquility, peace, and solemnity form a strong contrast with the bustling Shanghai, turning it into a small paradise (to be continued).

Brief Commentary: Compulsory Labor Insurance

The Ministry of Social Welfare, in order to improve people's welfare and promote social policies, is implementing "social insurance" and "simplified insurance" as state-owned enterprises, and has specially established the Social Simplified Insurance Bureau to take charge of it.

According to a report on the 21st, the city will first implement compulsory labor insurance starting on the 22nd. According to the provisions of the promulgated interim outline, the objects of labor insurance are (1) factories subject to the Factory Law, (2) mines subject to the Mining Law, and (3) those engaged in dangerous or unhygienic work. All of these are insured under the compulsory labor insurance. The insurance premium is 5% of the insured person's monthly remuneration, but the insured person only needs to pay 1.5%, and the remaining 3.5% is paid by the employer (i.e., the capital side). After joining the insurance, insurance benefits can be enjoyed in case of death, injury, illness, or childbirth due to the performance of duties.

We believe that such social policies, which are entirely designed for the welfare of the people, are commendable in their intention. We hope that those in charge can implement them effectively in accordance with laws and regulations, which will surely gain social trust. However, this kind of undertaking is still a pioneering effort in our country, especially one with a "compulsory" nature. At the beginning of its implementation, people are prone to doubts because they do not fully understand it. Therefore, the competent authorities must explain it clearly in detail so that everyone understands.

As for the word "compulsory" in compulsory insurance, we have an analogy. It is the same as the current public health authorities' compulsory vaccination of citizens. The authorities spend a lot of money to vaccinate the public for the sake of the citizens' health. Therefore, this kind of "compulsion" is also out of good intentions. We hope that the labor community will first understand this point.

Commentary: Rectifying Politics

This column translated and published the "Current Urgent Tasks of the Joint Business Association" discussed in the Dalu Daily on July 20th on the previous two days. In addition to the seven important issues discussed, the conclusion believes that if China wants to achieve success in controlled economy, it must first establish a greater political power... Therefore, the focus of the new policy must be on rectifying politics. This sentence can be regarded as earnest and well-meaning!

Originally, politics is economics, and economics is politics; rectifying politics can rectify economics. However, judging from the general structure of China, how easy is it to rectify? The ingrained habits of the Chinese people are deeply rooted. The spirit of doing things centers on conservatism, ethics are based on prejudice, and the bad habit of pursuing personal gain at public expense seems unbreakable. Thinking of these dark aspects, it is not easy to see the light without a drastic change of direction.

Standing on the economic front, what we are looking forward to is the Shanghai economy after the recovery of the concessions. It can be improved due to the rectification of politics. Although we "must not have excessive expectations" for the national controlled economic institutions, we must not feel despair either, because if we do not despair, hope will not be cut off from us!

Estimated Wheat Procurement

Chairman Chen Gongbo presided over the meeting. The most important cases passed included a proposal to strengthen the investigation team for public service needs to facilitate work, a proposal to strictly keep investigation materials and results confidential, a proposal to establish an investigation officer liaison meeting, and a method for rewarding whistleblowing and the seizure of illegal national important materials.

Business Summary

Gold and Silver: Gold jewelry in silver shops is still suspended for retail sales. Listed prices and handling fees remain the same. There is no market among peers, and few transactions outside the industry. In the early morning, the customs saw a gradual rise, rising several hundred by noon. The price of silver is the same as before.

Public Bonds: The market is slightly stronger, but it only strengthens slightly with the rise in stocks. Also, because the intermediate decline was very large, it then slightly rose.

Cotton Cloth: People's hearts are weak, and transactions are quiet. Market prices are falling. Longtou fine cloth fell again, and Sizijun fine wool fell slightly. Taohua women's cloth and White Cat floral cloth remained unchanged, and Sanyang fine wool also fell.

Cotton Yarn: Because it was the weekend, there were usually fewer transactions. In addition, the authorities strictly investigated the hoarding of yarn and cloth. There was a market without transactions. Only 42-count double-strand Blue Phoenix and 20-count Double Horse singles were opened. The former price was lowered, and the latter rose slightly.

Daily Necessities: Transactions are sluggish. Matches, soap, and candles are all at their peak. Cigarettes are becoming increasingly scarce, soaring upwards. Old British knives, Wuhua fairies, and others have all issued new prices. Qianmen customers are rarely interested. The market is still stable. Other domestic and Japanese cigarettes are flying high.

Grains: In the recent grain market, mung beans once broke through the customs due to strong sales, but now they have gradually declined and returned to the customs. Soybeans are still strong, and soybean cakes are fluctuating.

Disaster Reports from Various Parts of Shandong Province

Various parts of Shandong Province have suffered successive disasters of floods, droughts, insects, and hailstorms. Last year, many wheat fields in the disaster areas were not planted, and there is a serious shortage of food this spring, causing the disaster areas to expand to more than sixty counties and districts, with the number of disaster victims reaching more than one thousand million people. The situation is extremely serious. The investigation of the disaster situation in various regions is as follows:

Jinan City: Last autumn, it was tragically flooded, inundating properties worth millions of yuan. Tens of thousands of refugees were affected, and after entering winter, they slept in the open and begged, filling the streets and alleys. More disaster victims have flowed in from various places this spring. Although the government has set up shelters, it is now unable to provide relief.

Tangyi County, Guan County, Yecheng County, and Qiu County: The entire territory of each county was severely drought-stricken throughout the year last year, with poor harvests in all three seasons. Wheat was not sown, and after entering winter, the people's food supply was exhausted. Grass roots and tree bark were almost completely stripped and eaten. Refugees wandered and moved, resting in ditches. This spring, rainfall was again delayed, and the land was barren for miles. The disaster situation is severe. Although there was heavy rain in mid-May, the young and strong did not return from their wandering, and no one was planting. There is still a period of famine, and it is difficult to provide universal relief.

Linqing County: The disaster situation is widespread throughout the territory, but the situation in the third, sixth, and seventh districts is particularly serious.

Boping County, Heze County, Guantao County, Renping County, and Tai'an County: Each county suffered severe droughts last spring and summer, and autumn harvests were poor. Wheat was not sown, and not a drop of rain fell this spring. Tree bark, grass roots, and seeds were eaten completely. People died or fled, and the situation was tragic. The disaster has reached the entire territory.

Linqu County: Years of drought have plagued the people, and the situation is severe, making it difficult to provide universal relief.

Jiyu County: Last year's drought disaster reached the entire territory, especially the fourth district, where the disaster was particularly severe in thirteen townships.

Linzi County: The county is bordered by mountains in the south and sandy beaches in the north. The population is dense and the area is small. In years of good harvest, the food supply is still insufficient. Suffering from years of drought, the famine has reached its extreme. Although methods have been tried, it is difficult to provide universal relief.

Yi County: Years of poor harvests, last year's drought followed by flooding, followed by hailstorms, the situation is extremely severe. The seventh district, Hanzhuang Town, and other townships are particularly famine-stricken.

Sishui County: The flood in 1940 caused half of the villages in the entire territory to become swamps. The drought in 1941 meant no rain in spring and summer, no harvest of winter wheat, and withered autumn seedlings. The drought was particularly severe in 1942. There is still a period of famine. The disaster has reached the entire territory. Apart from the bandit areas, there are about 40,000 people displaced and waiting for food. The tragic situation is currently impossible to relieve.

Laiwu County: Famine is frequent, and wailing is everywhere. The number of disaster victims in the county has reached more than 20,000. There is now also a severe hailstorm, with 200 to 300 villages affected.

Ningyang County: Years of barren grass and barren land have plagued the people, and the distress has reached its extreme.

Yidu County: Years of drought and lack of food have left the people unable to eat their fill every day. People are starving and dying every day, with three to five deaths each time. The various tragic scenes are unbearable to hear and see.

Yucheng County: Last year's drought caused a reduction in the autumn harvest, especially in the five townships of Jincheng, Zhongren, Zhongzheng, Junming, and Taihe in the eastern part of the second district. All the food harvested before was used up last winter. To this day, the people have not only not planted spring crops, but also have difficulty maintaining their livelihoods.

Pu County: Years of drought have only yielded 20-30% of the autumn harvest. Disaster victims are everywhere, and the scene is too tragic to bear.

Guangrao County: Last year's disasters were particularly severe. The ears of the autumn harvest were not sticky, and since the beginning of spring, there has been no rain or snow. Winter wheat has not been sown, and hundreds of thousands of disaster victims have stripped and eaten grass roots, tree bark, miscellaneous grains, and chaff.

En County: Last year's promotion of cotton fields was frequent, and the people were extremely panicked.

Pingyuan County: The same as Guangrao County.

Huantai County: Last year's poor harvest and the narrow land and dense population have made it difficult for the people to obtain food since the beginning of spring.

Wenshang County: Last year's flood caused a poor harvest of winter wheat. Disaster victims were forced to make a living outside the customs, supporting the old and carrying the young. There were already more than 10,000. Those who had difficulty raising travel expenses were trapped in their hometowns and ate taro seedlings and dried vegetables. The severity of the disaster is unprecedented.

Linyi County: The land is barren and the people are poor. The disaster is severe and they have not obtained food. There is great panic. It is now summer, and spring plowing has not yet been sown.

Xintai County: The drought disaster is extremely severe. Years of poor harvests have caused people to flee in all directions, accounting for half of the county's population. There has been another drought this spring, and the scene of starvation is too tragic to bear.

Lai County: Years of disasters have been frequent. Last year, there was no rain, and the autumn harvest withered. The people had nothing to eat. They mourned each other in the streets, and the tragic situation has reached its extreme.
