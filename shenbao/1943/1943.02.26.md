### Discussion on University Education: Expectations for the Third National Education Conference

The Third National Education Conference has commenced today in the capital. As the entire nation moves towards a wartime system, this conference naturally carries a particularly important mission. Although there are numerous aspects to China's current education issues, the main ones are nothing more than the careful formulation of education policies, the raising and increasing of education funding, and the improvement of the lives of teachers and students at all levels. We expect that an educational policy outline that not only adapts to the current wartime situation but also prepares for the construction of a new China will be announced and implemented following political, economic, and military policy outlines. I would like to first discuss the most widespread and serious crises in current Chinese university education and offer some opinions for the reference of education authorities and attendees.

The main task of university education is to cultivate outstanding talents for the country and to create leaders for society. Therefore, if a country's university education is well-run, the government will not have to worry about a lack of talent, and society will not have to worry about the inability to find leadership figures. However, if we review China's past university education, even without discussing educational principles, systems, and methods, how many people in the country have received university education? Of those who have received university education, how many have truly devoted themselves to the country and society? Therefore, what we worry about now and in the future is the lack of researchers in advanced academics and the lack of talent to take on the task of building the country and serving society. Therefore, the protection of talent in all fields and the promotion of academic research are urgently needed. What we should strive for today is: first, to thoroughly eliminate comprador education and colonial education, in light of the actual situation of the past invasion of our education by British and American imperialism, so that our university education can be completely based on the solemn stance of an independent country to run education. Second, the doors of university education should be open to young people from all walks of life, that is to say, the majority of poor children should also be given the opportunity to enjoy higher education. Judging from the current situation, middle-class families are already struggling to maintain their children's national education; university studies are desirable but unattainable. As a result, universities have become places for a small number of wealthy children to obtain diplomas, which is a far cry from the original intention of the country to establish university education.

The above are two prerequisites for developing university education and cultivating high-level talents. However, the serious crisis in current university education must also be addressed at the same time. That is, the poverty of university teachers and students is so great that it fundamentally shakes the foundation of university education. At present, most university teachers are actually in a state of "not being able to eat their fill and not being able to starve to death", and as prices soar endlessly, they cannot but struggle for life, and have to spend their spare time and energy on daily food and clothing. Status and dignity have long been ignored, and when there is no way to reduce expenses and no way to sell things, they have no choice but to find other ways to survive. As a result, taking on extra classes and part-time jobs, and being busy with increasing income, has become a common phenomenon. The educational responsibility for students' studies has long been out of consideration, and it is impossible to seek students' respect for teachers. Those who are concerned cannot help but sigh at this phenomenon. But if we put ourselves in their shoes, we must know that if it is impossible to obtain even "a meal and a ladle of drink", even a great person may find it difficult to endure. The reason why the majority of university teachers still work tirelessly in education today is nothing more than "their personality still exists, and their conscience has not been extinguished."

The ancients said, "Avoiding illness and hating doctors, the disease will not be cured." The crisis of university education that we are talking about is probably only a very small part. But looking forward to the future of university education from this, it is already chilling. Therefore, we hope that the government authorities and the attendees of this education conference will treat the root cause as soon as possible to preserve the vitality of higher education, to cultivate outstanding cadres and talents, and the country's prosperity and future will be fortunate, fortunate.

Commentary and Discussion

### Wartime System in Daily Life

Every citizen and university clearly understands the importance of the current situation this year, and therefore restrains their own life. However, many people still do not show tension in their actual lives. Those whose duties have a positive contribution to the war have indeed shown tension, but don't they all carry unstable emotions in their own families and lives outside of their duties? Citizens should obey the various life controls decided by the government, and should further cooperate to promote the current situation.

This kind of spirit of the people should be respected. Great politicians cannot avoid the tide of this era. Of course, those in power and leaders, in order to carry out the current war, even if they have the ability to be in multiple places at once, are not enough to cope with the crowded affairs. But consolidating the domestic system and carrying out the work of war are equally important. War is not only the responsibility of those in power and leaders, but all citizens have the same responsibility. Regulations and controls in life that are common throughout the country should be planned by the government, but many problems with local characteristics can be considered by leaders. Similarly, concrete plans to make the lives of individual families tense can be considered by individual families themselves. As for individuals, they must also establish their own wartime system. Being angry at the slackness of the people's lives and the lack of a sense of determination is nothing more than an empty tension of recitation. Reliance on the government and leaders is not reliable. The government should shout from the midst of this tense public life, but even without the leadership of the government and leaders, the people themselves should condense their will and ignite their enthusiasm.

Regarding the issue of life, recently in Germany, there has been the issue of a wartime life system, and in Japan, there have been issues of clothing, entertainment, and food and drink arrangement. The rear life in Germany is built on the basis of a thorough wartime life system, which gives Japanese citizens a great stimulus. The above-mentioned tension in public life should therefore be promoted more tightly. There is a reason why clothing and entertainment have become formal topics in the parliament. Especially the arrangement of entertainment venues, once there is an opportunity, it becomes a topic of conversation, which was originally a problem that was not worth mentioning in public places.

Among clothing, food, and housing, the complete control of food has roughly taken shape. Regarding clothing materials, a rationing system has been implemented to prohibit the manufacture and sale of luxury goods. But there are still many improvements that should be made during wartime. Long sleeves for women are not needed at all in ordinary life, and are only used for wedding dresses. Regarding housing, new buildings are restricted in terms of area and materials, and the use of existing housing should also be considered. Regarding the arrangement of entertainment venues, there is no disagreement, only the issue of the urgency of implementation. These issues have all been raised in the parliament as issues of establishing a wartime system in life. The Ministry of Commerce and Industry recently submitted "Guidelines for Wartime Public Life" to the Cabinet, hoping that this case will not only be related to clothing materials, but will be a basic guideline for various wartime lives.

Su Tiren Discusses Education in North China

Nanjing, February 25 (Central News Agency) Su, Superintendent of the North China Education General Office, came to Nanjing with the chief education administrators and education experts of North China on the 24th to attend the Third National Educational Administrative Conference, and stayed at the Capital Hotel. The reporter made a special visit to Su and received the following remarks: "Since the return of the National Government to the capital, the work of peace and national construction has progressed rapidly. I have not been to the capital for ten years. Today, I have come again and seen that all new construction is under the leadership of Chairman Wang. They all have a rapid and vigorous trend. I and all the gentlemen who came with me are very excited. Since the establishment of the Provisional Government, education in North China has gradually recovered and expanded. As of the 31st year of the Republic of China, there are a total of 12 schools above the vocational level, with a total of 8,000 students. There are 274 secondary schools with more than 88,000 students, 41,267 elementary schools with more than 2 million students, and 4,341 social education institutions with more than 400,000 students. The average monthly number of viewers is more than 900,000. As for the administrative policy in the future, we will follow the instructions of the Central Government. The local governments will study specific implementation methods in order to achieve the effect of the fingers and arms. I believe that education must promote the inherent cultural spirit on the one hand, and absorb modern scientific knowledge on the other hand, so that both material and spiritual things are equally important without being biased. In addition, in response to the requirements of the times, vocational education should be promoted to increase production and cultivate national economic strength. As for the promotion of compulsory education and the improvement of the treatment of school teachers and staff, we will strive to achieve it within the possible scope based on the financial and economic conditions of each region."

### Yuezhou Security Team Cooperates with the Japanese Army to Occupy Junshan, a Yujun Stronghold; Japanese Army in Suhuai Defeats Yujun

Hubei Front Line, February 25 (Central News Agency) The National Government Army is cooperating closely with the Japanese Army to defeat the Yujun, and has been exceptionally active recently. After the start of the attack on the Sixth War Zone of Yu, the Yuezhou Security Team, led by Captain Li Ruizhen, joined the Japanese Army in boats and ships on Junshan, northeast of Luokou, where the 448th Regiment of the 44th Army of Yu was stationed. They bravely carried out the landing and broke through the Yu Army's fortress. They completely occupied the area. Junshan is the only base for the 20th, 40th and 44th Armies of Yu to spy on the peaceful area, and it is a difficult-to-attack and easy-to-defend stronghold. Captain Li led his subordinates to fight alone, and finally completely occupied Junshan. Now the unit has turned to a certain direction to continue fighting. It is also learned that after occupying the area, the defeated Yu army launched three counterattacks, but they were all repelled. On the 20th, they captured two lieutenants and one soldier from the 448th Regiment.

Suhuai Front Line, February 25 (Central News Agency) The elite troops of the Japanese Army launched a fierce attack on the 3,000 remnants of the 89th Army of Yu in the Suhuai wetland, crossed the old Yellow River northward, and forced their way to the vicinity of Xujiaji (20 kilometers east of Lianshui). They launched an encirclement war against the Yu Army lurking in the area, carried out a fierce attack and suppression, and seized a lot of weapons and ammunition abandoned by the Yu Army. In addition, the Japanese Army, which attacked from the middle route, launched a fierce attack on a regiment of the 117th Division of Yu east of Lianshui on the 24th. After several hours of fighting, they defeated them. They are now joining forces with the attacking troops on both wings to suppress the Yu Army's plainclothes team.

### After the Japanese Army Enters Guangzhou Bay, Yu Protests to Vichy; Relations between Yu and France Suddenly Deteriorate

Guangzhou, February 25 (Central News Agency) According to Yu Dian, after the Japanese Army entered Guangzhou Bay based on the Japanese-French Agreement, Yu was extremely embarrassed and protested to the Vichy French government on the 24th, saying that the sovereignty of Guangzhou Bay belongs to China forever. Therefore, it will take necessary measures to the French government to protect its rights. The spokesman of the Yu External Affairs Office also made the same statement on the same day. However, this protest by Yu and the previous abolition of unequal treaties by Britain and the United States have been prevented by Japan and the French government who took the opportunity to take the lead in preventing their efforts. It can be seen from its serious protest to the French government that it is frustrated and embarrassed after being hit again.

Macau, February 24 (Central News Agency) Recently, after the Japanese Army, based on the Japan-Vietnam Joint Defense Agreement, obtained the full understanding of the French government and entered the French-occupied Guangzhou Bay in a peaceful and friendly state, Chongqing was extremely distressed because the sea and land routes were completely cut off. In addition, because the French government declared the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of the concessions, it became angry at the government of the country. According to the news, the Yu "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" submitted a note to the French government on the 24th of this month, severely criticizing the fact that it did not resist when the Japanese Army entered Guangzhou Bay, and did not notify Yu of the situation before and after the event, and said that it would take necessary measures against Guangzhou Bay and demand compensation for losses. The wording was激烈 無禮。 The French government was extremely angry when it heard the news, and the relations between Yu and France suddenly deteriorated. It is said that the French government's representative in Yu has prepared to leave Chongqing to show the severance of relations with Yu.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Sichuan

Nanjing, February 25 (Central News Agency) The Japanese Dispatch Army in China announced today that the Japanese Army Air Force used a joint formation of fighter-bombers to launch a fierce attack on the Liangshan Airport and Wanxian County in Sichuan Province on the 24th, and completely smashed the affiliated facilities of the Liangshan Airport and the ships near the Wanxian County Wharf.

### Communist Army Chief of Staff Joins the Peace Camp and Publishes Memoirs of Joining the Army

Datong, February 23 (Central News Agency) Han Gaosheng, Chief of Staff and Education Staff of the Yanbei District Team Command of the Chahar-Suiyuan Communist Army, realized that the war of resistance was not a plan due to repeated defeats and the impact of the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, so he resolutely joined the peace camp. He recently published his memoirs, in which he said that he recalled that he had been engaged in night warfare for nearly six years. During this period, our situation was extremely embarrassing. We could only hide in the mountains and live by fleeing. If we were spared from annihilation, it would be a major victory for us. All officers and soldiers were well aware of this situation. The Jinchaji District is no longer the world of the Communist Army, but before the Japanese Army invaded the area, it was occupied by them. In the dark and miserable situation, the people's lives were on the verge of extinction, and even the soldiers were pale. Agricultural production was also decreasing day by day. Although I have escaped from the sea of ​​misery and lived a happy life in the peaceful area, the tragedy of my fathers and elders leaving their hometowns and wandering to other places in order to survive due to the scourge of the Communist bandits is something I will never forget. My subordinates numbered up to 1,000 at most. Most of them lacked knowledge, and two years after the incident, they still did not know what the war was. Therefore, repeated defeats were also the reason for this. One of my major mistakes at that time was that I did not know that my subordinates were always looking for opportunities to escape into the peaceful area and neglected prevention. Therefore, the military strength decreased day by day. It was not only insufficient to fight against the Japanese Army, but also difficult to suppress the people. Therefore, I had to forcibly recruit soldiers. One night with a strong north wind, I pulled a farmer from the countryside of Fuping County. His wife had just given birth and was groaning in bed. Seeing her husband's wailing and being forced, she committed suicide with her son at the same time in grief and indignation. Her husband also died in battle in the end. I deeply feel that this tragedy was caused by the Communist Army, so I decided to abandon the dark and join the peace camp. We originally directed guerrilla warfare in the Yan'an area, crossed the Yellow River and over the highlands, but what we got was only a small amount of ammunition. As for food, we only relied on requisitioning on the spot. At first, we used the beautiful name of saving the country to deceive the people in order to obtain food. After a long time, we lost the people's faith and had to forcibly levy taxes. However, because the source of materials was successively occupied by the Japanese Army, prices became higher and higher, and tax rates also increased accordingly. When farmers could not afford it, they replaced it with their cattle, sheep and other livestock. Moreover, due to the compulsory conscription, many young and strong people were forced to join the army, resulting in a daily decrease in agricultural production, but the Communist Army's rampant levies remained the same, so the rich in the Jinchaji Border Region fled to the peaceful area. However, under the Communist Army's terror politics, there were still a few ignorant people who were deceived by their propaganda, trying to restore the peace of the past and endure endless oppression. At present, their situation is extremely difficult, and the level of living is more than ten times higher than that of the peaceful area, and some materials cannot be obtained at all. Therefore, the tragic life of the Communist Army is not difficult to imagine. The currency in the area is all the Northwest Farmers Bank notes issued by the Communist Army, and other currencies are prohibited from circulation. However, due to excessive issuance, it has led to inflation and prices have also soared. In addition, the cultural level in the border area is too low, and it is all controlled by the Communist Party's vicious ideas, resulting in a decline in customs and morals. Although young people's desire for knowledge is strong, the reading materials they get are nothing more than the Communist Party's deceptive propaganda. Medicine is also extremely lacking. I deeply believe that China's participation in the war is the most glorious page in history. We will fight to the end with our inherent cultural spirit, and we will definitely be able to revive China. The people in the Jinchaji Border Region are now in deep water and fire, and we should rescue them from the sea of ​​misery so that we can jointly devote ourselves to the glorious war to destroy the United States and Britain. Han is a native of Fanshi County, Shanxi Province. He is 36 years old and graduated from Taiyuan Military Academy in the 25th year of the Republic of China. He once worked in the newly compiled 8th Regiment of Shanxi Province. At the time of the incident, he worked in the Administrative Security General Team of the Jinchaji Border Region. After the 28th year of the Republic of China, he was trained in the Advanced Guidance Section of the Second Branch of the Anti-Japanese Military and Political University in Lingshou County, Hebei Province. He only took his current position last year.

### Central Political Council Approves Important Cases

Nanjing, February 25 (Central News Agency) The Central Political Council held its 121st meeting on the morning of the 25th. The meeting approved the special appointment of Su Chengde Xiang Zhizhuang as members of the Military Commission, and the special appointment of Gao Guanwu and Shen Erqiao as members of the Qingxiang Committee, and the special appointment of He Tingliu and Ling Xianwen as members of the National Economic Committee, and the special appointment of Zhang Suixi as Deputy Commander-in-Chief of the Second Front Army, and the special appointment of Zou Jingfang as a political advisor to the National Government. In addition, the Qingxiang Committee has added one Deputy Secretary-General.

Nanjing, February 25 (Central News Agency) The National Government's return to Nanjing is about to reach its third anniversary. Today, the 121st Central Political Committee meeting resolved to approve the issuance of the Tongguang Medal by the National Government on the third anniversary of the National Government's return to Nanjing on March 30 this year. This is the first new medal issued since the National Government's return to the capital. This medal is applicable to both civilian and military officials and is divided into nine levels, which are awarded according to official rank and merit. The Tongguang Medal takes the meaning of "working together to advance towards the light". At present, the most important thing is to unite the Chinese compatriots, share weal and woe, live and die together in China, and unite the East Asian compatriots and share weal and woe in East Asia. The words "Tongguang" mean compatriots, sharing weal and woe, living together, and ushering in the light of restoring China and defending the future of East Asia. The meaning is very profound.

### Yu is Quite Dissatisfied with the US Air Force

Guangzhou, February 25 (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from Chongqing, the US Air Force stationed in Yu has recently been suppressed by the Japanese Air Force and has been forced to do nothing in the interior. The Chongqing military authorities and the general public are quite dissatisfied with it. The National News, which is semi-official in Yu, criticized the US Air Force stationed in Yu on the 24th. The newspaper's report is recorded as follows: We are very much looking forward to the air raid on Tokyo in order to obtain the greatest effect of the counter-offensive against Japan. However, it has not been realized since April 18 last year. On the contrary, the activities of the Japanese Air Force on the Chinese front have become more and more fierce. The above is the expression of public opinion in Chongqing. It is noteworthy that the feelings between Yu and the US are deeply estranged due to the issue of strengthening aid to Yu.

### Chief of Staff of the Northern Jiangsu Military Camp, Gao Shengyue, Dies of Illness

He came to Nanjing last year to recuperate, but he did not recover. He suddenly passed away at 0:15 pm on the 24th, at the age of only 47. When the sad news came, all parties were extremely saddened. The body was embalmed in the Dazhong Funeral Home at noon on the 25th. Xiao, Acting Chief of the General Staff of the Military Commission, and others went to mourn him. Gao was honest and incorruptible during his lifetime, and he left behind five sons and eight daughters. He was in dire straits after his death.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry Investigator Returns Home, Makes Remarks

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) Mr. Takeo Imamura, a major general in the army and an investigator from the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, departed from here in late January of this year to inspect North China and Mongolia, spending a month traveling. Mr. Tanaka, a naval colonel and also an investigator from the Greater East Asia Ministry, also traveled to inspect Central and South China. Recently, both gentlemen have successively returned here. They were specially received by the Greater East Asia press corps today, and based on the actual situation obtained from this inspection, they made remarks on various items, such as the preparation of the wartime system in the new China and the contributions of Japan and Italy to the political power of the National Government through friendly measures. They briefly stated: (1) First, regarding the significance of China's participation in the war, the National Government, standing on the position of "sharing life and death," is cooperating with Japan to jointly advance the Greater East Asia War against the enemy that has exploited China for a hundred years, in order to seek China's complete liberation, restore its original face, and obtain the practical benefits of peace. Therefore, participation in the war to defeat Britain and the United States is necessary. As for merely sharing weal and woe, it seems not thorough enough. Therefore, on the 9th of last month, the National Government, seeing that the time was ripe, resolutely rose up to participate in the war, and thus China's position became even clearer. Britain and the United States are not only the enemies of China and Japan, but also the enemies of all of Asia. Japan and Italy, as cooperating allies, resolutely returned the concessions to the National Government and abolished extraterritorial rights for the sake of China's independence and self-preservation. France also took the same measures on the 23rd. Currently, the spirit and determination of China to fight to the death with the enemy can be seen everywhere. The Chinese people deeply hope that after defeating Britain and the United States, which have turned China into a colony and hindered China's freedom and independence for a hundred years, China can be liberated and achieve the goal of peace and nation-building. Therefore, they are determined to defeat Britain and the United States, and at the same time, they deeply resent Chongqing, which willingly serves as an appendage to Britain and the United States and uses airplanes provided by Britain and the United States to massacre compatriots. Furthermore, recently Japan transferred enemy property to the National Government for management, which has made a great contribution to the National Government's political power. The general public and the Shanghai financial community have also expressed their appreciation for this. (2) Regarding the issue of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights, Japan has long recognized that concessions and extraterritorial rights are a humiliation to the old China. Therefore, such vestiges will not be allowed to exist in the new China. As for the transfer of enemy property to the National Government for management, the first batch of more than 1,000 cases has been decided and announced. Recently, there will be a second and third transfer. Japan is determined to cooperate with China in utilizing this enemy property to expand and strengthen national power. (3) Regarding the issue of strengthening the National Government's political power, it has not been three years since the National Government returned to the capital, but its strength has actually become extremely substantial. It is admirable that in such a short period of time, it was able to resolutely wage war against Britain and the United States. This is truly due to the enthusiasm and conviction of the Chairman, as well as the efforts of the key figures in the National Government and the Chinese people. Japan should assist China with all its strength. (4) Regarding the preparation of the decisive battle system after the participation in the war, the National Government is making every effort to prepare the decisive battle administrative posture in order to adapt to the new situation. It has established the Supreme National Defense Council, reformed administrative agencies, vigorously launched the New National Movement, and expanded the Economic Committee, etc. In order to train young people to shoulder the heavy responsibilities of China in the future, there is great expectation for the results of the New National Movement. The recruitment of a large number of volunteer soldiers and their intense training, etc., also make a great contribution to defeating Chongqing and ensuring the security of the new China. All of this is indeed worthy of attention. The work of "Qingxiang" (clearing the countryside) is also progressing smoothly, and the increased production of materials in the areas where "Qingxiang" has been implemented has also achieved significant results. The National Government's military preparations are continuing to be prepared, and at present, the main focus is on maintaining security and achieving considerable results. (5) Regarding the conclusions of this inspection, in short, Japan should provide all its strength to assist the National Government in strengthening its political power. Now, the new China has risen with a determination to fight to the death and recognizes the common goal of invigorating Asia. As for Japan, it is determined to exert its greatest efforts to unite all the nationalities of Asia.

### Soviet Forces Encircle Orel, Eastern Front War Moves North, Both Sides Deploy Air Force for Major Battle, Four Soviet Divisions Encircled in Dnieper Bend

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) Responsible sources here claim that the German defense lines on the Eastern Front have now stabilized, and the center of the war has shifted to the Sukhinichi area (Sukhinichi is on the right bank of the Vava River, northwest of Orel) and the area north of Orel. Soviet forces launched a concentrated offensive in that area, but were severely repulsed by our forces. German defenders, aided by the air force, are effectively resisting the enemy. German forces also hold an advantage between the Donets and Dnieper rivers, annihilating a large number of enemy troops. Soviet advances south of Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga have been unsuccessful. The southern part of the Eastern Front is thawing, so it appears that Soviet forces are likely to launch a fierce offensive to the north.

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) One week after a group of Soviet cavalry was encircled and annihilated by German forces in the Donets Basin, another group of Red Army guards has suffered the same fate in the Mius position and has been almost completely annihilated by us. Soviet forces attempted to encircle Axis forces on the western border of the Great Dnieper Bend, but as a result, about four Soviet divisions were instead encircled by an Axis counteroffensive. Although the German counteroffensive has not yet destroyed the enemy's offensive power, its offensive strength has been greatly weakened. If the Soviet forces continue to advance, they will have to draw on reserve troops. However, the German defenses between the Mius, Donets, and Dnieper rivers are extremely strong, and they have regained the initiative. The Soviet offensive will inevitably be futile. Soviet forces have launched several attacks in the Kotov area, but their forces are weak and have not succeeded. The Soviet Union is still deploying large forces to Orel, fighting regardless of sacrifice. The war is still continuing.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) According to the latest news, there was a fierce air battle in the central part of the Eastern Front yesterday. The Molotov squadron shot down 47 Soviet aircraft. At that time, the Soviet army used a large number of aircraft to assist the army's offensive. Spanish volunteers also participated in the war against the Soviets.

German War Report

Fuehrer Headquarters, 25th (Haitong News Agency) This afternoon, the German war report stated that our troops are advancing smoothly on the southern route of the Eastern Front. The enemy launched large-scale attacks on the central and northern routes, but they were unsuccessful. The enemy repeatedly attacked the Mios front, but was unsuccessful. Most of the Soviet 7th Cavalry Corps, which was trapped behind the front line, was annihilated. Commander General Bao Lianfu and his staff were captured. The annihilation battle is still continuing. Our troops and assault teams between the Donets and Dnieper rivers continue to advance, defeating a Soviet tank army and annihilating an enemy team. The enemy continues to attack west of Kharkov and Kursk, but has not succeeded. Our troops south and north of Orel are continuing to resist, and the enemy has suffered heavy losses. The enemy repeatedly attacked in batches east of Gzhatsk, but was unsuccessful. German aircraft assisted in the battle in the central part of the Eastern Front, shooting down 47 Soviet aircraft.

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) Responsible sources announced that a German anti-aircraft artillery unit destroyed 14 of 20 attacking American-made tanks on the Eastern Front yesterday. The engagement took place on a highway west of Moscow.

Germany Adopts Flexible Defense Strategy, Eastern Front Situation Stabilizes

Soviet Border, 25th (Havas News Agency) The Red Army General Staff announced in its war report today: "In the past 24 hours, our troops continued to fight and advanced in the same direction as before." The report did not specify the location. The difficulties encountered by the Red Army in this offensive seem to have increased, which can be seen from this. The war situation in each area is recorded as follows: (1) On the Caucasian Front, the Red Army repeatedly attacked downstream of the Kuban River, but was blocked by the German-Romanian Allied Forces. (2) In the Donets River Basin, the Soviet side also admitted that German forces are currently "frantically counterattacking" between Krasnoarmeysk and the Sea of Azov, and are advancing with infantry protected by a large number of tank teams. Military observers believe that the war in this area has lost its importance, because the Red Army failed to attack the German transportation lines with lightning speed, placing the German troops guarding the line between Voroshilovgrad and Rostov in a trap. Therefore, the German Commander-in-Chief was able to calmly take the necessary actions to withdraw from the two cities. (3) The Red Army's offensive in the Kharkov area is quite fluid and erratic. Because the Red Army has encountered determined resistance, the Red Army General Staff often changes its direction of attack, eager to achieve decisive results before the ice and snow melt. Several days ago, the Red Army attempted to attack the railway hubs of Dnepropetrovsk and Zaporozhye in the German defense line. By this point, the Red Army was attempting to advance towards the city of Poltava, so the Red Army's offensive moved north again. The Red Army General Staff has ordered the Red Army to advance along the Kharkov-Konotop-Kiev railway. Fierce battles took place near the city of Lebedin today and between Sumy and Bielopolye. In the Donets River and Kharkov areas, the Red Army has suffered heavy losses due to the effectiveness of the German "flexible defense strategy." Several Red Army battalions and tank teams were surrounded by German forces after penetrating deep into the German defense line and were completely wiped out. (4) Local wars are still taking place in the Kursk area. General Golikov's troops have increased pressure in the Orel area after receiving reinforcements. Fierce battles are also taking place near Lake Ilmen and Lake Ladoga. In short, the Eastern Front situation has stabilized, and the Red Army's offensive is gradually weakening, but its strength has not collapsed. The Soviet side is also transferring a large number of reserve troops to the front line to fight, because spring will soon arrive, and the ice and snow have already begun to melt, which will cause the war to stall. In addition, the German forces are currently consolidating their positions, and the weather is currently clear, allowing the German air force, which is actively participating in the war, to regain air superiority.

### Germany's and Europe's Future Will Be Determined on the Eastern Front, Fuehrer Hitler Issues Declaration, Will Use All Strength to Strive for Victory

Munich, 25th (Haitong News Agency) German Fuehrer Hitler issued a message on the anniversary of the founding of the National Socialist Party, stating briefly that Germany's enemies are still the enemies of last winter, and that those who think they can achieve their goals will again encounter tragic disappointment. The German people will use all their strength to conduct the war, and the countries that are fighting against the common enemy will also contribute their strength. Although the enemy's group is large, it is not comparable to the anti-Bolshevik alliance. The National Socialist movement is becoming stronger as it overcomes various setbacks. I still maintain my previous enthusiasm. We will destroy the power of the world's Jewish group, and through the final victory of the war, we will obtain life and bread. Hitler continued, saying that he will achieve his goals, and as in the period of domestic political strife, he still has the determination to fulfill the mission entrusted to him by fate. He firmly believes that God has ordained him to complete this mission, and the German people who support the new Germany absolutely agree with the ideals of the new Germany and the ideals of National Socialism. For months, the National Socialist Party has awakened the German people, explained the current crisis, strengthened their faith in their own strength, encouraged the courage of the weak, and resolutely eliminated saboteurs. Those who accept training will be trained, and terrorism will be met with terrorism ten times stronger. Any form of rebellion will be eliminated. The result of anti-Semitism is definitely not the destruction of the Aryan race, but the elimination of the Jews in Europe. The National Socialist movement will be accepted by all countries, and the enemy will also be forced to adopt the methods of National Socialism to conduct the war. There will be a day when all countries will change their attitudes and oppose the Jews. For months, all the soldiers fighting on the front line have been planning great changes. The future of Germany and Europe will be determined on the Eastern Front. Germany will definitely achieve final victory.

Japanese and Italian Newspapers Comment

Tokyo, 25th (Haitong News Agency) Japanese newspapers today prominently featured Hitler's message. The headlines of "Asahi Shimbun" were very vivid, such as "Total Mobilization of All of Europe" and "A Historic Great Mission Remains to Be Resolved." "Mainichi Shimbun" and "Tokyo Shimbun" attached great importance to Hitler's statement that he would destroy the privileged status enjoyed by Jews in the world. As for Hitler's statement that he was determined to fight against Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union to seek victory, Japanese public opinion was particularly interested.

Rome, 25th (Haitong News Agency) "Il Popolo di Roma," commenting on Hitler's declaration, expressed complete support for the plan for total mobilization in Europe. "Corriere della Sera" and "Il Popolo d'Italia" also believed that Germany and its allies had a close relationship and could rely on it to achieve final victory.

### Twelve German Officers Promoted to Generals

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) It was announced here yesterday that twelve German officers were promoted to generals and one was promoted to admiral. Among them, four had received the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross, and two had received the Oak Leaves of the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross.

### Berlin Announces U-Boat War Achievements This Month, Sinking Enemy Ships Reaching 410,000 Tons, Allied Shipping Feels Serious Threat

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) According to a special report released here yesterday, the enemy ships sunk by German submarines this month have reached a total of 418,000 tons.

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) A supplementary war report released here yesterday stated that among the seventeen Allied merchant ships recently sunk by German submarines, there were eight enemy oil tankers, totaling about 50,000 tons. The American oil tanker "Erima" (6,200 tons) and the hired Norwegian oil tanker "Stigstad" (5,694 tons) were included.

Algeciras, 25th (Haitong News Agency) A British gunboat struck a mine after leaving the port of Gibraltar the night before and sank within minutes. A British destroyer went to rescue it, but also struck a mine and was severely damaged. It is said that the destroyer was damaged by the gunboat's depth charges. The details are still unknown. A total of six people were killed and twenty-seven injured on the two ships.

Lisbon, 25th (Haitong News Agency) Pan Lai recently published an article in the "New York Sun," stating that German submarines are quite effective in hindering Allied shipping, making it almost impossible to protect the Allied important transportation lines. If this submarine threat cannot be eliminated, the munitions produced by American armories will be impossible to transport to the Allied front lines in various places, and the hope of strengthening military power will become a pipe dream. Moreover, the power of German submarines has not yet reached its peak, and they are currently accelerating the construction of submarines. The threat of submarines has truly become the Allied's primary problem. If a remedy is not sought urgently, the war will be in a desperate situation.

### Only Local Battles in Tunisia, Both Armies Actively Strengthening Positions

Lisbon, 25th (Allied News Agency) According to consolidated reports received here, fierce battles took place in the Thala area in central Tunisia in the past few days, but had gradually ceased by the 23rd. However, both armies seem to still be actively strengthening their lines. Axis air force had destroyed about 100 enemy trucks in central Tunisia and shot down several enemy aircraft in the air. They also destroyed 13 enemy patrol tanks and 8 armored transport vehicles in southeastern Tunisia.

Swiss Capital, 24th (Havas News Agency) According to recent reports from both Axis and Anglo-American sources, local battles still occurred in central Tunisia yesterday. According to Anglo-American sources, the German advance near the cities of Kasserine and Thala was stopped by American forces. A message issued by the headquarters of the Allied forces in Africa stated that the German offensive had largely ceased after General Amin's troops occupied an important mountain pass. However, the German and Italian war reports stated that only local wars and reconnaissance activities occurred on the front line, but 11 British and American aircraft were shot down on the front line. The headquarters of the French separatist army also declared that the fighting in the Thala area was fierce, and the reconnaissance units of both sides were very active in the Sbiba area. In other areas, the artillery of both sides exchanged fire. The positions of American troops in the Kasserine area have been improved, but the German counterattack in the Es Ass Community was very fierce. In addition, the ports of Algiers and Tripoli were bombed by the Axis air force. British and American aircraft also bombed the port of Bizerte and attacked Sicily. According to reports from Rome, 8 civilians were killed and 32 were injured. Two British aircraft were shot down.

Allied Forces Suffered Heavy Losses

Berlin, 25th (Haitong News Agency) In the recent Axis offensive in central Tunisia, about 4,500 British and American soldiers were killed and about 300 French soldiers were killed. This is the report from the Axis forces clearing the war zone. The number of injured is several times the number of dead. It is estimated that the Allied forces lost at least 20,000 people. The spoils of war have not yet been fully counted. The enemy abandoned a large amount of artillery and ammunition.

Swiss Newspaper Comments on North African War Situation

Swiss Capital, 24th (Havas News Agency) General Blanckliger published an article in the London Evening Standard today, commenting on the North African war situation, briefly stating that the Allied forces are currently gaining a time factor in Tunisia. German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently stated in his speech that Germany will be able to reorganize its motorcade in two months, and the melting snow on the Eastern Front will also improve the German war situation. The recent setbacks suffered by American forces in Tunisia have improved the German position. The current situation in Tunisia is particularly difficult in terms of air combat. In the Battle of El Alamein in Egypt, the British always had air superiority, but this advantage has been given to Germany in the current Tunisian campaign. However, Generals Rommel and Amin are under pressure from the Anglo-American Allied Forces and must support for two months. If General Alexander can win, it will be during this period, but he does not want to change his tactics and will not easily attack until he has sufficient troops and aircraft. It can be confidently said that the hope of the British army lies in the German personnel suffering significant pressure.

### Japanese Financial Institutions in the South

(Special Dispatch from Yoshita, Syonan, 15th) In the 81st session of the Diet, Finance Minister Kaya's financial speech explained the trend of establishing a financial zone in the occupied territories of the South and establishing a Greater East Asia financial zone centered on the yen. This trend, echoing the war situation, further enhances the foundation of economic construction. Currently, the most noteworthy aspects in the South, as mentioned by the Finance Minister, are: first, the Southern Development Bank has begun issuing banknotes; second, exchange services have begun between occupied territories in the South; and third, overseas Chinese are allowed to remit funds back to their home country. Focusing on these three issues, we provide an overview of the current state of economic construction in the entire Southern region.

The Mission of the Southern Development Bank

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the overall situation of economic construction in the South over the past year has been, in summary, a period of preparation. However, on the one hand, because large-scale military operations are continuing, the occupied territories in the South are naturally adopting policies that directly contribute to enhancing national power in terms of material resources. As for the fundamental issues of the entire Southern construction, they are incorporated into the grand plan of building a new order in Greater East Asia as permanent measures. Therefore, the initiation of each type of enterprise naturally requires a considerable period of preparation.

During this year, various projects started with investigation and preparation. By the end of last year, most of the newly started projects were operating in essence. However, this not only involves the passive inheritance of businesses already operated by the British, Americans, and Dutch in these regions, but also includes various new businesses necessary for the construction of Greater East Asia. These businesses are now gradually bearing fruit, and economic construction in the South is experiencing a leap forward.

With the commencement of various businesses, the need for capital is naturally increasing rapidly. Recently, Japanese trading companies entering the South have formed various new combinations locally, and the businesses they are engaged in are also becoming more active, resulting in an increase in available capital in this area. Banks such as Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Mitsui Bank, and South China Bank allow Japanese companies to finance their capital from these banks. Even at present, they are temporarily allowed to continue operating locally. Those in charge of each company still borrow Southern development funds from these banks based on the original relationships. However, as the progress of various businesses expands, the amount of funds required is also gradually increasing. Therefore, the activities of the Southern Development Bank, whose main task is to finance Southern development funds and material collection funds, have recently become more essential. Taking advantage of this opportunity, the Southern Development Bank is replacing the loans of various banks related to Southern affairs with its own activities, and is now entering a regular path this year. The limit of loans from the Southern Development Bank is determined based on the central capital financing plan.

The Southern Development Bank should be recognized as having independence in its banknote issuance operations in the local area. To promote the smooth supply of Southern development funds and to facilitate the future establishment of a Southern currency system, the current mission of the Southern Development Bank is extremely important.

Occupied Territories in the South Begin Exchange Services

The exchange of goods between various places in the South has recently increased rapidly. Therefore, it is necessary to start exchange services in the occupied territories in the South. Originally, the exchange of goods between Japan proper and the occupied territories in the South, as well as between Thailand and Vietnam, was handled by appropriate trade representatives designated by the military, and the expenses were used under the item of temporary military expenses. However, the recent situation seems to be temporarily stagnant, and the military is directly transporting goods. The rapid recovery of various industries and the boom brought about by new creations have led to an increase in traded goods, making it impossible to handle them using the original methods.

On the one hand, the different currencies in each occupied territory make transaction procedures extremely troublesome. In order to improve the above situation, the central government and the military administration departments in various regions have carefully discussed and decided to start exchange services to promote the organic activities of private traders and local transporters, making the exchange of goods between various places smoother. Therefore, its achievement is highly anticipated.

Remittance of Funds Back Home by Overseas Chinese

Japan's permission for overseas Chinese to remit funds back to their home country has been greatly appreciated by the overseas Chinese. The majority of overseas Chinese in the South come from places such as Xiamen, Shantou, Chaozhou, and Guangdong. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they have been unable to remit funds back to their home country. This was originally unavoidable in areas caught in the whirlpool of war. Thanks to the protection of the Japanese army, their lives and property have been safe and sound. Therefore, overseas Chinese are happy to assist in Japan's economic construction, and their achievements are very great. The Japanese side believes that due to this cooperative attitude of the overseas Chinese, from an economic point of view, it is working hard to rapidly restore the Southern economy, allowing financial institutions to be fully prepared recently. Taking this opportunity, overseas Chinese are allowed to remit funds back to their home country. This move has a great effect on the lives of the people in South China and the South. The exchange rate for remittances back home is based on the ratio between the Japanese yen and the reserve notes and the United Reserve Bank notes.

The successive realization of the above three issues is proof that the economic foundation of Japan in the entire Southern occupied area is becoming increasingly solid. A year ago, the Southern economy was completely dominated by the gold pound and the gold yuan. Now it has broken away from the old order and established a foundation as part of the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. This is indeed the result of the proper operation of Japanese military administration, especially the active policies taken in the financial and fiscal aspects, which have not had any unsettling or destabilizing effects on the minds of the people after the war, and have achieved epoch-making results in a short period of time. With the Southern economy standing on this solid foundation, the preparation of its organized economic form is not far off. At this time, when the South is linked with the Sino-Japanese-Manchu economic policy centered on Japan, the economic zone built on the foundation of the new order in Greater East Asia will, in fact, be completed.

### Britain and the United States Do Not Want the Soviet Union to Win, Fearing the Expansion of the Red Army's Power

(Special Dispatch from Zurich, Yomiuri Hochi, 14th) The Red Army's winter counteroffensive operation on the Eastern Front has been launched on a large scale since last November. Although Britain and the United States realistically expect it, if the Soviet Union succeeds too much, the Soviet Union's say in post-war Europe will inevitably increase. It is inevitable that people will say that Britain and the United States were saved by the Soviet Union, and they will inevitably lose face and have nowhere to hide. Britain and the United States are quite anxious about this. Regarding the Soviet Union's movements in the progress of the war, they are instead wary.

The biggest problem with the Red Army's counteroffensive on the Eastern Front this time is how far the current Red Army's attack will continue. However, regarding this matter, the attitude of Britain and the United States has recently changed suddenly due to unexpected circumstances. For example, dispatches from the Associated Press and Reuters also quoted Moscow military experts as saying: "In addition to the 300 divisions of the Red Army currently in the winter offensive operation, there are 500,000 new troops who have completed training," claiming that the Soviet Union's winter offensive is still continuing, thereby predicting the future fate of the German army on the Eastern Front.

According to Swedish newspapers, a special dispatch from London stated that British military experts commented on the German army's retreat after the fall of Kursk, believing it to be due to the Soviet army's "unexpected" toughness. According to well-informed sources, the Red Army's transportation capacity in this counteroffensive operation is huge, coupled with continuous night attacks on the German army, and the supply of military supplies is abundant. If the Soviet Union's claim of 500,000 new vehicles is true, then the situation on the Eastern Front should be taken seriously not only by the German army, but also by Britain and the United States.

Neutral parties believe that the Red Army's counteroffensive operation has consumed too much, and by the end of February, the ice and snow will melt, and the Soviet Union's original plan may encounter setbacks. The German army's defense capabilities and the spring offensive launched on the entire front should not be underestimated. The Red Army's counteroffensive will definitely not progress as Britain and the United States expected. In fact, Britain and the United States were shocked by the Red Army's successful winter counteroffensive. What they are most anxious about is that the Soviet Union's say in Europe will increase, making it impossible for Britain and the United States to manipulate it. For example, the wife of an American writer published her views in a British newspaper, openly warning British and American people to pay attention to the expansion of Soviet military power, roughly saying: If the Soviet Union has the upper hand on the Eastern Front, then Britain and the United States will be saved by the Soviet Union. When the post-war peace conference is held, Stalin will undoubtedly be the chairman. At present, Britain and the United States unanimously hold this view. The New York Times stated: The time to open a second front has matured. If this good opportunity is missed, it will not only be militarily dangerous, but also politically dangerous. A section of left-leaning elements and conservatives in Britain also believe that if Britain and the United States do not establish any military strategy on the European continent, the Allied European peace conference will be dominated by the Soviet Union. In order to strengthen the say of Britain and the United States on this, they demand that a second front be opened immediately. (Yun Sheng: Translated from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi, February 16th)

### British Prime Minister Cables Indian Leader Rejecting Gandhi's Release, Saying Britain is Responsible for Defending India; Mahatma is Confident He Can Survive the Fasting Period

Bangkok, 25th, Haitong Agency Telegraph - According to news from Bombay last night, Churchill has telegraphed Sir Sapru, the speaker of the Indian political leaders' meeting, rejecting the request to immediately and unconditionally release Gandhi. Churchill stated that he made this decision due to his sense of responsibility to India and the Allied countries. Gandhi is no different from other leaders of the National Congress Party. Therefore, Gandhi should be responsible for the consequences of his hunger strike. India is still under the threat of aggression, and it is the responsibility of the British government and the Indian government to defend India and enable India to fulfill its responsibility in the joint efforts of the Allied countries.

Lisbon, 24th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - According to news from New Delhi, 300 representatives from all walks of life in India have jointly requested the immediate and unconditional release of Gandhi. This request was telegraphed to British Prime Minister Churchill yesterday by Sir Sapru, the leader of the Indian Liberal Party. Churchill replied today, completely rejecting it, saying that the British and Indian governments will not easily abandon their responsibilities to the people of India and Britain due to Gandhi's hunger strike. There is no reason to release Gandhi now, and all responsibilities should be borne by Gandhi. It has been fully explained that the Indian government decided to detain Gandhi and other leaders of the Congress Party in August last year, and these reasons have not disappeared. The joint telegram from all walks of life in India stated that 300 representatives from the industrial, commercial, and agricultural sectors of India, as well as representatives from Hinduism, Islam, Christianity, and British priests, held a meeting yesterday and unanimously passed a resolution. In view of Gandhi's worsening crisis, they requested his immediate release, otherwise it would be too late. Sapru sent this joint request to the Governor-General of India yesterday afternoon, and soon received a reply, roughly saying that there are no new factors to change the original decision, so it is inconvenient to intervene. It seems that although the number of representatives is large and the request is very urgent, it is still rejected by the Governor-General, which is a pity. If Gandhi dies in a British prison, it will inevitably increase public anger. In the eyes of fair-minded people, there is no reason for the accusations against Gandhi by the government authorities. The only way to save the Mahatma's life is to rely on the government. Therefore, we request his release.

Gandhi's Condition Lisbon, 25th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - According to news from Pune, today is the sixteenth day of Gandhi's hunger strike. His condition is still improving. He was given a sponge bath and massage in the morning, but he rarely speaks. He only talks when meeting guests in the evening. Gandhi is scheduled to fast for twenty-one days, which will be completed at 8:00 am on the 3rd of next month (12:00 noon Shanghai time). His attending doctors are now optimistic and believe that there is nothing to worry about.

Lisbon, 25th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - According to news from Pune, yesterday was the fifteenth day of Gandhi's hunger strike. The night before last, he was on the verge of life and death. On Tuesday, Gandhi met with his old friend Alexander, and talked secretly for four minutes in a dimly lit room. This was the first time Gandhi had met a European after his hunger strike. Afterwards, Alexander said that Mahatma Gandhi was confident that he could survive the twenty-one-day hunger strike and is now planning his actions after the end of the hunger strike.

Bangkok, 25th, Haitong Agency Telegraph - According to the Bombay official newspaper, the toxicity of Gandhi's uric acid has slightly decreased, and his physical strength has slightly improved. Indian leaders were relieved to hear this.

Calls from All Sides

Swiss Capital, 24th, Havas Agency Telegraph - Calls for Gandhi's immediate release are being made all over the world, especially in India. However, the British government has not changed its attitude. In addition, many civil servants in various parts of India have resigned one after another, but they stated that they do not support Gandhi's disobedience movement. The Ceylon Legislative Council also expressed concern about Gandhi's health and requested the British government to release him immediately. In London, 200 Indian women gathered in the House of Commons to call for Gandhi's release. In addition, the British Labour Party also appointed a representative, Holland, to visit Emelie, the Minister of Indian Affairs, requesting that lenient steps be taken towards Gandhi. However, the British government's position remains unchanged. The Indian Affairs Department issued a communiqué on this meeting, roughly stating that the Indian government decided to detain Gandhi and other leaders in August last year, and the reasons have been fully stated, which should be understood by everyone. Now, these reasons still exist and have not disappeared.

Lisbon, 24th, Havas Agency Telegraph - According to news received here, several political and intellectual leaders in Chile have jointly telegraphed US President Roosevelt, expressing sympathy for the hunger strike of the Indian Mahatma Gandhi, roughly saying, "If the Governor-General of India rejects the advice of the majority of representatives and responsible persons indiscriminately, then we cannot help but regret it. We firmly believe that Gandhi's release will contribute to the advocacy of peace, just as Gandhi's death will harm the relationship between India and Britain. The charges against Gandhi cannot be supported by any fair court or any impartial organization. Therefore, Gandhi should be allowed to meet with the Governor-General to discuss various issues between Britain and India." At the same time, according to news from Washington, Secretary of State Hull replied to reporters at a press conference, saying, "Regarding the situation in India, I have no fresh news to report."

Swiss Capital, 24th, Havas Agency Telegraph - The Australian Trade Union Reception Committee today passed a resolution requesting the immediate release of Indian Mahatma Gandhi.

### Emelie in the House of Commons Severely Criticizes Gandhi

Swiss Capital, 25th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - According to a London dispatch, Minister of Indian Affairs Emelie replied to a member's question in the House of Commons today, stating that the Indian government does not allow Gandhi's unconditional release, and the British government fully agrees. Judging from the various circumstances when Gandhi was detained, Gandhi did not know the disaster he caused by inciting shootings, riots, and destruction. There is no reason to release the generation who deliberately planned the defense of thirty India in extremely urgent times. Gandhi is no different from other leaders of the Congress Party. Labour Party member Xinwell asked Emelie to provide evidence that Gandhi was responsible for the riots. Emelie hesitated and said that once more reports arrive in Britain, he will make a more detailed announcement.

### Eastern India Again Attacked by Japanese Aircraft; Japanese Air Force Active in Southwest Pacific

Lisbon, 25th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - According to news from New Delhi, a Japanese bomber squadron, protected by fighter planes, attacked the US air base in Assam, eastern India, again this morning. This is the second time in two days. The first time, four of the fifteen large US aircraft parked at the airport caught fire, and the rest were damaged by bombs.

Lisbon, 25th, Allied News Agency Telegraph - The US Navy Department announced yesterday that Japanese aircraft attacked Espiritu Santo Port in the New Hebrides Islands on the 21st of this month, and Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on the 22nd of this month.

### One Enemy Plane Shot Down Over Rangoon; Destruction of Golden Pagoda in Burma Causes Outrage Among Burmese People

Rangoon, 25th, Central News Agency Telegraph - When enemy planes attacked here at dawn on the 23rd, a heavy bomber was shot down by a Japanese fighter plane. According to the results of the Japanese investigation of the wreckage of the plane, it was found that the enemy plane had thorough escape facilities, such as parachutes, fire signal devices, rubber dinghies, saws, axes, food, and various medicines. Also, the enemy had widely publicized that all the planes that attacked Rangoon on the 23rd had safely returned to their original defenses. Now, the facts have proved that they are all completely fictitious.

Rangoon, 25th, Central News Agency Telegraph - This area was again subjected to indiscriminate bombing by enemy planes at dawn on the 23rd. The enemy planes dared to use inhuman behavior to bomb the Golden Pagoda, the largest pagoda in Burma. The attached buildings were destroyed by bombs, and there were slight casualties. All the people of Burma were deeply indignant. The highest commander of the Japanese army in Burma, Lieutenant General Iida, expressed great concern about the unfortunate bombing of the Golden Pagoda and donated a sum of money on the afternoon of the 24th to the standing director of the Golden Pagoda Management Committee, Zu En.

### Promoting the Circulation of Central Reserve Bank Notes; Decision to Expand the Scope of Use; Prices in the Hongkou District Will Now Use Military Notes and Reserve Bank Notes; Minister Tajiri Delivers a Speech

According to the Allied Press, since the comprehensive exchange of new and old currencies in June last year, the circulation scope of the Central Reserve Bank notes has been expanding and has already had the character of a unified currency. The Japanese side has previously provided active cooperation to the Central Reserve Bank note work, and it is now learned that this decision will further promote the circulation scope of the Central Reserve Bank notes and formulate various specific measures. It is hoped that all parties will fully cooperate in order to implement the original intention. The Japanese Minister to Shanghai, Tajiri, recently delivered the following speech on this matter:

The Japanese Side Has Always Cooperated

Since the comprehensive exchange of Central Reserve Bank notes in Central China in June last year, its circulation scope has been gradually expanding at a steady pace. The old currency has been completely excluded. The Japanese side has always cooperated with this Central Reserve Bank note work, adhering to the ratio of 100 military notes to 18 Central Reserve Bank notes, striving to integrate the military note economy and the Central Reserve Bank note economy, and promoting the expansion of the circulation scope of the Central Reserve Bank notes. In the future, the ratio of 18 dan will still be maintained. Regarding this point, as previously stated by the Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs, regarding the work of expanding the circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes, as a result of discussions among the relevant authorities on the Japanese side, it has been decided to continue unabated. The following are the measures:

Four Measures Decided

(1) Prices in the Hongkou District were originally military note prices, but now they will be priced in both military notes and reserve notes. If it is difficult, then the prices will be set in reserve notes. (2) Salaries in government offices and major commercial firms will be paid approximately half in reserve notes. Object fees and income will also use reserve notes as much as possible. (3) Room rates for hotels and apartments, restaurants, and cinemas will also be priced in both military notes and reserve notes. If it is difficult to set such a price list, then a price list for reserve notes only will be set. (4) The income of the Civil Regiment Tax, the income and expenditure of the Japan Club, and other public facilities will all implement the calculation methods of both military notes and reserve notes in order to expand the use of military notes and reserve notes.

### Social Welfare Bureau Established Next Month

After the Shanghai Social Movement Council was ordered to reorganize into the "Shanghai Special City Social Welfare Bureau," the candidate for the director of the bureau has been decided, and the chairman of the Social Movement Council, Xi Mingqi, will continue to serve. The bureau is scheduled to be officially established on March 1. Director Sun will also retire.

### The Police Authorities of Both Concessions Act to Prevent the Activities of Receiving Stolen Goods, Separately Sending Letters to the Municipal Police Bureau Ordering Secondhand Shops to Check Identification When Buying and Selling Goods.

The letters concerned the secondhand shops and pawnshops within their jurisdictions, requiring them to carefully examine the identification of individuals when receiving pawned or sold goods, in order to facilitate thorough investigations. It is understood that after receiving the letters, the Municipal Police Bureau and other agencies have already instructed their respective branches to immediately order all secondhand shops (including secondhand stalls) to comply. It is also reported that pawnshops are managed by the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, and the police bureau will work with the Social Affairs Bureau to enforce the pawnshop regulations.

### Brief Commentary: The Credit of the Central Reserve Bank Notes is Further Consolidated
Yesterday, Minister Tajiri delivered a speech to the Japanese residents in Central China, expressing his hope for unanimous cooperation in promoting the unification of the circulation of Japanese military scrip and Central Reserve Bank notes at a ratio of 18 yuan per 100 yuan, and further defining the scope of use as: (1) prices set by Japanese businesses in Hongkou, (2) salaries of employees of Japanese government offices and commercial firms, (3) charges for lodging and entertainment venues, and (4) revenues and expenditures of Japanese public utilities, all of which should be priced equally in Central Reserve Bank notes and military scrip, and if there are difficulties, only Central Reserve Bank notes should be used for pricing. This will further expand the scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes in the future, and further consolidate the credit of the currency value.

Since the National Government's entry into the war, Sino-Japanese cooperation has progressed further, especially in the economic sphere, where cooperation is strongest. During the 81st session of the Japanese Diet, various ministers made significant contributions to Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, and the policies of Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry to support the circulation and expansion of Central Reserve Bank notes are particularly noteworthy. This speech by Minister Tajiri further concretely demonstrates Japan's sincerity in assisting the stabilization of the value of Central Reserve Bank notes.

Central Reserve Bank notes are currently the only currency in circulation in China. Japan, in its position as a friendly nation, has repeatedly expressed its respect and cooperation. Our people should further safeguard and trust them, in order to achieve the stability of the currency value. However, there are still some individuals who harbor misconceptions and are competing to purchase goods, believing that holding currency will lead to devaluation losses. As a result, the more they compete to purchase goods, the more scarce the goods become. Under the circumstances of supply and demand imbalance, prices rise and the currency value falls. This kind of mutual cause and effect is not a devaluation of the currency system itself, but a man-made evil consequence. In the end, those with misconceptions will also suffer from the pain of rising prices. Therefore, we must take safeguarding the value of the national currency as a prerequisite, not be concerned with petty selfish interests, and lead to fluctuations in the entire social economy.

Secondly, since the scope of circulation of Central Reserve Bank notes will be wider in the future, the need will inevitably increase, and the issuance should be extra cautious. Objectively, it must reach a point where the people trust it.

### The Quantity and Price of Household Sugar are Still Under Consideration, Distribution Must Await Total Statistics, the Cooperative is Also Considering a Slight Price Increase
The distribution of sugar to households in this city will soon be implemented in districts starting next month. As for the quantity issue, there is a rumor that each sugar coupon can purchase half a catty, but according to the person in charge of the Sugar Merchants Cooperative, this has not yet been determined and is still being calculated and distributed. Regarding the sugar price issue, the various rationed sugars currently sold on the market are priced at 4.3 yuan per catty, but due to cost issues, the cooperative plans to slightly increase the price. A cost price list has already been drafted and submitted to the governing authorities for review. It is understood that the authorities must carefully review the price increase, so it is still under consideration.

### The Ruling Department and Various Associations Strengthen Internal Organizational Structures, the Authorities Dispatch Undercover Agents to Thoroughly Investigate Shop Prices, and Many Shops Exceeding Prices are Shut Down
To date, nearly 300 trade associations in this city have been formally established. To assist the authorities in unified management and to seek reasonable allocation of various materials, they are actively seeking to strengthen their internal organizations. At the same time, they are also convening general meetings to reorganize affairs and draft articles of association, as well as formulating trade regulations for the industry to ensure compliance.

### Key Points of Trade Regulations for Various Associations
Although the various trade associations have separately drafted trade regulations, the key points are: (1) The trade price is freely set by this association. The price list is submitted to the主管官署 governing authorities for approval, and then notified to all traders for compliance. When there is an increase or decrease in raw material costs, the price should also be changed according to the above procedures. (2) Traders buying and selling goods, regardless of期現 forward or spot goods, the price is settled according to the market, and no increase or decrease is allowed without authorization. (3) Traders who do not operate in accordance with the regulations will be investigated and verified, and the association will send the penalty measures to the主管機關 governing authorities for adjudication. (4) Traders should comply with the industrial and commercial registration rules of this city and directly register with the Social Affairs Bureau.

### All Shops Must Join Associations
The Public Concession 工部局 Municipal Council's Association Section, in order to unify management and facilitate the allocation of materials, has ordered all industry associations that companies and firms operating any commodity must complete the membership procedures with their respective associations from today without any excuse. Once membership is completed, the association will create a list and submit it for reference. Those who refuse to comply will be subject to legal sanctions. All industry associations have now separately notified traders to register for association membership and solicit new members. Those who hesitate will be regarded as voluntarily giving up their rights.

### Expansion of the Ruling Department's Scope
The 工部局 Municipal Council has greatly expanded the organization of the Goods Control Department. In previous years, it was managed by the 总办处 General Affairs Office. However, due to the expanding scope of work, the council decided to divide it into an independent department, with a staff of nearly 600 people. The department's responsibilities include handling the procurement and distribution of bulk grain, as well as controlling its movement and price. Another part is to control the selling price of daily necessities and supervise shops to comply with the price limit rules. At present, the selling price of department stores in various industries must be reviewed by the Control Department for its cost and set a price limit to maintain people's livelihood. In the council's budget for this year, the total expenditure of the Control Department is estimated to be 4,258,670 yuan.

### Shops Exceeding Prices are Shut Down
The French Concession police authorities, in order to thoroughly crack down on illegal traders and black market transactions within the concession and coordinate to suppress prices, have dispatched a large number of undercover agents to various districts to strictly inspect illegal shops that exceed the price limit and impose severe penalties. Since the day before yesterday, several shops, including Tongchangxiang Gauze Shop, have been investigated and penalized for committing the above-mentioned situation. In addition, some disguised silver shops that raised black market prices and rashly bought gold jewelry were also discovered by undercover agents and investigated and penalized. In addition, the photography industry and others have been found to have illegally raised prices. The Goods Evaluation Committee has ordered them to restore the original prices to comply with the law. If they fail to do so, they will be subject to the same closure penalty. The French Concession authorities have adopted these severe measures in order to effectively suppress the rising prices.

### Zhu Jing'an's Estate Dispute, Eight People Arrested by the Police and Awaiting Legal Resolution

The two lawyers, together with the French Concession police, rescued her from danger. It is heard that the inside story of this case is due to the estate issue, and the son abused his direct relatives, a family dispute. A total of eight people were arrested by the police and are awaiting legal resolution.

### Qingjian's Discussion on Reforming the Firefighting Undertaking in This Port
Firefighters will be retrained to improve the efficiency and standard of fire administration. Firefighting organizations recruit six firefighters to Shanghai. According to his statement, he has recruited six staff members from the Tokyo Urban Firefighting Association and sent them to serve as chiefs of the fire stations in the six districts of the Shanghai Public Concession to replace the British personnel who have retired. It is said that these new personnel have all received good training and have special firefighting skills.

### Retraining of Firefighters
The firefighters of the Shanghai Firefighting Association will be retrained. All useful firefighting methods will be taught, and old firefighting methods will still be practiced when deemed necessary. Qingjian said that he will select the advantages of the Tokyo and Shanghai firefighting associations and apply them to the firefighting association in this port to achieve perfection. As for the equipment or utensils of the firefighting association, he will also improve them in order to facilitate firefighting as a principle.

### Continue to Practice Fire Extinguishing Methods
The fire-fighting equipment in the Old Town, New Town, and Central districts will be properly improved, and the old and outdated items will be discarded. According to his report, the fire-fighting association investigators are now cooperating with the police department to investigate and prohibit various actions that are prone to fire. At the same time, he also advised residents to be careful in storing dangerous goods to prevent fire and protect the lives and property of residents. Regarding air defense and fire extinguishing, he said that the fire-fighting association will continue to lead residents to practice methods to prevent combustion and toxic gases.

### Special Compilation of Various Places in Southeast Asia, Four Malaya Vertical and Horizontal Talk (3) Voters
The British operation of Malaya initially aimed to make Malaya a distribution center for plundering products from the Orient, so they first established the port city of Malacca, which was important for transportation. Later, they extended their plundering hand from Malacca to China, Japan, and the islands of Southeast Asia, and finally discovered that Singapore had greater value and opened it as a port city. Stamford Raffles noticed Singapore's excellent geographical conditions when he was a young official in the East India Company. In 1819, he signed a treaty with the King of Singapore and obtained the right to set up a trading port. In 1827, he abolished tariffs to facilitate the import and export of British goods and strengthen British control. In 1836, the government was moved from Malacca to Singapore, making it the capital of Malaya. At that time, Stamford Raffles, an official in the East India Company, predicted that Singapore "has a value greater than the entire mainland from the perspective of British naval and commercial policies." In an era when the situation in the Orient was still very chaotic, he was able to predict the future value of Singapore with his keen eye. Later, Britain indeed used Singapore as an advance base for squeezing various countries in the Orient, and consolidated the foundation of the British Empire's prosperity in Southeast Asia.

In order to cultivate the economic strength of Singapore as a commercial port, Britain also promoted development work on the opposite Malay Peninsula. However, the experienced British did not adopt the blatant national centrism of France in Vietnam and the Netherlands in the East Indies, did not greed for temporary benefits, but focused on the long-term future and engaged in development work. They made special efforts in the construction of transportation networks, the absorption of foreign capital, and the import of labor. For a time, Malaya became a "free paradise." Regarding the construction of transportation networks, according to Andreus計兵, every mile of railway served 3,977 people; every mile of railway covered an area of 5 square miles; surpassing Japan and ranking first among the countries of the Orient. However, the British authorities may not have fully realized that such superior transportation, after more than 100 years of hard work, would become a successful path for the Japanese army in 1941-42 to quickly dispatch and concentrate its resources and occupy Malaya!

Regarding investment in Malaya, British surveys showed that the main investments were 108 million pounds from the United Kingdom, 19.27 million US dollars from the United States, and 41.2 million Japanese yen from Japan. The United Kingdom accounted for the vast majority, but because it has never rejected the inflow of foreign capital, investments from the United States and Japan also reached considerable figures for a time. In fact, this is precisely a manifestation of Britain's experienced policy of not being stingy with small things and focusing on big things, because on the one hand, profits are shared with foreign countries, but on the other hand, foreign capital is used to more effectively develop Malayan industries and create Malayan prosperity. Hasn't Britain received even greater benefits invisibly? And what should not be ignored here is that the investment of overseas Chinese also accounts for a considerable share. Therefore, the total amount of foreign capital input in Malaya is over 995 million yuan, deeply integrated into various economic sectors of Malaya.

Regarding labor, like capital, due to the small population of the Malayan indigenous people and the low labor rate, the labor necessary for industrial development had to rely on immigrants from China and India. According to a survey at the end of 1939, the population ratio in Malaya was: Chinese 2.3 million, accounting for 42.6% of the total population; Malays 2.25 million, accounting for 41.6%; Indians 740,000, accounting for 13.8%. Compared with the beginning of the 20th century, that is, about 40 years ago, it has increased by two times. At the same time, considering the characteristic that the mortality rate exceeds the birth rate, it can be seen that the rapid accumulation of the Malayan population is due to immigration from abroad. The most important immigrants are laborers in rubber plantations and mines. Indians are mostly employed in rubber plantations, while overseas Chinese are mostly engaged in mines and factories.

Therefore, the British management policy of Malaya is ostensibly open, and the residents are also allowed to share the benefits of transportation development and industrial development. However, this is just like the method of a large fishing net, temporarily making the fish feel active and free, but in the end, aren't they still someone else's food? Among them, labor immigration is a typical means of exploitation. When industries are prosperous and labor is urgently needed, they strongly welcome laborers to immigrate to Malaya, but in times of recession, they abandon them like worn shoes and no longer care about the life and death of the laborers. For example, in 1939, out of 55 mining machines in mines, 60 were shut down, and out of 100,000 Chinese coolies, 40,000 became unemployed, resulting in disturbances that were temporarily quelled under military and police suppression. Another example is the reduction of Indian immigrants. The Governor of Malaya once asked India to implement compulsory immigration, but the Indian National Congress Party refused because the Malayan authorities did not provide practical guarantees for improving labor conditions and unemployment relief. In the past, there was a contract immigration system for Chinese laborers, which was also a kind of so-called "piglet" system, a forced sale system. Therefore, the fact that the mortality rate of the Malayan population exceeds the birth rate can also be said to be the result of the British authorities' harsh and inhumane exploitation of a large number of laborers. Moreover, in order to recover the wages taken away by a large number of laborers, the British shamelessly implemented an opium monopoly system to poison all laborers and indigenous people, so opium revenue reached 40% of the total tax revenue annually!

In this way, Britain carried out clever and malicious exploitation behind a gentleman's mask to develop world-class industries such as rubber and tin in Malaya.

### (6) Rubber and Tin
It hasn't been long since rubber was transplanted to Malaya. Only at the end of the 19th century, 22 rubber seedlings were transplanted from the Royal Botanic Gardens in London to the Singapore Botanic Gardens. Since then, Malaya has had rubber trees, which is less than 50 years. However, now rubber plantations account for 60% of Malaya's agricultural area, reaching 3.28 million acres, and 85% of the 108 million pounds invested by Britain, or 92 million pounds, is invested in rubber plantations. And 7()% of the 19 million yuan invested by the United States, and 65% of the 41.2 million yuan invested by Japan, are invested in rubber cultivation. As a result, rubber production, although under restrictions, still reaches 370,000 metric tons per year, accounting for 35% of the world's total production of 1.1 million metric tons. In terms of exports, including the quantity concentrated in Singapore from the Dutch East Indies and Thailand and then re-exported, it is estimated to be about 480,000 metric tons, accounting for 4()% of the world's rubber exports. As for production methods, there are two types: group production in the form of large-scale capitalist agricultural management, and small-scale production by indigenous residents. Almost all of the large farm owners are British, accounting for two-thirds of the cultivated area, but the rubber plantation area that has stopped producing rubber during the implementation of production restrictions, large farms account for 21% of the total, while small farms account for 28%. This differential treatment fully expresses the preferential treatment for British rubber planters. In fact, the so-called production restriction is also a selfish method of Britain, that is, in the era of economic panic in 1930, rubber prices fell. In order to prevent indiscriminate selling, an international production restriction agreement was established between rubber producing countries. Since it was implemented in June 1934, the agreement stipulates the allocation of export quotas for various countries and prohibits new planting. On the surface, it seems to be a method to prevent the decline of rubber cultivation, but in reality, it is to prevent the free development of emerging rubber producing countries, and for the British to permanently maintain their hegemony in Malaya's rubber industry.

The situation of tin is also the same. The history of tin production in Malaya is very long, but it was only in the 20th century that it was systematically mined as an object of modern industry, especially the development after the First European War, which is most noteworthy. Consistent with the world's phenomena, the world production before the First World War was only 13,000 tons, but it jumped to 139,000 tons, ten times as much, by 1935. Among them, Malaya's production was 49,900 tons, accounting for about 35.5% of the world's production. In terms of investment, according to a survey in 1937, indigenous capital (mostly overseas Chinese capital) accounted for 50.8%, British capital accounted for 44.2%, and foreign capital (French, American) accounted for 5%.

Tin, like rubber, is mainly produced in neighboring Southeast Asian countries and various parts of Southwest China. All of these tin products are concentrated in Singapore. And the two major refining factories in Singapore, the "Straits Trading Company" (founded in 1890, with an annual production capacity of 60,000 tons) and the "Eastern Smelting Company" in Penang (production capacity of 30,000 tons), monopolized the world's tin ore refining industry. Although the United States once attempted to control the world's tin smelting industry, the then Governor of Malaya, Swettenham, advocated levying an export tax on tin ore, so that the United States could not obtain cheap raw materials, and the attempt failed. Britain maintained its world throne in tin. Therefore, not only tin ore from Yunnan, Thailand, the Dutch East Indies, and Vietnam, but also from Japan and as far as the South African Union, is concentrated in Singapore, refined, and then exported to obtain huge profits. Therefore, for example, in 1935, Malaya produced 49,000 tons of tin ore, while in the same year, the export of refined tin reached 62,200 tons.

### No Alcohol Allowed at War Commemoration Day Banquet, Ceremony Held on the Ninth of Every Month

### Shanghai Electric Power Company Unifies City-Wide Electricity Supply, Both Zhabei and Nanshi Power Plants Have Been Shut Down, Shanghai Gas Company Adds Pipeline to Jiangwan
The electric power plants in this port originally included four plants: the French Commercial Nanshi Plant, Zhabei Plant, and the Public Concession Electric Power Company, which supplied electricity to different areas. Recently, in order to save coal, the municipal authorities have shut down the Nanshi and Zhabei plants. The electricity in the two areas is now supplied by the Public Concession Electric Power Company, and the connection is currently underway. As for the French Commercial Electric Power Plant in the French Concession, since the French Concession will soon be returned to our country, methods will also be discussed to have the Public Concession Electric Power Company generate electricity uniformly. As for gas, since the restriction of users, it has been quite economical. The Japanese are currently laying a pipeline in the Joffre Road area so that factories in Jiangwan can use gas.

### The Insurance Supervisory Bureau of the Ministry of Industry Publishes Insurance Stamp Regulations, the Amount to be Affixed is One Percent of the Insurance Premium, Those Who Counterfeit Will be Dealt with as Counterfeit Currency

### Economic Circle: Economic Commentary on Having Materials but Not Manufacturing, Having Goods but Not Selling
The other day, I read Mr. Ling Tian's "Hidden Worries of the Textile Industry" in the "Economic Rambling Notes" column of the Xin Shen Bao, and one passage in it really resonated with me. The passage said: "However, judging from the current development situation, the general situation is still not optimistic. Although most textile factories have access to raw materials, they are still unwilling to start work or are not actively promoting their products. In other words, they do not hope for the progress of their own business, because based on the continuous rise in various prices, they believe that consuming one share of raw materials is losing one share, and selling the products is reducing their profits. This mentality contains a very strong speculative heart, and after the prevailing atmosphere, it will inevitably cause the entire textile industry to fall into stagnation again, so the hidden worries about its future cannot be ignored."

This kind of abnormal speculative mentality of "having raw materials but preferring to hoard them without manufacturing, having products but preferring to hoard them without selling" can currently be said to have penetrated the hearts of various merchants in Shanghai, and it is by no means unique to the textile industry. However, the widespread existence of this mentality is the biggest obstacle to the implementation of the government's wartime economic policies. The conflict between personal and public interests can be said to have been fully exposed and is approaching the boiling point. If merchants do not know how to automatically and quickly change this abnormal speculative mentality, causing prices to rise sharply, the people's livelihood to deteriorate, social order to be disrupted, and mass riots to be feared, then the local governments responsible for public security will only have to exercise police power and "do it once and for all" to conduct comprehensive rationing, limit prices to purchase domestic goods, and force factories to start work, in order to achieve comprehensive control over the wartime economy and stabilize the wartime life of the people in the rear.

### The Current Economic Market in Shanghai is Distorted
It is undeniable that Shanghai's economy has always been in a state of abnormal development. The soaring prices in the market in recent years are the best illustration of this, and the phenomenon of prosperity in Shanghai's commerce during this period is not a normal development of Shanghai's economy. As for the basis for stirring up trouble, everyone knows that it is due to the abundance of floating capital.

The wind of hoarding and manipulation by shops has created countless newly rich people in recent years; but on the other hand, it has increased the cost of living in Shanghai by 100 times or even 200 times, pushing the lives of the common people to the brink of starvation,

### Oil and Grain Coupons Reissued Together - Taxpayers Who Have Received Rice and Sugar Coupons - Go to Reclaim on the Specified Date

After the implementation of the planned distribution of edible oil and sugar, the Shanghai Municipal Council in the Public Concession first issued sugar coupons through the Rice Coupon Issuing Office. Currently, they are still being issued sequentially according to the dates listed on the property tax bills. Oil and grain coupons can be issued together from the 26th. Those who have already received rice and sugar coupons before the 26th are scheduled to reclaim the oil and grain coupons that have not yet been issued on the 27th of this month, March 6th, March 10th, and March 11th. The quantities and purchase dates will be announced separately by the Shanghai Municipal Council. It is expected that purchases can begin around mid-March. In addition, the distribution of the 28th term of household rice, has been completed by all rice shops for rice and flour, and will be sold from March 1st. The validity date of the 27th term of rice coupons is until the 27th.

### Household Rice This Term - Both Brown and White Rice Are Used - Hope Citizens Will Not Misunderstand

The quantity of household rice rationed per capita in the two concessions this term (27th term) is white rice (or brown rice) one and a half *sheng*, and broken rice one *sheng*. Because most residents prefer to eat white rice, some have requested white rice from rice shops during this term and refused to accept brown rice. According to a reporter from Datong News Agency who inquired at the Rice and Grain Office, most of the retail household rice received by retail rice shops this term (from the 19th to the 27th of this month) is broken rice and brown rice. Although some have received white rice instead of brown rice, the number is small. Therefore, if residents insist on purchasing white rice, it often causes difficulties for rice shops. It is heard that the authorities, in addition to hoping that residents will understand, are also trying to avoid this kind of disparity in the future.

### Postal Remittances to Tunxi and Three Other Places in Anhui Province Restored - Each Can Remit and Deposit 50 Yuan

### Rice Merchants Applying for Registration - Should Comply with Regulations and Pay Fees

The Municipal Grain Administration has been ordered to handle the registration of rice merchants, and the deadline has been extended for 20 days. However, all rice merchants should comply with the regulations and pay the fees for applying for registration. They must not deliberately violate them, lest they fall into the net of the law. The bureau yesterday specifically notified the district offices of each district and the joint public rice offices to instruct grain merchants to strictly abide by them.

### Warmer Weather - Fewer Corpses Exposed - Relief by Charitable Organizations Effective

Since the beginning of spring, the weather in this port has gradually become warmer. According to a reporter who inquired at Pushan Villa, the number of corpses exposed on the roads in the concession has decreased significantly in the past week. The main reason for this is that the authorities and various charitable organizations have handled the relocation and relief of general beggars. However, the warming weather has also contributed to this.

### Municipal Social Affairs Bureau Group Wedding - Scheduled - Interested Parties with Objections - Deadline for Evidence and Declaration

The date for the first group wedding this year has been set for 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Mayor Chen and Director Ling will personally attend and preside over the event. Since the date of the ceremony is approaching, the bureau specifically announced the names, ages, and native places of the sixteen couples participating in this wedding yesterday, and stated that if interested parties have any objections to the marriage of the wedding participants, they must go to the bureau with evidence to declare their objections before the 26th of this month. Otherwise, they will be allowed to participate in the wedding.

### Purchasing Light Bulbs Requires Exchange of Old for New - Simultaneously Implemented in China and Japan from March 1

### Shanghai Suburbs Delineated - Cigarette Rationing Area - More Than 5,000 Companies of All Sizes - Rationing to Be Implemented Citywide Starting Next Month

The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Cooperative, in order to unify the rationing of cigarettes, has completed the examination of registered tobacco shops after the registration deadline. The qualified shops include more than 290 large shops and more than 5,000 small shops. It is stipulated that all large shops willing to sell rationed cigarettes in accordance with all the regulations of the cooperative must, from March 2 to 5, have the person in charge of each shop fill out a statement of oath. After being verified by the authorities, a designation certificate will be issued for business operations. The distribution of goods to small shops is entrusted to large shops, and the small shops are divided into ABCD grades for management and rationing. Rationing will be implemented starting in March.

Shanghai Suburbs Delineated Area

Regarding the rationing area of the suburbs of Shanghai, the cooperative has determined it. The following is a record from a Shanghai News reporter: (1) West Shanghai (Caojiadu, Hongqiao, Longhua, Zhenru), (2) North Shanghai (Pengpu, Yangjiaqiao), (3) Jiading (Jiading, Nanxiang, Huangdu, Anting), (4) City Center (Hongzhen, Jiangwan, Miaohang), (5) Baoshan (Baoshan, Wusong), (6) Pudong (Gaoqiao, Luxing, Qingningsi, South of Dongchang Road, Yangzi Town), (7) Chuansha and Chongming eight districts. All wholesale shops in these areas that engage in the sales of cigarettes must register with the cooperative in writing from now on and submit them to the cooperative within the time limit, so as to concentrate on examination.

Registration of Shops Limited to Wholesale

Those who register with the cooperative shall fill in (1) name of each shop, (2) address, (3) name of person in charge, (4) date of establishment, (5) capital amount, (6) business status (average number and amount of cigarettes sold each month recently). Only those who apply for registration as cigarette wholesalers are allowed. If there is any fraudulent situation, the cooperative will permanently stop the distribution of cigarettes. Those who falsely set up names will be punished by other means. As for the date of implementation of rationing, it will be submitted to the board of directors for approval after the registration and examination are completed, and the authorities will approve it, and the names of the qualified distributors will be announced for implementation.

### Manufacturers Submit Price List - Extended for Another Half Month

Over a hundred members of the association from Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles attended. During the tea party, Wen Lanting, Chairman of the association, presided and invited Lin Kanghou to deliver the opening speech on behalf of the chairman. After Deputy Chairman Takeo Komuro delivered the welcoming speech, Minister Tajiri was invited to deliver a speech. The gathering ended with pleasure and a group photo at around 6:00 PM. The details are recorded below:

Chinese and Japanese Industrial and Commercial Figures Eagerly Attend

At 4:00 PM yesterday, members of the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association attended. The Chinese members included Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Xu Guanqun, Dong Daoning, Li Quanshi, Ye Fuxiao, Chen Shaozhen, Shao Shuhua, Huang Jiangquan, Pan Yangyao, Tang Xinghai, Pei Yunqing, Xu Yongzuo, Wang Boyuan, Xu Jingfu, Yao Junzhi, Yu Zhaoxing, Bao Guochang, Xu Xiaochu, Shi Huikang, Zheng Hongyan, Zhao Jinqing, etc. The friendly members included special guest Minister Tajiri, a research officer from the headquarters, the head of the information department, Hirota, Section Chief Kane, Consul Iwai, Consul Nakata, Mr. Yoshida, and the association's Deputy Chairman Takeo Komuro, Directors Takagaki Katsujiro, Tatsuiro Funatsu, Kenichi Kawaguchi, Toraji Kurimoto, Kanroku Yamada, and Kiichi Yamanaka, totaling over a hundred people from both China and Japan.

Chairman's Representative Delivers Opening Speech

First, Lin Kanghou, representing Chairman Wen Lanting, delivered the opening speech, briefly stating that it was a great honor to have Minister Tajiri and Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial guests present at today's welcome tea party. The significance of the welcome party was (1) to welcome Minister Tajiri and Consul General Yano and express admiration, (2) to welcome the more than 40 new Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial members who have joined the association besides the founders, (3) to represent all new and old members in celebrating Chairman Wen's recovery and good health, (4) to congratulate Mr. Chen Binhe on taking office as the president of Shenbao, (5) and to hold a New Year's group greeting for Chinese and Japanese members at the same time to express mutual friendship. Next, Deputy Chairman Takeo Komuro explained the organizational significance of the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and the central points that distinguished it from other general friendship associations, hoping that Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial members would work together in industrial and commercial matters.

Minister Tajiri's Speech

Then, Minister Tajiri was invited to deliver a speech, briefly stating, "I am very honored to participate in today's grand gathering. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles in Shanghai have been able to unite and cooperate automatically, which is a good phenomenon. Especially after the Chinese government declared war on Britain and the United States, the Chinese and Japanese economic circles are working hard under the same goal. At the same time, Japan deeply feels that the Chinese side has changed its psychology towards Britain and the United States. Cooperation should be the premise between Chinese and Japanese industries and businesses, recognizing responsibilities, working together sincerely. I feel that (1) Japan immediately announced the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China, the return of concessions, and the factories under trusteeship after China's participation in the war, which is enough to prove that Japan's new policy towards China focuses on practice and is gradually being implemented to help China become an independent and strong country. Because only with two independent and strong countries can there be thorough cooperation. The Chinese people should have a deep understanding of all these facts. (2) Although the scope of economic activities between Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles will expand in the future, they should focus on the big picture and long-term goals, such as improving the exchange of materials, etc., and engage in promoting wartime economic policies as the center. The Japanese authorities will also fully assist and jointly strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War. (3) Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles should be treated equally and will never give certain people certain privileges. I especially hope that Chinese and Japanese industrial and commercial circles will cooperate closely," etc.

Mr. Chen Binhe's Speech

Next, Chen Binhe, a member designated by the chairman, delivered a speech, saying, "I am very touched and grateful for Minister Tajiri's great remarks just now. The minister said that the Japanese government's new policy towards China in the future focuses on practice, and we know that the minister is the one who works hardest to practice the new policy. We also know that the minister is not only working hard to practice the new policy towards China, but also cares deeply about various current issues in Shanghai and is determined to seek reasonable solutions. For example, since the minister took office last winter, he has worked with various Japanese authorities to gradually increase the amount of household rice rationed. Recently, the traffic problem at the North Station has also been improved. However, there are still many problems in Shanghai that need to be solved urgently. As the minister has pointed out, such as economic problems, such as the exchange of materials between Shanghai and the mainland, the industrial and commercial circles, of course, hope for a speedy and reasonable solution. At the same time, the Chinese industrial and commercial circles and the people must mutually encourage each other to work hard to abide by wartime laws and regulations and not act selfishly." Finally, he briefly reported on the improvement of the newspaper after its resumption. At the end, Chairman Wen delivered a speech of thanks, and then a group photo was taken and the meeting adjourned.
