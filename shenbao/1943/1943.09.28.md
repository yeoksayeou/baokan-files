### Trends of the Chongqing Regime (Part 1) – A Dialogue Between Person A and Person B

A: Have you read the "On Overall Peace" commentary in the *Shen Bao* Weekly Review from September 26th?

B: Yes, I have. I strongly agree with the point that the key to the success or failure of overall peace today lies with Chongqing. However, I am too unfamiliar with the recent situation in Chongqing, and I would like to ask for your insights…

A: Not long ago, Chongqing held the "11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang," followed by the "Second Session of the Third National Political Council," where I heard they discussed many so-called "major events." Please present your questions, and I will answer them with what I know, how does that sound?

B: First, I would like to ask, the main obstacle to overall peace today is naturally Chongqing's dragging on the war. What is the strength of Chongqing's war effort?

A: To get a more accurate answer, this needs to be observed in conjunction with international relations, internal economy, and public sentiment.

B: How about starting with the military aspect?

A: As it stands, Chongqing's military strength has clearly been greatly weakened, and it also contains many crises. Not long ago, Rogov, the head of the Soviet TASS Chongqing branch, published an essay criticizing the Chongqing regime, in which he said regarding the Chongqing army: "…The reorganization of the Chongqing army has begun to encounter resistance in secret… The military reforms aimed at training new cadres and strengthening discipline have not been completed. As a result, the combat effectiveness of the army has been weakened, and it is even more dependent on the supply of British and American arms…" He also said: "Chongqing does not lack manpower, but the army does not have regular replenishment, no sufficient trained reserves, and not even organized civilian conscription. Even to this day, the ordinary conscription laws have not been fully implemented, and the personnel replenishment obtained by the army is mostly unsuitable for military service…"

B: But wasn't Chongqing long proclaiming the "new soldier training" under Hu Zongnan's training, preparing for a general counteroffensive?

A: True, we have heard of that too. However, Rogov also criticized Chongqing's new soldier training, saying: "Foreign military observers who have visited the Chongqing army all agree that the soldiers are very tenacious and hard-working on the battlefield, and do not pay attention to food and clothing, but the commanding officers are extremely backward in military and technical training, the equipment of the army is also very low, and the organization and management of the army is extremely imperfect." He also specifically pointed out: "One of the shortcomings of the Chongqing army is the lack of effective unified leadership and coordinated operations on various battlefields: internal friction and suspicion between generals cannot but reduce the combat effectiveness and discipline of the army."

B: Even criticism from those sympathetic to Chongqing is not overly severe, which shows that Chongqing's ability to drag on the war has reached the "end of its rope." So, what is the truth?

A: To observe the current Chongqing politics, it is important to grasp three major centers: first, international relations, second, the Chongqing-Communist relationship, and third, the trend of public opinion. Integrating these aspects for research will make it easy to infer the direction of Chongqing. However, when we observe the trends of the Chongqing regime and estimate its strength, of course we must not underestimate it, but we should not overestimate it either.

Starting with international relations, Chongqing has recently been boasting about being one of the "United Nations Four Powers," on par with Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. However, in reality, Chongqing exists in the contradiction of the opposition between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and its situation is quite difficult. The text of the head of the Soviet TASS branch criticizing Chongqing already shows what the Soviet Union thinks of Chongqing. On the contrary, it can also be seen that the Chongqing regime is tending towards a path of complete dependence on the United States and Britain. In addition, the dictatorial nature of the Anglo-American faction in the essence of the Chongqing regime is even more obvious! This point cannot be ignored under any circumstances. The regime that actually becomes an Anglo-American faction represents the interests of Anglo-American imperialism and a few who depend on Britain and the United States, and of course all policies will follow the lead of Britain and the United States.

B: To what extent has the Chongqing-Communist friction issue reached recently?

A: According to the main points of the "11th Plenary Session of the Kuomintang" in Chongqing's resolution on the Communist Party issue, following Chiang's instructions, the Communist Party should repent and earnestly fulfill the four promises, namely, to strive to realize the Three Principles of the People; to abolish the policy of riots and the Redization movement; to abolish the Soviet government and unify the regime; to abolish the Red Army and reorganize it into the "National Revolutionary Army" under the control of the "Military Commission," etc. This measure is entirely aimed at launching a political offensive to make up for the poverty of military preparations, and to buy time for a large-scale campaign to suppress the Communists. The Communist Party, on the other hand, is not showing weakness either, and is preparing to fight back, tit-for-tat. For example, in August, there were armed clashes between the Chongqing and Communist sides in some places. Therefore, in the current stage of the Chongqing-Communist relationship, the longer the friction lasts, the deeper the degree of deterioration. If there were no constraints from the international environment, a large-scale civil war would have broken out long ago.

B: What is the trend of the people under Chongqing's rule being tired of war and alienated?

A: The trend of publications in various places under Chongqing's rule shows the people's situation with being tired of war and alienation. According to statistics from the first half of this year, compared with last year, soft literature has increased to 48%, politics has decreased to 9%, economics has decreased to 4%, history and geography have decreased to 3%, science has decreased to 3%, and those promoting the Three Principles of the People have decreased to 1%. This trend of publications really shows the seriousness of the problem. The higher the prices and the more difficult life is, the more popular soft literature becomes. Currently, among the 32 magazines in Kunming, there are as many as 16 drama publications, and among the 122 books that bookstores in Xi'an applied for review and sale in April of this year, new and old novels account for as many as 115. However, it is clearly insufficient to say that this "worrying" phenomenon is only due to "high prices and difficult life." It is more honest to say that it reflects the people's aversion to war and dissatisfaction with politics.

### Third Anniversary of the Alliance Treaty: Axis Powers Reaffirm Determination; Japan and Germany Recognize the New Fascist Government of Italy

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – On the third anniversary of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the Japanese government, simultaneously with its ally Germany, formally recognized the Italian Fascist Republic government headed by Mussolini. The Fascist Republic government was formed on the 23rd by Mussolini, who gathered comrades from across the country. Mussolini himself serves as Prime Minister and Foreign Minister, and on the 27th, he also assumed the chairmanship of the government. Now that the government has been recognized by Japan and Germany, the following facts have been established: The Italian Fascist Republic government is now the sole legitimate government of Italy, and therefore, the Japanese government's attitude towards the betrayal of the Badoglio regime is essentially one of denial. At the same time, the existence of the House of Savoy as the Italian royal family is also denied. In the future, Mussolini will be qualified to have the qualifications of head of state as the head of the government. In addition, the existing international treaties between Japan, Germany, and Italy do not need to go through other special procedures, but will be inherited and fulfilled by the government immediately. From now on, the relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has been established as more clear and solid than before.

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – On September 27, the third anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu hosted a luncheon at his residence at 12:30 p.m. to celebrate the occasion, inviting the German ambassador Speer and the ambassadors of other allied countries such as Romania and Hungary, and reaffirmed the determination to jointly carry out the war. Foreign Minister Shigemitsu also delivered a speech at the luncheon, outlining the Japanese government's countermeasures against the Mussolini government and forcefully stating its vow to work with its allies to defeat Britain and the United States.

Berlin, September 27 (Central News Agency) – After the Badoglio regime of Italy broke faith and withdrew from the Tripartite Pact, the anti-Axis side used this as an opportunity to sow discord among the three allied countries, launching a major propaganda campaign. German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop was scheduled to exchange statements with Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu via broadcast on the 27th, the third anniversary of the alliance treaty, to reaffirm the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. On the evening of the 26th, German Foreign Ministry officials declared in this regard: When the Badoglio regime of Italy betrayed the Tripartite Pact, the governments of Japan and Germany simultaneously issued statements declaring that the Tripartite Pact would continue to exist. Now that Chairman Mussolini has returned and organized a new government based on new laws, it is of course necessary to reaffirm the treaty and spirit of the Tripartite Pact. Furthermore, on the occasion of the third anniversary of the establishment of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the other allied countries will also confirm the existence of the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy and the alliance treaties signed between the countries, in order to shatter the false propaganda of the anti-Axis side. Therefore, to reaffirm the Tripartite Pact again to show the world, all the signatory countries must participate unanimously, without exception. It is feared that not only Japan and Germany, but all signatory countries will reiterate the content and purpose of the Tripartite Pact through appropriate institutions or foreign ministers.

The National Government Authorities Express Recognition

Nanjing, September 27 (Central News Agency) – The Italian Fascist Republic government has been formally established under the leadership of the Iron Fist Prime Minister Mussolini. He assumed the chairmanship of the new government in the capital Rome, and the Italian national system has therefore changed. The Axis countries of Japan and Germany have expressed formal recognition, which proves that the Axis powers of the three countries are still united and inseparable. The Japanese government's recognition on the anniversary of the Tripartite Pact is particularly significant. A spokesperson for our government also told Central News Agency reporters on the 28th that the government will formally recognize the legitimate government of the Italian Fascist Republic. Relations between China and Italy cannot change due to Badoglio's surrender. The solidarity of the Axis countries will become more solid, and they will jointly advance towards the path of overthrowing the United States and Britain and achieving communism. The statement of our government's spokesperson can be regarded as an expression of our government's recognition of the new Fascist Republic government.

Exchange of Congratulatory Telegrams between Japanese and German Foreign Ministers

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop exchanged congratulatory telegrams on September 27, the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. The original text of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's congratulatory telegram to the German Foreign Minister is as follows: "Today, I am delighted to celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. I extend my deepest congratulations to Your Excellency. Japan and Germany are currently engaged in a great war of self-defense, and are simultaneously engaged in building a just order in the Greater East Asia and European regions, respectively. I am extremely pleased to see this. The joint declaration previously issued by the governments of Japan and Germany is of great significance. I believe that Japan and Germany will cooperate closely and surely achieve final victory."

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop sent a telegram congratulating Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu. The telegram reads as follows: "Today, I am delighted to celebrate the third anniversary of the signing of the Tripartite Pact. I am deeply gratified to recall the armies of the allied countries jointly confronting the enemy and reaping honorable and great victories. Only such great victories can give the peoples of the allied countries an unwavering belief in the future and in their happiness and freedom."

### Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu Broadcasts to Germany, Moving Forward Hand in Hand to Transform the World

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu held a historic exchange broadcast with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop at the Tokyo Broadcasting Station at 7:30 p.m. today, revealing the firm determination of the Axis countries to complete the war. The main points of his speech are as follows: Although the United States and Britain have used all kinds of cunning tricks to seduce the Badoglio regime into betraying the Axis, the Axis alliance will never waver because of this. The alliance treaty shines as brightly as the sun and moon, illuminating the path of the Axis countries towards final victory. Fueled by ardent friendship, the success of Hitler's rescue of Mussolini to a safe area can be considered a miracle. On this anniversary of the alliance, Mussolini assumed the position of Chairman of the Italian Fascist Republic government. The Japanese government and the allied countries have quickly recognized this. Therefore, under the leadership of Chairman Mussolini, the new Italy will once again strive for a bright future, to wash away the humiliation and disgrace caused by the unconditional surrender forced by Britain and the United States. This is what we hope for.

We, as constituent members of the interwoven composition of nations, ethnicities, and the world, naturally enjoy the inherent right to coexist with other countries and flags. Because this inherent right to survive is already under threat, we have no choice but to take self-defense measures and possess the resolute determination to carry out the war and strive for victory. Over the past three years, the Axis powers have countered the enemy's counterattacks, crushing their forces everywhere in the East and West. Germany, in Europe, has established a great fortress of Europe with the allied countries, and has used a brave and decisive offensive spirit to reduce the enemy. Japan has also countered the enemy's resistance in various aspects of Greater East Asia, and is gradually destroying their war power. Therefore, the purpose of the alliance treaty is to realize justice in the world. We have already achieved glorious victories, and its success is beyond doubt. Japan has built a mutually cooperative, stable, and prosperous system in East Asia, which is in line with justice and the inevitable demands of the East Asian peoples. We are now fighting to the end to achieve this noble purpose. For many years, the countries of the United States and Britain have invaded Asia, viewing it as a colony or semi-colony to be exploited at will. Their usual policy is to divide and rule Asia. We who uphold the right to survive are seeking to liberate East Asia from the invasion of the United States and Britain, so we must first eliminate this invasive and exploitative force. The United States and Britain have not yet abandoned their ambitions, and are still trying to restore their old state of domination over Asia, and are continuing to challenge and counterattack Japan. However, the fierce fighting of the Japanese army and navy has completely shattered their ambitions. Liberating Asia and building a new world of coexistence and co-prosperity in East Asia is our common goal. The Republic of China has been liberated, and is already building and restoring China in East Asia. Thailand has developed into an autonomous and independent power. Burma has also completely declared independence. The Philippines will also be independent. India should also be liberated. In this way, the Asian peoples will all have their place. Therefore, this war is not only a war for world justice, but also a war for the revival of Asia. The Asian countries and nations must fight this war to the end with the European Axis powers in order to secure the threatened right to survive. Japan's spirit of courageous fighting in East Asia and the spirit of the courageous fighting of Germany and other European allied countries in Europe are the same in meaning. The aim of the Axis allies to build a world of justice in Eurasia will be achieved by the final victory of the Axis powers. This is already very clear.

### Minister Aoki's Address Celebrating Burmese Independence Fully Demonstrates the Japanese Spirit of Justice

Tokyo, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Various Japanese national movement organizations held a grand celebration of Burmese independence at the Greater East Asia Hall here at 1:00 p.m. on the 27th, with many representatives from various national movement organizations attending, creating a very enthusiastic atmosphere. Japanese Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia specially took time out of his busy schedule to attend and deliver a congratulatory speech. The main points of his speech are as follows: The declaration of independence by Burma denies British rule over East Asia and is a major advance in the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia. It marks a new era in world history. The Greater East Asia War has now entered the decisive stage from the war stage, and the enemy's counterattacks are becoming increasingly fierce. Burma's declaration of independence during the Great War fully demonstrates the Japanese spirit of justice, allowing all nations to have their place and all people to live in peace. It is also clear evidence of the Japanese government's commitment to its promises. Furthermore, the announcement yesterday of Japan's recognition of the incorporation of various states and provinces into Burmese territory is sufficient to prove Japan's attitude of righteousness and magnanimity. It is believed that the entire Burmese people will recognize this attitude of Japan, and that all the peoples of East Asia and the world will also express their approval of this just measure taken by Japan. However, all of us Greater East Asian peoples must remember that if the Greater East Asia War does not achieve victory, it will be difficult for the countries of Greater East Asia to achieve autonomy and independence, and it will also be difficult to build a Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the independence of Burma can only be fully and permanently guaranteed after the Greater East Asia War is completed. Japan will always support the independence of Burma and fully cooperate with its future development. It is firmly believed that the Burmese people will be able to carry out the spirit of the Japan-Burma alliance, strengthen their cooperation with Japan, and strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Meritte, Writes to Japanese Consul General Yano: Italian Overseas Chinese in Central China Support the Fascist Party

Shanghai, Central News Agency – Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Colonel Meritte, wrote to Japanese Consul General Yano on the 16th, expressing his denial of the Badoglio regime and his absolute support for the Fascist Party. He expressed his willingness to guide the new overseas Chinese in assisting the Axis countries to complete the war under the leadership of Commander Mussolini.

Furthermore, since former Italian Consul General in Shanghai, Colonel Meritte, took the lead in swearing allegiance to Mussolini and firmly supporting the Fascist Party, the situation of supporting the Fascist Party among the Italian overseas Chinese in Central China, centered on Shanghai, has suddenly increased. In general, Italian overseas Chinese have expressed their willingness to be loyal to Mussolini, but the authorities are closely watching their movements because the Italian overseas Chinese are a complex group.

Mr. Nierone and Foreign Minister Li had a cordial conversation for 40 minutes before he left.

The weather was good on that day, which was very conducive to air raids. The Chongqing side's ground fire was also quite fierce, but it failed to prevent the Japanese aircraft from bravely attacking. All the Japanese aircraft on all three fronts returned safely to their bases without any losses.

### Ministry of Justice Issues Order to Subordinates to Report Economic Criminals in Order to Curb Speculation and Hoarding

Nanjing, September 27 (Central News Agency) – In order to stabilize prices and secure people's livelihoods, the National Government has successively promulgated various laws and regulations to punish economic criminals, in order to combat speculation and hoarding. It is learned that, in order to urge its subordinates to earnestly implement these regulations, the Ministry of Judicial Administration has issued a special order to all courts and agencies that, in the future, prosecutors should inspect and seriously report on economic criminals at any time, and should not shift responsibility to administrative agencies and voluntarily abandon their duties. Trial judges should be especially careful and avoid giving cause for criticism. It is stipulated that, starting from October 10, 1943, those who violate the Provisional Regulations for Punishing the Crime of Hoarding Major Commodities, the Provisional Regulations for Buying Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth, the Provisional Regulations for Punishing Hindrance to the New Legal Tender, and Articles 16 to 20 of the Wartime Special Criminal Law should immediately report the full case file and the original copy of the judgment for special filing once the punishment or judgment is confirmed. It is also stipulated that the number of cases accepted should be reported to the ministry every month for future reference, in order to determine performance evaluation. If, in the case of the above-mentioned economic crimes, there are any instances of those in charge abusing their power and deliberately making loopholes, the responsible personnel will be severely punished upon verification, and the heads of the respective agencies will also be held responsible. Furthermore, the ministry, regarding the fact that the courts under its jurisdiction have failed to earnestly implement the Provisional Measures for the Imposition of Fines during Wartime, has once again ordered all courts to strictly abide by the provisions of the regulations and earnestly handle cases involving the imposition of fines.

### Personnel Choices for the Cotton Industry Professional Committee Have Been Decided

Nanjing, September 27 (Central News Agency) – Since the authorities decisively implemented the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, the organization and personnel selection of the Cotton Industry Professional Committee of the Trade Control Commission have recently been decided due to the upcoming cotton harvest season. It is expected that Tang Shoumin will be appointed as the chairman of the Cotton Acquisition Committee, and a deputy chairman will also be selected. The direct acquisition plan is being drafted and is expected to be completed within days, and then the acquisition will begin. The acquisition method will generally follow the acquisition method for wheat, with members of the various trade associations affiliated with the Sino-Japanese Joint Association responsible for the acquisition. In the past, the method of dividing acquisition areas between China and Japan was implemented for acquisition matters. It is reported that this method is still adopted in principle, but in practice, both China and Japan are free to acquire. However, the managers are still responsible for their respective areas under the jurisdiction of both China and Japan.

### Soviet Troops Use Fog Cover to Attempt to Cross the Dnieper River; Fierce Fighting West of Bryansk

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to official sources: Soviet troops attempted to cross the Dnieper River again near Bryansk on Sunday morning, achieving only partial success. The Soviet troops used heavy fog as cover, but lost control of their movements in the fog during the battle. German troops penetrated the Soviet lines, and isolated Soviet tank units were unexpectedly destroyed. Soviet reinforcements transported by motorcycle were also completely routed.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency correspondent Colonel Hammer): On Saturday, the Soviet army continued its efforts to break through the German defenses at various points along the Eastern Front. The Soviet army launched a large-scale landing operation at the Kuban bridgehead in an attempt to achieve the aforementioned objective. In the central Dnieper region, Red Army paratroopers simultaneously landed behind German lines, but all Soviet attempts were thwarted by German defenders. The Soviet army hoped that the weather conditions in the central and southern parts of the Eastern Front would deteriorate, hindering German operations, but this hope was dashed. The war in various regions of the Eastern Front has not eased. The Soviet army is not only engaging divisions but also entire army corps in combat, and continues to suffer extremely heavy casualties. The Soviet army's "offensive for bread" has developed into a large-scale war of attrition. For the sake of survival, the Soviet army will have to continue this war, regardless of its irreparable losses.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The seesaw battle in the Chernikov district is currently raging. Soviet forces are using extremely powerful tanks and infantry to maintain their supply lines, resulting in heavy losses. The local gains made by the Soviet army were completely cleared by fierce German counterattacks before nightfall.

### Argentina Expresses Neutrality

Argentina's foreign policy has no ambitions or ulterior motives towards any nation, but is a clear, upright policy with genuine friendship, and this foreign policy will be reflected in concrete actions. Furthermore, this speech by the Argentine President is his first foreign policy speech since the resignation of former Foreign Minister Storni.

Central News Agency dispatch - According to London sources: The British Foreign Office issued an official statement commenting on the egg purchasing agreement concluded with Argentina, expressing deep disappointment at the decision of successive Argentine governments to remain neutral.

### Germany Adopts New Submarine Tactics in the Atlantic; Dönitz Offensive Revived

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Since Grand Admiral Dönitz, commander of the German submarine fleet, took office as commander-in-chief of the Navy at the beginning of this year, German submarine warfare has become significantly more active. The so-called "Dönitz Offensive" has caused fear among the British and Americans. However, as British and American anti-submarine defenses reached a peak, the results gradually diminished after April, leading to a gradual decline in German submarine activity. The German High Command announced on the 24th its long-dormant major submarine victory, indicating that German submarines have re-launched their offensive. Although the type and performance of the new weapons used to achieve this victory have not yet been revealed, reports suggest that this submarine war not only used new weapons but also adopted new tactics for the first time. German submarines have always primarily targeted transport ships, concentrating all their efforts on them in each attack and not attacking escort ships. However, this method was discovered by the British and Americans and could no longer be used. Therefore, German personnel, led by Grand Admiral Dönitz and other highly intelligent individuals, researched new tactics, and finally achieved this offensive strategy. This time, emulating Japanese submarine tactics, they focused all their efforts on attacking warships first, and then attacking transport ships. When a submarine approached a convoy, it first attacked the escort destroyer fleet, striving to destroy the destroyers with unwavering determination. After that, the submarine would turn its sharp edge toward the transport ships, launching a fierce attack on transport ships that the escort ships were unable to defend. As a result, a major victory was achieved, sinking twelve British and American escort ships, inflicting a major blow on the British and Americans. The British and Americans seem to be extremely embarrassed by this. The new offensive by German submarines, using new weapons and adopting new tactics, has just begun. It is said that the German high command has great confidence in this, and Dönitz's contribution, after six months of dormancy, will become increasingly active in the Atlantic, inflicting a heavy blow on the British and American transportation network.

### Stettinius Appointed U.S. Under Secretary of State

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Reuters report from Washington: The British Broadcasting Corporation's correspondent in the United States, Barkerway, claimed that Stettinius's appointment as Under Secretary of State after Welles has caused great surprise among Americans. Washington political figures have welcomed the appointment, believing that Stettinius can reorganize the State Department with his experience and talent and implement new policies. It is also generally believed that Stettinius's appointment as Under Secretary of State confirms that the Lend-Lease system will become one of the important aspects of American post-war policy. Welles's future position remains unknown.

### Soviet Representative for the British, American, and Soviet Foreign Ministers Conference Decided

Moscow, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Soviet Foreign Ministry announced yesterday that it has appointed Deputy Foreign Minister Vyshinsky to represent the Soviet government at the upcoming meeting of the British, American, and Soviet foreign ministers to be held in Algiers.

### British and American Forces Launch Reconnaissance Offensive in Italian Mountain Area, Repelled by Heavy German Artillery Fire

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German News Agency's special correspondent in Italy, Bollener, stated that in the Salerno area and further east in the Potenza area as far as the Gulf of Manfredonia, British and American activities in the past 24 hours have been limited to reconnaissance attacks. In the focal points northwest of Salerno and north of Montecorvino in the past few days, the British and American forces have conserved their weak infantry and focused on using reinforced artillery units to attack high-ground German positions. On the front lines north of Contursi and Potenza, small American and British reconnaissance units cautiously advanced towards German forward positions on September 25, but were repulsed everywhere, suffering heavy casualties. A large American infantry group deployed in the valleys was effectively bombarded by German artillery fire, preventing the implementation of the previously planned American reconnaissance offensive. British and American units tasked with clearing German landmines were subjected to a sudden attack by German vanguards and were either annihilated or captured. German fighter-bombers attacked British and American supply lines, resulting in air combat. Two enemy aircraft were shot down, while the German aircraft completed their missions without any losses.

### German Head of State Declares Independence for Norway, Promoting Policies to Permanently Safeguard European Security

Oslo, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) - German News Agency reports: The German Commissioner for Norway, Terboven, yesterday read the following declaration from the German Head of State to Norwegian Prime Minister Quisling and officials at the Norwegian National Assembly: The German people are currently engaged in a mortal struggle with Bolshevism and the financiers who support it. The Jewish alliance of England and America in Moscow is launching a large-scale offensive against Western culture with mechanized forces, and the price paid by the English and American capitalists is "Europe." The German people have been at the forefront, sacrificing enormous manpower and material resources, deeply aware that this war will not only determine the fate of Germany and the German nation for centuries to come, but will also affect the entire future of the European continent. Therefore, they are willing to bear heavy responsibilities now and in the future, and are confident that this determination will guarantee victory and be a prerequisite for the pacification of Europe. Only after the implementation of pacification policies can Europe contribute all its strength to spiritual and material construction. In the process of completing this task, the German Head of State has decided, after achieving victory, to build a national socialist Norway that enjoys independence and freedom, ensuring that Norway can permanently safeguard European security in an elevated European society. Only such a society can ensure and guarantee the security of Europe. Furthermore, political figures here believe that the Head of State's declaration is not only a definition of the main political affairs implemented by the Norwegian National Assembly for three years, which is based on belief, but also an unprecedented announcement. The Norwegian National Government has always been loyal to this policy.

### Analysis of Soviet War Potential (Part 2)

Since the start of the German-Soviet war, more than two years have passed. Looking at the movements of the Soviet army, two tendencies are immediately apparent. 1. The recent efforts of the Soviet army towards modernization, and 2. The Soviet army's tendency towards revivalism. However, these two contradictory tendencies are not absolutely opposed. It is because of these contradictions that they can be unified. From a military point of view, they play an important role in strengthening the Soviet army's resistance.

Reinvigoration of the Soviet Army

Regarding the heavy blows suffered by the Soviet army at the beginning of the war, and the reasons why the Soviet Union was on the verge of collapse, are now clear and need not be repeated. Although the Soviet army had a highly mechanized and massive people's army, the leadership, misled by the glories of the civil war, neglected the operation of the latest combat techniques and relied solely on the morale of the combatants, which led to this result.

Of course, the morale of the combatants is the most important thing and the most important factor in resistance, which is beyond doubt. However, facing the highly mechanized German army, which was well-versed in ideal and cutting-edge tactics, the rough tactical views of the Soviet army's leadership collapsed vulnerably, pushing the Soviet Union into a major crisis.

Therefore, the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, Stalin, decided to thoroughly reorganize the Soviet army's leadership during the winter battles of 1941-42. The one who boldly and frankly demanded the change of the Soviet army's leadership, representing the world of public opinion, was the Ukrainian writer, and current Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Alexander Korniychuk.

Korniychuk's play, "The Front," from August 24th to 27th, caused an unusual reaction in all quarters. "The Front" is a literary work of the highest value, but it has even greater significance as a tactical [unclear]. Korniychuk said in "The Front" that it is not enough to simply demand courage from soldiers. Civil war heroes who do not understand the complex outlines of modern tactics are not qualified to carry out the war against Germany, which requires the highest technology and intelligence, and demanded that these "old soldiers" be removed from the Soviet army's leadership. Promote young officers with modern knowledge who understand what modern warfare is.

At the same time, Korniychuk demanded that the Soviet army, from the upper echelons to the rank and file, must have "knowledge of using first-class combat technology." The factory director who appears in the play is a thorough technician, pointing out that "the public respects and hopes for leaders with knowledge and keen insight."

The Pravda wrote a special editorial commenting on the play, stating: "In the Soviet army, commanders without talent, even if they rely on their past achievements and courage, cannot but withdraw from the position of leadership." This argument clearly reflects Stalin's intentions.

Thus, since last year, generals such as Voroshilov, Timoshenko, Budyonny, and Shaposhnikov, who had occupied positions in the Soviet army's leadership, were forced to withdraw from the front lines, and new and energetic commanders who understood modern tactics and respected technology successively occupied senior positions in the Soviet army's leadership.

For example, the new Chief of the General Staff of the Soviet Army, Marshal Alexander Vasilevsky, the commander of the Leningrad [unclear], General Eremenko, the commander of the Volkhov Front, General Meretskov, the commander of the Kalinin Front, General Maxim Purkayev (who seems to have recently been transferred to the commander of the Far Eastern Front), the commander of the Don Front, General Rokossovsky, the commander of the Southwestern Front, General Nikolai Vatutin, the commander of the Southern Front, General Malinovsky, the commander of the North Caucasus Front, Lieutenant General Maslennikov, the commander of the Voronezh Front, General Fyodor Golikov, the Chief Marshal of the Soviet Air Force, Novikov, and the Chief Marshal of the Artillery, Nikolai Voronov, are all around forty years old. Other army commanders, division commanders, etc., are mostly young people around thirty [unclear].

The above facts not only mean that the age of the Soviet army's lineup has returned to youth, but also that the Soviet army's combat effectiveness is not the same. This can be clearly seen in the Soviet army's counter-offensive in the winter of 1942-43 and the Soviet army's summer offensive since July 5th this year. Stalin disregarded all external considerations, gradually promoted new commanders, and ordered old and senile commanders to withdraw, constantly instilling a fresh [unclear] atmosphere within the Soviet army, which is a material that explains the "Asian mystery" of the Soviet army's resistance.

Unification of the Command System

The next important change in the Soviet army was the unification of the command system due to the abolition of the military commissar system. On October 9th last year, the Presidium of the Supreme Soviet issued a decree on "the unification of the command system and the abolition of the military commissar system in the Soviet army," which simply and clearly explained the urgent need to establish the unification of the command system.

The military commissar system was created to monitor the former Tsarist Russian officers who accounted for a large proportion of the Soviet army's leadership during the civil war. At that time, when Soviet army commanders issued orders, they had to be countersigned by the military committee. As a result, the Soviet army's command system was completely dualistic.

Later, after the end of the civil war, the political education of the Soviet army was strengthened, and as a result of the so-called Bolshevik education, the political education of the Soviet army commanders was greatly improved. During the Soviet-Finnish War, the military commissar system was once abolished and then restored, and it continued to exist for a year and a half during the German-Soviet War. However, with the progress of the war, many new and promising commanders with rich experience in modern warfare emerged, and the Soviet army made remarkable progress in both political and military aspects.

On the other hand, military commissars and political workers have raised their military significance and accumulated rich experience in modern warfare. Some of them have already served as commanders on the front lines. Many others can immediately become commanders after a certain amount of military training. As a result, the basis on which the military commissar system could exist has completely disappeared. If the military commissar system is allowed to continue to exist, and the command system is split into two, it will become a major obstacle to the implementation of the war. Therefore, it was decided to abolish the military commissar system.

The abolition of the military commissar system does not mean that political education within the Soviet army is no longer needed. It is because the political consciousness of the Soviet army commanders has greatly improved, and the army has [unclear] grown to the point where it can bear all the responsibilities on military and political issues. That is, the former military commissars and political workers who had the qualifications of internal commanders have been appointed as commanders, and others have also been transformed into political [unclear] of the commanders, in addition to undertaking the political education of the former Soviet army, they are also trained as commanders.

Regarding the above situation, as the "Red Star" newspaper said in its editorial: "The work of those engaged in politics is not determined by the number of meetings, reports, and speeches. It is determined by whether they can fully implement the troops' discipline, resistance consciousness, and combat tasks." Therefore, the abolition of the military commissar system in the Soviet army was implemented out of the necessity to most effectively carry out the war against Germany. Because the unification of the command system makes the conduct of operations extremely smooth, and because of the implementation of the same Bolshevik doctrine [unclear], military discipline is further strengthened, resistance is strengthened, and more capable cadres are cultivated, in an attempt to no longer be troubled by the lack of commanders. Therefore, the abolition of the military commissar system and the unification of the command system can be said to be a further development of the Soviet army's resistance.

In short, the abolition of the military commissar system was not abolished because there was no need to carry out political education within the Soviet army. As the Izvestia pointed out, in addition to unifying the command system to smoothly advance the war, it was for the purpose of "forming new reserve commanders." Everything is produced by the necessity of carrying out the war against Germany. Here, we can clearly see that Lenin [unclear] the slogan of "everything for the war" is being concretely implemented in the Soviet Union.

Revival of Tradition

The former slogan of the Soviet army was "Liberation of the working class of the world." Today, this slogan has become a pipe dream, and what is emblazoned on all the flags of the Soviet army is "For the Motherland" and "For Stalin." That is, the Soviet army believes that there is nothing else in existence today other than "war." Therefore, the Soviet army regards everything necessary for the course of war, and immediately adopts it without hesitation. In that [unclear], the system of the Tsarist era is no longer a problem. The most important of these is the revival of shoulder marks implemented in January of this year. When the Soviet army was created, the Soviet regime abolished shoulder marks as a "symbol of reaction." However, when restoring the "gold shoulder army," the Red Star newspaper said in its editorial: "Shoulder marks are a traditional decoration of the Russian army. The Soviet army is the legitimate successor to the honor of the Russian army. We cannot but use the weapons of our ancestors to inspire morale and take everything necessary to strengthen military discipline. The Soviet army values love for the motherland and respect for historical tradition. Shoulder marks are not simply an accessory to military uniforms, but a symbol of which soldiers boast."

In addition to the restoration of shoulder marks, the system of orderlies for officers has also been restored. The Presidium of the Supreme Soviet further issued an order in early July to strengthen the class system of the Soviet army. According to this order, the class classification of the Soviet army is divided into four classes: soldiers, non-commissioned officers, junior officers, and general officers. Before the revolution, the Russian army's class division was divided into three classes: soldiers, non-commissioned officers, and junior officers. Since the creation of the Soviet army, this class system has been abolished. Junior officers are simply referred to as Soviet army commanders, and soldiers are referred to as Soviet army soldiers.

However, the Soviet army authorities, in view of the experience of the two years of the German-Soviet war, have implemented the strengthening of the class system. This, like the revival of shoulder marks, is to enhance the authority of commanders and generals in order to improve military discipline.

On August 11th, the Soviet Navy also adopted this system. The Soviet Union, which calls itself an enemy of the class system, divides classes in the Soviet army and restores the traditions of the old Russian army, also due to the necessity of carrying out the war. In the future, the Soviet Union will resort to all means to win victory.

In summary, the movements of the Soviet army during the two years of the German-Soviet war are one, the progressive tendency to experience the latest technology and effectively carry out the war against Germany, and the revivalist tendency to restore the traditions of the old Russian army. Both of these are carried out in accordance with the fundamental policy of "everything for the war" stipulated by Lenin. In order to improve military technology, military discipline must be strengthened and morale must be boosted. In order to strengthen military discipline and boost morale, new and capable commanders must be continuously [unclear]. The two tendencies are not necessarily opposed. Here, we can seek the key to solving the "Asian mystery" of the Soviet army's resistance. (End of this chapter) (Translation: Allied World News Selection No. 1223)

### Enthusiastic Participation in the Purchasing Association

In order to complete the goal of unified rice purchase, the Rice Control Committee decided to set up preparatory committees for rice purchasing trade associations in various regions of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. After a meeting was held a few days ago, it was passed and the "Outline for the Establishment of Preparatory Committees for Rice Purchasing Trade Associations" was formulated. In addition to submitting it to the Executive Yuan for approval, if rice merchants in the joint regions wish to participate in the preparatory committee, they should comply with the requirements [unclear] stipulated in the Outline.

### Fang Jiuxia Robbery Case Huang Cifu Sentenced to Death Yesterday Morning's Sentencing Attached Civil Suit Sent to Civil Court

Huang Cifu robbed four diamond rings from Fang Jiuxia Jewelry Store on Nanjing Road on July 18th of this year, and opened fire to resist arrest, killing Indian constable Terry Poole and self-defense corps members Shen He. Huang was also arrested. The Shanghai District Court opened a trial on the 23rd of this month, declared the debate closed, and waited for sentencing.

Sentencing Situation

Yesterday morning was the date of sentencing. The Judicial Police Brigade [unclear] dispatched a large number of bailiffs inside and outside the court to implement security. The lawyers Mao Xianshen, Cheng Zhengping, and Ji Chao, hired by the families of the deceased Shen and Jiang from the self-defense corps, and the defendant's defense lawyer Zhu Hui, were all present in court. At about 10:00 a.m., the presiding judge, Zhao Zhengzhang, the president of the District Court, accompanied by the two judges Wu and Yu, and the prosecutor, took their seats in the Third Criminal Court. Huang Cifu was escorted to the court by four Chinese detectives and two Chinese constables.

Judgment Statement

After President Zhao called the roll, he stood up and read the main text: Huang Cifu is sentenced to five years of imprisonment for fraud, sentenced to death for continuous murder, and deprived of political rights for life. The death penalty shall be executed. The attached civil suit shall be transferred to the Civil Court of this court for trial. The defendant shall be transferred to Tilanqiao Shanghai Prison. [unclear] The items shall be returned to the original owner.

Reasons for the Judgment

[unclear] After the sentence, the reasons for the judgment were announced, stating in brief: Regarding the facts of the defendant's crime, it is extremely obvious. Although the defendant claimed to suffer from mental illness, considering his condition at the time of the crime, such as pretending to go outside the door to view the brilliance when taking the diamond rings, and his state when resisting arrest, it cannot prove that he was mentally deranged at the time. Assuming that he does have mental illness at present, since there was no sign of mental abnormality at the time of the crime, he cannot be relieved of his guilt. Moreover, after [unclear] determination by the court's forensic doctor Hou Guangdi, the defendant did not have mental illness.

Fraud and Murder

As for the arrest by the police for the defendant's crime of robbery and murder, but after trial [unclear] results, the defendant did not [unclear] violence, coercion, or take out weapons to intimidate at the time, so it cannot be considered a robbery. It is actually [unclear] the crime of fraud and murder. Moreover, considering that the defendant is a police officer who commits a crime with knowledge of the law, there is really nothing to be angry about, so the judgment is made as in the main text. If he does not accept this judgment, he can file an appeal within ten days after receiving the judgment, etc. Huang Cifu was silent after hearing the sentence, and was then escorted by detectives and constables into a car and sent to prison.

### Nanshi's Current Grain Sales

### Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign Inaugural Meeting: Grand Opening with the Declaration of Two Outcomes

Central News Agency Report: The Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign, initiated and prepared by sixteen influential public organizations in the city, held its grand inaugural meeting yesterday at 3:00 PM at the Ningbo Native Place Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. Government officials from both China and Japan attended. Representing Mayor Zhao was Secretary-General Cui Jingzi. From the Municipal Party Headquarters was Yangshan; Chen Dongbai, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare; a representative from the New Life Movement branch; Zhu Yunsheng, representing Police Chief Lu Ying; and from the Allied Nations, Mr. Ota, representing Minister Izubuchi of the Army Press Department; Mr. Akaboshi; Lieutenant Tanaka, representing Colonel Matsushima, Director of the Fleet Press Department; Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy's Intelligence Department; Secretary Iwai; Vice Consul Fuku; as well as Chen Shao, Xu Chu, Xiang Yuan, Qin Run, Chen Binhe, Gu Nanqun, and over 1,500 member representatives. The Shanghai Orphanage band played music at the event, and China Film Company sent personnel to film news footage of the meeting. The assembly also telegraphed greetings to Chairman Wang.

Declaration of Establishment

The following is the original text of the declaration of the establishment of the Shanghai Municipal Citizens' Thrift Campaign: "Thrift is virtue." Ancient teachings are clear. The beginning of benevolent governance prioritizes frugality. Amid chaos and disorder, the key to good governance lies in diligence and thrift. Simple clothing and food are the foundation of everlasting achievements. Coarse garments and hats led to the revival of the nation. Reduced clothing counts were a hallmark of the Zhenguan era, unseen since ancient times. Understanding the difficulty of material resources begins with diligence in national affairs. When the people's strength is relieved, the nation is stable and strong. This is not accidental, as history shows. Now that the political system is reformed and sovereignty rests with the people, practicing thrift and cherishing resources relies even more on the voluntary action of the people. Only then can we overcome difficulties and achieve effective governance. In times of war, the disparity between the supply and demand of materials is significant, and not a single bit should be wasted. This is understood by everyone and needs no further elaboration. Looking ahead to the reconstruction after the war, the importance is even greater today. Without establishing a strong foundation and preserving vitality, achieving significant results is impossible. We must be like passengers in the same boat, helping each other for the common good. This is why the thrift campaign cannot be delayed or neglected. Shanghai is the economic and cultural center of the country, and its every word and action affects the entire nation. In the past, due to the existence of concessions, power was inverted, leading to extravagant habits. This has become deeply ingrained. In the past, consumption had already been deemed far beyond the standard of living. In recent years, even more so, as it is far from the war zone, it is like a paradise, and extravagance has become even more rampant. Now that we have regained our original status, we should wash away old habits and cultivate a culture of thrift and frugality to adapt to the wartime system, consolidate the foundation for reconstruction, and set an example for the whole country. The purpose of this association is to practice the above principles. The rules and regulations are not complicated, but aim to ensure that everyone can implement them, so as to achieve everyone practicing it, day after day. To contribute to the victory of the war and the reconstruction after the war, each person should do their part. May all our compatriots and gentlemen be aware of this.

Chairman's Speech

Zhang Yi, Chairman of the Congress, gave a speech at the opening of the conference, stating: "Today is the inaugural meeting of the Citizens' Thrift Campaign. No one would ever object to thrift, so thrift is extremely ordinary and extremely solemn. The significance of the thrift campaign, in a broader sense, is that thrift is of utmost importance and closely related to the country and society. In a world of chaos, only nations with hard-working and enduring peoples can maintain their eternal existence. No matter how society changes, arousing the spirit of autonomy and self-discipline will never be a loss. Therefore, the importance of thrift should be given top priority. If someone says this is an exaggeration, I will take a step back and say that, in a smaller sense, in terms of personal life, personal life is greatly affected. In the process of life, childhood centers on the family, youth centers on marriage, and middle and old age center on friendship. In these three stages, if you indulge in extravagance and do not engage in thrift, the harm will be profound. I will give an example. Those who cannot save in the family will have disharmony between brothers, discord between sisters-in-law, and disputes over property, leading to the danger of family breakdown. Regarding marriage, today's freedom of love is a matter of course, but if men and women love each other and wish to do so, they can freely engage, but those with elders above them will never have this freedom. They must consider the family status of both parties and boast of mutual friends and relatives. Therefore, due to unsuitable conditions, the love of children is sacrificed. This is a common occurrence. If the family is too strict, it will lead to suicide and endanger life. As for old age, people seek pleasure in life in old age, and eventually they will meet good friends, but in early years of making friends, the rich hear the air, and the poor are poor. When the poor friends root water after that, sometimes they knock on the door to see party friends, often they are blocked by the servants below. Therefore, it is difficult to make friends on the face and suffering deepens. Therefore, thrift is deeply related to the country and society in general, and is extremely close to individuals in particular. Therefore, a thrift campaign cannot but be undertaken. Talking about thrift must be done from the individual, engaging in simplicity and frugality. Therefore, the thrift campaign is not only for each person to save, but also for most people to save. Do not be thrifty for a moment, but be thrifty for life. This is of great benefit to society and the country. Starting from the starting point of local efforts to promote the movement, we must first organize meetings before we can do it together, with thrift as the only belief. It should not be a personal belief, but a belief in thrift for the country and for society. We must cultivate a good atmosphere of frugality.

Hirota's Speech

Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy's Intelligence Department gave a speech, stating: "Today is the establishment of your association. I am honored to attend and give a speech on behalf of the association. Today, all of you present are the most influential people in Shanghai. Thrift is beneficial to the country and society. We look forward to the automatic initiation by the citizens of Shanghai. Whether in China or Japan, the thrift campaign should be actively promoted. Looking back, since the Xinhai Revolution in China, there has been constant talk of unity and self-improvement, but China's construction has not yet been successful. This is due to the oppression of Britain and the United States, which has prevented the fulfillment of its mission. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggression of Britain and the United States will be wiped clean, and reconstruction will begin. Therefore, thrift should be practiced everywhere to achieve success. Furthermore, China sympathizes with Japan's war against Britain and the United States, and declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9 of this year, standing on the same front, sharing life and death, to complete the Greater East Asia War. Not only in terms of military strength, but also in terms of military thought and economy, we must advance on three fronts to establish the Greater East Asia War. Due to all of these reasons, we must fully practice thrift to contribute to the country, so that materials are sufficient and economic power is strengthened. Whether large or small, we must implement it thoroughly. Therefore, the significance of the thrift campaign is profound, directly enriching national strength and indirectly stabilizing people's livelihoods. We express our deep anticipation for the automatic initiation and organization by the citizens of Shanghai, and at the same time express our sincere congratulations."

### Air Defense Measures Increasingly Comprehensive; Consideration of Air Raid Insurance; Yellow Sand and Water Buckets Must Be Regularly Prepared

Central News Agency Report: With the cooperation of various parties, citizens are becoming more proficient in their knowledge and skills regarding air raid measures and civilian air raid equipment in this city. To promote the thoroughness of the air defense network in each district, the Municipal Baojia Committee has ordered all Baojia offices under its jurisdiction to advise residents in each district to set up yellow sand and water buckets, and to keep them regularly prepared in case of emergency, so that civilian air defense forces can be invisibly strengthened.

Commercial News Agency Report: According to Japanese newspapers, the Shanghai Japanese "National Damage Insurance Company Association" has been designated by the Japanese authorities to promote "Air Raid Insurance" in Shanghai. The insurance contract requires a premium of two yuan for every six months for an insured amount of one thousand yuan. As for the Chinese side, the relevant authorities are also considering promoting this insurance, and detailed measures and insurance costs still need to be determined. It is reported that in addition to the insurance that has been implemented for the cotton cloth purchased by the General Chamber of Commerce, "Air Raid Insurance" is also being considered.

Datong News Agency Report: To improve air defense equipment in each Baojia district, each Lianbao is required to prepare the following items: Fire Knockers: This fire knocker consists of a bamboo pole of equal length with a straw rope tied to one end. Its purpose is to extinguish incendiary bombs. When in use, the end tied with the rope is immersed in water and knocked against the bomb, which can extinguish the incendiary bomb. Sandbags or sand buckets. Water buckets or water tanks. Long ladders. Straw mats.

### Price Increase for Pedicabs Resolved

Recently, the Pedicab Rental Industry Association of this city increased prices without formal approval from the competent authorities and widely published the increase in newspapers. The First District Public Office issued a written warning and notified the association to submit a memorial explaining the reasons for the price increase for verification. According to the submitted report, prices have recently risen, and the prices of key materials for pedicabs, such as hardware and tires, have risen even more sharply. Under these circumstances, it is impossible to maintain operations, which affects the livelihoods of workers. In view of the fact that pedicabs are an important means of transportation in this city and to maintain the operation of pedicabs, and taking into account the livelihoods of more than 10,000 pedicab drivers in the city, the District Public Office cannot but give benevolent consideration and find ways to provide relief, but at the same time, the burden on the citizens must also be taken into account. With the approval of Mayor Chen, the prices have been revised. (Double-seat rickshaws: initial 30 minutes for 18 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 2 yuan, every hour 30 yuan. Single-seat rickshaws: initial 30 minutes for 12 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 1.5 yuan, every hour 21 yuan. Double-seat sedan cars: initial 30 minutes for 18 yuan, every 5 minutes thereafter 2 yuan, every hour 30 yuan.) The First Police Bureau was instructed to comply.

In addition, the Shanghai Bus Company on Tongfu Road had a dispute due to increased fares. After the Bureau of Social Welfare summoned both parties to the bureau again yesterday and strongly persuaded them, an agreement was reached. It was agreed to readjust the fare to 80 yuan per day. The company must not dismiss drivers due to the occurrence of this case. After the city license is obtained in the future, the fare will remain the same, and a written record was signed at the scene.

### Former Shanghai Postmaster Chapellain Passes Away

Mr. Chapellain, a Frenchman who was formerly the Director of the Shanghai Office of the Directorate General of Posts and the Director of the Shanghai Postal Administration, passed away at 7:00 PM on the 24th. Mr. Chapellain had served in the Chinese postal service for more than 30 years and was known for his diligence and kindness to his subordinates. Now that he has passed away, all postal workers mourn him. The body was placed in a coffin at the Universal Funeral Parlor yesterday, and more than a thousand postal workers voluntarily went to the funeral. When the coffin arrived at the French Cemetery for burial, the Shanghai Postal Workers' Union, led by the postal worker military band and green-clad postal workers, carried wreaths and lined up. The line stretched for miles. Mr. Chapellain's friends and postal authorities all attended the burial at the cemetery.

### West Shanghai Household Flour to Be Available for General Sale Tomorrow

The sixteenth phase of household flour for the first and second wards of the West Shanghai district, totaling 8,032 packages of first-grade flour and 1,606 packages of third-grade flour, has been processed for shipment by the district's public grain joint office and is expected to be available for sale tomorrow (the 29th). Each person can purchase 1.4 catties of first-grade flour and 0.4 catties of third-grade flour with a certificate, priced at 11.4 yuan.

### Seventh Phase Rationed Sugar to Be Available for General Sale on the Second of Next Month; Price May Increase by One Dime Per Catty

The sugar rationed for the seventh phase in this city has been approved by the military distribution authorities to continue to be handled by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office. The sugar will be available for general sale this month, but due to shipping procedures, it must be postponed until the second of next month. All authorized retailers should regularly exchange purchase certificates and pay for the goods for shipment on a scheduled date. The announcement from the office is copied below:

Deadline for Exchanging Certificates and Paying for Goods

It has been found that the seventh phase of rationed food supply has been prepared by this office. It is now scheduled to issue purchase certificates on the 28th and 29th of this month. All retailers who sell rationed sugar must affix their seal to the previously issued blank receipts and indicate the quantity in the upper-mentioned deadline in order to receive the purchase certificate, and must pay the full amount to the designated sugar store before the 30th of this month and sell immediately. Delays are not allowed. In addition, the date for users of Group 1 (i.e., former Class B retailers) to exchange purchase certificates will be announced separately.

The Price of This Phase May Increase Slightly

Regarding the price of sugar in this phase, the person in charge of the office told reporters, "It has been found that the sugar distributed by this office in the future will be distributed by the military authorities. The cost per catty is 4.74 yuan, while the current price of rationed sugar is 4.7 yuan per catty. In the past, because the sugar distributed was owned by the shareholders of this office, the difference of a few cents was not taken into account. However, since it is now acting as an agent, the difference of a few cents, if calculated as an integer, is not small. At the same time, the cost of issuing sugar certificates to various authorities is also borne by the office. In order to take into account the cost, the price may be increased by one dime per catty to 4.8 yuan, but this has not yet been decided and must be approved by the authorities."

### The Materials Investigation Committee Does Not Send Personnel to Investigate Along the Road

Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee's investigation of hoarding of materials in Shanghai has become increasingly tense. The task and scope of the investigation are to investigate whether there is hoarding of materials in the warehouses and factories of various public and private companies and firms, as designated by order, and no personnel are sent to investigate when the authorities approve the movement and transportation of goods. It has recently been reported that unscrupulous people often impersonate investigators from the Materials Investigation Committee, intercept and investigate, and carry out fraudulent behavior, which is extremely harmful to merchants. The person in charge of the association told reporters yesterday that the association has not sent personnel to patrol along the road. If this kind of situation is discovered when transporting goods, it can be truthfully reported to the authorities.

### The School for the Unfortunate: A Record of the School for the Blind (1)

On Hongqiao Road, a place of poetry and painting in the western suburbs of Shanghai, several famous cultural fortresses once stood. The only one that remains is the School for the Blind at the eastern end of McClain Road, which is creating miracles of human civilization. It has a magnificent Western-style building and an endless expanse of farmland, which has been renovated after several wars. It is full of peace, tranquility, and an atmosphere that makes people feel attached to it. In the golden autumn sunshine, the wind is filled with the fragrance of flowers, carrying the sound of teachers and students reading, mixed with the solemn and peaceful sound of the piano, arousing the desire to visit this school immediately.

The Sad History of Management

From the ancient city-style gate came an amiable old man who opened the tall and heavy iron gate. A puppy came out to greet us, making the school seem full of life in its tranquility. Mr. He Zhizeng, the vice-principal, has been involved in blind education for 29 years, but he is still full of youthful spirit. He first told us about the glorious history of the School for the Blind.

Thirty-two years ago, one year before the birth of the Republic of China, Dr. John Fryer, who had contributed to the enlightenment movement and social and cultural undertakings in China, accepted the opinions of some enthusiastic people at the time and donated a large sum of money to establish the School for the Blind on North Sichuan Road, specializing in the admission of Chinese blind children and providing them with special education. At that time, the purpose of running the school was threefold: First, in view of the plight of homeless wandering blind children, to provide shelter and relief in accordance with God's love for people and human sympathy and mutual assistance; second, to enable blind children not only to have a place to live, but also to acquire special skills in school so that they can make a living in the future and not be a burden on society; third, and further, to enable blind children to learn specialized skills and promote the education of the blind after graduating from school, so that even if there are blind children in China in the future, all blind people can serve the country and society.

After four years of arduous management, the school was barely prepared, but the number of homeless blind children who should be admitted was still increasing day by day. The cause of the school for the blind urgently needed to be expanded. In the fourth year of the Republic of China, a new and luxurious school building suddenly appeared at No. 4, Yidingpan Road, Nishi, and the teachers and students worked even harder in teaching. In the second year (the fifth year of the Republic of China), a handicraft department was established to enable blind children with similar talents to learn handicraft skills that could make a living, such as weaving and equipment, and at the same time, the school could sell some products to help with general expenses. As for the academic subjects, they were originally at the elementary school level, but later, with the permission of St. John's University, they could be inserted into the specially set up high school department of the university. Therefore, a junior high school department was opened in the seventh year of the Republic of China, and graduates were sent to St. John's for further study.

In April of the twentieth year of the Republic of China, Mr. Chuan Burlan, the principal of the School for the Blind, attended the 36-nation International Blind Conference held in the United States as a representative of China, enabling well-known figures from various countries who were enthusiastic about blind and deaf education to recognize the importance of assisting blind and deaf education in China. In December of the same year, the completed new school building at No. 290, Hongqiao Road, was also declared completed. A girls' school building was attached to this building, and a girls' school department was opened after the winter vacation, focusing on the education of female blind children. In this way, the first complete blind education organization in China laid the foundation for a promising future of active development.

The Secret of the Blind Not Being Blind

Blind children from all directions, once they enter the gate of the School for the Blind, the "life" of the black hell in the past ends. What unfolds before them is a bright path. Not only do they receive the care of love between human beings, but from then on, they are integrated into another warm and united world, and what they do not know is that they are not blind people! They can read and write like ordinary people, and then take on all the tasks of society and the country! This is not a fantastic miracle, but a simple fact!

So, how do blind people read and work? Mr. Fan Fubao, the director of studies, a half-blind enthusiastic scholar who has been engaged in blind education for more than 20 years, led us to visit various departments of the school to answer this question for you. It turns out that blind people have specially made characters and books! "Braille" consists of 54 basic symbols, which are spelled out in Chinese characters according to the phonetic methods of the national language, Roman characters, or Latin characters, including the tones of the language and the new punctuation marks, for a total of 69 basic symbols. English, including some commonly used basic words and Arabic numerals, has only 56 basic symbols. These symbols, when combined, form words and languages. Perhaps some people suspect that there are too many basic symbols and that they are difficult to remember. In fact, the five or sixty basic symbols are just changes in six raised dots, much like the changes in the ancient Chinese "Eight Trigrams." However, the basis of the Eight Trigrams is "Qian," that is, "three," and the new composition of each line constitutes sixty-four "Gua." The basic symbols of Braille, on the other hand, are composed of the following: In these six points, different phonetic symbols are formed by the level or convexity of each point. The basic phonetic symbols in Chinese are about fifty-four consonants and vowels such as b, p, m, f, d, t, n, l, g, k, h, j, q, x, zh, ch, sh, r, z, c, s, y, w, a, o, e, i, u, ü, ai, ei, ao, ou, an, en, ang, eng, er, yi, wu, yu, wa, wo, wai, wei, wan, wen, wang, weng, ya, yao, ye, yi, yin, ying, yong. Then, use these phonetic symbols to spell out characters. Therefore, when you open a blind person's books or dictionaries, they are (books without words), only rows of crab-like raised dots. Blind people use the sense of touch of their fingers instead of the vision of their eyes, and they can quickly read the sentences in the book and quickly check the dictionary. This method of literacy is similar to the Romanization of the national language, and it is much easier to teach than square Chinese characters. No wonder blind people can read books like sighted people! However, the progress of science is human-oriented. Not long ago, the United States and the Soviet Union had invented another kind of blind education tool, which is roughly similar in structure to gramophone records. The textbooks or materials to be taught, and even the news in the daily newspaper, are recorded on the records. The records are special paper records, which are light in weight and can be rolled up and mailed. After receiving them, they can be played back by sound according to a certain method. It is estimated that in the near future, blind people in China will also be able to use this new teaching tool. However, charts and models will naturally have to use the original raised lines, raised dots, symbols, etc. In short, there is no mystery in blind people not being blind. Scientific research and discoveries have compensated for their natural defects.

### Today's Confucius Birthday Commemoration; Municipal Government Holds Grand Autumn Sacrificial Ceremony; Shandong Native Place Association Holds Grand Ceremony

### Unregistered Milk Farms to Be Thoroughly Investigated

The phenomenon of production and sales of unregistered milk farms in this city will be thoroughly investigated by the First District Public Office. It is understood that the authorities have decided to implement this thorough investigation in the near future. After the First District Public Office issued a notice to major consumers last week to fill out the report forms for June, July, and August, it is now classifying the reports. According to official sources, the sales of unregistered milk are very widespread. The authorities plan to conduct a thorough investigation to protect public health. Merchants who only seek private profit and sell unsanitary milk, regardless of the public, will be severely punished. Although the investigation being conducted by the First District Public Office is not yet clear, the public will be informed of the punishment and scope of penalties for illegal milk merchants in the shortest possible time.

### Sentiments on the Birthday of Confucius

— Wang Duanru

The world is declining and the Dao is weak, and Confucianism has been in decline for a long time. People in the southeast are deeply worried about this, so they have established the Chinese Confucius Society. Mr. Shen Xinqing is in charge of its affairs and has set up a general assembly in Shanghai, because it is an area where talents gather, and it is easy to achieve twice the result with half the effort in lecturing and asking questions. Our Shaanxi is located in the north, and the culture is backward. The scriptures are still passed down, but they are on the verge of extinction. My brother Yaoxian lamented the decline of Confucianism, the great meaning and subtle words were lost, so he abandoned commerce and followed Confucianism, requesting it from Zhang Guoqifu Zi. Once he suddenly became enlightened. He strengthened his determination to promote it and resolutely destroyed his family to study. Duanru followed behind him and repeatedly donated large sums of money to purchase bases. In the 24th year of the Republic of China, the Confucius Temple and Zongsheng School were established in Jiwang Village, Mae Township, Lintong County, his hometown. The Lingchuan Temple was also built in Lingkou Town, with an affiliated classics reading school. The Guanxue Temple and Guanxue Academy were also built in Xi'an, and the Wufuzi Temple and Jingxian Academy were built in Fengwang Village, Jingyang County. All of them enroll students free of charge to teach the national studies. It is also planned to set up a Zhou Nan School in Xijing City, following the legacy of the empress, mainly for female students. These are all the things that Duanru's brothers have worked hard to manage and operate, and they have been seen in reality. Now, on the birthday of the supreme sage and teacher, I respectfully offer my humble words as a celebration, and state my feelings as such.

Economic Circles Comments

### Securities Exchange Resumes Operations

The Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange, which had been suspended for over six years since the August 13th Incident, has officially announced its resumption of operations in the newspaper by its board of directors. The reopening ceremony will be held tomorrow at 10 a.m.

For the past six years, the Shanghai securities industry has been unofficially trading securities for clients on the black market. Now, it is fortunate to have obtained the government's understanding, allowing it to conduct securities trading for clients openly and formally in the market. This is indeed a significant economic event worthy of celebration.

In the past, the outflow of idle capital in Shanghai mostly flowed towards hoarding goods. However, since the government issued the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth on the 9th of last month, this trend has declined. Subsequently, the government ordered the Central Trust Bureau to organize "Special Savings Lottery Bonds," and the Central Reserve Bank, together with the Shanghai financial community, held a "Prize-Bearing Fixed Deposit Savings Campaign" to absorb some of the idle capital in the market. However, many commentators believe that the most enlightened and effective measure for the authorities to absorb idle capital is the officially authorized resumption of operations of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange.

However, things in the world often suffer from the problem of "supporting the east while the west collapses." Resuming formal trading of Chinese securities is indeed sufficient to absorb a large amount of idle capital. However, after the resumption of formal trading of Chinese securities, attention should be paid to preventing speculation, stabilizing prices, and strictly reviewing listed securities, so that securities trading can move towards the right track. This is the original intention of the authorities in allowing the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange to resume operations, and it is also the most important issue for the board of directors and supervisory committee of the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange in the future.

### After All Brokers Are Confirmed, Securities Trading Will Officially Commence; Resumption Ceremony to Be Held Tomorrow

Since the Shanghai Chinese Securities Exchange received orders from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to prepare for resumption of operations as soon as possible, it convened a temporary shareholders' meeting, decided on capital increase measures, and actively carried out preparations. Now, the proposed business charter of the exchange has been submitted for approval, and the brokers participating in stock trading have been submitted to the Ministry of Industry for review. The first batch of 39 firms has been approved to enter the market for trading, and the second batch will also be announced within days. At the same time, the exchange's supervisory committee, appointed by the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry, has also been established. Therefore, the exchange, in accordance with current regulations, will first handle the registration of various listed stocks within five days from the 24th to the 28th of this month in order to allow for trading after qualified review. At the same time, the resumption ceremony is scheduled to be held at 10:00 a.m. on the 29th of this month. The exchange has invited the relevant authorities to send personnel to the venue for guidance. The details are recorded as follows:

Enthusiastic Registration of Listed Securities

Since the exchange issued the announcement for the registration of listed securities, various companies in the city have been enthusiastically registering their listed stocks with the exchange recently. The registration conditions are in accordance with the "Principles for Reviewing Listed Stocks of This Exchange": limited liability companies, those approved and registered by the competent authorities, those with a capital of 5 million yuan or more, those with a capital of less than 5 million yuan but with total assets of more than 10 million yuan, and those that have been incorporated for more than one year may be allowed to register. The registration form stipulates that the following must be filled in: company name, date of establishment, date of registration, location of headquarters, location of main factory, business scope, proprietary rights, total capital, total number of shares, fixed dividend, par value per share, date of premium issuance, name of preferred stock, company history, capital increase and decrease history, subsidiary businesses, production volume and/or sales amount for the last five years, dividend records for the last five years, accounting year, location of branch offices or factories, directors, supervisors, and key personnel, distribution of shares held by shareholders, and remarks.

Internal Organization Divided into Three Departments

The internal organization of the exchange is divided into three departments under the chairman and secretary-general: General Affairs Department, Business Department, and Statistics Department, which handle all business. According to the Central News Agency reporter's inquiry with the person in charge of the exchange, after the resumption ceremony is held tomorrow (the 29th), stock trading will officially begin around the 10th of next month because the telephone installation for the market brokers has not yet been completed. After the listed stocks are reviewed and approved, they will be determined and announced by the exchange's supervisory committee.

### Real Estate Transactions Have Become Clearer and Scarcer in the Last Two Months

Real estate transactions in this city occupy an important position in the market. In the past, due to the abundance of idle capital and the rampant hoarding of goods, real estate transactions followed suit, and their prices also rose rapidly. Some people with idle capital, in addition to hoarding goods, also hoarded real estate. General speculators took the opportunity to rise up and engage in "kicking the ball" style of trading. As a result, the price increase became unstoppable. The peak of trading activity was between July and August of this year, averaging more than 20 transactions per day. However, since the government authorities used decisive measures to purchase yarn and cloth, restrict the excessive lending of various money houses, and crack down on speculative hoarding, the market's monetary conditions tightened, and the prices of various commodities also fell, thus falling into a state of stagnation. Recently, during the unusually active real estate transactions in July and August of this year, market prices soared by more than 100%. However, since the second half of September, due to the clearer and sparser transactions, there has been no sharp increase in prices.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the rise in Chinese stocks intensified, and the trend of seven consecutive rises was about to appear. In a chorus of positive news, the resumption of the securities market was imminent. The market's money houses were easing, and financial giants were releasing funds to continue to acquire yarn factory stocks. Some shifted their targets to pharmaceutical and other industrial stocks, and buying momentum was also expanding. Trading was even more active. The distribution of various stocks is as follows:

Textiles: Yong'an Textile, under the huge amount of buying, had few sales after the opening in the morning, and the price jumped up miraculously. It then hovered, and finally rose two levels more than Saturday afternoon. Dasheng No. 1 Factory also rose one level, knocking on double passes. No. 3 Factory jumped up more than one level, rushing to half a pass. Yufeng Weaving reached a major pass, rising more than 30% from Saturday. Meiya sharply broke through a major pass in the afternoon. Zhongfang Xinhe's rise was even greater, and buyers also went outside the double passes. Meilun Wool and small-denomination Hongyu and Dachina Weaving also attracted the attention of small investors who valued profits. Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing also saw an upward rush, and buyers of Jingfu Shirts actively raised prices. Jinglun went beyond the par value by 60%. Tianlun Silk Weaving rose by 30%, but there was still more demand than supply. Dagong Weaving debuted, with buyers bidding 70% above par value.

Department Stores: Yong'an Company rose more slowly, with a small portion being sold to buy other stocks (buying Yong'an Textile). In the end, it still rose by more than one level. Xinxin hovered around a major pass and broke out again in the afternoon. Sincere also went outside the level, all rising by more than one level. Zhonglian Underwear opened trading at the last edge.

Pharmaceuticals: Xinya Pharmaceuticals rose more than one level in the buying, and finally came out of the pass. Zhongfa also rose more than one level. Wuzhou Zhongxi and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory were all rising steadily.

Finance: Continental Bank crossed outside the pass again. Shanghai Zhexing Jincheng Banking and Zhongyi Trust all saw new high prices.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity and Shanghai Commercial Electricity rose in the rising tide. The former has already knocked on a major pass. Public utilities, electrical appliances, and Xiangsheng tricycles also rose steadily.

Real Estate: Xinyi traded outside the pass. Zhonghua and Yongxing also rose sharply.

Culture: World Book Company rose most sharply, breaking out of the pass. Commercial Press rose one level, and Zhonglian rose half a pass. Yongxiang Printing was firm.

Enterprises: Jiu'an Industrial flew out of the pass and continued to rise. Dachina Industrial rose 20% compared to Saturday. China and Guohua Investment were also quite firm. Xinya Construction was still rising. Buying of Dazhong Fireworks was particularly strong, rising more than half a pass. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco Company's rise was also fierce.

Others: Zhonglian Cinema rose 60% above par value. Kangyuan Confectionery had scattered buyers and rose a huge one pass. Fumin Dairy opened trading 30% above par value. Guanshengyuan and Merlin Confectionery both saw higher prices. Standard monosodium glutamate's buying momentum was still booming. Qinkong and Standard Paper made by Zaizao Paper, Da'an Glass, and Hanye were all lifted by buyers.

### Summary of Commercial Information

Government Bonds: Yesterday, the trend of government bonds still ran counter to stocks. The two types opened flat yesterday and then rose sharply. The final price at noon was higher than two weeks ago. Types A, B, and C were also relatively firm, but Type D's rise was particularly large.

Call Loan Rate: The Shanghai Money Trade Association's call loan rate remained unchanged at 18%.

Rice and Grain: The rice market had few arrivals, and retail transactions were also small. Bulk buying was still strong, and as a result, new rice was only one level away from a major pass, and thin rice also followed the trend. Since Yuan still stood on the pass, the demand for oil was still flat, and the market was stable.

Gunny Bags: Trading remained sluggish, mainly due to the long suspension of military needs and the narrow practical use. As a result, supply and demand were weak, and the market was uninteresting.

Woolen Fabrics: Due to environmental reasons, wholesale transactions have been limited for the past two weeks. Therefore, although prices have fallen for a month, there are still more sellers than buyers. As the weather turns cold and autumn sales begin, there are some transactions above the market, and shop assistants are also slightly increasing purchases. This sharp drop has brought all kinds of prices within the limit price. The cessation of cotton cloth sales has led to a sharp increase in the number of woolen and silk shops. Money houses are replenishing stock for shops that have overdrafts as well as those that do not owe money. As a result, the long-deserted woolen market is said to be turning active again.

Bird's-eye View of Northern Military Base

### Developing Vast Resources, Redoubling Efforts to Enhance Combat Power

Amidst the fierce battles in the South Pacific, the United States, which is advancing its bases towards Attu Island and Kiska Island, actually intends to use the so-called northern offensive route linking Alaska and the Aleutians to attack Japan's homeland. Its counter-offensive posture is quite formidable. Under this tense situation, the military significance of Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island has increased. Amidst this excitement of combat readiness, Hokkaido has established a five-year plan for increased food production, and Sakhalin Island is also rushing to formulate a ten-year development plan, hoping to dedicate vast resources to enhancing combat power and ensuring food supply. These two places were originally military base areas for resources and food supplies. From now on, they will further enhance combat power and develop resources from the perspective of military strongholds. Tang Ze, the Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, visited the area for ten days, and returned with great confidence in the concretization of the aforementioned plans. A reporter accompanied him, and this report will be written based on what he saw and heard.

Sakhalin Island

Sakhalin Island covers an area of 36,000 square kilometers, possessing vast arable land, abundant forests, one of the world's three major fishing grounds, 〇〇 tons of coal, and countless geological resources. It bears the important responsibility of a decisive battle base. However, people in the mainland have overlooked such resources. Since the Manchurian Incident, the pulp industry has been the main focus of development, becoming an important base for Japan's northward advance. Subsequently, due to the China Incident, the development of underground resources was further accelerated. Taking the Greater East Asia War as an opportunity, it became the driving force for promoting the national policy of decisive battle.

Mining Industry

The center of Sakhalin Island's mining industry is coal. Coal mountains are scattered in the North, South, and Central major coal mountains and throughout the island, with reserves of 〇〇 billion 〇. There are 25 companies engaged in the coal industry, including Mitsubishi, Mitsui, and Iron Real, with a total annual production of approximately 〇〇 tons, accounting for 〇〇% of Japan's total domestic production. There are still many coal mines that have not been opened. Once a full-scale mobilization of mining begins, the output will certainly be even more impressive. Sakhalin Island coal's biggest challenge at present is maritime transportation capacity, which prevents the transportation of goods as desired. Efforts are currently being made to improve transportation and allocate wooden ships. Various difficulties will soon be overcome. Currently, the government is also seeking comprehensive countermeasures for coal storage. Many believe that further progress is still needed, and the consolidation of coal mining companies is also an urgent task. At the same time, surveys of undeveloped mining areas should continue, and existing mining areas should be re-examined.

Industry

Sakhalin Island's industry began with the rise of paper and pulp production. Paper production is over 400 million pounds (accounting for one-fifth of the country's total production), and wood pulp is over 400,000 tons (accounting for over 40% of the country's total production). This must be attributed to the Prince Paper Company. However, it is a pity that the industries in other sectors have not yet been revitalized. In 1936, a Sakhalin Sugar Company was established. Currently, one-third of the sugar consumed on the island can be supplied domestically, and there is hope for increased production in the future. Currently, the center of Sakhalin Island's industry is artificial petroleum. The Sihai Coast Mitsubishi Petroleum Chemical Industry, established in 1939, uses Naihoro coal as raw material and has achieved remarkable results. Recently, the Bangtai Artificial Petroleum Plant on the east coast was established with a capital of 40 million yen, and can produce 〇〇 tons of artificial petroleum annually. The future development is unlimited. Sakhalin Island's artificial petroleum production accounts for an important 〇% of the country's total production.

Forestry

In recent years, forests have been slightly weakened due to forest fires and insect pests. Since last year, a fifteen-year afforestation plan has been launched. The Prince Paper Company has always been the largest consumer of forestry products, but due to its production restrictions and maritime transportation capacity, forestry still needs to be re-examined.

Fishery

Sakhalin Island, one of the world's three major fishing grounds, uses 70% of the aquatic products caught for fertilizer and 30% for food. The Sakhalin Island Government's fisheries administration, which encourages aquatic production and aquaculture, is old. However, a new important issue is to unify and merge the three existing organizations on the island: the Sakhalin Fisheries Company, the Sakhalin Marine Animal Industry Company, and the Sakhalin Marine Products Control Association, in order to launch a unified aquatic product industry as part of the local food policy.

Agriculture

Sakhalin Island is said to be abundant in materials, but food self-sufficiency on the island is still a problem. The shortage of arable land and farmers makes it difficult to achieve food self-sufficiency. The authorities have recently sent personnel to investigate and urgently hope for improvement. Secondly, consideration should be given to increasing the number of livestock such as cattle, horses, pigs, and chickens, preparing agricultural instructors, constructing agricultural roads, and subsidizing rural finance. In particular, for farmers who are developing new land, it is necessary to help them build houses and purchase fuel and livestock. It is generally hoped that each household can be helped with 6,000 yen, so the subsidy to agriculture is not a small amount. The island's food self-sufficiency is the center of the authorities' development plan. Currently, a food plan integrating Hokkaido and Sakhalin Island is being established, and regulations dependent on other cities will be abandoned.

The above is an overview of various industries. The Sakhalin Development Company, established in July of the year before last to promote development, has not yet achieved significant results. As a national policy company, this is noteworthy. It is hoped that it can strengthen the allocation of company leaders, correct the ills of bureaucratization, and transcend the concept of profit to move towards the greatest goal of enhancing combat power.

Beijing Correspondence

### Trends in the Cultural Circles of the Old Capital

The Whereabouts of Literary Representatives

Some time ago, Chinese writers sent representatives to Japan to attend the Second Greater East Asia Writers' Conference. The representatives from North China, including Shen Qixian and his group, had already returned to Beijing after the closing of the conference. Only Chen Ying, Zhang Wojun, and the nine representatives from Central China, who were invited by the Japanese Literary Patriotic Society to visit various places and tour Manchuria, did not return to Beijing until the 13th of this month, staying at the Beijing Hotel. That evening, the North China Writers Association hosted a banquet to welcome them back. Liu Ziguang, the secretary-general of the North China Writers Association, even gave a very moving speech. It was, after all, a convivial gathering for literary figures of the times. It is said that the Central China delegation has returned to the south after completing its diplomatic mission, while the North China representatives will attend a joint symposium initiated by four cultural organizations—the Beijing Chinese New Culture Construction Association, the North China Writers Association, the Chinese Life Culture Association, and the Chinese Culture Society—on the 22nd of this month to report on their experiences and impressions from the conference and travels in Japan. It can be said that they will be able to show off their accomplishments.

Oil Painting Exhibition

Artists seem to be very undisciplined. However, this is not always the case. The Chinese Oil Painting Society is an organization formed by several oil painters who do not like to be undisciplined. It has been three years since its establishment. To commemorate the anniversary, the society borrowed the Central Park's board of directors to hold a three-week anniversary exhibition. A total of three sections were displayed. The first section featured works by oil painting enthusiasts in Beijing, with three winners: Chen Yubin, Gao Kekai, and Dang Guohui. The second section featured works by members of the society, especially the excellent works of Tang Guoji, Zhang Zhenhua, Yang Ning, and others. The third section was the most valuable, consisting of more than twenty pieces of modern Western masterpieces collected by the National Academy of Art and Li Shuqi, as well as posthumous works by deceased domestic painters. All were rare and invaluable. The exhibition opened on the 14th of this month. The exhibition lasted for a week, and many people visited it every day, making it an opportunity for major artistic activity.

The Plight of Elementary School Teachers

There is a popular saying in Beijing recently that goes, "Four Cheap Things." What are the four cheap things? First, table salt; second, streetcar fares; third, postage; and fourth, elementary school teachers. Among these four, although table salt is not a valuable thing, it has recently become scarce due to certain reasons, and it is difficult to buy. Moreover, the price has already increased. Streetcar fares are indeed as cheap as they can be, but recently they have also increased from 10 cents to 15 cents. Postage has not changed much, but it is not as though it has not increased compared to before the incident. And then there is the salary of elementary school teachers, which has remained at the same price as a few years ago. The highest is 80 yuan per month, and the lowest is only 55 yuan, which is less than the income of a servant. In this era of high prices for everything, such treatment is really too difficult. No wonder many elementary school teachers have given up their chalk-dust careers and sought other ways to make a living. However, although some have left, there are still quite a few newcomers. The reason is that people who graduate from middle school have no other skills besides becoming elementary school teachers. It is said that these people who have received secondary education are a kind of scholar-officials. These "scholars" are refined and gentle, and cannot withstand even a gust of autumn wind, let alone hard work. Therefore, they have no choice but to go to elementary schools to seek a way to "eke out a living." However, even "eking out a living" has become a problem now. Rice costs as much as 4 or 5 yuan per catty, and 80 yuan in salary is not enough to pay for half a month's worth of food. How can they "eke out a living"? How can they support their families? Therefore, a new method has recently been invented, called "raising subsidies," which is to ask students for extra allowances. In other words, it is a kind of begging. Unfortunately, because this "solicitation" is "extra," it has aroused the attention of the education authorities, who are determined to rectify customs. As a result, the "Beijing Special Municipality Education Bureau" issued an order to stop the "solicitation of living subsidies by teachers in municipal elementary schools, which harms the educational policy," and the schools "obeyed the order and immediately stopped soliciting subsidies from students." However, for those who have already been solicited, there is no way to develop, so special grace is granted, "no longer to be returned" (the above is quoted from the New Beijing Daily on the 17th of this month). It is said that after stopping this "solicitation" that harms customs, the authorities are thinking of ways to improve the treatment of elementary school teachers, but we do not know when they will raise funds and how they will improve it.

National Forum

### The Urgent Need for Police Reform

Part One

For politics to be on the right track, it requires the governing authorities to use wise regulations and methods, implementing them in all aspects of society. Those who execute and oversee the implementation of these regulations and methods are called public servants. Therefore, having sound regulations and methods necessitates honest and upright public servants to execute them. Otherwise, even with good regulations and methods, if corrupt public servants abuse them, the harm will not only cause the people to suffer but also lead to contempt for government laws and distrust of the governing authorities. Therefore, we demand a reformed politics, one that must not neglect whether the implementers of regulations and methods—the public servants—are honest, upright, and capable of diligently conveying the intentions of the authorities and sincerely extending benefits to the people.

I, as a humble observer, have limited experience and cannot visit remote and desolate areas to assess the performance of public servants throughout the country. However, I believe that Shanghai can represent the best among the nation. Why? Because the more densely populated the area, the more attention must be paid to public criticism. Even corrupt public servants must exercise some restraint. As the saying goes, "A gentleman does not deceive even in a dark room," meaning that in sparsely populated areas, one can act arbitrarily, but only a gentleman can refrain from deception. In densely populated areas, even petty people cannot easily act recklessly. And since Shanghai's population density is the highest in the country, I believe Shanghai can represent the best in the nation.

The term "public servants" includes all those who work in government agencies. However, during times of war, the ones who have the most contact with the public are the police officers. They have fixed positions on roads, at entrances, and on main thoroughfares. In peacetime, their duty is merely to maintain law and order and protect the safety of good people. Their fundamental stance should be to sincerely cooperate with and earnestly assist the well-intentioned public. However, today, because the government seeks to crack down on speculation and hoarding to stabilize people's livelihoods, it has announced various measures for appropriate and reasonable disposal of materials, such as government purchase, restrictions on movement, price limits, and mandatory registration. The government's formulation of these laws is, of course, a necessary measure to safeguard the overall situation and stabilize people's livelihoods. Public servants should absolutely obey, comply with, and implement them without any favoritism. However, the reality is far from it. Such is the behavior of Shanghai's police officers, and I believe anyone living in Shanghai with clear eyes and ears would not deny it. If Shanghai is like this, one can imagine the situation in other remote areas where few people are watching. If this continues, the government's fundamental policies will not be implemented, and the people will become increasingly resentful and uneasy. What the future holds is truly unbearable to think about.

Needless groaning without illness is unacceptable. To repeat errors is still errors. It is even more unacceptable to remain silent and unaware of impending dangers, treating them as normal. "Among the most unacceptable of potential disasters is to have a seeming era of peace and prosperity, but in reality harbor unforeseen troubles." I hope that those in power will take the nation and its people as their priority, resolutely make up their minds, and revitalize the police administration. If so, the nation will be fortunate, and the people will be fortunate (Xu Hongsheng).

Part Two

Shanghai citizens generally have unfavorable impression towards police officers of the special district (formerly patrolmen), which is almost universal. What could be the reason? Because people usually see the police acting in a way that gives them a bad impression. The Chinese people tend to sweep the snow from their own doorstep and ignore the frost on others' roofs, which has resulted in these police officers disregarding the law. I believe that to eliminate such behavior, the following is necessary:

Increase salaries to ensure a stable daily life so that they will not seek unexpected wealth and will be content to do their duty.

Provide all police officers with moral training, emphasizing the importance of serving society. They must use persuasive methods towards the people, fostering goodwill and cooperation.

Eliminate those with outdated mindsets, violent and unreasonable behaviors, as well as the elderly and useless ones. Recruit young, strong individuals who have received adequate education as qualified candidates, or establish police academies. If there is a shortage of police officers, the academy should be responsible for filling the positions.

Impose severe punishments immediately for any illegal conduct.

Incorporate public opinion. If there are reports or other information that is verified, immediately dismiss and investigate the individuals involved.

Assign undercover inspectors to investigate police duties and report daily to determine rewards and punishments. I wonder if the authorities consider the above points to be good? (Ye Renzhen)

### Promoting the "Respect Teachers Fund" Movement

— Jian Jun

September 28th is "Teachers' Day." It can indeed be said to be a form of respect and enthusiasm for teachers. However, I believe that in these difficult times of hardship, in addition to giving them spiritual comfort, there should be more proactive actions to genuinely express the concern of students towards them. This is why I want to advocate for a "Respect Teachers Fund" movement.

I believe that the contribution to the "Respect Teachers Fund" should be initiated by the students themselves, completely out of sincerity and voluntariness. They should ideally take a portion or all of their usual savings from candy expenses or entertainment expenses to give the teachers some comfort. Although, in reality, perhaps some people no longer have the ability to save due to their unstable living conditions, I believe this is only a small minority. Even if they don't have savings, I believe that if they are truly willing to earnestly contribute for their teachers, they will definitely find a way. They can very well solicit donations from relatives and friends.

As for the method and procedure of presentation, I believe the best way is for each student to hand over the funds they have donated for the teachers to the school's administrative office for safekeeping. This is because, on the one hand, it can avoid the trouble of refusal or acceptance, and on the other hand, it can avoid the problem of "inequality." If this movement can proceed smoothly, I believe that although teachers cannot be said to "benefit greatly," they can at least say that it is "not without some benefit."
