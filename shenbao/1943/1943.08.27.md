### Buying Up and Distributing Simultaneously

Master Zhu once said, "It is appropriate to prepare for rain before it comes; do not dig a well only when thirsty." Managing a household requires this, and managing a country even more so. "Preparing for rain before it comes" is a proactive arrangement, which is "preventing problems before they arise." "Digging a well only when thirsty" is a passive remedy after the fact. It is better to have a proactive arrangement than a passive remedy. Of course, we are not saying that remedies after the fact are unnecessary. However, comparatively, proactive arrangements are the best policy, remedies after the fact are a middle policy, and failing to make proactive arrangements or know how to remedy after the fact is the worst policy.

All of a country's political and economic measures, especially economic measures, are always related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, and therefore require proactive arrangements. First, determine the policy, then deliberate on the plan, and then implement it step by step. The determination of policies and plans must be carefully considered, imagining possible developments from multiple perspectives and applying appropriate arrangements, striving for thoroughness and precision without any loopholes, and then cooperating with faithful implementation and strict assessment. Then the plan will be completed and the policy will be realized without any doubt. Therefore, the government should engage more in proactive arrangements for political and economic measures, especially economic ones. If proactive arrangements are perfect, there will be no need for passive remedies. Because remedies and adjustments are, after all, a middle policy, and the government and the people will inevitably suffer losses as a result.

Let's take a recent example, such as the government's purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. If the government could have predicted its possible development a year ago and made appropriate arrangements, then the repercussions from all sides would certainly not have been as shocking as they are today, a year later. Of course, we are by no means saying that the government's purchase of yarn and cloth this time is not normal. On the contrary, we support the government's adoption of this passive, middle policy after losing the opportunity for a proactive, best policy. At the same time, we further argue that the government should pay attention to the repercussions from all sides after the purchase of yarn and cloth and make appropriate arrangements. Because if proactive arrangements are not made today, even if passive remedies can be made in the future, the result will be that the government and the people will suffer losses again, and repeat the current mistakes. This should be taken as a serious warning.

The purpose of this purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth is to crack down on hoarding, suppress prices, and ultimately stabilize the people's livelihood. This has already been stated clearly in the government's statement. From a theoretical point of view, we, standing from the people's position, can naturally trust the government; however, in reality, we cannot help but expect the government to pay close attention to the repercussions it has caused in society. First, will the production of cotton yarn and cotton cloth by textile factories be stopped as a result? Second, if textile factories continue to produce, will the cumulative cost plus legitimate profit of their raw materials, wages, and all expenses be in line with the official purchase price? Third, due to the negative impact of past imprudent pledges, the financial industry is deeply wary, and will the resulting credit crunch prevent other production enterprises from raising and using funds, indirectly leading to a reduction in production? Fourth, since the purpose of purchasing yarn and cloth is to crack down on hoarding and stabilize the people's livelihood, how should a reasonable distribution be planned? How can the interests of the people be shared equally? This is what everyone urgently expects. The first three points are a source of deep concern for those who have always been concerned about national economic construction and wartime production increases, or those who are directly related to industrial production. What they are worried about is certainly not the blow to those who hoard cotton yarn and cotton cloth, nor that the purchase of yarn and cloth will lead to the shrinking of production enterprises. What they are worried about is whether the government can make proactive arrangements for the repercussions caused by the purchase of yarn and cloth, instead of waiting for the facts of the repercussions to develop before making passive remedies. The last point is especially what all the people are eagerly awaiting to be realized as soon as possible.

Here, we offer our humble opinions without hesitating to assist in planning. First, yarn and cloth are daily necessities for the people's livelihood. Not only must textile factories not be allowed to stop production, but they must also be urged to increase production. The more the output, the easier the circulation, and the prices will be stable without suppression. The government has a responsibility to properly plan and fully assist in the procurement of raw materials, the supply of power, the improvement of transportation, etc. Second, since the government has already stipulated the official purchase price, the raw materials of textile factories must also be appropriately priced at the same time, so that the total cumulative amount of raw material costs, processing wages, all expenses, and legitimate profits is consistent with the official purchase price. If the total cost is higher than the official purchase price, it will be a loss for the factory, then this loss should be borne or subsidized by the government. If the price of raw materials is constrained by general prices and cannot be obtained at the official price, the government should purchase them and then supply them to the factories at the official price. Third, the credit crunch in the financial industry is not to be criticized for its own business prudence, but it is difficult for production enterprises that need funds to raise them. In this case, the national bank should provide appropriate assistance to the interbank call money market, and the financial industry should focus on strict investigation and prudent lending, without abandoning food because of choking, and imposing a uniform credit crunch. Fourth, the government's purpose in purchasing yarn and cloth is not to hold yarn and cloth, but to distribute yarn and cloth. ××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××××Therefore, how to distribute them as soon as possible should be planned at the same time as how to purchase them. It is advisable to buy and distribute simultaneously to strengthen the people's faith and to practice the purpose of stabilizing the people's livelihood.

Shanghai is the center of China's economy, and its trends and successes or failures have a significant impact on the national economy, so it should be used flexibly at any time. Flexible use is a proactive arrangement, which is entirely the responsibility of the authorities. However, when it comes to economic issues, especially the impact of the purchase of yarn and cloth on the economic sector, it is impossible not to mention food and prices. We have discussed it several times. If the food problem cannot be solved, the entire price problem cannot be solved. At the same time, the official price standard for the purchase of yarn and cloth cannot be linked to food prices and prices. If the official price of yarn and cloth is not linked to food prices and prices for one day, then the social economy and the people's economic life will be in a state of chaos and alienation for one day. In this case, to advocate the stabilization of the people's lives and Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, we have not seen any real consequences!

### The Tragedy of Pearl Harbor

On the day the Greater East Asia War broke out, the American fleet at Pearl Harbor was severely damaged by the Japanese air force. The American magazine "Life" (published on June 14), which recently arrived in the Argentine capital, published photos of "The Salvage Operation at Pearl Harbor," with the following description:

"Of the nineteen warships damaged on that fateful day, fourteen have already been repaired and are sailing the seas under their own power. The remaining five, the battleships Arizona and Oklahoma, and the target ship Utah, are currently being salvaged. The economic value of the other two, the destroyers Cassin and Downes, cannot be exploited anymore. However, more than half of their equipment will be used to build new ships. Currently, one-third of the bottom of the Oklahoma is visible above the sea, tilted at a 30-degree angle. In the salvage operation, a model of the ship is first created, exactly the same as the sunk ship. After divers study this model, they dive into the sea and seal the rooms below the deck. Then, iron bars are tied to the ship's body, and the 29,000-ton Oklahoma is slowly lifted upright using a facility on Ford Island. Next, workers dismantle all removable objects, similar to those on the battleships Nevada, West Virginia, California, and transfer them to other ships. The ship's hull and other shattered parts are completely blocked, allowing the ship to float on the surface and be towed to the canal." (Xiang: Translated from the Western Tomorrow Newspaper, August 21)

### For the Interests of the Fatherland, Italy Decides to Continue the War and Wait Patiently for Future Developments

Complete Restoration Through Internal Reform

Rome, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) A month has passed since the fall of the Fascists in Italy.

Now, the responsibility of the Italian people is to cooperate with the government to avoid the country from falling into chaos. The internal endurance of the Italian people is extraordinarily abundant and will contribute to the country, it was stated.

### Berlin Authorities Comment on the Quebec Conference Communiqué

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) German diplomatic authorities issued the following comments on the Quebec Conference: The content released at this conference was even more lacking than the Casablanca Conference or the Washington Conference. It is feared that there are not many results. Because the conference period was quite long, it can be seen that the opinions between Britain and the United States are not necessarily consistent. Although Roosevelt wanted to secure the presidential position in next year's election, Churchill still insisted on the Europe First doctrine. Considering the Soviet Union's request to form a second front, he may still maintain the Europe First doctrine in the future. Roosevelt explained that the war against Japan would be a long-term war, but he intended to decide it in the short term. However, in any case, the United States cannot implement its claims, and the result is only to take a compromise approach. First, launch a short-term and powerful offensive in Europe, and then turn to a general counteroffensive in the Pacific. The British and American representatives have different opinions on the counteroffensive operations in Europe. When to start the general offensive must be decided at the next conference. In addition, the anti-Axis camp is afraid that the Soviet Union will break out in Central Europe. It will observe the Soviet Union's intentions and stop the offensive against Europe to a certain extent in order to seek a final solution in a political direction. Regarding the political issues in Europe, the British and American countries were embarrassed by the Soviet Union's tough demands and called for focusing on the Pacific theater. Therefore, the results of this conference are still nothing more than a bluff.

### Rome is Undefended: In Negotiations

Therefore, Muti was arrested near Fregene on the night of August 20. When the police were escorting Muti back to camp, someone opened fire on the escorting police officers in the forest. Muti took advantage of the chaos to escape, but was chased and shot dead by the police."

### Attending the Canadian Parliament, Roosevelt's Speech Consisted Entirely of Flattery to Canadians

Buenos Aires, 26th (Central News Agency) - President Roosevelt attended the Canadian Parliament at 1:00 PM on the 25th and gave a speech on the so-called establishment of the Four Freedoms. The content of the speech consisted entirely of flattering Canadians and a self-consoling idealism of slandering totalitarianism, full of deceptive color. He said, "Five years ago, I visited your country. At that time, it was one year before the German army entered Poland and three years before the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor. I said that we cannot but be concerned about disputes outside the Americas, and the American continent has felt the threat. Today, the vast military resources, commercial power, and human resources of the Americas have been formed as necessary elements for the peace of the Americas and the world," and so on. Roosevelt also used a so-called non-belligerent attitude to conceal the fact that he had been engaged in war activities against Germany and Italy since the beginning of the European War and that "before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he prohibited the export of all materials to Japan, and then openly launched an economic war against Japan with the so-called capital freezing order." Regarding the results of the Quebec meeting, he only said that they had discussed the common goals of the war and the realization of victory in the short term.

### North China New People's Society Launches New National Movement

The North China New People's Society plans to launch a new national movement throughout North China from the 25th of this month to the end of October as the first phase, and from November 1st to January 9th next year as the second phase, to advance towards the four major goals of completing the suppression of communists and building the country, increasing production to save the people, rectifying thought, and reforming life. The key points of its implementation are as follows:

Suppress Communists and Build the Country

Based on the independent stance of building the country, thoroughly suppress the communists, and use the awareness of building the country to overcome the communist party's party consciousness, class consciousness, and inappropriate national consciousness. At the same time, based on this stance, actively develop the society's performance, use thought to deal with thought, use organization to deal with organization, and use strength to deal with strength, to completely eradicate the communist disaster.

To implement the suppression of communists, it is necessary to carry out a political and ideological struggle against the communists, and first of all, strengthen the subjective awareness of building the country. The method of promotion is to take counties and cities as units and strive to carry out rural construction. In order to strengthen the New National Movement's camp and promote the task of suppressing communists and building the country, implement special training for government officials, teachers, branch chiefs, baojia chiefs, youth groups, self-defense corps, and other workers in various departments, and continue the three-clean movement of cleaning the countryside, cleaning the government, and cleaning up drugs. The New People's Society will first take the lead in practicing this, in order to actively develop it. In order to strengthen the New People's Society's camp during this period, and to re-launch the New People's Society's movement, increase the number of branches, develop local work by peripheral mass organizations, and organize an anti-communist grand alliance to strengthen the anti-communist function, unify the guidance of youth and women's movements, operate committees at all levels, and popularize self-defense work to make it an elite organization of the New People's Society movement, and strengthen the training and organization of New People's Work Pioneers, increase the rural information network, and maintain close contact with the government, security forces, anti-communist committees, road protection work, cooperatives, labor organizations, etc., to give full play to organic operation.

Increase Production to Save the People

Plan to ensure increased agricultural production and low-price policies, support the government's food policy, eliminate improper acts, and reduce losses for producers and consumers. Pay special attention to the revitalization of rural areas and the return of farmers to their hometowns, and move towards rural construction and the establishment of a new economic system.

The method of implementation is to mobilize organizations and groups at all levels to lead the masses to cooperate with the food policy, and smoothly and reasonably solve the problems of purchase prices, circulation, and distribution from production to consumption. Give full play to the power of mass organizations, enlighten representatives of joint councils and various groups in various places, and automatically organize "National Production Increase and People's Saving Movement Cooperation Committees" to clarify the actual situation of improper acts such as extortion, embezzlement, speculation, manipulation, and hoarding, discuss the situation of food purchase work, and the impact after the implementation of the policy, and gradually improve it.

### Reorganization of Baojia in Various Districts to be Completed Before the End of the Month

The Municipal Baojia Committee believes that the selection of Baojia organizations in various districts is crucial to local security. To prevent cunning villagers from mixing into various districts, it has already issued a notice to the offices in various districts and special districts, requiring them to reorganize the Baojia in their respective districts and set a deadline for completion by the end of this month. As the deadline is approaching, it has again issued a reminder to the Baojia offices in various districts to complete the work on time and not to delay it any further.

### Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Progresses Smoothly

Allocation Plan Still Being Drafted

Since the National Commercial Control Association's office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth issued its first announcement and began implementing the purchase work on August 23rd, and handled supplementary registrations, cotton yarn and cloth merchants have enthusiastically applied to the office to sell their goods and complete supplementary registration procedures. It is understood that the deadline for applications and supplementary registrations is set for September 6th and will not be extended again. Those who miss the deadline will be handled according to the regulations.

Full Allocation to Shops and Factories

Shanghai News Agency reports: According to the purchase method, yarn and cloth retailers and manufacturers are only allowed to retain one month's worth of retail stock or required quantity. The rest must be sold by application. Therefore, in the past week or so, cotton cloth stores and others competed to sell registered and unregistered goods beyond the allowed limit, leading to a drop in market prices. On the manufacturing side, factories inevitably had to sell yarn and cloth beyond the legal limit. However, there were concerns about the factories' own production. However, according to reporter inquiries, once the allocation plan under consideration is implemented, it will be sufficient to ensure that factories maintain a continuous supply of raw materials and shops obtain sufficient cloth to allocate to citizens. As for the allocation plan, it is still being drafted.

No Problems with Raw Materials for Weaving Factories

Commercial News Agency reports: The government's regulations on purchasing yarn and cloth stipulate that the raw material inventory of yarn factories and textile factories must not exceed one month's worth of needs. People in the textile industry in the city believe that after the one-month supply is used up, it is uncertain whether they will be able to obtain a large amount of raw materials, which may affect production. According to a related person, the authorities have a comprehensive plan for purchasing yarn and cloth and allocating it in the future. The raw materials needed by yarn factories and textile factories will be fully allocated. If not, the original intention of purchasing yarn and cloth will be lost. The reason why the authorities have taken such measures for yarn and cloth is to adjust the proper relationship between production and consumption. The government allocates raw materials to various factories, and all of its finished products are allocated to legitimate users. In this way, materials can be circulated, prices will not skyrocket, and unscrupulous merchants will not be able to use their skills. Therefore, people in the textile industry do not need to worry about the raw material problem. Not only that, the authorities will also devise methods to enable various factories to increase production to meet wartime needs. As for the concrete plan for implementing the allocation, the authorities are carefully drafting it.

Actively Purchase Cotton to Adjust Prices

The Cotton Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association is currently purchasing cotton in large quantities from various producing areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. This year's new cotton has already entered the market. In order to make farmers willing to sell, the committee plans to appropriately increase the purchase price to facilitate the smooth progress of the purchase work. The cotton purchasing work has been extremely tense, and it is said that a considerable quantity has been received.

Plan Uses for Allocated Yarn and Cloth

Dawei News Agency reports: According to the Wu Shi Times, the National Commercial Control Association has been proceeding smoothly with the work of purchasing yarn and cloth. Once the purchase is completed, a per capita allocation will be implemented. According to official predictions, the purchase work will be completed around the end of September. The Chinese and Japanese authorities are paying close attention to the allocation of the purchased yarn and cloth. The allocation methods for these yarn and cloth will include transporting them to other areas of China and allocating them locally in Central China. The latter will have an important practical significance for controlling commodity prices in Shanghai and Central China. Shanghai will use yarn and cloth to purchase agricultural products from various places. These agricultural products can be controlled by the authorities, and various places in Central China can obtain yarn and cloth at lower prices. At the same time, it is also learned that the National Commercial Control Association has been preparing a yarn allocation system in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai.

### Food Supply Issues Being Studied and Improved; August Rice Still Being Prepared for Transport

Central News Agency Shanghai: The food problem in Shanghai is now being taken very seriously by the five million citizens. However, due to the recovery period of the two concessions, the new and old police forces of the food distribution agency are being replaced, and there is inevitably some delay in various procedures such as procurement, transportation, and distribution. The reason for the delayed distribution of the 45th installment of household rice in the first and eighth districts is this. The Central News Agency reporter visited the United Rice Grain Association, which is responsible for procurement and transportation. According to them, the Rice Department has purchased rice from rice-producing areas. Of the 150,000 bags assigned in July, personnel have been sent to Suzhou, Changzhou, Songjiang, and Yangzhou to transport them to Shanghai. The remaining 10,000 bags will also be transported to Shanghai. The 150,000 bags assigned in August are still being prepared and personnel will be sent to transport them to Shanghai soon. However, in order to meet the urgent needs of the people for food, this transportation procedure will be more efficient than the last time. At the same time, the relevant authorities are studying and gradually improving the food supply to the people every day, and making every effort to purchase and fully allocate to meet the needs of the people. As for the general citizens of the city, they hope that the Rice Department will instruct the United Rice Grain Association to transport the rice assigned in August to Shanghai and distribute it as soon as possible.

Flour Sales Slips Issued in Advance

According to a reporter from Da Tong News Agency, the Rice and Flour Procurement Section, in view of the slow transportation mechanism of the national rice, has issued the flour sales slips for the 46th installment in advance, so that they can be issued on September 1st as scheduled. The number of household flour for the 46th installment will be officially announced in a bulletin.

21st Installment of Rice for Sale in Nanshi

Regarding the 21st installment of rice for sale in the city area, it has been sold to the public starting yesterday. Each person can purchase 1.5 liters of rice from the designated public office with the rice ticket for this installment, costing 9 yuan in Central Reserve Coupons. The 22nd installment of rice will be opened for sale immediately.

No Solicitation Should be Required for Flour Extraction

The Rice and Flour Procurement Section of the First District Office issued a notice yesterday: When flour users collect flour from warehouses or flour mills, they should not pay extra porterage fees, and warehouses or flour mills should not solicit them.

### Prices Trend Downward

As a result of the effective measures taken by the authorities to control prices, commodity prices in this city, except for food, have recently shown a downward trend. The various department stores in this city have reduced the prices of goods in their stores in recent days due to the strict maintenance of previous prices by the municipal authorities and the impact of the investigation of national reserves. Therefore, there are more residents purchasing goods than before. However, it is generally expected that these goods will fall further, because hoarders are releasing their stockpiles, and the general residents do not consider these goods to be necessary during the emergency period. As for daily necessities, such as matches and soap, their prices have also fallen due to the news that they will be distributed on a household basis. In addition to matches and soap, which are expected to be distributed starting next month, other daily necessities may also be subject to a similar system.

### Meat and Egg Prices to be Determined

Da Tong News Agency says: According to the Wu Shi Times, the authorities are now planning to take action against the unreasonable rise in food prices in the Shanghai area recently, which will be particularly gratifying to housewives. Investigators from the Materials Investigation Committee and other government groups will begin to study and determine the prices of meat and eggs. These two major foods have sharply increased prices in Shanghai, disregarding the decline in vegetable prices and other foods. It is understood that the number of personnel investigating these goods has fortunately increased from 60 to 100 people.

Coal Briquette Raw Materials Allocated on Schedule

Sources from the Shanghai Social News Agency have learned that recently, various mechanical coal briquette factories have received increased supplies of raw materials (coal dust) from relevant authorities on schedule. As a result, the production of these factories has returned to normal. However, the consumption of coal briquettes is comparable to previous levels, so the production volume and consumption rate have reached equilibrium. Retail merchants can obtain sufficient credit and sell at their storefronts. It is reported that the manufacturing cost for each factory remains the same as before, and the standard fixed price of 32.5 yuan per dan (a unit of weight) is expected to remain in effect for the long term without changes.

Economy

### Commentary: After the Flow of Materials

After discussing the promotion of material exchange in the previous article, including purchasing, allocation, and production, what are the natural consequences after [terms illegible]?

The two sentences spoken by Mr. Oka [name illegible], Minister of the Japanese Embassy, can be said to be the best answer. He said: "Because in the past, the distribution of materials to farmers in Shanghai was not smooth, we are paying special attention to this point this time, and studying how to directly allocate to farmers. If this method is successful, the farmers will have obtained cheap cotton cloth, and will naturally sell agricultural products at low prices; the purpose of material exchange will be achieved at this point."

The so-called purpose of material exchange is to enable society and humanity to exchange what they have and make up for what they lack. If everyone can use what they have in abundance to supplement what they lack, then prices and people's livelihood will be reasonably resolved at the same time. For example, with cotton, cotton is grown by farmers and cotton cloth is made by factories. If cotton cloth can be allocated to farmers at low prices, and the purchase price of raw cotton is also appropriately increased to guarantee their livelihoods, then farmers will not only be happy to supply their cotton to factories at low prices, but also be happy to sell other agricultural products such as rice, wheat, vegetables, and fruits in large quantities to the city, thus solving the current panic of high food prices in urban areas. At the same time, the 1,395,664 spindles and 16,675 looms of Shanghai's Chinese-owned cotton mills will also become active one by one due to the solution of the raw material problem, creating a prosperous wartime economy!

### Trade Associations Set Adjustment Methods for Fixed Prices, Strictly Prohibiting Alteration of Grades for Profiteering

The city's overall price control bureau has gradually entered a normal state. The major fluctuations of the past few days have returned to silence. This is because the authorities have achieved results in their thorough investigation work. Speculators are deeply threatened and unable to operate. To prevent domestically produced goods from being smuggled out of the country or hidden elsewhere, in addition to strictly ordering that all transfers of materials must apply for a transport permit, they are also strictly monitoring the carrying of whole batches or small amounts of materials. It was learned yesterday that each trade association is [illegible] to stabilize the market and stabilize prices, and will devise methods to adjust the fixed prices that were assessed in the past. The specific regulations are as follows:

Wholesalers of designated commodities should sell current goods to retailers in the same industry, and refuse to sell to outsiders and merchants outside the industry. Retailers should mark the price of each item sold and issue sales invoices. All markets must not engage in illegal short selling, and all spot transactions are limited to merchants in the relevant industry. In the event of a shortage of goods, they must not take advantage of the situation to hoard goods, raise prices, or alter grades, or engage in any other improper conduct. All factories, companies, and businesses must join the trade association. Non-members are not allowed to engage in the buying and selling of relevant commodities. For items that have been assessed with fixed prices, both wholesalers and retailers must buy and sell in accordance with the assessed fixed prices and must not deliberately violate [regulations]. If a price change is desired due to cost factors, the trade association should forward the request to the authorities for verification and approval. The trade association will notify the change after approval, otherwise it will be regarded as an illegal price increase and severely punished according to law. The trade associations have already notified all member businesses accordingly.

Since the first half of this year, [illegible] prices [illegible]. A certain company was once [illegible] by the authorities and financial groups. [Illegible] was once suspended. [Illegible] Prices are still [illegible]. After that, the authorities [illegible] stock trading. One district [illegible] various management methods [illegible]. How the future develops is being carefully watched by all parties. The current reality of the stock market is also what the industrial and commercial circles in this city urgently need to understand. A description of the current situation is as follows:

Stock Trading

According to an authority in the economic world, stock trading is a legal commercial behavior, and the rise in stock prices indicates that there are people who are interested in investing in enterprises, therefore, the general public believes that the rise in stock prices is not a bad thing. However, of course, the rise has a limit. In other words, there should not be a feverish surge in the stock market, otherwise, the impact will not only fuel speculation but also harm industrial and commercial enterprises. In the past, stock trading was not limited to purely spot trading, which made it easier for speculative merchants to take advantage of the situation. Since the authorities issued an order restricting stock trading to spot trading only, this crisis can be avoided, and the price of a certain stock will not rise above the stock's actual value. Therefore, the rise in stock prices can provide a haven for floating capital and should not affect general prices.

Future Stock Market

In addition, the reason for the previous stock market was that the authorities strictly cracked down on national [illegible] and [illegible]. People no longer dared to engage in hoarding and trading, and since stocks were a legal transaction, they competed to purchase them. Therefore, the sharp rise in the stock market was inevitable. At this time, the prices of other goods fell due to the government authorities' stringent price controls. The stock market was appropriately selected. It can be seen that the high stock prices have no direct relationship with price fluctuations. Later, news of the government's purchase of yarn came, and the entire market was shaken. People became anxious and competed to sell, so the stock market crashed, which was also a natural phenomenon. But today, the stock market has stopped falling under the revival of the buying trend [illegible]. In the future, the stock market will no longer show a volatile phenomenon.

### "Wartime World Women" Symposium (2)

Profound British Mobilization Status

Bu Bu: The British Minister of Food is frantically promoting the avoidance of food waste. Britain has already started using pre-war food reserves. Four months after the start of the war, the authorities implemented food rationing. Meat and vegetables are not easy to buy, and the taste of fruit has long been forgotten. In this difficult environment, housewives are still working without the slightest complaint. They had enough of the last war, so they were already aware of this war from the beginning. Young women have all been assigned to occupational sectors. Most of those staying at home are elderly people, mothers with children, students, and patients. The most thorough and profound mobilization of women can be said to be in Britain!

London Filled with Female Soldiers

Question: It is said that Britain already has female soldiers. Please explain the actual situation of mobilization in detail:

Bu Bu: Britain began to slightly employ women from February of last year. Their age has gradually decreased. Now, women aged eighteen to forty-two, even if married, are subject to conscription if they have no young children. Unmarried women are even more so. The women's auxiliary units of the army, navy, and air force alone have 500,000 female soldiers. This is a unit entirely composed of women, performing communication, liaison, sanitation, and anti-aircraft gun duties in the country. Dressed in men's trousers uniforms and riding military bicycles, they are indeed extraordinarily handsome. Most of the female soldiers are from good families. The army's uniform is brownish-yellow and not very attractive, so there were very few volunteers at first. Then, the Minister of Labor spread the word that women would soon be subjected to forced labor, which is a very hard job. However, if they can join the army now, they won't have to work as laborers later. This propaganda worked greatly, and ladies of the upper class competed to join the army. Now, this brownish-yellow uniform simply fills the entire city of London.

Kondo: The United States is also generally similar to Britain. The army, navy, and air force employ female units. The army has 150,000, and a bill to increase it to 375,000 has recently been proposed. The navy has only 20,000, serving as coastal guard units, riding small motorboats, and monitoring submarines and aircraft. They mainly serve in the rear, acting as nurses or telephone operators, to assist the army in principle. Recently, it is said that a law appointing female doctors as military doctors has been passed.

Wartime Consciousness of American Women

Teranishi: People generally think that American women are frivolous and hopelessly extravagant, but in reality, they are unexpectedly good wives and mothers. Readers of magazines often discuss the unique worries of women.

Question: What is the wartime consciousness of American women?

Teranishi: American women have very low levels of education and know almost nothing. They only began to frantically study Japan after hearing about the attack on Pearl Harbor.

When the Japanese were preparing to expel the English language, the United States was enthusiastically studying Japanese. Hatred is therefore very deep. When four thousand professional women in New York were asked about their desire to serve in the air force, the first place was military service, and the second place was nursing. As a result of the rapid development of military production, mines that had always prohibited female labor have also lifted this ban. Recently, the increasingly powerful female laborers are said to have raised demands for material goods.

Kondo: The nature of American women has undergone significant changes compared to the last war. Originally, American citizens inherited the blood of pioneer ancestors and had a down-to-earth enterprising spirit. However, the development of material civilization has promoted their habits of enjoyment, reaching its peak in the early 20th century. The disorder of male-female relationships and the increase in divorce cases all occurred among people who grew up at that time. Although the current young women appear frivolous, they are actually very thoughtful.

Question: The United States has always been a country with many working women. How many women are currently working in the professional world?

Kondo: In the United States, there are about 50 million women over the age of fourteen. 17.2 million women work in companies, factories, and farms. There are also about 4 million working in military factories, and 3 million more are expected to be mobilized to the military industry this year.

Female Foremen Commanding Strong Men

Question: The number of female laborers must also be very high in the Soviet Union?

Ogata: The Soviet constitution states that women are equal to men in economic, cultural, and social terms, so there is no job that women cannot do. Railway porters are also women. They have bodies as strong as men, so it is no effort for them to lift heavy goods. The common Japanese concept of women does not apply here at all. This is simply the centralization or even masculinization of women, but in our eyes, Japanese women are still better. However, this is all due to the needs of wartime. The number of female laborers is increasing year by year. In 1929, the ratio of female laborers to the total number of laborers was 27.2%. In 1939, ten years after the implementation of the plan, this ratio had risen to 41.6%. Women are also drivers of farm tractors, and there are quite a few female foremen who command male workers.

Question: What about in terms of politics and military equipment?

Ogata: In the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, female representatives in the Union Council and female representatives in the Council of Nationalities each account for about 20% of the total.

Question: In order to mobilize women, population policy has to be temporarily shelved. So, what has become of the lending of funds for actively encouraging marriage?

Kichiura: In Italy, husbands who have Italian citizenship, are not over twenty-six years old, and have an annual income of less than 12,000 lira, are eligible for a marriage loan. Interest of one percent is paid half a year after marriage, but if the wife becomes pregnant five months after marriage, repayment can be postponed until one and a half years later. If there are no children four years after marriage, the interest will be two percent. The birth of the first child can reduce the total amount by 10%, the birth of the second child can reduce it by 20%, and the birth of the third child can reduce it by 30%. If a fourth child is born, the entire amount does not have to be repaid. Families with many children also have preferential treatment regarding schools and other matters.

Question: Are there any institutions that protect mothers and children?

Kichiura: Italy has state-run institutions for the protection of mothers and young children, mainly targeting poor mothers and children and abandoned children. The nursery I visited in Rome was extremely grand, and the children inside were better nourished and fatter than the children of ordinary citizens. There are also many free obstetrical hospitals. The funds are quite large, all maintained by government donations and high bachelor taxes. In addition, the nurseries also take Italian children living in the outskirts to the coast for summer vacation so that they do not forget their lovely motherland, truly doing everything possible to be thorough.

Question: What about in Britain?

Bu Bu: The intellectual class believes that in the current world, even if many children are raised, there is no hope for them to become rich and live a more prosperous life than themselves. Rather than doing that, it is better to raise one child and raise him healthily. Therefore, even if there is encouragement, the population does not multiply. Hedonism and the pain of unemployment are already too profound.

German Protective Garrison System

I: Because there are too many women in France, they cannot marry without a dowry, so parents save money for their daughters' marriage, and daughters from poor families save money through their own work to prepare for marriage. Because there are many children in France, property must be divided equally, so people are unwilling to raise children. Therefore, the French civil law must be changed.

Kouchi: Germany also largely adopts the same population policy as Italy, with a marriage loan system. If five children are raised, it does not have to be repaid. I went to visit the famous "Mother's Paradise." Mothers who are liberated from household chores sleep comfortably during their midday nap in a comfortable style established in a scenic place, or do sports as if returning to their childhood years. Constantly doing endless housework, housewives feel great fatigue in their nerves and bodies. This kind of recuperation is really needed. During their time away from home, the housework and childcare are taken care of by members of the women's organization without worry.

Question: What is the work of this women's organization like?

Beruga: The women's organization is really doing a lot of work. Daycare centers are run by women's groups, and in the markets, women's groups also have special rooms, teaching cooking methods and serving as consultants for family troubles. The child protection department is always ready to help families in need. One is the organization of the Baojia system, with sixty-five families as a group and ten groups as a unit. A leader is placed here. The leader visits the families in the group at any time, inspects the family's situation, and sees which family needs help. The biggest service is at the train station, taking care of refugees fleeing from the war zone. The female youth group rotates day and night for twenty-four hours of service.

Soviet Divorce and Marriage

Question: What is the population problem in the Soviet Union like?

Ogata: In the past, marriage and divorce in the Soviet Union were very easy. One could file for divorce by paying five rubles, and even abortion was allowed. This provision, drafted from the standpoint of liberating women, was abused by many, so the authorities revised it in 1936. Now, they have changed and are encouraging childbirth, and divorce has become difficult.

Question: Finally, let's change the topic. In the enemy's British and American air defense systems, are they, like Japan, centered on housewives in the Baojia system, each guarding their own home?

Bu Bu: As I said just now, the air defense monitors and anti-aircraft gunners in Britain are all women, and air defense units are also formed in the homes, with responsible persons. Each family has one person sitting by the window every night, watching and reporting immediately when incendiary bombs are dropped.

Kondo: The United States has organizations of civilian defense groups all over the country. This is a government agency, with the First Lady serving as an advisor. Women participate in the air defense monitoring team. There was a time when it was criticized as a toy for idle-class wives, which forced Mrs. Roosevelt to withdraw. After reorganization, it is now headed by Landis, the former president of Harvard University. Women also serve in important departments. But they always cannot get rid of the American-style chaotic temperament. It is questionable how much activity they can actually do in actual combat. Due to the lack of materials and other circumstances, the general public seems to deeply feel the need for unity and hard work, so they should not be underestimated.
