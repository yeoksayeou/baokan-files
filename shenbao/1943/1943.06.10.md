### Two Major Avenues for Idle Capital Outlets

Since the Sino-Japanese Incident, funds from various regions have flocked to Shanghai, forming the largest pool of idle capital in the country. Naturally, this accumulated idle capital is not content to remain stagnant and seeks outlets at all times. Initially, the purpose of these outlets was to ensure the safety of their own funds and obtain modest profits, such as depositing funds in banks to earn interest or engaging in small-scale commercial operations. Later, as idle capital accumulated further and the desire for profit grew without limit, there was a gradual attempt to obtain exorbitant profits. Consequently, there was a tendency toward speculation in foreign exchange hedging and even hoarding for manipulation. If one person profited, everyone followed suit. As idle capital became more rampant, speculative activities flourished, leading to a chaotic market, distorted prosperity, and soaring prices, benefiting a few while causing suffering to the majority.

Looking back at Shanghai society in recent years, which has also significantly influenced various parts of the country, the free flow of rampant idle capital, unable to find a normal channel of destination, has stirred up a storm, leaving no peaceful day. After reflecting on the pain, the question of how to formulate effective countermeasures for absorption in the future relies on the government's overall leadership from above, the full cooperation of all sectors of society, especially the economic sector, and the unified support of the masses, working together to ensure that idle capital not only does not cause harm like floods and fierce beasts but is also utilized as a vital force for industrial revival. This responsibility cannot be shirked by the government and the people but must be shouldered together to promote progress.

In the past few years, due to the complexity of the environment and the ever-changing situation, idle capital, being the most sensitive, surveyed the landscape and found no reliable and permanent destination. Therefore, it adopted a strategy of wandering and seeking profits, taking a chance for a while. This fact has its objective factors that contributed to it. Today, the situation is generally determined and not prone to unpredictable changes, and the environment is also free of complex phenomena. Therefore, those who hold idle capital must recognize this fact and abandon the concept of hoarding goods for exorbitant profits. Because this approach, the "golden age" has passed, and even if you hoard, there will never be exorbitant profits to be gained again. Moreover, the government has explicitly prohibited it, and materials are under strict control. Why willingly risk breaking the law and engaging in risky ventures for "things beyond what is needed for life"? Why be happy alone while others suffer? Society will one day be stable, and the country will one day be revived. Why should I be a sinner in stability and revival! Perhaps some hold the view that even if I don't do it, others will still do it, and it's all in vain. This view is most undesirable. Once this view is held, there is no hope for improvement in anything, and all evils arise from this. The reason why our national affairs are so chaotic is that there are many compatriots who hold this view, which is truly lamentable! Therefore, we hope that holders of idle capital—including individuals and organizations—will henceforth use their funds in legitimate ways, lower their desire for profit, and raise their awareness of the country and society. Only when the country is revived can your funds truly be guaranteed and enjoyed; otherwise, when the nest is overturned, there will be no intact eggs. What good is a rolling fortune?

It seems that we have said a lot of empty words above. In fact, we believe that only by establishing a strong and correct foundation in everyone's mind can we achieve things that are not only for personal gain but also for the benefit of the country and society. Here, we present two major avenues for idle capital:

First, invest in national bonds, such as bonds, lottery tickets, and savings bonds issued by the state. When the state levies fees from the people for legitimate needs, the people have an absolute obligation to subscribe. On the one hand, the government should carefully consider the legitimacy of the use and the guarantee of benefits beforehand, and once a decision is made, the people should enthusiastically follow suit. For example, the welfare lottery tickets and food warehouse receipts recently issued by the government are intended to encourage people to save, allowing currency to flow back, control inflation, and indirectly suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Since the government considers the people, the people should support the government. Moreover, national savings are a powerful pillar for the country to adjust its finances. The country with the highest national savings rate in the world is the country with the highest patriotic sentiment among its citizens and the country with the easiest ability to exert united strength. Although the profit from savings is not as high as speculation, the interests of the country are greater than the interests of individuals. Therefore, we hope that holders of idle capital will invest as much as possible in national bonds.

Second, invest in productive enterprises. The scope of productive enterprises is quite broad, with types such as agriculture, industry, and mining, and natures such as state-owned, public-owned, and private-owned, but all fall within the scope of the country's economic construction. In this regard, we believe that the government should have an overall economic construction plan, categorized and organized by time and location. The National Economic Commission should have this responsibility. On the one hand, it turns a blind eye and allows idle capital to flow into speculation and curses it; on the other hand, it fails to plan channels for its destination. This blame should not be shirked. As for methods, there are many, such as the government coming forward to organize large-scale enterprise companies to absorb idle capital and engage in production; allowing the people to take over or jointly operate state-owned enterprises that have achieved success, while the government establishes new ones; rewarding and assisting the people in establishing large-scale enterprise companies to absorb idle capital; formulating plans for private enterprises that have achieved success but still need to expand and publicly soliciting idle capital, etc., are all productive enterprises that can absorb a large amount of idle capital.

In short, the most reliable and permanent outlets for idle capital are the two avenues mentioned above, and the core lies in holders of idle capital recognizing the importance of individual interests versus national interests. Do not be blinded by exorbitant profits and immediate gains, do not indulge in personal desires, and take care of the public and the country. At the same time, we also hope that the government authorities will value the power of idle capital and plan strategies for its utilization, taking the protection of the people's interests and the removal of the people's doubts as a prerequisite, so that this considerable idle capital will not be a boil that harms society but will become a huge force for stabilizing national finances and revitalizing the country's industry. Then the country, society, and the people will all benefit from it. How fortunate it would be!

### Japanese Naval Air Force Launches Major Attack on Russell Island, Downing 49 Enemy Aircraft in Air Battle

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 5 p.m. today: On the 7th, the Imperial Naval Air Force dispatched a large squadron of fighters to attack Russell Island (located in the central Solomon Islands). They frequently encountered enemy aircraft over the area and engaged in fierce air battles. As a result, 49 enemy aircraft were shot down, while six of our aircraft did not return to base.

Buenos Aires, 9th (Central News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, the U.S. Navy Department announced on the 8th that a strong Japanese air force had attacked U.S. military positions on Russell Island on the morning of the 6th. U.S. fighters lost seven aircraft in the ensuing battle.

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Naval Air Observation Unit previously attacked enemy aircraft on Santa Ana Island, shooting down 20 of them and achieving a great victory. On the morning of the 8th, a large squadron of fighters departed from a certain base and launched a strong attack on Russell Island, an important base. Enemy aircraft engaged in an unprecedented large-scale air battle. As a result, 49 enemy aircraft were shot down, achieving another great victory. On that day, the large Japanese aircraft formation, filled with the determination to destroy the enemy, advanced towards the enemy's base. Before even reaching Russell Island, Japanese aircraft were already waiting in ambush over Ganasca Island, so the enemy aircraft became easy prey for the Japanese aircraft as soon as they flew in, and eight enemy aircraft were shot down in an instant. Later, when Japanese aircraft reached the airspace above the enemy's base on Russell Island, they engaged in fierce air battles with newly equipped enemy Vought Sikorsky (b4u) aircraft, Curtiss (p4o) aircraft, and Giant (g3t) aircraft. Japanese aircraft shot down 49 enemy aircraft. In the meantime, the Japanese aircraft still had ample strength, so they fiercely bombed the enemy's airfield hangars and other military facilities, inflicting heavy damage. In this battle, six Japanese aircraft failed to return to their original defense. Regarding the U.S. losses in this air battle, the U.S. Navy Department announced that only seven aircraft were lost, which is their usual trick to cover up the facts. Therefore, the enemy's vigorous propaganda that their losses are few only proves the intensity of the Japanese air force's attack.

### Hankow Naval Base Command Holds Inauguration Ceremony Today, Naval Headquarters Sends Zhao Guizhang to Hankow to Preside

Hankow, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Hankow Naval Base Command, actively prepared by Commander Meng Xiuzhuang, is finally ready and will hold its inauguration ceremony today (the 10th). Naval Headquarters specially sent Deputy Naval Minister Zhao Guizhang to Hankow to preside, accompanied by Commander Yin Zuqian and Templeoka Akira.

Also, it is reported that after Deputy Naval Minister Zhao Guizhang arrived in Hankow yesterday, he separately visited provincial and municipal authorities and friendly naval authorities. When the reporter paid a special visit, he was honored to hear the following remarks: The establishment of the Hankow Base Command was originally intended to be personally presided over by Minister Bu Duomu, but due to the busy political affairs, I was sent to Hankow to represent him. Wuhan is located in an important strategic area of the Yangtze River and is considered a military stronghold. It is particularly important during the Greater East Asia War. The army's defenses are already very solid, so it is necessary for the navy to establish defenses as well. Since the National Government returned to the capital, the navy has been actively developing, establishing important port commands in Nanjing, Weihaiwei, and Guangzhou. This time, thanks to the assistance of friendly countries and provincial and municipal leaders, the Naval Headquarters was able to establish a base command in Hankow. Our department expresses its sincere gratitude to friendly countries and provincial and municipal leaders.

### Ways of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (II) Promoting Controlled Economic Cooperation, Preventing Capital Concentration in Concessions – Wu Zhenxiu

Concessions and extraterritoriality are major constraints on China's politics and economy. Crimes committed in concessions under the protection of extraterritoriality are well-known. Of course, concessions are also the safest places for life, property, and capital. Even today, some Chinese still think this way, so only the concessions have concentrated capital, and only the concessions have become fertile ground. Shanghai, Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and other places are all like this. This kind of development that is biased towards the coastal areas can be said to be a distorted development for the entire Chinese economy.

Now, the implementation of recovering concessions and extraterritoriality is truly gratifying for the political and economic development of China, and this is what I hope for. In the future, even if the coastal cities that have concessions become a little thinner, it doesn't matter, because it can promote the development of various inland areas (referring to the inland of the coastal cities), and the banks of the inland rivers or the areas along the railways can all achieve balanced materials and the same development. In the future, Shanghai will of course still be in the central position of control and will gradually develop. However, China's past economy has not developed, and China cannot develop soundly, let alone develop from an ancient country to a new country, and then to a modern country. Regarding the progress of the Commercial Control Association, we have recently been discussing the establishment of local federations of lower-level organizations. We will of course do our best to operate the Commercial Control Association, but the future is not easy.

First, controlled economy has no precedent in China and almost no experience. The so-called controlled knowledge is only a slight study of Japanese things, so it is somewhat reluctant for us to do it. Although this time it was handed over to us to handle ourselves because of the new Sino-Japanese policy, we still have to ask Japan for assistance in the places where our strength is not enough. Second, the objective conditions surrounding the Commercial Control Association are not necessarily good. In a nutshell, China's current situation has neither an old organization nor a new one. The reason for this situation cannot be denied: it was caused by September 18th, August 13th, and the Greater East Asia War, and for decades, under the system of gentry, farmers, workers, and merchants, industry was primitive. From the old organization era that focused solely on agriculture until the period of trade with foreign countries and up to the present, there have been countless changes in the middle. Under these circumstances, it is not easy to accomplish a new and major task. If Japan encountered this situation, there would still be ways to think about it, but the Chinese side feels greatly troubled.

The current problem of the Commercial Control Association is how to control the materials in Shanghai. I think that if Shanghai's materials had been purchased after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th, the situation would have been more optimistic. However, after December 8th, Shanghai's materials all flowed to the people, and the prices also rose sharply, and the Commercial Control Association was established at this very troublesome time. I hope the Japanese side also considers this situation.

Of course, it is necessary to severely crack down on speculation and hoarding in Shanghai, especially those hoarding behaviors that seek exorbitant profits, which must not be allowed to exist. If only a part of the speculators and hoarders are exposed, it will not only fail to eradicate them but will also produce the opposite effect. Shanghai has a population of over 4.5 million, among which only a very small number are engaged in large-scale speculation and hoarding. I think that for these people, in addition to what they need for their lives, all the materials should be returned to the Commercial Control Association and handed over to the government. First, we should have a cordial talk with them about this idea. If they still do not agree no matter what you say, then wouldn't it be a very good method to ask this person to leave Shanghai?

The most necessary thing in Shanghai is to increase business. Regarding this point, the enemy properties that have been transferred by the Japanese side to the Tong government should be handed over to private individuals to manage as soon as possible if they are suitable for private management, so as to strive to increase production. Although it is said that it should be handed over to private individuals to do, it would be useless to call someone who has no real experience in running a business to do it.

In the military, the restriction on the movement of materials has been eased, and the control of materials is handled by China itself. This is something to be happy and grateful for. But there is still one problem, which is the smooth circulation of materials between Central China and North China. For example, we are very concerned about the food problem in North China from the perspective of people's livelihood. For example, the price of coal in Central China is surprisingly high, while it is very cheap in North China. It is not a good phenomenon that goods are coming from North China, but not from Central China. This price difference should be adjusted. However, due to the past situation between North China and Central China, it is impossible to seek free trade at once. I think we should first exchange two or three kinds of materials, take a look at the situation, and then make adjustments, step by step. Finally, I would like to say one more sentence. In the current world, it is always the people in the guiding position who think this way: "This is why we have to do this, because it is necessary, it is natural, so we have to do this." For example, the transfer from free economy to controlled economy is a natural thing at present, and it is necessary to do so. From a fair point of view, I don't think the people who do it are unreasonable. However, from a fair point of view, there are indeed difficulties for the controlled party. The environment that the Commercial Control Association faces can also be said to be like this, so in all matters, we must consider the guide and the guided, consider both the controlled side and the controlled side, so as to achieve perfection and fairness.

### Tokyo Holds National Convention: Issues Declaration Urging National Public to Rise Up and Fulfill the Unfinished Aspirations of the Patriotic Soldiers

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - After learning of the heroic martyrdom of Marshal Yamamoto and the honorable deaths of all Japanese troops on Attu Island, the emotions of Japan's 100 million citizens reached a fever pitch. The Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Assistance Political Association, the Tokyo Municipal Government, and other organizations jointly launched a "National Convention for Decisive Battle to Destroy Britain and America." With the support of the Mainichi, Asahi, and Yomiuri Shimbun newspapers, the Tokyo National Convention was grandly held at the Hibiya Public Hall at 2:00 PM on the 9th. After ceremonial procedures, Goto Fumio, Vice-President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, delivered a congratulatory address. Subsequently, General Abe Nobuyuki, President of the Assistance Political Association, was elected as Chairman of the Convention. Then, Mr. Matsuda Takechiyo, Vice-Chairman of the Assistance Political Association's Diet Members' Association, read aloud the convention's declaration and resolution, which were unanimously approved by the entire assembly. Afterwards, Speaker Okada of the House of Representatives and Mr. Shimomura Hiro, Director-General of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, successively delivered speeches encouraging the national public to rise up and promote the spirit of "destroying Britain and America until the task is completed." The meeting adjourned at 2:45 PM. The gist of the convention's declaration is as follows: "Since the start of the war, the glorious achievements of the Japanese military have been sufficient to be forever etched in history. However, the great task of constructing Greater East Asia is still in its early stages. At this decisive moment, now is the time for all our citizens to devote their utmost loyalty and patriotism to the nation and strive to achieve the final victory. More than a year has passed since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and many of our loyal and brave soldiers have embraced the spirit of sacrificing their lives for the nation and their sovereign. This time, Marshal Yamamoto, who commanded Japan's invincible navy and demonstrated its divine might throughout the universe, heroically martyred himself in the front lines while supervising the battle. The Japanese garrison on Attu Island, outnumbered by the enemy, fought to the last man. Their sincerity and devotion are enough to astonish heaven and earth and move even the gods to tears. When we think back to the ferocity of this battle and the loyalty and bravery of our soldiers, our blood cannot help but boil, and our resolve is strengthened. Feelings of enmity towards the enemy and the determination to sacrifice ourselves for the nation arise spontaneously. We vow to devote all our strength to enhance all war capabilities, overcome all difficulties, and resolutely destroy Britain and America to avenge this loss and fulfill the unfinished aspirations of the patriotic soldiers, while simultaneously completing the great task of the nation and reassuring the Emperor."

### Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Hidaka, Issues Statement

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to Italy, Hidaka, met with a group of Italian reporters on the 8th and strongly asserted that Japan has established a decisive system to cope with the current world war situation. He stated, in essence, that Japan is prepared to deal with any unexpected circumstances that may arise and is currently striving to maintain coordination with the various countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. He claimed the peoples of those countries are already enjoying genuine freedom. Furthermore, Japan is continuing its operations against Chongqing. The recent participation of Chongqing generals in the peace movement proves that Japan's plans to advance against Chongqing are steadily succeeding. As for Churchill and Roosevelt discussing in their recent Washington conference whether to focus the main thrust of the anti-Axis forces on Europe or East Asia, such plans are difficult to implement and are not worth paying attention to.

### US Air Force Strength Weak: Japan Controls the Skies

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from a certain base of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, the Japanese Army Air Force has been bravely operating on the Central China front to destroy the US forces stationed in Chongqing. Since January, they have repeatedly carried out strong attacks, crushing the enemy's counter-offensive attempts. Therefore, at the current stage, whether the US Air Force can carry out its wild boast of bombing Japan is being examined. The opinions of local Japanese air force personnel are summarized as follows: According to a certain unit commander of the bomber forces, technically speaking, it may be possible to attack the Japanese mainland from Kunming and other places. However, because Japan controls the air over its forward bases, the US Air Force in Chongqing has no hope of survival. The operational radius of the enemy's "Unified Type" (1324) aircraft is only about 300 kilometers, and its maximum performance is so poor that its range of operations is limited. The performance of the enemy's "North American Type" (1325) aircraft is even worse. The main issue is the morale of the unit, as the enemy only knows how to escape and lacks a proactive attitude. Therefore, they have no brave spirit to overcome all difficulties and bomb the Japanese mainland. According to a certain unit commander of the fighter forces, the performance of the enemy's fighter planes (P-40 and P-43) is not to be feared. Even with auxiliary fuel tanks, their operational radius is only about 1,000 kilometers. It is impossible to form a fighter-bomber formation with such aircraft. If bombers were to carry out sneak attacks alone, they would be shot down by Japanese fighters defending the homeland. Although the morale of the US military is better than last year, they only dare to adopt a group warfare tactic and attack when they have a large numerical advantage over the Japanese. If their numbers are the same as or less than the Japanese, they have almost no courage to fight. (According to a certain unit commander of the reconnaissance plane unit, because of the continuous fierce attacks by Japanese planes, the enemy is currently trying to counterattack, but they only occasionally appear at intermediate bases such as Liangshan, Enshi, and Hengyang before fleeing inland. Judging from the current situation, enemy planes do not seem capable of challenging the Japanese. Long-range bombers such as the B-17 have not yet appeared. If they were to attack, the Japanese would certainly retaliate fiercely. Currently, the morale of the Japanese military is very high, and they all have a strong belief.

### Javanese Young Police Officers Sent to Taiwan for Study

Guakaruta, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Military Administration Department of Java considers it an urgent task to improve the quality of indigenous police officers. In order to develop promising young cadre police officers, this time, ten outstanding police officers from the backbone cadre were specially selected and sent to the Japanese Police School in Taiwan for study. The study period is set for two months, and they are currently undergoing preparatory training at the Police School in Sukabumi.

### Japanese Newspaper Analyzes the Trends of Various Neutral Countries

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Nagoya (Chubu Nihon Shimbun) on the 9th wrote an article entitled "The Trends of Neutral Countries," analyzing the current trends of various neutral countries with great accuracy. The gist of the translation is as follows: "During this autumn of world war, there are still seven countries around the world that maintain their neutral or non-belligerent status, namely Argentina in South America, Afghanistan and Turkey in West Asia, Spain and Portugal in the Iberian Peninsula, Switzerland in Central Europe, and Sweden in Northern Europe. The common hope of all these countries is to avoid directly entering the vortex of war and to hope to save this world from the flames of war. However, if we examine the nature of this war, we can see that this war is nothing more than a superficial conflict of interests between the Axis and anti-Axis camps. Its root cause is actually a struggle between the old and new worlds. For more than twenty years since the last world war, the so-called victorious countries such as Britain, the United States, and France have artificially created an unnatural old world order, which has now begun to collapse from within. Therefore, there is a movement to adapt to this situation and strive to build a new world order, which is to rationally distribute and organize the world's land, population, and resources according to natural conditions. Although this work has its gains and losses in armed warfare and diplomatic warfare, it must also be pursued with determination. This is the mainstream that is spreading throughout the world in this great war. If this is the case, then today's neutral countries may not be able to remain aloof from this mainstream forever. Or, before they themselves participate in this world revolution, the world situation may no longer allow them to maintain their isolationist attitude. This is only natural. If Britain and the United States increase their troops in West Asia, then Afghanistan and Turkey will lean towards Britain and the United States. Also, in the current stage of the European war, it is inevitable that Argentina shows goodwill to the United States, just as Sweden approaches Germany. As for the positions of Spain and Portugal, they are indeed unusually subtle, which cannot be denied. In short, the trends of today's neutral countries can no longer be determined by their own intentions, but are entirely determined by the direction of the world war. The statements made by the authorities in charge of each neutral country often imply a conflict between their own lack of will and the objective situation, as well as deep distress. Therefore, if we carefully examine their statements, we can easily understand the situation. Thus, the trends of today's neutral countries are a reflection of the current world situation."

### Conflicting Interests Between Britain and America Regarding Argentina

Buenos Aires, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Argentine government has issued only a very simple statement regarding the new government's foreign policy, stating that it will maintain neutrality for the time being. Behind this statement of maintaining neutrality, one can further discern the complex interests of Britain and the United States in that country. The United States, given the current situation of the world war, is doing everything possible to make Argentina abandon its neutrality and place it under its sphere of influence, and make it share the burden of the war. However, Britain hopes that the country will remain neutral, and the reason is that the existing imperialist rights and interests of Britain in that country are more advantageous than those of the United States and other countries. Economically, British capital accounts for a large proportion of Argentina's railways, telecommunications, electricity, gas, refrigeration, meat processing plants, and other industries. Argentina's economic dependence on Britain and European countries is beyond general imagination. Therefore, if Argentina abandons its neutrality, it will lose its freedom of navigation in the Atlantic, which would be a significant blow to Britain. Due to the extreme causes mentioned above, the interests of Britain and the United States are in complete opposition.

### The Voice of Scientific Victory (4): Resources Beneath Fossils: Mobilizing Geologists to Develop the South

The war industry has completely entered the stage of attrition warfare. In order to achieve victory, everything must be used effectively. The vast territory of East Asia contains inexhaustible resources, which are eagerly awaiting development. Minerals such as iron, coal, petroleum, bauxite, and tin are indispensable materials for war. Therefore, the development of unlimited underground resources is immediately driving the war effort, accumulating strength for the victorious Greater East Asia War. However, the discovery of these underground resources in East Asia is by no means the result of accidental dominance. In order to discover these minerals, countless years of scientific exploration have been spent. How was the secret potential war power of East Asia that appears before our eyes obtained? This requires geology to give us an answer.

"What do most people in the world think of geologists and paleohistologists who obsessively study seemingly unremarkable fossils, forgetting to eat and sleep, exhausting their minds?" "Some people must be thinking that fossil research, which has nothing to do with war, is of no benefit at all to the great war at the critical moment of national survival. But this idea is wrong. In the South? In Manchuria? In China? How great has been the efficiency of bringing underground resources to the surface continuously? Geology is just like a fitter in a black country airplane."

The one who said this was Professor Kato Takeo, Doctor of Science, Dean of the Faculty of Science and member of the Academy of Japan, Tokyo Imperial University, the author of "Research on East Asian Geology and Research on Underground Resources."

"The Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which has a very vast area, is formed by the East Asian continent adjacent to Manchuria and the Japanese archipelago near it, and the East Indian islands. Materially speaking, their origin and history of change are different, and meteorologically speaking, they include frigid, temperate, and tropical zones. This inevitably leads to differences in the abundant above-ground and underground resources of East Asia. However, the previous development was really unsatisfactory. The biggest causative factor is that the knowledge of fundamental geology is too threatened, and its exploratory power is very insufficient. So why is it necessary to study things like fossils in order to explore underground resources? Let us give two or three examples to illustrate this point."

Metal ore beds

The geology of the continent and the archipelago has its own differences. Gold ore and metals are also affected by their land endorsements, and their constituent elements must also be different. Generally speaking, in the deep depths of the continental zone, gold ore and iron ore beds are very numerous. This is not found in island areas. So why are there such ore veins on the archipelago? This is entirely due to the influence of volcanoes, so in the shallow depths of the archipelago, there are more gold, silver, and copper ore veins, and fewer iron ore veins.

Bauxite

The weathering effect in ancient times in the southern zone was very serious, so the rock and stone disintegrated to become red soil. When this red soil was formed, the iron and vanadium contained in the original rock gradually dissolved and precipitated into the soil, thus becoming iron ore and bauxite.

Tin

At a certain local time, when granite collapsed in the south, the tin attached to the shared garden later became tin ore. Moreover, in the belt area, this kind of parrot ore bed decomposes due to natural action and turns into scraps of vermilion and flows into the sand, and precipitates in the sand ore.

Petroleum

In terms of the Earth-selling policy, the Tertiary period (my study of science is a relatively new era), the places where there are many petroleum mines today were all shallow seas. Sand and sediment accumulated and precipitated on this seabed to become layers of centimeters, and biological remains were mixed in this release of land accumulation. The remains of the north and another layer of sand and settlement organisms were dried by nature to become media oil. Later, this seabed belt became land and became a coal oil pool, forming a stratum, and the specialized name for the wrinkled skin that protrudes in this stratum is the inclining part, with coal gas at the top, coal oil below, and water below. Therefore, if you make holes in this kind of inclining structure part, it will definitely spray out oil. This is the compilation theory derived from Earth-related studies. Fossils are the relics of organisms in the world that have sunk into the strata. Therefore, if we carefully examine it, we can judge which resource is hidden in the underground in the layer of the first epoch by discovering this kind of fossil. In some places in Manchuria and China, quasi-ground protrudes, containing a certain special fossil of the Ordovician three-gray rock. If you excavate near this kind of protrusion, you will definitely discover coal. Underground resources are so gold-leasing related to fossils. Therefore, the more progressive the study of fossils, the more progressive paleontology, geological tectonics, geo-history, basic geology, and attribution will be. Once we understand the reason for the existence of resources such as those mentioned above, then we will work hard to develop underground resources. The current development of underground resources must be based on geological theory. Therefore, in the future, with the increasingly progressive geology, we will continue to develop undeveloped underground resources to prepare for the flexible use of tomorrow's combat power.

### Axis Forces Heavily Defend Mediterranean Islands: British Troops Fail to Land on Lampedusa Island: US Air Force Concentrates on Bombing the Balkans

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency) - A military reporter from the German News Agency recently reported on the attempt by anti-Axis forces to land on Lampedusa Island in the Mediterranean Sea, stating that the attempt by anti-Axis forces to land on Lampedusa was the first step in an attempt to invade the Italian mainland, but it was heavily defeated by the Italian defense forces and ultimately failed. The British troops attempting to land this time had received special training, and all of them were armed with automatic rifles. The troop strength was approximately one battalion. The island has an area of only twenty square kilometers and is located two hundred kilometers from the southern tip of Sicily. Although the island's fortress is far less solid than Malta and Pantelleria, the Italian army annihilated all of the enemy troops attempting to land in just a few hours. The anti-Axis forces' landing on the island was aimed at testing the Italian army's defense capabilities.

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Since British Prime Minister Churchill returned to London, the British newspapers have frequently reported that the anti-Axis forces will launch a new operation on the European continent. And since the British army's attempted landing operation on Lampedusa Island south of Sicily, the war situation in the Mediterranean has suddenly become tight. Although this landing operation by the British army failed due to the brave counterattack of the Italian army, the anti-Axis air force has been bombing Pantelleria Island, Sicily Island, and Sardinia Island, which are the outposts of the Italian mainland, for days, so it is expected that the anti-Axis forces will attempt to carry out landing operations on these islands again. Therefore, the anti-Axis forces' plan to counterattack the Mediterranean islands is beyond doubt. It is reported that the United States Air Force is now also assembling on Cyprus Island, attempting to bomb the Balkan Peninsula, with an emphasis on bombing western Greece. This move may be a prerequisite for counterattacking the Dodecanese Islands and Crete. It is observed that the intention of the Axis forces is to recapture the above-mentioned islands, so that they can obtain a base for landing operations in Europe, and at the same time open up the waterway in the Mediterranean Sea, so as to strengthen the assistance to the Soviet army on the Eastern Front, and ensure the transportation route to India. Therefore, the Italian Army Headquarters is fully fortifying the key coastal areas in order to prevent the anti-Axis forces from landing, and is also strengthening the garrison and laying mines to form a tight defense line.

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Army Headquarters issued a war report on the 9th, stating that the anti-Axis forces bombarded Pantelleria Island with both naval and air forces on the 8th, and then advised the Italian garrison on the island to surrender, which was severely rejected.

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency) - Yesterday, responsible parties here declared that the anti-aircraft artillery and coastal artillery gunners on Pantelleria Island are all manned by Fascist militias, and the command is also held by officers of the militia. The accurate shooting of the coastal artillery gunners forced the attacking British battleships to cease fire, and the skill of the anti-aircraft gunners was equally astonishing. According to the Italian war report announced yesterday, no less than one hundred enemy planes were shot down on the island, and the militia also suffered some casualties.

### Churchill's Speech Claims Major War Imminent: Acknowledges Submarine Threat Remains Serious

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to London sources, British Prime Minister Churchill admitted in the House of Commons yesterday that Britain's main concern is the effectiveness of the Axis submarine warfare and the heavy losses of anti-Axis ships. Churchill also hinted that sooner or later there will be a major war. At the same time, Churchill also stressed that in the battle of Tunisia, the British First Army and Eighth Army suffered serious losses. Churchill did not discuss the development of the near future in detail, but only said that "a very complex and dangerous large-scale naval and land war is imminent." Churchill also said that the Soviet army is fighting a desperate battle, and there will soon be a large-scale battle on the Eastern Front. But we have not been able to contact Stalin or other representatives of the Soviet Union, which we deeply regret. The Soviet Union bears the greatest responsibility and sacrifices the most flesh and blood. Each Allied country has a different point of view on the war, but we British continue to regard the war against submarines as the top priority, because we must conquer submarines before we can survive and act. The situation in May was one of the best months since the United States joined the war. Churchill went on to mention the meeting he held in Washington, saying that his relationship with President Roosevelt has become a personal friendship, and a comrade and partner in thought and action. Churchill also discussed the situation in North Africa in detail, saying that the anti-Axis losses in Tunisia were serious. After crossing the Libyan front, the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery lost 11,500 people, and the British First Army under General Anderson lost 23,500 people. The Prime Minister also said that his visit to North Africa had no political nature. He said, "When I was in Algiers, de Gaulle happened to arrive with his friends, so I specially telegraphed Foreign Secretary Eden to assist. In the negotiations to organize the so-called French National Liberation Committee, we had no need to intervene. But we, like General Eisenhower, are paying close attention to safeguarding the interests of Britain and the United States and the welfare of our troops stationed in North Africa. The Prime Minister did not mention the order of the war zones and future operations in his speech.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Algiers, the North African French Liberation Committee announced on the 9th that it had decided to appoint Giraud as the commander-in-chief of the army, navy, and air force, commanding all military affairs, and de Gaulle would be in charge of general political affairs.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - According to Algiers, the French National Liberation Committee has added seven more members. According to US radio broadcasts, three of them are from de Gaulle's faction, three are from Giraud's faction, and one is a neutral.

### Britain to Increase Diplomatic Staff in Soviet Union

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that the British diplomatic representative in Moscow will soon be increased, and Britain will first decide to send one ambassador and one minister to the Soviet Union. The position of minister will be filled by Balfour, who previously served as minister to Portugal.

### Guerrillas Encircled in Yugoslavia

Zagreb, 9th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports that guerrillas in Bosnia and Herzegovina are now completely surrounded by Axis forces in Montenegro, and fighting is still ongoing. The guerrillas' plan to break out of the encirclement has failed, with heavy casualties.

### Turkey Maintains Armed Neutrality in the Current Stage of the European War: Clear Statement by President Ismet

Ankara, 9th (Central News Agency) - Turkish President Ismet, at the opening of the 6th Congress of the Republican People's Party yesterday, stated that the Turkish government is determined to maintain its neutrality in the current stage of the World War. The President stated: "We firmly guarantee the security of our country, and if necessary for self-defense, we are also prepared to fight with all our strength. It is impossible to predict when and under what circumstances this war will end, but we believe that peace will come in the near future. The President continued to say that Turkish finance is currently in unprecedented demand, and the government is taking various appropriate measures to cope with it. The President also expressed the hope that the public should pay more direct attention to internal affairs than in the past, and should especially strictly select those in power. Only in this way can the trust between the public and the government be maintained, and the government can make decisions. The contribution of the Republican People's Party in this regard is commendable, and the parliament should take it as law. After instructing the party's future work, the President said that the true happiness of the people can only be sought in serving the country."

### Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union Returns to Kuibyshev

Kuibyshev, 9th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister to the Soviet Union, Shigeno Goro, who previously decided to return home to report on his duties, returned to Kuibyshev on the 8th and is scheduled to go to Moscow on the 10th.

### US Explosives Factory Explodes

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports that the Triumph Explosives Factory in Elkton, Maryland, suddenly exploded, killing at least 125 female workers and injuring countless others. Most of the bodies are unrecognizable. Windows and doors throughout the town of Elkton were shattered. The factory has more than 10,000 workers. The cause of the accident is unknown. The former managers of the factory are both on trial in court for fraud.

### Marshal Dönitz Discusses with Assurance of Final Victory

(Special Correspondent from Berlin, 31st Dispatches) Naval Chief Marshal Dönitz of Germany is equivalent to the Minister of the Navy and Chief of the Naval General Staff of Japan. At the same time, he also holds a position similar to the Commander of the Yokosuka Naval District, directly commanding the German U-boat fleet that traverses the world's oceans. He is the number one figure in the German Navy. The reporter raised questions about the joint operations of the Japanese and German navies, the development of U-boat warfare, and other issues, requesting an interview with Marshal Dönitz. Despite his busy military affairs, he agreed to meet with the reporter on May 31st. Since Marshal Dönitz assumed the post of Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, this was his first meeting with domestic and foreign journalists. The reporter, accompanied by Major Fujimura of the Japanese Naval Attaché's Office, visited the office of the German Navy Minister at 10:00 a.m. that day. Marshal Dönitz is a tall and sturdy man, 52 years old this year, 16 years younger than his predecessor, Raeder. When he shook hands with the reporter, he seemed to be a man of few words at first glance, but his warmth overflowed from his expression. The following is the Q&A between Marshal Dönitz and the reporter.

Striving for Initiative

Marshal Dönitz said: "All of us German naval officers and soldiers are deeply moved by the patriotic sacrifice of Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto of the Combined Fleet. The achievements of the Japanese Navy in this war, announced on the Japanese Naval Battle Memorial Day, are a monument to Marshal Yamamoto's great achievements that will be passed down through the ages. In my telegram to the Japanese Navy, I conveyed our admiration and trust in the Japanese Navy to your country, which was expressed out of sincere emotion. I am very honored to have received earnest replies from Minister of the Navy Shimada and Chief of the Naval General Staff Nagano."

Marshal Dönitz then changed the subject and expressed his aspirations for the current naval warfare. He described how the German Navy, which was just starting to be built when Britain and France declared war on Germany, overcame various unfavorable circumstances.

Marshal Dönitz continued, "You have been stationed in Germany as a veteran journalist since before the war, so you probably understand very well that the small navy, which was still in its infancy of reconstruction at that time, was forced to fight against Britain. Even in the North Sea and the Atlantic Ocean, the British and French fleets had more than ten times the strength of ours. But we were not afraid of this great enemy. From the first day of the war, our navy took lightning action to seize the initiative of attack from the enemy, surprise-attacked the heart of Britain, the Scapa Flow naval port, and laid mines along the British coast. We dispatched submarines, battleships, and cruisers to the distant oceans, and occupied the enemy's landing place, the coast of Norway, creating a posture of threatening the British mainland from the north. On the southern flank of the British mainland, thanks to the miraculous surprise attack of our army and air force, we obtained a strategically important base on the Atlantic coast. Based on this Atlantic coast, our submarines were able to operate continuously and threaten the enemy's lifeline. The achievements of our submarines are self-evident and I won’t repeat them here. Just when this submarine warfare was accelerating the threat to the British mainland, the United States thought that Japan could be deceived and coerced, and finally joined the war. This was a fundamental misjudgment of the enemy camp. We Germans have always remembered with admiration and amazement Japan's resolute determination and powerful force in attacking the arrogance of the United States at that time."

The reporter here expressed his congratulations on the close cooperation among the countries centered on the Tripartite Pact in the current major war situation, and expressed his boundless joy in the greatness of the German U-boat fleet. Marshal Dönitz then spoke with a knowing smile, stating the following meaningful remarks!

"As you said, if we combine the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in the Pacific Ocean with the achievements of the German U-boats in the Atlantic Ocean, we will know where the essence of the decisive battle on the ocean stage in this world war lies. The entire combat power of our Japanese, German, and Italian allied navies is by no means a separate, individual war. We use our unique deployment, appearing suddenly in the east and west, floating unpredictably, to contain and attack British and American warships and merchant ships everywhere, gradually weakening the enemy's power. The effect of this interactive combat of our side's camp ultimately and unequivocally reduces the enemy's power.”

Sinkings Exceed Shipbuilding Capacity

"The total number of enemy ships sunk by our Allied camp so far is, as I recall, 31.5 million tons. I would like to hear your opinion on this submarine warfare." Upon the reporter's inquiry, Marshal Dönitz gave the following answer:

"This figure is sufficient to prove that no matter what defensive tactics the enemy takes, no matter how desperately the enemy builds new ships, it cannot exceed our attack power. We are especially grateful and trust that Japan plays an essentially important role in this achievement of sinking enemy ships, and will continue to do so in the future. However, when discussing the effect of the work of destroying enemy ships in the vast maritime stage, we should consider the overall results of the sinking as the object of discussion. The results of naval battles, which are often dominated by various conditions, sometimes more and sometimes less, are an inevitable phenomenon. The one who determines the victory or defeat of a naval battle is the form in which the final overall result appears. For example, our submarines, day after day, extract blood from the enemy's blood vessels.”

The reporter informed that the enemy has recently been boasting about the progress of its submarine defense tactics, and asked what countermeasures the German Navy has taken.

Marshal Dönitz replied: "The enemy is thinking of escaping, and we are thinking of chasing. Because the enemy wants to find a way to escape, they will naturally come up with various tactics. As for our side, our attack tactics will naturally not stand still and stagnate. Our new tactics and new weapons are also being researched and improved day by day, and are being put into practical use.”

Hearing this, the reporter recalled the anecdote of then-Lieutenant Commander Dönitz when he was the commander of a submarine and circumnavigated the Mediterranean Sea into the Atlantic Ocean in 1918. At that time, his superior criticized Dönitz, saying: "I have never seen anyone as ambitious and bold as Dönitz. He sometimes swallows mines, sometimes collides, and sometimes throws himself into the sea. If everyone did as adventurously as Dönitz, all of Germany's submarines would soon be wiped out.”

The reporter continued, "Today is exactly the anniversary of the Battle of Skagerrak, which the German Navy regards as glorious. In the future world war, I would like to hear your beliefs."

Marshal Dönitz replied: "I am confident that the countries in our Allied camp will have an absolutely undefeated spirit and strength in future naval battles. The form of naval battles has changed greatly since the Battle of Skagerrak, and will change even more in the future. However, no matter how different modern naval warfare is from the past in terms of region, strategy, and technology, our purpose is unwavering. At any time, we focus on the same goal, which is to strive for the final victory. This is our supreme goal.”

At this point, the reporter asked Marshal Dönitz what he thought of the spirit of the Japanese soldiers on Attu Island who died for their country. The Marshal said frankly:

"In this just war, the heroic sacrifices of the soldiers are by no means meaningless. The touching aspect of Attu Island lies in this. The spirit of the scholars of ancient Japan still flows in the blood of the Japanese people. The brave Japanese soldiers have once again displayed it to people all over the world here. People who know a little about Japanese history will inevitably imagine how the entire Japanese people will react and what impact it will have on the tragic battle of the Aleutians, far away from their homeland. Under the new commander, Koga, the entire Japanese Combined Fleet and the entire Japanese army will be even more vigorous in their morale and will continue to fight against the enemy. I believe that small disasters will turn into great blessings.”

Marshal Dönitz had just returned to Berlin this morning, and before he could warm his seat, he was about to depart again for the front line. The plane was already waiting to take off. The reporter thanked the Marshal for taking the time to meet him in his busy schedule. The impression gained at the German Naval Headquarters on this day was that the heads of the headquarters, from the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, were very young people. It was felt that after Marshal Dönitz took office as Commander-in-Chief, all the old people had retired. There was no one older than the 52-year-old Commander Dönitz.

### Restricting Consumption of Cotton Products; Adoption of Rationing System; Per Capita Annual Consumption to Be 76 Points; Implementation for Japanese Residents Next Month, Chinese Still Under Consideration

Regarding restricting the consumption of cotton products and adopting a rationing system, starting with Japanese residents first, scheduled to be implemented next month, the Japanese Embassy, the Japanese Consulate General, and the Resident Group have repeatedly decided on specific measures with the material control authorities. Although the specific method has not yet been finalized, according to inquiries from the Guofeng News Agency reporter, based on the current situation, the method is a coupon rationing system.

Special Allotments for Mothers and Children

This system roughly stipulates that the total annual consumption points per person will be set at 76 points. For example, each towel will be designated as 1 point, a bolt of bleached cloth will be 6 points, and 10 yards of white cotton cloth will be 20 points. Within a year, the minimum number of towels to be allocated is 3. The total number of points for annual consumer goods, regardless of their composition, must not exceed the specified amount. In addition, a special allotment system is being considered for children and mothers. The locations for issuing ration coupons and the designated retail stores that sell rationed cotton products are currently under careful consideration by all relevant parties. The rationed cotton products include 11 types: (1) towels, (2) white cotton cloth, (3) bleached cloth, (4) flannel, (5) cotton yarn and foreign yarn, (6) gauze, (7) absorbent cotton, (8) cloth socks, (9) foreign socks, (10) undershirts, (11) shirts. As for the rationing of cotton products for the Chinese population, it seems to be still in the planning stage.

### Bulgarian Minister Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

Fiyi Pu, the Bulgarian Minister to Japan and concurrently Minister to China, has been very busy with receptions since arriving in Beijing to present his credentials. The Bulgarian Minister was originally scheduled to come to Shanghai on the 8th and transfer to Japan, but due to other matters, he changed his plan and arrived in Shanghai by train at 9:00 a.m. yesterday (the 9th). In addition to his staff, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs also sent Secretary Wang to accompany him to Shanghai. It is said that the Bulgarian Minister will stay at the consulate in Shanghai and then transfer to Japan.

### French Police Assault and Humiliate Judge, Express Compensation and Apology

Regarding the incident in which the French police officer of the Central District, Pousset, assaulted and humiliated Wang Lansheng, the judge of the Second Special District Court, at the intersection of Route Lafayette on the morning of the 7th of this month, disrespecting the judge and obstructing official duties, it has once again aroused the anger of citizens throughout the city. After the Second Special Court made serious representations to the French police, the French police agreed to provide compensation and an apology. They sent personnel to visit Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie of the court to express their apology. They also went to Judge Wang's residence to apologize. However, Judge Wang believed that this matter was related to respecting Chinese justice and was not convenient for him to handle independently, so he did not meet them and refused the apology. Chen Bingjun, the president of the court, has now gone to Beijing on official business and is scheduled to return to Shanghai today. Therefore, the incident must wait until President Chen returns to Shanghai before a suitable solution can be obtained.

The Shanghai Groups' Zhang Case Support Association sent a letter to President Chen of the Second Special District Court yesterday, stating that after the Zhang case trial began on June 7th, the instigator and principal offender, Guo Shiyuan, actually threw paper balls at each other with his attorney. They requested that the lawyer's illegal behavior be punished at the next court session. In addition, the Chinese Confucian Society sent a telegram to the Executive Yuan's Ministry of Foreign Affairs yesterday, stating that Judge Wang Lansheng of the court was humiliated on his way to the court to perform his duties, and requested immediate representations.

### Matricide Case Scheduled for Sentencing

The case of Jiang Lianjiang, a 16-year-old student at Yucai Public School, who killed his 16-year-old classmate Jin Weigang with a sharp blade, was continued yesterday morning by Judge Du Fuyao of the First Special Court in the Second Criminal Court. The defendant Jiang Lianjiang did not appoint a lawyer to defend him. According to the law, the court appointed lawyer Ge Zhaoji as his pro bono defender. Jin Youming, the father of the deceased, appointed lawyer Tao Wuzhi to file a supplementary civil suit, requesting compensation for funeral expenses and other fees totaling 469,799 yuan. Because the defendant is still a minor, his father Jiang Jie'an should be jointly and severally liable for compensation. First, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police, stated the case. Then, the father of the deceased recounted the process. When questioned, the defendant Jiang Lianjiang stated that he did not bring a knife when he went to the deceased's place. Because the deceased took out a knife to stab him, he grabbed it and stabbed back. He had no premeditated intention to kill. The court, believing that the facts were clear, ordered the start of the debate. Then, lawyer Zhang Tianyin, representing the police, rose to make the accusation, stating that the fact that the deceased was killed by the defendant was an undisputed fact. Although Article 63 of the Criminal Law stipulates that those under the age of 18 or over the age of 80 shall not be sentenced to death or life imprisonment, the police are bound by the law and cannot request that the defendant be sentenced to the death penalty or life imprisonment. The maximum term of imprisonment is 15 years, and if the circumstances are serious, it may be increased at the court's discretion. Therefore, he requested that the court increase the punishment according to the law and sentence him to 20 years of imprisonment. Then, the appointed defense lawyer Ge Zhaoji argued that there was no corroborating evidence to prove that the murder weapon was brought by the defendant, and the defendant insisted that the deceased intended to harm him and he resisted, which belonged to self-defense and was only an excessive defense. Therefore, he requested a lighter sentence. The court then declared the debate closed and scheduled the verdict to be announced next Wednesday.

### Conventions for Saving on Banquets; More Letters of Response

Our newspaper advocates practicing wartime life and saving on consumption, and has launched "Conventions for Saving on Banquets," soliciting participation from all walks of life. In addition to the first batch of letters of consent published in our newspaper on the 8th, we now record the second batch of letters of consent:

(1) Mr. Lie Yunqing (Tongren Money Exchange) stated: "Saving on any consumption is not only practicing wartime life, but also cherishing materials in peacetime. I have always adhered to this principle, and will continue to do so in the future with a spirit of integrity and unwavering commitment."

(2) Mr. Wu Xiaohou (Jinan Changyu Salt Manufacturing Company) supplemented: "Ordinary banquets should be based on four dishes and five bowls."

We still hope that all walks of life will jointly practice and send letters to participate.

### Donations for Disaster Relief in North China; Collected by Banks and Money Exchanges; Hope People Will Submit Payments Nearby for Convenience; Our Newspaper Extends Gratitude to All Donors

People from all walks of life in this city, aware of the severe disaster in North China, the displacement of people, and the unimaginable suffering, who does not have parents, who does not have a wife and children, we are in a comfortable area, what do we think of the disaster victims, rescuing the hungry and helping the drowning, everyone has the same heart, we hope that all compatriots will work hard to donate and fulfill their obligations.

Bank Collection

Now the association, in order to catch up quickly and alleviate the disaster as soon as possible, and to relieve the suffering of the disaster victims, has designated 13 banks and 2 money exchanges to collect relief funds. We hope that all sectors will submit payments nearby to benefit the disaster victims and save them from disaster.

Game Results

The basketball and football charity games for disaster relief in North China, sponsored by the Municipal Government, with the Nanjing Military Team and Shanghai teams performing their best, have been successfully held. They closed the day before yesterday (the 8th). The sales results, excluding the 30,000 yuan of honorary tickets issued and collected, were 4,620 yuan for tickets on the first day (5th), 7,590 yuan on the second day (6th), 4,770 yuan on the third day (7th), and 4,840 yuan on the fourth day (8th). Including the auction of charity balls for four days, the total was 111,820 yuan.

Buddhist Fundraising

The Municipal Buddhist Association, together with temples and Buddhist groups such as the Pure Land Society and the Chongde Association, launched a campaign to assist disaster relief in North China. They gathered at Jing'an Temple yesterday, with Yuan Ying, Desen, Fan Cheng, Zhenhua, Miga, Wu Qiyao, Hu Songnian, Zhao Puchu, etc. present. They agreed to set a fundraising target of 600,000 yuan. In addition to identifying 200,000 yuan on the spot, they immediately began actively soliciting donations from Buddhist believers.

Dance Hall Charity

A dance hall on Yuqiaoqing Road will donate all of its business income on the evening of the 11th of this month to disaster relief in North China. The manager of the hall, Zhou Yixing, requested that all the dance stars donate their dance fees for the evening as well. Their enthusiasm for donation is still an innovation. It is expected that the dance halls will not shirk their responsibility and will definitely follow suit.

Our Newspaper Thanks

Our newspaper received 10,000 yuan yesterday from Mr. Chen Yisheng from his daughter's one-month-old Tangyi to raise funds for disaster relief, which was handed over to our newspaper to collect.

The cooperative will then issue payment notices to designated banks. The cooperative's address was originally at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce (telephone 44856), but that room has been given to the Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association for office use, so the cooperative's telephone numbers have changed to (44758 and 41482). Those seeking regulations can obtain them directly from the cooperative at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. Members of trade associations can obtain them directly from their respective associations.

### Red Swastika Society's Refugee Work-Study Center Continues to Accept Thirty-Six People, Developing Horticulture, Teaching Chicken Farming

The Economic World - Short Commentaries

### Re-examining the Lessons of the North China Famine

This column's May 25th article, "The Lessons of the North China Famine," pointed out that the causes of the recent North China famine were scarce rainfall, hoarding by the wealthy, lack of external grain supply, expansion of cotton fields, and the widespread planting of "useless crops." Among the above causes, the last point is the most important. Why do we say this? Scarce rainfall is temporary and man-made; hoarding by the wealthy can be resolved by law; the lack of external grain supply can be remedied by politics; the expansion of cotton fields can still solve the problem of clothing, and North China cotton can still be exchanged for Central China rice; only the widespread planting of "useless crops" is the artificial creation of current and future famines.

Due to several reports from the first joint discussion of all groups of the Shanghai All Circles North China Relief Association the other day, we feel more and more that if we want to relieve the suffering of famine for the people of North China from now on, then changing to planting "beneficial crops" is the only important task at present. So, how to change to planting "beneficial crops"? It is precisely what was guessed in those few reports: (1) Find a way to transport corn seeds to the disaster area for cultivation, (2) The North lacks seeds, find a way to supply them as soon as possible, (3) Encourage the planting of Chinese yams to increase food supply; Corn and yams are not only popular foods, but also foods rich in nutrients, and are the best representatives of the so-called "beneficial crops." The planting of all "useless crops" throughout North China should be replaced with this type of "beneficial crops." This is much more thorough than the "storing grain for disaster prevention" method.

One more supplementary remark: the types of food included in "beneficial crops" are numerous, and are of course not limited to corn and yams; but since they are "beneficial crops," they should be used as much as possible to supply food for the people, and should not be arbitrarily put to wasteful uses. Therefore, Mr. Zhang Yipeng asked to collect wheat and stop making wine to replenish disaster relief grain; Wine was originally not needed for people's food, and the main purpose of buying wheat was to allocate it to flour mills for flour production to meet the needs of the people's food. Therefore, we must not only promote the widespread planting of "beneficial crops," but also oppose the waste of "beneficial crops." These problems, especially the widespread planting of "useless crops," are all lessons we have learned from the North China famine.

### Chairman Tang of the Commercial Control Association Clarifies the Significance of Various Industry Organizations, Hopes That All Elected Directors and Supervisors Will Handle Affairs With Integrity

Regarding the internal structure of the competent authorities of the National Commercial Control Association, the industry associations of various industry departments, and the Sino-Japanese joint professional committees, people from all walks of life have not been able to deeply understand them. Mr. Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the Association, specially issued a statement to clarify the organizational system and the nature of the various industry associations and professional committees, and the obligations that all elected directors and supervisors should fulfill. The statement said, "Since the Commercial Control Association was reorganized and directly under the jurisdiction of the Executive Yuan, all control work has been handled in accordance with the instructions of the Executive Yuan. All internal organizational systems (1) belong to the internal departments, with four departments and fifteen groups, and the members are all Chinese personnel appointed by the Association; the industry associations of various industry departments are completely composed of Chinese commercial groups (i.e., trade associations); the professional committees are composed of Chinese and Japanese industry merchants because of commercial relations with friendly countries. All industry associations and professional committees must engage in work in accordance with the four words 'fairness, integrity, and clarity.' It is hoped that the directors, supervisors, and committee members of each industry association (and each industry trade association) and each industry professional committee will not regard it as a kind of right. It must be known that this kind of control work, from the Commercial Control Association to the elected chairman, directors, and supervisors of each association and each industry trade association, is of an obligation nature, serving national policies, handling all control work for social service, and should especially adhere to the spirit of 'commercial collective autonomous control,' strictly abide by laws and regulations to promote the control policy. If there is any illegal behavior that violates the control principles, once discovered, it will be ordered to reorganize. The Japanese side's various industry associations also have the same measures. In addition to the direct order from the Commercial Control Association, the Japanese Embassy will be asked to order the reorganization at any time. In short, this kind of control is rigid and practical, with no room for accommodation. If there is any violation of the law, it will be punished according to law. I hope that the persons in charge of each industry association will pay close attention to it. As for the Materials Control Review Committee established by the National Government, it is composed of officials from the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the chairman of the Commercial Control Association as committee members, and is a material control review agency. The Commercial Control Association is an approval agency directly under the Executive Yuan," he said.

### Municipal Price Evaluation Council Held Its First Inaugural Meeting Yesterday, Resolving Four Important Cases

Then, four important cases were discussed and resolved: (1) The prices of various commodities in the city have not been approved by the Economic Bureau in the past, or have not been evaluated and determined by the Committee recently, and shall not be evaluated and implemented by the trade associations without authorization. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to telegraph the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to notify the trade associations to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed. (2) The trade associations of various industries in the city should list in detail the cost calculation tables of various commodities in the industry as of April 30, together with the supporting documents, and send them to the Committee for evaluation. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to notify them to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed. (3) In accordance with the provisions of central laws and regulations, the trade associations of various industries in the city shall be responsible for supervising the member firms of the industry and shall not wholesale various commodities to non-members to prevent hoarding. It is proposed to sign and request the Economic Bureau to notify them to comply with the request for approval, which was resolved and passed.

### Visits to Various Ports to Prepare for the Establishment of Rural Pawnshops

However, in the following circumstances, the pawn should be refused immediately: (1) When there is a suspicion of obviously involving criminal stolen goods, (2) When the value is too high or difficult to estimate, (3) When violating the prohibition order, (4) When it is too bulky or most easily perishable and not suitable for storage. The total capital of each rural pawnshop must be more than 30,000 yuan of public funds, and it may request the central or local government to allocate public houses for the pawnshop to use, without collecting rent or allocating public funds to deposit in the pawnshop, reducing interest, and subsidizing part or all of its operating expenses and house repair and reconstruction expenses, reducing or exempting all taxes and levies on business and income and pawned items, and the interest on the pawn shall not exceed one and six thousandths of the monthly interest, and the storage fee shall not exceed one and four thousandths of the monthly interest, and the full pawn period shall not be less than nine months.

### The Honest Mirror

— Cheng Jusun

Is it taboo to say "people do not know their own appearance"? As long as you face a mirror - just look - isn't it clear at a glance!

But never be saddened by seeing your own ugly face in the mirror. And don't be proud of your own beauty! Because the mirror is dishonest; it can only show you your external form and appearance -- a well-dressed body, but it cannot reveal the "real" you -- your personality.

Since the mirror only allows us to see the ugliness and beauty of our appearance, then what kind of mirror should we use to see our personality? Of course, we need an "honest mirror," which is "conscience self-examination." Only "conscience" can know one's own personality, and only "self-examination" can know all one's mistakes. Zeng Zi said: "I examine myself three times a day." Even the sages and wise men were like this, let alone we young people who have entered the world to seek deep knowledge.

People often do not realize whether what they are doing is "right" or "wrong" at the time when they are doing something. If they do not add "self-examination" afterwards, then their mistakes will never be corrected. There is also a kind of person who knows that things should not be done this way, but still stubbornly does them. This is also a wrong idea caused by the youth's exuberance... Some people lose their personality because of these mistakes.

Friends, use your "honest mirror" to look at yourself! And take a closer look, carefully observe your past mistakes, and correct your stubborn views, and you will become a good, real "person"!

Finally, I still want to tell you tirelessly: "Don't spend a lot of time in front of the mirror on the dressing table, you should try to use your free time to look into your 'honest mirror' -- conscience self-examination."

### Student Voices: The Distress of High School Graduates

— Ji Weiyi

Dear Friend: Haven't you received any news from me for a long time! I'm telling you, it's not that I'm too busy preparing for exams and ignoring your inquiries, but the distress of graduation makes me feel like I'm lost in a fog. Now I want to pour it all out to you, so I can thoroughly cleanse my recklessly thinking brain.

Graduating from high school, this should be something to be envied. But, who can understand the anxiety in their hearts? The reason for this anxiety is nothing more than the environment that has created it, no wonder the predecessors sighed: "Graduation is the beginning of decline."

After graduation, there are only two paths: further education and employment.

Those from families who can afford it and want to study have no problem. However, we happen to be part of those who do not inherit property, are not good at managing affairs, but still want to continue studying. It is expected that there will be many applicants for schools with low tuition fees and can obtain real knowledge and skills. And whether or not they will be accepted is a chilling question. Otherwise, if you can't get in, even though there are many schools like clouds and the sea, the considerable tuition fee is very difficult to obtain. And with so much money spent, can you buy the best quality goods (as it really is)? This is a "major" question.

Therefore, many classmates resolutely decide not to study further and simply take up employment, using the quick knife to cut the tangled hemp and throw the road to education out of their minds. But, they also have distress. They also have difficulties. Where does this begin?

Originally, this is a society that values qualifications. High school graduates are not as knowledgeable as the general older generations and university students (although some university students are just outwardly impressive). In terms of experience, they are far inferior to clerks who have learned from apprenticeship training. Furthermore, "a newborn calf is not afraid of a tiger," high school graduates are not as easy to order around as older employees; but their airs (?) are not at all lacking. Because society seems to only need people who look up to the future, and those who are humble and subservient to be exploited. Therefore, high school graduates are generally unwelcome. Moreover, this is a time of expensive rice and cinnamon firewood, and everywhere is requesting austerity.

Therefore, getting a job is not a very easy thing. We can only blame this on this cursed society.

We can clearly see the contradiction in this society: those who want to study do not have the strength to bear the high tuition fees, while those who have money do not want to study. People who work hard to earn a living cannot find a job that can only maintain their lives, while those who do not worry about food and clothing occupy high positions and try to amass wealth.

Do you want to say that I am complaining? Anyway, this is the truth after all!

Think about it, living in this era, how can high school graduates not be distressed?

### For Myself and For Others

— Zhang

Yang Zhu advocated: "I would not pluck out a hair to benefit the world." Mozi advocated: "Weary of skin and bone to benefit the world." Two sages, doing things, and having such different principles, truly making it difficult for people to follow. But after careful thought, in order to "for myself," I must "for others," "for others" is also "for myself." "For myself" and "for others", these two are said to be contradictory, but at the same time, they are in a position of cooperation. In order to carry out the mission of our lives, neither can be abandoned.

The so-called "for myself" is not necessarily a selfish and self-interested life proposition - only that advocated by Mr. Yang Zhu, who only cares about his own moral cultivation, is selfish and self-interested - to explain the meaning of the two words "for myself" in modern language, is the right to personal survival. However, in order to achieve the purpose of personal survival, it is necessary to jointly build a good society with the spirit of "for others". Because people are social animals, and if they are separated, they will become incompetent and unable to survive. Because of this, he is a private person on the one hand, and a member of society on the other hand, and with these dual relationships, he must "for myself" on the one hand, and "for others" on the other.

Yang Zhu only saw one aspect of doing things. He did not know that society is the cradle of human survival and happiness, and it does not originally have any purpose. It is just an organization for millions of people to live together in worry. If he were to despise the society on which his survival depends and refuse to cooperate with society, then not only would he not be able to keep the hair he was unwilling to give up, but even his own life would have nowhere to rest. Therefore, we must learn from Mozi to work hard and then hope to build an ideal society where we can ask for and take what we need. In the process of practicing "for others", we have also fulfilled the task of "for myself".

However, the "for myself" like Yang Zhu's is just a passive attitude of doing things. Compared with those who not only do not pluck a hair but also scrape people's skin, it is still seen as more ignorant, less cunning, and less harmful! But then again, no matter how many advantages these people take and how much unjust wealth they make, the social mechanism repeatedly loses its fair operation, and as a result, stability and order cannot be maintained. The misfortune of society is also a barrier to the happiness of individuals. People who truly know how to pursue personal happiness all know that this kind of thing is like playing with fire and is not taken by the wise!

### Talking About Popular Literature

— Dongfang

Among the departments of literature, general popular literature has a wider readership than any other kind of literature. Because literature is inherently for the masses, and popular literature is for the masses.

The beginning of popular literature is the British writer Dickens. This does not mean that there was no popular literature before his works, but that his works can be said to have opened a new era for popular literature. In his works, such as "A Tale of Two Cities," "Hard Times," etc., the life of the lower classes is the object of his writing, and there is a very large reaction and a spicy satire of the upper class in the transition period at that time. His works lack psychological description, but contain a lot of humor. He often uses behavior and action to replace cumbersome psychological descriptions. These are loved by the general middle and lower classes.

The greatest value of popular literature is to raise the level of the general readers. Therefore, it holds a kind of repulsive power, and it does not lower the level to cater to the masses, but is the advocate and defender of the "general masses' inferior and backward emotions"; "it does not selectively cater to the psychology of the general public and beautify and decorate the backward, submissive, and lowly emotions of the general public.

The subject matter of popular literature does not have to be limited to the circles of the middle and lower social classes. All kinds of great life and the various aspects of the upper class can be used as themes. It is narrated in an easy-to-understand tone and is suitable for the tastes of the general public. Of course, the best work is a true record of the writer's life experience. Therefore, I hope that writers will put themselves into real life, enrich the themes of their works, adopt these experiential themes, and use an easy-to-understand tone and a writing style suitable for the tastes of the masses to create exquisite works. These works will surely be accepted by the broad masses of the people and become the literature of the masses.

What we need now is a kind of popular literature that can improve the cultural level of the masses. In terms of theme, it should be positive and helpful to the growth of the new society and must fully overcome works that only have entertainment value and are too empty and unrealistic.

### "Optimism" · "Escaping Reality"

— Wenzhong

Under the pressure of extreme distress, most people's psychology has lost its normal state: some people linger in the city of sorrow all day long, complaining about heaven and blaming others, and even do not hesitate to use their own hands to destroy their own lives; others who call themselves "optimists" hold a large pile of "taking it easy", "doing one day as a monk and striking the bell one day", "today there is wine, today I am drunk" and other "romantic philosophies". It's a pity that they lack the courage to "see through the red dust" and then "shave their heads to become monks"!

These people think that fighting with the environment is in vain: and suicide is even more unnecessary, in fact, they simply do not want to die, thinking that life in the world is only once, and happiness should be enjoyed in time; why wait for the future? Therefore, those with a few banknotes in their pockets spend their days in places of sensuality and indulgence, living a life of drunken dreams, thinking they are carefree in the world. They despise the heavens. As for those who have no connection with "Brother Copper Coin," they also have fun in poverty, trying to live a quiet life in a noisy environment. Therefore, they lock themselves in a small room to hum and scribble, express their complaints, or wander on the streets. When bored, they invite a few like-minded "friends" to sit in a teahouse for a few hours, sipping tea while commenting on the women walking on the road, or each freely discussing "life views" and gossiping about "strange news and sights."

The above-mentioned characters can be said to be very "optimistic". They sincerely believe that the universe is so great and they are so small, what are the students busy with? Why bother to worry? It's better to abandon all the beautiful dreams of success and enter their own paradise to spend their lives!

In fact, this kind of thinking is not qualified to be called "optimism"? It is just a kind of "escaping reality" fantasy. These people are indeed conquered by the environment and become victims of the environment.

Those who are not bound by the environment and are not moved by happiness, anger, sorrow, and joy can be called "optimistic". It is very obvious that "optimism" is to overcome the environment, while "escaping reality" is precisely to be conquered by the environment. The two are absolutely in opposite positions.

We are in this turbulent society, and the responsibilities we bear are so great? The reality absolutely does not allow us to shirk the responsibility on our shoulders and escape to the Peach Blossom Garden to enjoy ourselves. The life of a hermit is not suitable for us at all. In short, the environment is indeed bad, but we must not use a negative attitude to escape reality. We believe that the future is bright as long as we have an "optimistic" way of thinking: hold on to the present and actively fight against the bad environment!

### Teacher and Tea Server

— Shengyao

I have a relative who is a middle school teacher. He teaches Chinese in high school and is paid 7 yuan and 25 cents per hour. He teaches for a full six hours a day, earning 43 yuan and 50 cents.

The son of the old nanny in my house is a tea server in a certain company. Today, a wealthy elder is marrying off his daughter, and the company, big and small, public and private, all came to send 1,200 yuan in legal tender. The tea server received a tip of 120 yuan. Tomorrow, a certain bank will open, and he will send a silver something, earning 50 yuan for his effort.

A teacher has extra energy and can teach three or four hours a day, which is already amazing. Weddings and funerals, happy events, and auspicious openings follow one after another, and there are always ten or so times a month.

The responsibility of a teacher is to enlighten the people and cultivate the pillars of the country; the tea server is to listen to calls and be summoned, working hard for a living.

The teacher at least writes books and speaks fluently. He can talk about the past and the present; most of the tea servers are illiterate.

Although the teacher does not wear a suit, he must wear a long gown; people call him "Sir"; the tea server can wear short clothes and a small jacket, and others see him as a member of the "short-shirt gang".

But the teacher's remuneration is like this, and the tea server's remuneration is like this.

The tea server receives the extra benefits of the capitalists and already lives very well; but how many capitalists want to add benefits to the teachers who educate their children?

People who are content with their own lives are all complaining about the difficulty of life, but why?

"I do not worry about scarcity, but worry about inequality!"

### Qi (Vital Energy/Anger)

— Defang

How great is "Qi"! Once a person becomes prominent and powerful, he can intimidate his subordinates with "Qi", ordering them around, what a prestige? What about those below? Although they are innocently humiliated, they have to lower their voices, swallow their anger, and dare not refute or argue. Otherwise, their rice bowl may be broken. So, the big cow suppresses his anger in his chest, or goes home to "be naughty", venting his anger on his wife and children. Is this what is meant by one crab eating another?

However, there are also people who simply cannot stand other people's criticism and ridicule. As the saying goes, "fight for honor, not for wealth", they would rather lose money than let others gain the upper hand in words. This is the so-called face-saving faction.

Young people are often criticized as "young and vigorous". The tone is one of blame, meaning that they cannot endure. Indeed, young people all have a courage, and their hearts cannot tolerate unpleasant things! In anger, they can abandon everything and travel far away. Of course, this kind of stimulating "Qi" can also really do great things, but if they blindly act based on a temporary "Qi" and make a desperate gamble, then this "Qi" will not be able to withstand one or two blows and setbacks and will "run out of Qi".

The ancients mostly talked about the method of "cultivating Qi", cultivating our magnificent Qi. The so-called Prime Minister's belly can hold a boat, which means that a person should have a broad mind, be able to tolerate criticisms. To be able to tolerate is to be able to endure. Endurance is not numbness. It has feelings, reflection, examination, and labor. Do not let emotional "Qi" blind the clear-minded intellect. To be rushed and frustrated and make groundless counterattacks, success is only venting one's own anger, failure will cause prejudice, deviating from the greater self and embarking on the wrong path, and treating temper tantrums as the guide for doing things.

### Three Realizations

— Renchuan

In the past, I often suffered from a kind of "indecision and hesitation", which is a fatal injury to "nothing accomplished". Neither donkey nor horse, neither fish nor fowl, finally being looked down upon as "unlearned and unskilled". This is the first point that should be painfully realized.

In dealing with people, one should be kind and amiable; in establishing oneself in the world, one must be honest and self-disciplined. Young people are shallow in knowledge and impatient, "eyes higher than the top of the head, mouth as big as a basket", spouting nonsense, acting as if they are invincible, which will inevitably lead to isolation and failure. This is the second point that should be realized as soon as possible.

Aspiration is the goal of action. Without aspiration is like a "blind man riding a blind horse", jumping around randomly, but still trapped in confusion in the end? Therefore, setting an aspiration is the most important thing. Without setting an aspiration, the footing is unstable, the mind is dizzy, there is no distinction between right and wrong, and one cannot distinguish between the treacherous and the evil. Like floating flowers in the flowing water, one does not know where to return! Isn't such a life dangerous! This is the third point that should be deeply realized.

Social Services

### Fudan University Responds to the North China Emergency Relief

Fudan University students held a general meeting to respond to the North China disaster relief. It was decided to launch a fundraising campaign with a predetermined goal of 50,000 yuan, with a deadline of February 28. More than 10,000 yuan have been raised. After the fundraising is completed, it will be sent to the Finance Department of the Emergency Relief Association. The school also hopes that the whole city

### Chao-Shan Disaster Relief Donations

After the famine occurred in Chao-Shan and other places, readers sent letters calling for help. The Shui Office yesterday collected donations from all walks of life to help the disaster victims in Chao-Shan. The list includes: Li Huaisheng and Xiao Di each donated 50 yuan, Wang Zhenhua donated 40 yuan, Huang Shenfu Hall donated 400 yuan, and the colleagues of Xu Meifu General Office jointly donated 300 yuan, which fully shows the righteousness and courage of the Chao-Shan natives in Shanghai.

### Wannian Cemetery Should Be Built Quickly with Bamboo Fences

— Bai Xia

Yesterday, I went to Wannian Cemetery in Caohejing to sweep the tombs and saw that the north and four sides were all cut off. The cemetery has become a shortcut to Caohejing Town. Since people are trespassing, they will inevitably step on the tombs, and the gravediggers can do nothing about it. It is said that Wannian Cemetery was originally run by Huang Chu Jiu. After his great change, it was hosted by his concubine. She is very familiar with the situation of the cemetery. I hope that the grave owners can find a way to contact each other and elect a person in charge to help Mrs. Huang deal with it. The north and west sides must at least be surrounded by bamboo fences, otherwise it will be difficult to achieve the purpose of safekeeping. As for the cost, it can be divided equally by the grave owners, and the Huang family cannot be completely blamed for undertaking this arduous task.

### General Situation of Buddhist Congee Kitchen

The Nanshi Buddhist Congee Kitchen was established in August 1942. As of the end of April 1943, it has distributed food to 650,054 destitute people (each serving is for about two people, so there are actually one million people), with a total expenditure of 376,605 yuan and 45 cents for food, fuel, office expenses, etc. The income from donations and sideline profits is 321,818 yuan and 90 cents. The overdraft is 54,781 yuan and 55 cents. The current stock in the warehouse can only last until the end of May. It is found that there are four congee kitchens in Nanshi, and three of them have been closed one after another. The remaining one is the Buddhist Congee Kitchen. At present, the consumption required is about 50,000 yuan per month. Recently, the directors ordered that the target of congee distribution should be the poor and disabled who are over five years old and under fifty years old. They also hope that all circles will donate. Receipts will be sent to the Trust Department of Jincheng Bank on Jiangxi Road, Shen Bao on Hankou Road, Xinwen Bao on Sichuan Road, Qian Qin Bank on Tianjin Road, and the Buddhist Congee Kitchen in Guandi Lane, Lao Ximen, Nanshi (telephone number 011070667).

### Art Academy Discusses Scholarship Quota

The New China Art Academy at 270 Chengdu Road was founded by Tan Zhengjian, Lu Si, Liu Rukui, Yang Yinshi, and Yang Hewenyi. It has two departments: film and theater and literature. It has now begun to register students. Mr. Zhang Mingqiu, who is enthusiastic about art education, generously donated five scholarships to poor students in the Literature Department of the academy. All young people who are determined to enter the academy but are really unable to afford it can apply to participate in the examination. Those who are admitted will be exempted from all tuition fees. Actors are also being recruited to train new actors at the academy.

Acknowledgment: Qianzhuang Pu Jiting, a kind gentleman from Zi Suo, delivered one hundred bottles of salt-made epidemic prevention water donated by Mr. Renai, instructing us to distribute them to poor teachers. We hereby acknowledge this.

Lost and Found: This morning, someone found a bunch of keys at the entrance of this building. The owner is asked to claim them at this office.
