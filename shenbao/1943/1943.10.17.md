### On the Two-Nation Conference

— Mu Gong

The tripartite conference of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is about to begin. As this world war enters a decisive stage, this political move by the anti-Axis powers is of significant and thought-provoking importance. There is no need to elaborate. I will now analyze the motives, themes, intentions of the three countries, and possible trends of the conference from an objective and impartial standpoint, in order to help the people of our country understand the international situation. Perhaps this will not be entirely without meaning.

The preparation for the tripartite conference dates back to the Quebec Conference of Roosevelt and Churchill. At that time, Britain and the United States did not invite the Soviet Union to participate in the strategic meeting of the anti-Axis countries, and the Soviet side indicated that there was "no need to participate," which actually showed the "superficial unity and inner discord" of the anti-Axis countries. Therefore, at the close of the meeting, news spread that Roosevelt and Churchill were eagerly hoping to meet with Stalin in person in order to maintain the unity of the three countries in the anti-German war. However, considering the actual situation of the dispute, Roosevelt was unable to endure the hardships of going to Moscow, and Stalin clearly stated that he could not leave the Soviet territory. Therefore, it was proposed that a tripartite foreign ministers' conference should be held first, before the meeting of the three giants, in order to clarify some obstacles to strengthening wartime unity among the three countries and explore possible conditions for continued cooperation after the war, in order to find more appropriate countermeasures. Under the general premise of jointly opposing Germany, we will strengthen the cooperation of the three countries in the military, political, and economic fields. I think that although the ultimate goals of the three countries are different, the motives of this tripartite foreign ministers' conference are almost the same.

So, what issues will the US-British-Soviet conference discuss? From the perspective of the international war situation, perhaps all three parties have a demand for a unified strategy and coordinated operations? However, it seems that the participants in the meeting are all diplomatic figures. Obviously, this meeting will not touch on military affairs. Because, the Soviet Union is certainly unwilling to talk about the strategy in the Pacific, but Britain and the United States are afraid of hearing about the "blunders" of the second front again. Without discussing military affairs, and focusing on diplomacy, it is natural to discuss political issues. This is the core of this meeting. Except for the Soviet Union's silence, we have already heard various rumors and speculations. The most likely topics of this meeting will be: (A) issues related to the current diplomatic problems of the three countries, and (B) issues related to the post-war international order. As for the former, it includes the problems of the Balkan countries, the problems of the Near East and the Middle East, the problems of the three Baltic countries, the problems of Finland and Poland, and the problems of the Mediterranean, etc. These problems are interrelated and have complex relationships. As for the latter, it is fundamentally an illusory problem. Of course, judging by the urgency of the situation, the focus of this meeting seems to be on resolving current diplomatic problems and strengthening cooperation.

The countries participating in the meeting obviously have their own plans. Leaving aside the contradictions between Britain and the United States for the time being, in this meeting, the subtle relationship between the capitalist Britain and the United States and the socialist Soviet Union is also thought-provoking. Reports from Berlin and London said that the Soviet Union will make the following requests at this meeting: "The Baltic coastal countries will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; the eastern part of Poland up to the Curzon Line will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; Bessarabia will be incorporated into the Soviet Union; the borders stipulated in the Soviet-Finnish treaty after the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939 will be recognized; the Soviet Union's close mutual assistance with Romania, Bulgaria, Yugoslavia, and Iran." But the above items from to are actually the Soviet-Finnish borders set by the results of the Soviet-Finnish War in 1939 and the western borders of the Soviet Union before the outbreak of the German-Soviet War in 1941. In the Soviet Union, it cannot be regarded as a "request" or need to make a "request", but the British and American sides want to use "recognition" of this border as a bargaining chip in the negotiation. Therefore, the Soviet side has already declared a few days ago that "this meeting will not discuss border issues" in order to avoid unnecessary complications. Objectively speaking, what the Soviet Union hopes from Britain and the United States today is very clear, that is, concentrate all efforts to open up the Western Front, that is, the real second front; give the Soviet Union more and more substantial material assistance; abandon anti-Soviet activities in the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Near East, the Middle East and other small countries; do not rush to discuss post-war issues during the war, including the so-called border issues, and must strengthen the cooperation of the three countries under the slogan of "Germany First".

However, Britain and the United States are very wary of the Soviet Union. Regarding the "risky actions" of opening up the Western Front, they are unwilling to lightly meet the Soviet Union's demands. Even the so-called material assistance has always maintained a certain limit, and they always maintain the vigilance of "raising a tiger". At the same time, because of the fear of the future development of the socialist system, they cannot but raise the issue of the post-war order today. As for the issues of the Balkans, the Mediterranean, the Baltic Sea, and the Near East and the Middle East, they must be considered "in the long term" under the premise of preventing Soviet activities. What particularly aroused the fear of Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union and made them eager to suppress it is: the Soviet Union's activities in the Balkans; the development of the Polish army organization in the Soviet Union; the expansion of the red forces in Africa and other places after the Soviet Union joined the Mediterranean Mixed Committee; the new development of the relationship between the Soviet Union and Turkey and the small countries in the Near East and the Middle East; the contradiction between the Soviet Union's organization of the "Free German" political institutions in the country and the policies of Britain and the United States, etc. All these issues require a preliminary solution at this meeting, otherwise, strengthening unity during the war is out of the question, let alone continued cooperation after the war.

Can the tripartite conference solve these problems? Even the most optimistic anti-Axis observers are afraid that it is difficult to make a judgment! However, there are a few facts that really make Britain and the United States feel a headache. First, the Soviet Union has been independently containing 200 divisions of the German army until now. Therefore, it is impossible not to recognize the Soviet Union's strongest voice at the meeting; what's more, the rumors of a possible German-Soviet peace treaty inevitably make Roosevelt and Churchill feel frightened! Secondly, the Soviet Union's victory to some extent in the summer offensive is obviously quite beneficial to the Soviet Union's prestige on the international stage and its position in diplomacy with Britain and the United States. Britain and the United States cannot but be eclipsed in this regard. In the face of this fact, as the Japanese Western Asahi Shimbun said on October 7, "Britain and the United States, fearing the increase in Soviet diplomatic pressure following the progress of the Eastern Front, first tried to ease this pressure, and they will not hesitate to use humble words and generous gifts in form." If so, the future of the tripartite conference seems to be "self-evident".

### Japanese Army in Burma Advances in Several Routes, British Concentrate Forces on Indian Border

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) The Japanese headquarters announced at 3:00 pm on the 16th that the Chongqing army is attempting to retake Burma and is currently concentrating its forces in southwestern China. The Imperial Army in Burma is preventing it from launching an offensive, and began attacking from Tengyue and Myitkyina in the early part of last month, and is still breaking through the Chongqing army everywhere and pushing forward.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency Telegram) The enemy army, in order to launch a general offensive to retake Burma during the rainy season, has been actively strengthening its war preparations and strengthening its blind bombing of Burma since the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Forces in Southeast Asia, Mountbatten, arrived in New Delhi. It has also concentrated approximately ten divisions of troops on the front line of the Burma-India border in an attempt to invade. On the 8th of this month, 200 enemy soldiers attempted to invade Maungdaw with 16 boats to scout the strength of the Japanese army, but they were annihilated. At the same time, the Burma Expeditionary Force under Chen Cheng of the Chongqing army, based in Kunming, also responded to this, and drew more than ten divisions from the Fifth Group Army led by Du Yuming, the Ninth Group Army of Guan Linzheng, and the Eleventh Group Army of Song Xilian, attempting to advance from Yunnan to northern Burma. The Japanese army in that area, in order to give the Chongqing army a fatal blow this month, launched an attack from Tengyue and Myitkyina on the Yunnan border in several routes, breaking through the dangerous Gaoligon Mountains and Great Snow Mountains, and is still advancing fiercely with the force of anger. The collapsing army in that area, in order to urgently solve the shortage of domestic supplies, wants to open a new highway from Baoshan in Yunnan, through Tengyue and Myitkyina, to Assam in northern India. Currently, the Chongqing army gathered in that area no longer uses Soviet-made weapons, but is fully equipped with American-made equipment, and is preparing to start moving under the command of smiling army generals. However, they were suddenly attacked by the Japanese army, and their dream finally turned into a bubble. Because there are dangerous roads in the Gaoligon Mountains and Great Snow Mountains and the torrents of the Nu River in this area, the construction of a new road must cross the humid area before reaching Assam in India. Even without the Japanese army's attack, the project is extremely difficult. Today, the inside story of the Chongqing side is really unspeakable.

### Subtle Soviet-Turkish Relations After Changes in European War Situation, Turkish Ambassador to Soviet Union Arrives in Moscow

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - Moscow dispatch: The newly appointed Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Batour, arrived in Moscow on Friday. Those who welcomed him at the station included members of the Turkish Embassy and representatives of the Soviet Foreign Affairs Committee.

Istanbul, 16th (Central News Agency) - Since the changes in the European war situation, Soviet-Turkish relations have become more subtle. Turkish political figures are extremely concerned about the movements of the Soviet Union due to the upcoming meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the upcoming Mediterranean Commission. It is rumored that there have been clashes between Soviet and Turkish troops on the border, but after investigation, it has been proven that this statement is completely false. It is believed that Soviet-Turkish relations will become more tense in the future. There are three reasons: First, the Soviet army is fighting better in the East, and has landed on the Crimean Peninsula. It is expected that the Soviet army's activities in the Black Sea will become more active. Second, taking advantage of its favorable military situation, the Soviet Union is trying to interfere with the Dardanelles Strait and Turkish rights. Recently, some Soviet newspapers have publicly attacked Turkey's neutral policy. The Turkish government has also used various newspaper editorials to clarify Turkey's unchanged willingness to maintain its neutral policy. Therefore, it is expected that the Soviet Union will increase its pressure on Turkey in the future. Third, Britain seems to be ignoring the tension in Soviet-Turkish relations, so British-Turkish relations have also gradually become colder recently. Turkey believes that the relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are incompatible and it is extremely difficult to achieve full reconciliation. In addition, the recent establishment of the Mediterranean Commission by the anti-Axis countries, its mission is unclear. Therefore, the Turkish political circles are extremely worried that the Soviet Union has sent Foreign Vice Minister Vyshinsky and other representatives to attend the committee, which has actually demonstrated the Soviet Union's intentions towards the Mediterranean.

### Fierce Counterattacks by German Troops on Both Sides of Kiev, Fighting in the Nevel Area Becomes Quiet

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German army launched a counterattack on the 15th, fiercely repelling enemy troops advancing southeast and north of Kiev, destroying 59 enemy tanks.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters military reporter Setorius said: At present, the two major centers of the Soviet offensive are between the Dnieper River near Kiev and the Sea of Azov. The Soviet army is increasing its attacking force in both places, making slight progress at the cost of heavy sacrifices, but still failing to complete its large-scale breakthrough attempt. The German withdrawal from Chaplinka has no decisive impact on the three-week war between the lower reaches of the Dnieper River and Crimea. Chaplinka was originally one of the German bridgeheads east of the Dnieper River, mainly to protect the flanks of the German troops advancing north. It was expected that the Soviet army would launch a fierce attack on it. In fact, Chaplinka is far away from the main defensive line along the river. The German troops stationed there were mainly to meet the vanguard of the Soviet attacking troops. This goal has been achieved in the past three weeks. The German army has now cut off the enemy army on the Volkhov River and has built strong positions on the west bank of the river, and can now head-on attack the attacking enemy army. The Soviet army also failed to achieve its breakthrough wishes in the areas of Helderburg west of the entrance to the Nogaisk steppe south of Chapayevka, and Melitopol, only achieving partial breakthroughs in the German lines. The vanguard of the Soviet army advancing towards the eastern section of Melitopol has now encountered a strong German counterattack, and fierce fighting is still underway there. On the Kiev front, the Soviet army has repeatedly launched offensives with heavy troops from the bridgeheads north and southeast of the city, but they have been repelled by our army's counterattacks and have been contained. The pressure exerted by the enemy in the Kiev area is still heavy, and the fierce fighting in the past two days will continue. In other sections of the Dnieper River, the German army has cleared enemy strongholds on both banks. The German army has also stepped up its pressure on the Soviet Berislav bridgehead. There is no change in the Gomel battle situation. The enemy launched an offensive east of Orsha on the Smolensk-Minsk highway, and was severely damaged and repulsed by our army. The fighting in the Nevel area has now become quiet.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line sources: After a fierce artillery preparation, the Soviet army launched a fierce attack on the Kremenchug area from the Dnieper River bridgehead yesterday with strong infantry and tank troops. Fighting is currently underway.

### Soviet Union Replaces Minister of Agriculture

Ankara, 16th (Central News Agency) - The Moscow News Agency reported yesterday that the Soviet People's Commissar for Agriculture has been succeeded by Gusenko. The name of the former Commissar, Sharunov, was not mentioned, and when he left office was never formally announced. The region under the jurisdiction of the Commissar is the most important agricultural production area in the Soviet Union. This leadership change may be due to improper harvest preparations.

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - When the U.S. Air Force bombed Schweinfurt, 80 kilometers east of Frankfurt, on the afternoon of the 14th, it lost 139 aircraft. According to a London dispatch, U.S. 8th Bomber Command Commander Anderson still used his usual deceptive tactics regarding the damage to U.S. aircraft in this operation, only announcing the loss of 62 aircraft, and even claiming that he had long predicted that there would be damage this year, so the loss of a large number of aircraft this time is not surprising. However, according to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt frankly admitted defeat when receiving reporters on the 15th, saying that if the U.S. Air Force suffered such losses every day, the future would be unimaginable. U.S. pilots who participated in the bombing said that the German ground fire was extremely fierce, and the German Air Force fighter squadrons flew up to intercept the U.S. aircraft one and a half hours before they reached their destination, so the bombing was extremely difficult. German News Agency Air Force reporter Haringsleben's commentary on the air battle stated that the total number of U.S. aircraft participating in the bombing was about 300, and about half of them were shot down by the German army. The U.S. military's claim that heavily armored "Flying Fortresses" continued to be reduced to ashes, estimates that at least 1,200 pilots were killed and more than 1,700 machine guns were lost. One of the reasons why the German army achieved this great victory was the reinforcement of air defense equipment. According to a U.S. airman who landed near Munich, the German army used rocket smoke screens in this air battle. However, the German authorities did not explain what equipment and nature this type of smoke screen had.

### German Planes Attack Britain

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a London dispatch, the British Air Force Department announced on the morning of the 16th that German air force units bombed various parts of the British mainland on the night of the 15th.

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - London official visit this morning claimed that the German Air Force bombed targets in southwestern England and East Anglia on Friday night, causing some damage, and there were casualties among residents.

### Germany Officially Recognizes Philippine Republic Government

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reported that after receiving notification of the establishment of the newly independent Philippine Republic Government, the German government, represented by German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, sent a telegram to Philippine President Laurel, officially recognizing the government and wishing its country prosperity.

### Bulgaria's Replacement of Foreign Minister Not Valued by Germany

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: The German political circles do not value Bulgaria's replacement of its Foreign Minister. A German Foreign Ministry spokesman said yesterday that this change was a natural result of Kirov's illness. The new Foreign Minister, Hishmanov, has experience in the diplomatic field and is an old friend of Germany.

### Soviet Union Appoints Ambassador to Egypt

Stockholm, 16th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency. According to Moscow Radio, the Soviet government has appointed Lapin as its ambassador to Egypt.

### Winant to be Appointed Cabinet Member

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: New York message. The New York Post reported that U.S. Ambassador to Britain, Winant, will be appointed as a Cabinet member to replace Secretary of Labor Perkins. The newspaper did not mention Winant's successor.

### Schweinfurt Air Battle, German Army Uses "Inlay Tactics," U.S. Loses Large Number of Flying Fortresses

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters aviation reporter Zipelin, German military sources said that nearly half of the Flying Fortresses that flew over German territory on Thursday were shot down. Of the 300 American bombers attacking Schweinfurt, 139 were destroyed. The success of German air defense is due to two aspects: First, the German army used the latest "inlay tactics." Second, the strengthening of air defense. The so-called "inlay tactics" is to disperse group air combat into individual operations, during which enemy aircraft are attacked one by one. The German army's victory over the Flying Fortresses this time was the enemy's greatest setback in this battle. American bombers fly at extremely high altitudes and have the protection of long-range fighters, but when flying from the coast to the target, they are intercepted by countless Me aircraft. The Me aircraft specifically chose bombers as their targets, and the enemy fighters were unable to do anything about it, so the American bombers became disorganized and suffered heavy losses. Although some enemy aircraft were able to reach their destination in Schweinfurt, they were unable to launch an effective attack due to the lack of organization. The U.S. Air Force lost a large number of aircraft and 1,400 air force personnel and approximately 1,700 machine guns in one day. Therefore, the losses of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Britain since October 1 have been greater than what can be replenished.

### Fierce Fighting Underway North of the Volturno River

German Troops Withdraw from Campobasso

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - Reuters: The British and American armies crossed the Volturno River and gained two footholds on the north bank of the river on Tuesday. On Thursday, the German army launched a fierce attack on the enemy bridgehead and entered the enemy lines. In the afternoon of the same day, the British and American armies launched an attack with a large number of infantry and tank teams on the German outposts on both banks of the Volturno River. German military sources said that the British and American offensive was expected, and fierce fighting is still underway.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities announced on the 15th that the German army in southern Italy had destroyed important military facilities in the city of Campobasso (50 miles northeast of Naples) on the night of the 14th and had withdrawn from the city. The attempt by the U.S.-Canadian Allied Forces to wipe out the German army in the city had completely failed.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - A Reuters military reporter said that the German command adopted a strategy of prolonging the front line and making the British and American armies attack at the beginning of the war in southern Italy, and the German forces deployed were to inflict possible losses on the enemy. The strategy in the past two days has proven to be successful. As stated in the German war report on the 15th, in the past two days, the enemy has attacked the German outposts with a "superior" force. Only a small number of German troops were stationed there, and the main German force did not engage with them, so Alexander could not find out when and where the main German force would engage them. However, the German troops guarding the outposts were all elite troops, who could both contain the enemy's forces and deplete their strength. Therefore, the enemy's battle to seize the German outposts is still in full swing. Therefore, the left wing of the U.S. Fifth Army advancing from the north bank of the Volturno has slowed down. The troops landed by the British army in the Gulf of Gaeta north of the Volturno River encountered strong German resistance and failed to change the battle situation there. The enemy pressure in the Capua area is very strong. The right wing of the U.S. Fifth Army in the mountainous area north of Capua is now advancing towards Miletto and Venafro, and the attacking force is becoming stronger and stronger. The left wing of the British Eighth Army is seizing the outposts of the German army in front of the ancient town of Isérnia and the German positions northeast of Campobasso. The British army has no major activity between Termoli and Vasto. It is clear that Montgomery has transferred his right-wing troops to the left wing to fight.

### German Commander-in-Chief in Western Europe Inspects Mediterranean Defenses

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency) - German Commander-in-Chief in Western Europe, Field Marshal von Rundstedt, recently inspected the defense facilities along the Mediterranean coast. It is reported that the Field Marshal is very satisfied with the strong defensive positions built between the Alps and the Pyrenees over the past few months.

### Tiger Plague Epidemic in Bengal Province, India

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Calcutta, Bengal Province, India, which is facing a severe food crisis, is suffering from a tiger plague epidemic. It is reported that in the Bogura area alone, 250 people have died of the tiger plague in just one week. It has now spread to Calcutta, where 82 cases occurred last week and 97 cases have occurred this week.

### A Glimpse of the Philippine Industry Situation

The Philippines is now undertaking a new mission and hope in the process of carrying out the Greater East Asia War, and is embarking on a path of glorious independence. Geographically, the Philippines is the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. In terms of resources, it is the largest producer of national defense resources in the southern regions. The future development of the New Philippines is indeed promising. In addition to mineral resources, it also possesses abundant resources such as copra, hemp, and cotton. With the progress of future development, the Philippines, as a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has taken on an extremely important task.

So, in what direction should the Philippine economy proceed in the future? First, it is to ensure the resources to enhance war power that are directly related to the execution of the war. Second, it is to develop industries that make the Philippine economy the center and become a link in the Co-Prosperity Sphere economy. The former includes mineral resources such as copper, manganese, and ore, and the latter includes copra, hemp, cotton, wood, and oils. On the other hand, the domestic food problem and the security problem have a great impact on industrial development and are required to be resolved as soon as possible. In terms of food countermeasures, the establishment of a self-sufficiency system for rice, which is a staple food for islanders, requires the authorities to thoroughly re-examine all aspects of agriculture. The production target is projected to be 63.85 million cavans (one cavan equals four dou and one sheng). Under the "Five-Year Production Increase Plan," preparations are being actively carried out, and an annual budget of 〇〇 is allocated to improve irrigation and drainage facilities, increase the propagation of excellent varieties, improve cultivation methods, increase the production of self-supplied fertilizers, and utilize idle land. Japanese and Filipino agricultural personnel work together to increase production. The following will examine the progress of individual industries that serve as war materials and become the center of the economy.

Mining

Among the occupied territories in the South, the Philippines is considered to be the first in terms of surveyed mineral resources and has a promising future. In 1940, the total number of mines in the Philippines was 80, with a total mineral production value of 92.62 million pesos (Philippine currency). Among them, the gold mining industry accounted for 85% of the total, amounting to 76.83 million pesos, silver mining 1.98 million pesos, ore mining 4 million pesos, ship mining 118,000 pesos, 2.61 million pesos, iron 560,000 pesos, and manganese 1.42 million pesos. It is no exaggeration to say that the Philippine mining industry is a gold mining industry. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, there has inevitably been a change, and its focus has shifted from the gold mining industry to copper, ore, and manganese. Therefore, industries such as gold and silver inlaying, which are directly related to the war, will inevitably be reorganized, and their surplus machinery will be transferred to important mining industries. The total number of mines was originally 80, but after reorganization, only 〇〇 remained, placed under military management and operating smoothly.

Agriculture

Philippine agriculture has always been relatively well-developed, but most of the major food crops, starting with rice, have relied heavily on overseas imports, which is a fatal flaw. With the establishment of the Co-Prosperity Sphere economic system in the future, further adjustments are needed.

Hemp

The annual production of Manila hemp is approximately 〇〇 tons. Domestic demand is approximately 〇〇 tons, and the remaining 〇〇 tons can be exported to Japan and various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Currently, this material is used as a raw material for shipbuilding, weaving, hat making, papermaking, etc., and its demand is greatly increasing. In the future, the supply of hemp within the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere will be determined to be supplied by the Philippines alone, and therefore Philippine hemp is of great significance. To increase production, the authorities provide various conveniences, engage in purchasing and adjusting prices to maintain market prices, improve cultivation and production methods, and increase the mechanical power of hemp manufacturing. The factories in various places are moved to Taibao, where collection, manufacturing, and transportation are concentrated, and efforts are made to increase production.

Copra

Copra, like Manila hemp, is an important industry in the Philippines and occupies an important position. The Philippines has one of the world's leading copra production volumes, and about 4 million islanders have relied on this industry for their livelihood in the past. The resources are extremely rich, and because small industries in various places are invested and managed by individuals, they have a great impact on the economic life of the islanders, and thus have great significance in grasping the hearts of the people. The planting area is approximately 〇〇 acres, the number of trees is approximately 〇〇 thousand, and the copra production volume is approximately 〇〇 tons. Currently, it is widely transported to various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, with Japan as the center. The increase in copra production depends greatly on the smooth operation of collection. To achieve effective unified control and purchasing, the "Philippine Copra Purchasing Association" is established, dividing the production areas into several regions and stipulating the purchasing volume for each region. The purchasing volume projected for this year has exceeded 〇〇 tons. If the Philippines can fully purchase copra, the Co-Prosperity Sphere's copra needs will be sufficiently supplied by the Philippines alone.

The development of the oil industry using copra as raw material is also an urgent task at present. Before the war, with small-scale mechanical power, the annual production of coconut oil was 300,000 tons, and the annual production of heavy oil substitute fuel was 180,000 tons, making it the only coconut oil production area in the South. It is not only manufacturing coconut oil, but also starting to manufacture high-grade oils such as hardened oil and lubricating oil. The various oil extraction factories in the suburbs of Manila are moved to the rural areas of the production areas to enhance the oil industry.

Sugar

In Philippine agriculture, the most important issue and the one that has a great impact on future industrial development is the sugar industry. It accounted for 40% of the Philippines' total exports in the past, with an annual production of 〇〇 tons and an annual revenue of more than 100 million pesos for the national treasury. Of the approximately 〇〇 tons of sugar produced, approximately 〇〇 tons are consumed domestically, and the remaining 〇〇 tons of export markets have been blocked due to the war. The future is bound to change. A part of the sugar industry has been converted into cotton production under the Greater East Asia economic plan.

Cotton

The transition from sugar to cotton production has been quite successful during the trial period last year, overcoming all unfavorable conditions. Although there is no room for discussion on land conditions, considerable effort is still needed in technical guidance to complete the five-year plan of 〇〇 piculs. However, in the first year, experience has been gained and improvements have been made in various aspects such as land improvement, cultivation technology guidance, cultivation of excellent varieties, and pest control. With the preparation of various necessary conditions, cotton cultivation has already been implemented this year, and it is planned to ensure a harvest of 〇〇 piculs of cotton. The number of Japanese technicians has also greatly increased this year, already exceeding one hundred. They are studying cultivation countermeasures that match the land conditions, pre-calculating the timing of droughts and rainy seasons, and preventing them to ensure perfection.

The development of the spinning industry is also in the plan. The spinning industry that has been reorganized in Japan is being actively moved to the Philippines. 〇〇 spindles have already been moved, and combined with local machinery and equipment, a powerful factory has been completed. In terms of the need for cotton cloth, Philippine cotton cultivation will make a great contribution. In addition, the promising industries in the Philippines are timber and fisheries. Timber is centered on Mindanao Island, with thousands of acres of forest land. After the outbreak of the war, it was often transported to Japan as an exchange item.

### Strict Prohibition of Adulteration in the Sale of Grains, Oils, and Sugar

The authorities are in charge of the planned export of grains, oils, and sugar to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. However, the sales firms also conducted secret inspections in advance. Recently, a small number of firms have been illegally adulterating and selling goods, hoping to obtain extra profits. It is now learned that the authorities have decided to strictly prohibit such incidents. If it is found to be true, in addition to being punished according to the law, the sales qualification will also be revoked.

### Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association Decides on Organizational Regulations, Grain Control Council Passes Measures for Procurement Certificates

Central News Agency: The Rice Grain Control Committee is actively preparing to urge merchants in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special city areas of Nanjing and Shanghai to organize a Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association to meet the needs of the people's food. Branch offices will be set up to engage in rice grain procurement. The association also continued to hold plenary committee meetings the day before yesterday and yesterday, resulting in the amendment and passage of: Interim Organizational and Operating Rules for the Preparatory Committee of the Local Rice Grain Procurement Trade Association, Interim Operating Regulations for the Local Offices of the Rice Grain Control Committee, Operating Rules for the Rice Grain Control Committee, and Measures for Applying for the Issuance of Rice Grain Procurement Certificates and Rice Grain Transportation Passports. The above resolutions will be submitted to the Executive Yuan by the Commerce Control Council for approval and promulgation. It is learned that the various district offices of the association and the local rice grain procurement trade associations will be established around the 20th of this month. The preparatory committees of the local procurement trade associations will be designated by the registered and surety-paid procurement merchants in each region to take charge of the organization. The local offices of the association will be divided into twelve districts: Shanghai District, Nanjing District, Yangzhou District, Suzhou District, Su-Song-Chang-Jia District, Taizhou District, Huzhou District, Wuhu District, Luhe District, Suzhou First, Second, and Third Period Districts, Zhenjiang District, Taihu Southeast First Period District, and Taihu Southeast Second Period District. Each branch office will have one chief director and one or two deputy directors. The internal organization includes: General Affairs, Finance, and Business departments. It is heard that the association will soon convene a meeting of the preparatory committees of the local procurement trade associations to discuss the main points of the association's organization and to be responsible for the procurement of rice grains. As for the surety deposits to be paid by the procurement merchants in each region, the original deadline was the 15th of this month, but since some are unable to rush to complete the procedures due to the long distance, it will be extended to noon on the 19th of this month.

### Private School Teachers' Subsidies to be Issued on the 20th, Approved List Sent Out

According to Shanghai News reporters inquiring from the Education Authorities, the issuance of subsidies for private schools is largely prepared. The lists of teachers applying for subsidies from various schools have been sent in, and after review and completion by the authorities, the approved receipts will be sent to the schools separately, and the persons in charge of the schools will go to collect them on the 20th. The authorities have initiated a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan to teachers in private schools, entirely out of concern for the difficult treatment of teachers under the current situation, and have tried to add a little support so that teachers can stabilize their work in their positions. Therefore, it is hoped that colleagues in the education field will appreciate the authorities' hard work.

### Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Holds First Board Meeting, Passes Multiple Important Cases

The Shanghai Branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association held its first executive board meeting at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 16th) on the 14th floor of the Guobin Hotel to decide on the steps for the development of the association's affairs and discuss various important cases.

Future meetings will be held on the Thursday of the third week of each month.

### Movement of Leather Within the City Not Restricted, Rawhide Purchase Plan Under Study

Leather is a major commodity and also a military raw material. Since the establishment of the Leather Federation, it has first urged the reorganization of trade associations in various places and the investigation of the production and sales volume of rawhide. On the friendly side, the Sino-Japanese Leather Federation has also been established. The Federation, in view of the need for business liaison, intends to request the establishment of a leather professional department under the National Commercial Control Council to facilitate consultation and implementation. Furthermore, in order to properly supply both military and civilian use of rawhide, which is the raw material for all leather, it is planned to unify the purchase and centralized allocation, with the Sino-Japanese Rawhide Trade Association jointly establishing a joint procurement and sales agency. The detailed plan is currently under consultation and study. As for finished leather, there is currently no talk of purchase. Yesterday's report that the movement of all leather in this city is not allowed, pending registration within a limited time, has been learned from knowledgeable sources that it is not true. The movement of leather within the city is still not subject to any restrictions.

### Murderer Tang Rongchang Executed by Hanging Yesterday

Gao Qinong, who lived at No. 32, Yanjiazhai, Fanhuan Road (Old Jessfield Road), and was engaged in the pig intestine business, was constantly lowering the selling price when buying and selling pig intestines, which violated the rules of the union and affected the business of other intestine businesses, causing resentment. On the morning of July 21, 1941, a group of thugs suddenly broke into Gao's house and opened fire, killing Gao and his wife. It was not until 1942 that Tang Rongchang (34 years old), a Wuxi native, was captured by the former Public Concession Police, and was interrogated and sentenced to death by the former First Special Court. The sentence has been finalized and awaiting execution. The Shanghai Local Procuratorate has received instructions from the Ministry of Justice to execute the criminal on a scheduled basis. Yesterday morning, the Local Procuratorate took Tang from the Shanghai Prison and escorted him to the execution ground outside the Second Branch Prison of Shanghai. After the prosecutor questioned his year and place of birth, he verified his identity and executed him by hanging according to law.

### Coal Balls in Short Supply, Difficult to Purchase, Fuel Panic Needs Adjustment

Coal balls, an indispensable fuel for residents every day, have become increasingly scarce in the past week. Residents are finding it difficult to purchase them, and there is a risk of being forced to stop cooking. Therefore, the authorities should be consistent and immediately send personnel to thoroughly investigate the truth and adjust the supply situation. It is generally believed that although it is difficult to purchase scattered coal balls recently, the various manufacturers still deliver them to direct users as usual. At the same time, residents, eager to alleviate the fuel panic, are purchasing from the black market, where the price is said to be more than double the standard price limit. According to those familiar with the coal ball market, the true raw material (white coal powder) for manufacturing coal balls is only 50%, with 30% being coal slag and 20% being yellow mud. Therefore, the burning power has obviously decreased. The reserve of white coal powder used to manufacture coal balls is still quite abundant, and the source continues to arrive. It is allocated by the relevant authorities on a regular basis, but the current situation of no goods available on the market is unexpected.

### City Propaganda Department Holds First Regular Press Conference Yesterday to Discuss Various Municipal Issues

Central News Agency dispatch: To improve the knowledge of municipal facilities among reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in the city, and to ensure the accuracy of news reporting, the City Propaganda Department held its first regular press conference yesterday at 10 a.m. in the conference room on the second floor of the City Hall. Attendees from the press included: Matsudaira Kyushu (Domei News Agency), Cheng Yiping (Central News Agency), Jiang (China Daily), Liu Han (Shen Bao), Li Zhi ( ), Saki Kunio (Mainland News), Tang Xiongfeng (Ping Bao), and Yu Zhi (News ). Representatives from various government agencies included: Huanxiang (Third Police Bureau, Baojia Office), Xu Ming (Public Works Bureau), Shen Hua (Huxi Police Bureau), Zhou Xihuang (Food Bureau), Chen Jiufeng (First District Baojia Committee), Cu Tiehan (Public Utilities Bureau), Jin Pingshan (City Baojia Committee), Xu Rong (Second Police Bureau), Wei Zhonggong (Finance Bureau), as well as Director Liang Xiuyu and Secretary Jiang Qiqi of the department, totaling more than twenty people. Director Liang presided over the meeting, beginning with introductory remarks, stating that today's regular press conference was decided upon based on the previous Municipal News Reporting Liaison Meeting. Since the establishment of the Propaganda Department, it has strived to establish close contact with various newspaper offices. At the same time, in order to ensure the accuracy and speed of news sources for municipal news reporting, the newspapers also hoped that the Propaganda Department would hold regular press conferences. The newspapers would submit municipal issues in advance, and the Propaganda Department would contact various agencies to send representatives to answer questions, so as to ensure that the people understand the direction of municipal facilities, and so on. Then, representatives from various agencies answered the following questions in turn:

Current Baojia System Issues

(Shen Bao asked: What are the current Baojia regional divisions? What is the organizational structure of the Baojia offices in the first and eighth districts? Is the Baojia a subordinate agency of the police bureau, or a parallel agency? What is the scope of authority of the Jia Committee organized by citizens? There are differences in the selection of self-defense corps in the first district and civilian police on duty in the eighth district. What is the reason for this?) (The First and Eighth District Baojia Committees replied:) Regarding the boundaries of the Baojia districts and the status relationship with the police bureau, the following answers can be given: In the past, there were seven districts within the Shanghai International Settlement, and another naval Baojia district in Hongkou. The municipal districts were the municipal western district, which belonged to the Municipal Baojia Committee. After the recovery of the concessions, the Baojia office in the first district was directly under the Baojia Office of the First Police Bureau. In the eighth district, a Baojia branch office was established separately. Regarding the issue of the authority of the Baojia Committee organized by citizens, the name of the Baojia Committee organized by citizens is the Baojia Guidance Committee, which is not an executive agency, but a consulting agency for the Baojia. Regarding the difference in service between the self-defense corps and civilian police corps in the first and eighth districts, the regulations in the first district are stricter. All those aged between twenty and forty-five without disabilities are required to be on duty, while the eighth district stipulates that they must be between twenty-five and thirty-five years old. Moreover, because those on rotation are selected through a draw, they do not all take turns. This situation naturally involves degrees of importance. Since the Baojia in the eighth district has been managed by the Baojia office and branch office, there has been a gradual trend of rectification. If there are unscrupulous elements who use the name of the Baojia to exploit the people, it is hoped that they will be reported at any time, so as to ensure the soundness of the Baojia organization and achieve the goal of maintaining local security.

Rice Rationing Issues

(Ping Bao asked:) Since the city implemented per capita rice rationing, prices have increased, while the amount has decreased. Moreover, the announcement often includes unclear and indefinite wording such as "either white rice, brown rice, or broken rice," which provides opportunities for rice shops to engage in malpractice. The above are important issues concerning the people's food supply. Are there any methods to improve this in the shortest period of time? (Food Bureau replied:) The reduction in rice allocation is due to the inability to transport smoothly, and the increase in transportation costs is also a reason for the increase in rice prices. The rice quality and quantity allocation issues are under the Rice and Grain Adjustment Committee, and because there is no annotation on the warehouse receipt, the distribution can only be done according to the rice after it is released from the warehouse. The urban area has always required each rice shop to sell white rice, brown rice, and broken rice clearly in accordance with the announcement. As for the above situation, it is probably a phenomenon of the first and eighth districts, and the right to allocate rice in the first and eighth districts does not belong to the Food Bureau. Regarding prices and quantities, we are actively working to improve.

Iron Gate Removal Issue

(Ping Bao asked:) The iron gates at the junction of the city and the former concessions were initially said to be completely removed, then completely opened, and then increased in number, but none of this has been implemented so far. These iron gates should be completely removed as soon as possible to give a new impression and facilitate transportation. What measures will the municipal authorities take in this regard? (Public Works Bureau replied:) Regarding the issue of removing the iron gates at the border between the former city and the concession, the Public Works Bureau planned to prepare for the removal at the end of July when the concessions were recovered. Later, the police department believed that it was better not to remove them for the sake of current police and security relations.

Tram Through-Service Issues

(Ping Bao asked:) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, public transportation in Shanghai has been greatly reduced, and the problem of citizens traveling is very serious. This can be seen from the congestion of trams on various routes. In the future, are there any preparations for improving this? The trams in the first and eighth districts used to be able to run through all routes, but now almost all stop at the border. The through-service of trams in the two districts would greatly facilitate citizens. Can the method of restoring full through-service be studied now? The population of Nanshi has recently increased, but public transportation is still lacking. The restoration of trams may not be possible for a while due to a lack of materials, but there is not much difficulty in operating public charcoal-powered vehicles. Is there any possibility of restoring public transportation in Nanshi in the future! (Public Utilities Bureau replied:) Regarding the issue of tram through-service in the first and eighth districts, the Public Utilities Bureau consulted with the tram company as soon as the concessions were recovered and has already restored part of it. Routes 18 and 24 have now been connected through the two districts. Routes 17, 6, 5, and 12 cannot be restored to their original state for the time being. Regarding the issue of operating public buses in Nanshi, there is a shortage of materials and various difficulties. It may be difficult to implement public buses in Nanshi for the time being.

Short Comment

### Improving Transportation

At yesterday's general meeting of the Citizens' Welfare Association, there was a proposed resolution requesting the improvement of transportation. Transportation is supposed to primarily serve the convenience of travelers. If travelers feel inconvenienced, the quality of transportation can be easily imagined.

Just considering the Beijing-Shanghai Railway, before the July 7th Incident in 1937, the two railways were well-managed and convenient for travelers, as anyone who traveled those routes could attest. However, the current state of transportation on those two railways is so painful that one doesn't need to travel to experience it. Even a visit to the North Station reveals chaotic scenes of queuing, pushing, and quarreling, resembling a picture of chaos. Under such circumstances, there are those who pay for assistance and are forced to squeeze through, and there are those whose luggage disappears in an instant.

This spring, we appealed on behalf of travelers, requesting the transportation authorities to improve the situation. The authorities gradually rectified the situation, and public opinion was favorable. However, it soon reverted to its old state. Our suggestions to the transportation authorities have been detailed and thorough, and the initial willingness of the authorities to listen to our concerns was commendable. Unfortunately, they lacked the perseverance to maintain the improvements, resulting in the current situation deteriorating.

We solemnly reiterate: "The primary purpose of transportation is to facilitate travel." We urge the transportation authorities to pay close attention to and pursue methods to achieve this goal at all times and in all places. If the Huazhong Railway Company's resources are limited and it cannot rectify the entire situation, then the municipal authorities, relevant parties, and social organizations should assist in solving the problem. They must not turn a blind eye and allow travelers to suffer. We believe that it is a disgrace to a modern country if transportation cannot serve the convenience of travelers.

Economic Commentary

### Promoting the Chemical Industry

The Third East Asia Economic Beijing Conference was held at Huairentang, Zhongnanhai, Beijing, from September 27th. The specific issue that was particularly discussed was how to overcome obstacles to increased production, and the chemical industry in North China deserves special attention from people in Central China. Speaking of the chemical industry, with the soda and acid industries using salt as raw materials as the center, industries such as glass, oil, pharmaceuticals, papermaking can be developed. However, the development of these industries in North China is slower than other industries, due to the lack of electricity, materials, and funds. Therefore, at the conference, some people strongly advocated the establishment of a chemical industry review agency, "which attracted considerable attention."

Why does the chemical industry particularly deserve attention from people in Central China? First, the chemical industry in Central China already has a considerable foundation, and it is relatively easy to develop and expand. Second, the three basic conditions required by the chemical industry—electricity, materials, and funds—are not a problem in Central China. It only depends on how we develop these conditions to meet the needs of the chemical industry. Taking electricity as an example, "the total power generation of various power plants in Shanghai is about 200,000 KVA or more, but industrial electricity is still felt to be insufficient, and the chemical industry is no exception. Adjustments should be made frequently to supplement the lack of power for the chemical industry. As for materials, that is, raw materials, the primary raw material for the chemical industry is salt, and salt is the richest natural product in the Central China area. The only issue is how to solve the supply problem, otherwise even table salt will have problems, let alone the raw materials for the chemical industry? As for funds, Central China, especially Shanghai, has plenty of funds. It only depends on how to enhance the public's understanding of the chemical industry and encourage them to invest more in the chemical industry, thereby benefiting the public. Judging from the interest that investors have shown in stocks of new drugs and papermaking industries, this understanding seems to have improved significantly!

### Cotton Production on the Beijing-Shanghai Line Is Not Abundant, Prices Gradually Increasing

This year's new cotton has already entered the market. New cotton has been listed in cotton-producing areas along the Beijing-Shanghai line, such as Taicang and Jiangyin. When cotton yarn and cloth were not yet purchased by the government, cotton prices soared. Later, due to the fall in yarn and cloth prices, cotton prices also fell. Two months ago, the price per dan fell by half. Recently, the Cotton Department of the Commerce and Trade Control Commission implemented centralized purchase of cotton. In order to protect the interests of farmers, the authorities of the commission were unwilling to suppress cotton prices excessively. Therefore, cotton prices, which were unable to rise, gradually showed signs of recovery. As of today, in various cotton-producing areas such as Taicang and Jiangyin, the selling price of new ginned cotton at the beginning of the season has risen, and has subsequently increased gradually. According to cotton industry insiders, during the peak cotton blooming season this year, the harvest was not very good due to the damage caused by the hurricane. Therefore, the selling price of new cotton is expected to continue to rise in the future.

### Invigorating Wartime Sentiment

Banning Decadent Songs

Not long ago, the Chang Bureau issued an order to ban songs that violate national policy in order to purify the people's political thought. However, this is really not enough. It is also necessary to ban the decadent songs of "      sounds" in order to invigorate the national spirit.

In the past two or three years, due to the hoarding and manipulation by merchants, a distortedly prosperous situation has been created in Shanghai. All entertainment has trended towards the enjoyment of low-level material desires. Dance halls, cafes, and large hotels have sprung up like bamboo shoots after a rain. As a result, a large number of songs about "flowers" and "moons" have emerged. Furthermore, through the broadcasting of radio and the circulation of song selections, they have penetrated into all levels of society. On the streets and in the alleys, one can hear a coolie or even an eight- or nine-year-old child humming lyrics such as "Brother, oh brother" and "Sister, oh sister." This not only dampens the ambition of the general public but also affects the education of young people. If these songs are allowed to continue to exist and continue to develop their influence, the future of the nation is truly unimaginable. I wonder if the authorities have paid attention to this? (A Certain Person)

Promoting Popular Music

Music and the people are extremely closely related. The Book of Music says: "The people have blood and qi, and knowledge, and they have the constancy of sadness and joy. They respond to external things and are moved, and then their minds take shape. Therefore, when the sound of urgent slaughter arises, the people think of sorrow; when the sound of harmonious, slow, easy, complex, concise, and restrained music arises, the people are peaceful and happy; when the sound of coarse, sharp, fierce, rising, spirited, and broad music arises, the people are resolute; when the sound of upright, straight, strong, correct, solemn, and respectful music arises, the people are solemn and respectful; when the sound of generous, affluent, inwardly pleasing, harmonious, and moving music arises, the people are ____ ; when the sound of flowing, heretical, evil, respectful, Di, fulfilling, and cleansing music arises, the people are lewd and disorderly...."

However, the music in Shanghai today, whether it is movie theme songs or popular songs in various cabarets, all tend towards hedonism and are mainly about private affairs between men and women. As a result, what is heard on the streets, whether it is pedestrians humming casually or music played on gramophones in shops, is all music for the moment, and soft, saccharine songs about brothers and sisters. Habit becomes nature, and so the general public all take hedonism as a prerequisite, content with ease and accustomed to following the old ways, so that the rich are extravagant and superficial, and the poor deceive each other. Young people fall into debauchery and are infatuated with singing stages and dancing halls, indulging in sensual pleasures. Thus, scholars do not pursue practical learning. Once they get their diplomas, they rejoice that they have a tool to knock on doors with. Merchants only seek profit, hoarding and speculating, ____ their waists growing ever fatter. They spend a thousand gold pieces in a single throw and buy smiles with ten thousand strings of cash. Those who run cabarets also constantly seek novelty and innovation, vying to use sensual pleasures as bait. ____ the one who wears the headscarf, beauty steals his gaze, ____ melodies fill his ears, and he hears and asks about nothing else. As for the government's earnest appeals and the admonitions and criticisms of ____ theories, how can they enter his ears and eyes? How can they cleanse his mind and body? The Marseillaise, a song of revolution, enabled the French Revolution to succeed. The Song of the Rainbow Skirt and Feather Dress almost led to the demise of the Tang Dynasty imperial family. Those in power must not ignore this. Moreover, in these extraordinary times, the survival of a country depends on the strength or weakness of its people's spirit, so wartime music should not be ignored by the wise authorities.

"A wartime nation without wartime sentiment is a shame that the government and the people should share. To speak grandly of participating in the war without any wartime sentiment is a self-deception and even more shameful." (See the April 7th editorial of the Shen Bao).

The spirit of the people is decadent, and all evils are rampant. Under these circumstances, to talk loftily about enriching the country and strengthening the people and seeking to put politics and economics on the right track is truly "to have eyes that can see a thousand miles but forget one's own eyebrows and eyelashes." How can shouting slogans and plastering posters achieve any results? To love ease and hate work is human nature. "Lead the people by example." It is hoped that the government authorities will thoroughly reform all the boring, soft songs and reward and promote wartime popular music in order to correct the people's hearts and inspire their spirit. Other entertainment venues and movie scripts and play plots, etc., must also be ____ and rectified, so that there are normal entertainment venues but no extravagant and wasteful dens of ruin. What should be promoted should be promoted, and what ____ should be eliminated, not neglecting the overall situation because of small evils, and not allowing Shanghai to become a bad place where oranges from the south turn into trifoliate oranges from the north when planted in the north. In this way, the New Movement can ____ advance, the people's hearts can be invigorated, and there will be hope for the revival of the nation. (Liu Hanmin)

Mahjong and Women's Entertainment

Some people think that mahjong is a pastime, but the fundamental purpose of a pastime is how to pass idle time. Now, day and night, even the time for sleeping and resting is spent on this pastime. Whether this is reasonable is self-evident. Others say it is entertainment, but very ____ often, both sides turn red in the face and part on bad terms in order to fight for a single tile. To what extent can this be called entertainment and joy? Therefore, whether viewed from the perspective of pastime or entertainment, it cannot be said that there are sufficient reasons. What is even more heartbreaking is that the average housewife entrusts her children to a nanny and does not care about them at all, only caring about the eight ____ five ____ ; older children ____ on the corner of the mahjong table, pointing and gesturing, actually acting as a dog-headed advisor. Where exactly is the family ____ education? Not ____ losing money, then only the sound of women's stools clattering is heard, only ____ bowls ____ flying about, venting a bellyful of resentment to the fullest extent. As for not recognizing one's relatives and causing domestic unrest, where is family harmony and love? All kinds of bad attitudes ____ can be picked up everywhere. If this goes on for a long time, how will mahjong differ from opium in terms of plunging the people into ruin? If the family is not sound, the foundation for national revival will not be established, and national prosperity and strength will forever be a distant dream!

Although mahjong has been able to penetrate deep into the people today and gain widespread influence, it has its reasons. Taking social interaction as an example, it is indeed ____ simple and convenient. There is a sense that it is indispensable. Therefore, the problem is not mahjong itself but how to eliminate the evils caused by ____ mahjong and how to put mahjong back on the right track. Our research targets are limited to the upper and middle classes, especially the women of the upper and middle classes, because most of them are just lazybones who have nothing to do and use ____ mahjong as their so-called pastime and entertainment. As long as there is a solution for them, the elimination of the evils of mahjong can be easily solved. As for wanting to use the power of the government to achieve the goal of eliminating the evils of mahjong, it is impossible. The government is really powerless to help in this regard. Therefore, the only solution is to seek spontaneous restraint—____ not caring about one's own health and staying up day and night? ____ ____ children's education and lingering in the gaming square? Is it worth sacrificing the harmonious atmosphere of the family, one's own future, and useful time in ____ battle? All kinds of questions should be deeply reflected upon when a person sits down ____ to play mahjong ____ . (The Mahjong Two-Hour League should be given deep sympathy). However, the women of the upper and middle classes, even the young ladies who have received advanced education, have never considered this for a moment, which is truly worthy of tears and weeping. If such women cannot control themselves from mahjong for a day, the evils of mahjong cannot be eliminated for a day!

To fundamentally solve the problem, we must reform women's thinking and promote women's skills, such as needlework, ____ , ____ knots ____ threads, etc. Guide them to have accurate thoughts and understanding, and to have useful work at hand at all times, so that they will not and ____ not waste a lot of time on ____ mahjong. To achieve this goal, the system of women's education really needs to be fundamentally reviewed. It is an undeniable fact that women's education has become a mere decoration for women today. Improper mahjong ____ is a dark side of women's education. The few women who have gained a position in society today are by no means the success of today's women's education but rather the result of their own struggle. Our demand is to reform the system of women's education and make it suitable for the needs of modern countries and societies and the needs of families. Church-style women's education and aristocratic women's education are all to be discarded! Only then will there be hope for family happiness and national revival. (Da Quan)

I have heard that the adulteration of household rice is harmful to the health of citizens, ____ but I have never seen a victim discover it. Unexpectedly, this disaster happened to my family. My little daughter, fifteen years old, had severe abdominal pain on the eleventh of this month. At that time, I suspected it was "sha" and immediately sent her to the hospital for emergency treatment. Unexpectedly, after the doctor's diagnosis, it was acute appendicitis, and surgery was necessary, otherwise her life would be in danger. At that time, I followed the doctor's advice and had the appendix removed. It is said that the appendix was full of fine sand and stones. I traced the source of this thing and could not help but attribute it to the household rice from the past few periods. The quality is poor, and I hope that the general public will pay more attention to it. I also hope that the food authorities will take into account the health of the citizens. It is okay to allocate brown rice, white rice, or broken rice, as long as the quality of the rice is pure and does not contain fine sand and stones.

### Difficulty for Students Going to Other Cities to Obtain Residence Permits

A student's family wrote to explain the difficulty for students going to other cities to obtain residence permits: A young man living in the eighth district went to a certain middle school in Nanjing to study, and his Shanghai household registration was naturally reported. However, the baojia system in Nanjing is different from that in Shanghai. Whether commuting or boarding, as long as there is a student card, it is possible to pass freely everywhere. However, the validity period of the student card ends at the end of the semester. When he returns to Shanghai, he hurriedly takes photos and goes through the procedures for applying for a residence permit. After several weeks, he is afraid of being checked for a residence permit on the road. He does not dare to go out the door. Finally, he gets the residence permit, but then he has to go to Nanjing for the start of school. According to the baojia regulations, it is necessary to cancel the residence permit and report it after leaving Shanghai for more than three months. Thinking that the young man will be back on vacation after more than three months, at that time he will not have a Shanghai residence permit and will not dare to go out. If he is unlucky, he will even get slapped. It is a small matter to go to the line and pay a fine, but a misunderstanding is a big deal, so he does not dare to report it; if he does not report it, he is said to be buying household rice (in fact, it is only one he of rice per day). If he reports it now and then reports it again in the future, the application is so troublesome and the residence permit is obtained so slowly, and the photo and other expenses are so expensive. The baojia office staff do not think it is troublesome, but the baojia chief thinks it is annoying. I wonder if the baojia staff also think that there must be many such facts in Shanghai. Is there a remedy?

### An Appeal from a Shantytown Dweller

I am a shantytown dweller (living in a flat in the Hongkou to Yangshupu area; this house ____ , a house built and managed before the old concession, is not collected ____ donation tickets ____ total ____ shantytown). Recently, I read in your newspaper that soap, matches, and salt have also been rationed, which has greatly reduced the burden on citizens. However, the purchase certificate that is issued is based on the house donation ticket, and it does not mention us shantytown dwellers. Currently, what shantytown dwellers are rationed is only rice flour and oil (the rice flour certificate is issued by the district office, and the oil is bought with the household registration certificate). Sugar has not yet been rationed to this day. If soap, matches, and food ____ are also not rationed, in the future ____ ____ same, then it will be even more unbearable. Therefore, these three necessities are indispensable every day and are more important than sugar. If they are not rationed without a house donation ticket, like in the Zhabei district, there is no house donation ____ are also rationed. The purchase certificate is issued by the baojia office. We shantytown dwellers in the Hongkou district cannot get the same ration, and the jiazhang has no effect. Where should we apply? Please pay attention to this. (Zhou ____ )
