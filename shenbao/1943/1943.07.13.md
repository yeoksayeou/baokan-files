### Further Discussion on Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings

We, having observed the increasing number of refugees and orphaned children in Shanghai in recent years, coupled with the escalating cost of living, despite the hundreds of charitable organizations working to accommodate them, still find the effort falling short. Therefore, considering the urgent need for unified advancement of charitable undertakings, we must focus on a proactive approach, developing with planned organization, and eliminating the serious phenomena in society as soon as possible. On June 26th, we published an essay, proposing the idea of "Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings," hoping that social leaders would come forward to advocate for it. Subsequently, Mr. Kai Lan, Mr. Lin Kanghou, and Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Chairman and Vice Chairmen of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association, respectively, expressed their thoughts. (The full text was published on pages three of this newspaper from July 6th to 8th.) Given the enthusiasm these three gentlemen have always shown for public welfare and charitable endeavors, and their high reputations in all sectors of society, such outstanding opinions will certainly arouse public attention and promote the sound development of charitable undertakings. We look forward to the early realization of this endeavor, our eagerness no less than that of the three gentlemen. As the Shanghai concessions are about to be returned and Shanghai is about to be reborn, we especially hope that all sectors will work together to jointly promote the sound development of Shanghai society. The agreed promotion of charitable undertakings should also be considered a critical aspect.

We have heard that the issues raised by Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng regarding unifying and promoting charitable undertakings could only be voiced by those deeply familiar with its joys and hardships. The content is truly worthy of thorough investigation. However, we believe that, firstly, with regard to unified promotion, it should be handled as a whole. Unification cannot be separate from promotion; rather promotion cannot be apart from unification. The important goal is that the promotion of charitable undertakings in Shanghai must have a unified plan and steps. Secondly, regarding the question of who should unify, we partly agree with the views of the three gentlemen. They believe that it is better for charitable organizations to automatically unify and promote than for the government or officials to unify it alone. This is not to say that official unification is not good, but in terms of the current actual situation, whether in terms of the scale, equipment, achievements, or talent of various undertakings, it is not easy for the officials to unify. We advocate that government agencies should lead and promote unification first, and then various charitable organizations should automatically unify and promote afterward. As for the third point, how to unify and promote, this includes organizational issues, talent issues, investigation, research, design, and funding issues. We deeply feel that the concerns of the three gentlemen are pertinent and worthy of arousing attention and research from all parties.

We have heard that after raising the issues, Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng listed the difficulties in unifying and promoting charitable undertakings, and finally expressed their ideals and practical ways to overcome the difficulties. In addition to our sincere sympathy, we would like to offer another word for correction from the three gentlemen and all those concerned about the future of charitable undertakings in this city. From the organizational aspect of unifying and promoting charitable undertakings, we believe that if there are indeed leading organizations among the current charitable organizations, there is no need to start from scratch. It is enough to reorganize and refresh them. However, what must be achieved is, first, that this organization must have a reputation in society, and its work and undertakings must be believed by various charitable organizations and society; second, this organization must absorb experienced talents who have done well in charitable undertakings in the past or are still doing so to participate in design and promotion work, and must be currently earnestly engaged in charitable undertakings; third, all the work of this organization must be open to the public, and respected gentlemen in society should organize an inspection body to review its work from time to time, and accept public criticism and so as to strengthen its work efficiency. We still feel today that the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association is well-suited to preside over the unified promotion of the undertaking because it has almost all of the above conditions. They seem to have already done a lot of organizational work. However, in the past, the scope of the association's work seemed to be limited to relief for the poor and sick. In fact, charitable undertakings are by no means limited to these two, and perhaps the nature of the association's subsidies to various organizations is not limited to these two either. If it is reorganized and expanded in the future, the scope of work will naturally be expanded to include all charitable undertakings.

Regarding the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, in addition to organization, the most important thing is the issue of funding. The failure of hundreds of charitable organizations in this city to fully achieve their goals is due to the lack of funds. And the biggest difficulty for various charitable organizations is also the lack of funds, as far as we know. We have heard that Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng have proposed organized fundraising methods that are detailed and comprehensive. What we want to add is: in terms of income, there must be planned and organized, total mobilization-style fundraising; in addition to passive relief, such as relief for the old, sick, disabled, we must especially strive for active relief, cooperate with relevant government departments and financial entrepreneurs, and open short-term handicraft, agricultural reclamation, animal husbandry, and other training classes for the unemployed vagrants, the extremely poor men and women, and young beggars, refugees, etc. After a considerable period of training, they will be sent to various appropriate production departments to engage in production work, and when necessary, they can run their own production business without relying entirely on donations. In terms of expenditure, the word "economy" has almost reached the point where every charitable organization has no more to save. However, if unified planning and management can be carried out in planning and management, and rationalized methods can be implemented, perhaps the severity of the funding problem can be alleviated. Secondly, regarding the design issue, on the one hand, concentrate the real talents in the original charitable organizations. On the other hand, select experts from enthusiastic people in the society, and supplement them with personnel selected by relevant government departments and technical talents hired from friendly countries to form an "Advisory Committee" (hypothetical name) to divide the work and cooperate to plan, improve, and promote charitable undertakings. We believe that with the cooperation of all parties, the future charitable undertakings will be able to achieve the due effect. We have heard that the ideal of Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng is not difficult to achieve.

The unified promotion of charitable undertakings is a basic undertaking for transforming society, and it is also a prerequisite for helping to stabilize today's Shanghai society. We hope that the charitable organizations and people from all walks of life in this city will, following the lead of Mr. Lin, Mr. Yuan, and Mr. Deng, express their insightful views and work together to promote its early realization.

### Inspection of the South Completed Successfully - Prime Minister Tojo Returns Safely to Tokyo - Total Duration of Thirteen Days - Politically Significant

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 3:15 PM on the 12th that Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki had completed his visit to Thailand and inspection of various military and political locations in the South, and returned to Tokyo at 3:15 PM on the 12th.

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki, accompanied by Army Ministry's Director of Military Affairs Sato, Vice Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry Yamamoto, Director of Political Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry Uemura, Colonel Yai, Lieutenant Colonel Takahashi, and other staff members, departed from Tokyo on June 30th for the South. He traveled to the front lines of various military and political locations in Vietnam, Thailand, Malaya, Sumatra, Borneo, Java, the Philippines, etc. He held discussions with local government leaders and military, political, and civilian officials in the South, commended their hard work, and inspected the conditions of the Southern residents who were cooperating in the construction of Greater East Asia. He achieved significant results. Having completed his mission, he returned to Tokyo on the afternoon of the 12th, totaling thirteen days.

During his trip to the South, Prime Minister Tojo and his party first made a brief stop in Saigon, Vietnam, on the 3rd to listen to reports on the military situation in Vietnam from the top commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy stationed there. He then traveled to Bangkok, Thailand, where he stayed for two nights. On the 4th, he met with Thai Prime Minister Phibun Songkhram to discuss the collaborative war strategies of Japan and Thailand. The two sides were in complete agreement and subsequently issued a joint statement, confirming that the six British-administered states would be incorporated into Thai territory. On the 5th, he proceeded to Syonan (Singapore) to meet with Field Marshal Terauchi, the Supreme Commander of the Southern Army, to hear reports on the military and political situation, and to comfort the soldiers in the South. He also held discussions with Subhas Chandra Bose, President of the Indian Independence League, and Ba Maw, Chief of the Burmese Executive Administration, and inspected the Indian National Army, offering them encouragement. On the 6th, he inspected the military and political situation in Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, and attended a residents' appreciation meeting in Jakarta. On his return journey, he revisited the Philippines, where he met with Philippine Executive Secretary Vargas, Independent Preparation Committee Chairman Laurel, and other officials, inspected the officials and civilians active in various places under military administration, and gave separate instructions and encouragement. After thirteen days, he has now completed the entire trip and returned home. Prime Minister Tojo's inspection of the South has had a significant impact on completing the Greater East Asia War, uniting the Greater East Asia nations, and promoting the construction of Greater East Asia. Therefore, its political significance is extremely important. Furthermore, according to opinions from political circles here, it is believed that since Prime Minister Tojo had previously visited China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and has now inspected the South, he has practically traveled throughout Greater East Asia. This will not only enable the countries and peoples of Greater East Asia to deepen their understanding of Japan's policies and sincerity, but Prime Minister Tojo will also be strengthened by his personal experiences to fulfill his determination and conviction to complete the war and complete the construction. It can be truly said that the construction of Greater East Asia will unfold with even greater leaps.

### Japanese Prime Minister Releases Impressions of the Trip After Returning Home

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - After returning home, Japanese Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo Hideki immediately issued a statement outlining his impressions of the trip. The gist of his statement is as follows: I was honored to visit Thailand on this occasion, where I had sincere discussions with Prime Minister Phibun and other Thai leaders, and was able to witness the reality of Thailand under the Greater East Asia War. I express my deep respect for the continuous efforts made by the Thai people, united under the leadership of Prime Minister Phibun, to promote Thailand and to thoroughly pursue the Greater East Asia War. I firmly believe that the people of Japan and Thailand will deepen their understanding of each other through my visit to Thailand, and further strengthen their determination to pursue the war. In particular, the views of the Prime Ministers of Japan and Thailand have been completely aligned regarding the new concrete cooperative measures that Japan will take towards Thailand. This is truly gratifying. During my visit to Thailand, I also visited Malaya, Sumatra, and Borneo, inspected the military situation and the real situation of the residents in various places, and was greatly pleased to console the Japanese officers and soldiers and officials and civilians stationed there. In Syonan, in addition to holding talks with Burmese Chief Executive Ba Maw and Indian Independence leader Subhas Chandra Bose, I also had the opportunity to inspect the Indian National Army. Later, in Jakarta, I attended a grand appreciation meeting held by local residents, and when I passed through Manila, I was able to hold talks with members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, which was also very pleasant. Since the occupation of the South, although it has only been a year and a half, it is gratifying that the implementation of extreme policies such as military, economic and cultural development with the sincere cooperation of the indigenous people is proceeding smoothly. I would like to take this opportunity to express my appreciation for the cooperation of the indigenous people. Moreover, the independence preparations in Burma and the Philippines are progressing steadily, and the participation of Indonesian people in politics is also about to be realized concretely. On the one hand, the Indian independence preparation movement is becoming stronger day by day, and the day when India gains freedom and prosperity is not far away, which is especially commendable. For many years, the South has been under the control of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, and has been regarded as an object of exploitation. As colonies, the Southern people were unable to receive education and were bound, leading a life of ignorance and indifference. At this time, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was truly a gift from heaven. Now, the people of both sides have broken away from the shackles of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands, and have taken on the original mission of the Greater East Asia nations, and are preparing for the situation of coexistence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia. Since March of this year, I have visited the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the Philippines. This time, I have visited Thailand and various parts of the South, and the impressions I have gained are very good, which makes me more determined in my belief that the construction of Greater East Asia will be successful. Japan, with this belief in sure victory and success, is determined to move forward towards the path of destroying the aggressors of East Asia. Java occupies an extremely important position in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you have a significant impact on the future of the war situation. I previously stated specifically in the Japanese Parliament that the indigenous people of Java would be granted the right to participate in politics this year. I hope that you will demonstrate your great spirit, and under the command of the local army, work together to engage in construction in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. To achieve this consensus, work hard and strive. I have expressed my thoughts here, and I pray that you will strive to fulfill them.

### Prime Minister Tojo Visits the Philippines Again, Holds Discussions with Military and Political Leaders

Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Hideki arrived in Manila at noon on the 10th, accompanied by Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Greater East Asia Ministry, Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau, Director Uemura of the Political Affairs Bureau of the Foreign Ministry, and other staff members. Supreme Commander Kuroda, Supreme Advisor Murata, and the staff of the Military and Political Administration, the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, and the heads of the Executive Administration greeted him. Amidst the cheers of the citizens lining the streets, he proceeded to the Manila Hotel for rest.

Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - After arriving in the Philippines, Prime Minister Tojo held discussions with Supreme Commander Kuroda and members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee, which have yielded epoch-making results. On the morning of the 11th, he embarked on his journey home, escorted by many officials including the chiefs of staff of the Japanese Army and Navy and the heads of the Executive Administration.

Manila, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 4 PM on the 10th, Prime Minister Tojo held a 40-minute discussion with the members of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee at the Manila Hotel, and hosted a tea party for the members. Chairman Laurel and Member Roxas, who were undergoing treatment, also attended despite their illness. During the event, Prime Minister Tojo and Chairman Laurel delivered speeches successively, and then exchanged views on various matters related to Philippine independence in all sincerity. The gist of Prime Minister Tojo's speech and Chairman Laurel's response is as follows: "Gist of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech": I am extremely pleased with the establishment of the Preparatory Committee and the active progress of various preparatory matters. I hope that all members will make sincere efforts to quickly complete the preparatory work, and I hope that all the people of the Philippines will work together to build a new Philippines and fulfill the Greater East Asia War. "Gist of Chairman Laurel's Response": The members of the Philippine Independence Committee were all selected from the sincere people in all sectors of the Philippines, so I am confident that they will achieve their desired goals. I sincerely appreciate the fact that the Philippines will gain independence. This sentiment of mine not only represents the sentiment of the 18 million people of the Philippines, but is also commonly felt by all East Asian nations liberated from the shackles of the United Kingdom and the United States. What the people of the Philippines should think about is the joyful feeling when the flag of an independent nation flies in the air, which cannot be described in words. Therefore, we will mobilize the power of all the people of the Philippines to move forward in the construction of the new Philippines, and we are determined to make the greatest efforts to complete the Greater East Asia War.

### Attends Mass Rally in Java, Encourages Unity and Efforts in Construction

Jakarta, 12th (Central News Agency) - During his inspection of the South, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo arrived here at 11:50 AM on the 7th. Commander-in-Chief Harada and other military and civilian representatives greeted him warmly. After a brief rest at the residence of the Commander-in-Chief, Prime Minister Tojo listened to a report on the military situation from Commander-in-Chief Harada at noon and held various discussions.

Jakarta, 12th (Central News Agency) - At 4:30 PM on the 7th, Japanese Prime Minister Tojo attended a mass appreciation meeting held at Kanpir Square here. He addressed the more than 100,000 participants sincerely, saying in essence: I am delighted to meet with you all today. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, you have understood the true meaning of this operation and have cooperated with Japan with solid unity and sincerity. I am deeply grateful for your involvement in the construction of the new Java. I am even more deeply moved by what I have seen today. All the residents of the various regions of our Greater East Asia are one large family of one system, but they have been oppressed by the United Kingdom and the United States for many years. Since the start of the war, Japan has become the central core of Greater East Asia with the posture of certain victory in Greater East Asia, in order to liberate this large family from the shackles of East Asian invaders, and this war has occurred. I have visited various places in China and Manchuria, and this time I have come to inspect various places in the South. The impressions I have gained are very good, which makes me even more determined in my belief that the construction of Greater East Asia will be successful. With this belief in sure victory and success, Japan is determined to move forward towards the path of destroying the aggressors of East Asia. Java occupies an extremely important position in this Greater East Asia War. Therefore, you have a significant impact on the future of the war situation. I previously stated specifically in the Japanese Parliament that the original residents of Java will be granted the right to participate in politics this year, which is I hope that you will demonstrate your great spirit, and under the command of the local army, work together to engage in construction in all aspects of politics, economy, and culture. In order to complete the Greater East Asia War, to achieve this consensus, work hard and strive. I have expressed my thoughts here, and I pray that you will strive to fulfill them

### US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Bombs Vietnam Twice

Hanoi, 11th (Central News Agency) - The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing bombed the Tokyo State of Vietnam on the morning of the 10th. In the afternoon, it attacked Haiphong and Honggu again. Both were bombed. A total of 21 residents died and 40 were injured in the two raids, it is said.

### Wartime German Student Life

Germany's total war effort and national mobilization have recently been completed. Not only middle school and girls' school students, but also elementary school students, want to show their skills in this era of total war. The following describes the recent daily life of German youths aged six to seventeen, also known as "Young German Nationals," and their participation in the total war effort:

Thorough Air Raid Defense Education

First-graders aged six and seven used to be escorted to and from school by their mothers. However, in today's total war, many mothers in families go to work in military factories and have no time to care for their children. Therefore, the children automatically form groups of three or four and go to school.

National schools continue as before, with five hours of daily instruction starting at 8:00 AM. However, if there is an air raid alarm on alternate evenings, class time is delayed by two hours. Most of the young teachers have gone to the front lines, so most of the teachers are female or elderly. They liaise with the National Socialist Party's youth organization to improve education under strategic conditions. Air raid defense education facilities are also very thorough, and exercises are held from time to time. Sandbags, fire extinguishers, etc., must be placed in each classroom and corridor, and the basement is equipped with sleeping quarters that are absolutely safe for sleep. There are all kinds of tableware and ventilation equipment, and nurses are on standby, sweeping and cleaning, so that children separated from their fathers and brothers will not be anxious.

Training in Emergency Measures

The implementation of wartime children's education is extremely practical. New slogans are often placed in classrooms and corridors. The themes often come from German history, portraits of legends, or maxims, so that children have a deep impression. Every day, the children collect many waste products from their homes, such as paper, torn rags, and scrap metal, and send them to the teachers. Why do they desperately collect so many waste products? Why does the country need this? What can be done with these in the future? Large color illustrations or movies are used to explain this, deeply and clearly imprinting it in the children's minds. Slightly more advanced children are taught practical knowledge such as first aid measures for injuries. "Injured person models" are wrapped with cellophane threads, and actual performances are given on hands or feet. Regarding these matters, party organizations issue magazines and pamphlets with instructions to the teachers, who then teach the children the important things that need to be especially remembered during wartime.

Children's Health and Satisfaction

Naturally, great attention is also paid to children's health. Children's health is no different from pre-war in any national school. For children aged six to fourteen, the German National Socialist Party specially organizes "Forest Schools." Children who apply to join are sent to safe conservation areas where there is absolutely no danger of surprise attacks, such as coastal areas. During the summer holidays, they take in good nutrition together with the teachers.

In addition to their regular lessons, the children must also help nearby farmers, such as removing pests, drawing water, and caring for livestock, which are things that children can do. Children's health is closely monitored at all times. Experts often visit and ask questions in each forest school dormitory: "Is the food nutritious enough?" "What is the sanitary condition?" Therefore, there is even a lamp-lighting workshop for the leaders of the children to study, and currently there are 6,393 male instructors and 3,767 female instructors in training.

In addition, there are 248 male instructors and 274 female instructors who specialize in teaching children how to repair furniture in homes damaged by surprise attacks. Since the autumn of 1940, a total of 382,616 boys and girls have been transported from areas with the most surprise attacks to the German inland, which is free from surprise attacks, or to conservation areas in Denmark, Norway, Hungary, Slovakia, and Bulgaria, using 1,621 special trains and 58 ships.

Senior Students Practice Air Defense

The wartime life of secondary school students is similar to that of pre-war students, with senior students receiving six hours of instruction daily. However, the highest-level 17-year-old boys must be conscripted into the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force." This youth air defense force returns to school from the barracks one day a week and attends classes for four hours each day. Those who do not have enough time due to this conscription will omit unnecessary courses to supplement it. For example, French, French, music, gymnastics, and other subjects are canceled, and only English is limited in terms of language.

In this way, when the highest-level students in boys' secondary schools finish their last year, they are also graduated from the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force" and are immediately conscripted into formal soldiers. Therefore, there has been a great decrease in the number of people who have advanced to senior high schools or above recently, and only those in special engineering and medical fields can enter senior high schools. This is the Ministry of Education's unavoidable policy under the total war effort. The highest-level boys can choose either the "Hitler Youth Air Defense Force" or the "Hitler Youth Volunteer Force." The "Hitler Youth Volunteer Force" system was established in 1942. In addition to receiving various technical education before becoming soldiers, they are also taught skills such as car drivers, flight telegraph operators, communicators, and sailors. To date, thousands of people have been concentrated here for education.

Service During the Busy Farming Season

Students other than senior students in boys' secondary schools must fully serve in the harvest during the busy farming season from July 7th, and girls help with farming operations and housework. However, during the school term, they cooperate with the children of national schools to collect debris. Using their spare time from school, they cultivate in school halls and fields, and use the harvest to comfort wounded soldiers in hospitals.

The course of instruction is implemented regularly as before. For example, during girls' sewing time, cloth and yarn are given to sew pillows and quilts for wounded soldiers or to practice sewing baby clothes, in order to rationalize the academic work with practice. These works are accumulated every three months and sent to various parties.

However, the boys' cooking course is limited to the theory of how to cook family food, because it cannot waste food. Boys students manufacture models of airplanes, warships, and tanks during handicraft time, taking this opportunity to inform them of the importance of industry and the necessity of labor under wartime conditions. Only English is listed as a compulsory subject for foreign languages, and French is no longer valued. At this time, special attention is paid to sharpening the "weapon of knowing rigor."

### Japanese Economic Mission Arrives in Beijing, Pays Respects to Chairman, Ambassador Gu Hosts Welcome Banquet That Evening, Members Express Impressions from Inspection

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese economic survey mission, led by Mr. Ogura Masatsune, arrived here at 2:20 PM on the 12th. After a short rest, they paid their respects to Chairman Wang of the National Government, and separately visited Minister Chu of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, Minister Mei Baoye, and General Commander Hata of the Japanese Army to pay their respects. They then went to the Japanese Naval Hospital to visit wounded and sick soldiers. In the evening at 7:00 PM, they attended a banquet hosted by Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Gu Zhengzhi.

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese economic mission arrived in Beijing at 2:20 PM yesterday (the 12th). The group consists of twelve people, led by the head of the delegation, Masatsune Ogura. The list of members is recorded as follows: Head of the Delegation Masatsune Ogura. Members include: Akashi Teruo, Nango Saburo, Kotera Gengo, Yoshida Chiyo, Saku Izumiyama Sanroku, Hamano Kyohei, Akutsu Sekiichiro, Sekiguchi Takeo, Takagi Gaishi, etc.

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - A Chinese economic survey mission, organized by Japanese economic experts and led by Chairman Ogura, arrived in Beijing by car from somewhere at 9:00 AM on the 12th. Our reporter immediately rushed to visit them, and Mr. Ogura promised to express his impressions on important issues such as Chinese currency, finance, and prices as follows:

Mr. Ogura Masatsune said that he had been frankly exchanging opinions with Chinese dignitaries in Shanghai for many days and learned about the actual situation in China. At present, there are many proper policies that need to be implemented in Shanghai regarding price and currency issues. Therefore, I deeply hope that based on the opinions collected from various parties, after fully reviewing each issue, I will do my best for China's development. However, although China is a country with a long history, its national character and national conditions are quite different from those of Japan. It is necessary to have a full understanding of this point. Especially now, due to the unfolding of the new policy toward China, people in the Chinese economic circles are working hard with great hope, so it is also necessary to promote their creativity and research.

Mr. Akashi Teruo said that China currently has a huge amount of national capital, and on the other hand, the conditions for labor and equipment for production are also complete. Therefore, if national capital can be introduced into the production sector and utilized, it is quite promising to maintain the value of reserve coupons. However, the current Chinese economy, this national capital, and production are all acting individually, with different paces. This is quite different from Japan's integrated use of capital and production both internally and externally. Therefore, in China, it is an urgent task to properly guide and use national capital for the sake of China's development and for the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We hope that this issue can be resolved through cooperation between China and Japan and strive to move forward.

Mr. Nango Saburo said that from the perspective of trade, Central China is an extremely important region within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and it is also an urgent task to promote the exchange of materials between Central China and various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the impact on prices and currency is also great. Under wartime conditions, the transportation of ships restricts the independent activities of various regions. For the sake of the future development of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is unnecessary. Under the overall integrated plan of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, material exchanges should be implemented. For example, China sends cotton to Japan, Japan sends cotton cloth to Thailand and India, and Thailand and India transport rice to Central China. This is a rationalized import and export situation in which each region uses necessities. Central China should also move along this direction to increase production.

Mr. Kotera Gengo said that the economic policy of the United Kingdom and the United States towards China has always been to buy Chinese raw materials at low prices and then distribute manufactured goods to China at high prices. However, for China's own development, Japan really needs to help China strengthen its production. Therefore, in the textile industry, it is necessary to not only strive to increase the production of cotton but also to consider the revitalization of the textile industry itself.

### Economic Authorities of Both Countries to Hold Frank Talks Today, Openly Exchange Opinions on the Great Cause of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The Haitian News Agency reports that responsible parties revealed that German and Italian elite forces began their counterattack on the Anglo-American beachhead in Sicily on Sunday morning, and have already achieved preliminary important victories. However, the war has not yet been announced. It is only known that the German and Italian forces have defeated the Anglo-American forces, cut off their rear communications, annihilated the remaining paratroopers, and reduced their beachhead fortresses. On Sunday, a large group of Axis bombers, under the protection of fighter planes, continued to bombard the Anglo-American landing forces.

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to Berlin military sources, the main force of the Axis forces in Sicily, which was left to deal with the anti-Axis invading forces, launched a fierce counterattack on Sunday morning. The Haitian News Agency reported that before Sunday morning, the Axis defenders were limited to coastal defense forces. According to military news from the Haitian News Agency, anti-Axis forces had established four beachheads on the island, and two other landing attempts had been repelled. The landing was carried out near Cape Basero in the southeastern corner of the island and south of Syracuse last night. As for the second landing attempt in the same area, it was repelled by the local coastal defense forces. The second batch of anti-Axis landing ships, protected by many warships, entered the Gira Bay and established several beachheads near the city of Gira. In addition, two beachheads were established near Ligata, further west. The enemy's landing attempt northeast of Mazala failed due to the resistance of the coastal defense forces. It is said that the enemy's attack on Sicily began with paratroopers, who landed in the southeastern corner of the island at dawn on Saturday. Military personnel here point out that the area where the paratroopers landed is sparsely populated, which makes it possible to establish large-scale beachheads. However, according to official announcements, most of these paratroopers have been annihilated, and only a few small groups have fled into the hilly areas west of Laigaruk and have not been captured.

### Italian Torpedo Planes Fiercely Attack Enemy Ships

Rome, 12th (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reports that the Italian Air Force has been participating in the fighting in the Strait of Sicily and along the southeastern coast of Sicily since Friday evening. Heavy bombers bombed enemy convoys between Malta and the coast of Sicily, hitting many enemy ships in a series of attacks. At the same time, Italian bombers also bombed the port of Lavanda in Malta, destroying many merchant ships and light landing ships about to leave the port. On Sunday, the Italian air force, overcoming the enemy's fierce anti-aircraft fire, attacked enemy forces near the coast at low altitude and inflicted heavy damage. The pursuit aircraft unit also attacked the enemy landing fleet heading for the coast, destroying several landing ships. Later, dive bombers protected by fighter planes attacked heavily defended merchant ships. A huge merchant ship was hit by two bombs, and other smaller ships were also hit. Italian fighter planes shot down two anti-Axis bombers and severely damaged ten enemy bombers and several Spitfires while engaging "Mikkel"-type bombers and Spitfires. Last night, Italian aircraft continued to intercept enemy forces in the Sicilian Sea. Long-range bombers also hit several ships during their attack missions, and many enemy ships were seen on fire, followed by explosions. Other bomber squadrons repeatedly attacked the enemy fleet, medium-sized merchant ships, and landing ships in Sicily. Torpedo planes repeatedly intercepted the enemy fleet and achieved remarkable results. During the first attack, a ship was hit and exploded, revealing that it was loaded with ammunition and explosives. A 15,000-ton ship was also seriously damaged. One of the torpedo planes participating in the war was attacked by night fighters. Another torpedo plane squadron attacked the enemy fleet, hitting two 7,000-ton enemy cruisers, one of which was severely damaged and is believed to have sunk. In addition, a 6,000-ton transport ship also caught fire, and the crew escaped by boat. Torpedo planes carrying out a second sortie were also repeatedly attacked by enemy fighters, and the enemy aircraft pursued the Italian aircraft to their base. Italian aircraft also intercepted enemy ships off the coast of French North Africa to prevent the enemy's supply from reaching Sicily. At 10:20 PM, an Italian torpedo plane attacked an 8,000-ton ship five miles from Bianco. The ship was hit and exploded. A 5,000-ton cargo ship escorted by two destroyers was also sunk by an Italian torpedo plane.

### Fighting Intensifies in the Kursk Salient, Both Sides Transferring Elite Forces as Reinforcements, Offensive Advances Continue

Stockholm, 12th (Central News Agency) - German forces seized new strongholds near Belgorod and south of Orel yesterday, serving as bases for their attacks on the Soviet line. Yesterday was the seventh day of the German counteroffensive in the Kursk salient, and the fierce fighting of tanks and mechanized units has intensified greatly. News from Moscow said that German General Klitzig had transferred elite tanks, aircraft, and infantry to join the battle. Although both sides suffered heavy losses, the strength of the offensive has not weakened. The Soviet side said that the Red Army is organizing a counteroffensive to cope with the German breakthrough and is transferring a large number of elite reserves and heavy artillery. However, German war reports said that the momentum of the march has not diminished slightly. In the large forest area east of Belgorod, German mechanized units, assisted by aircraft, penetrated the Soviet line in several places. The German army's battle results along the east bank of the Donets were obtained by defeating the powerful Soviet forces concentrated in that area. Although German actions were hindered by heavy rain and difficult terrain, they were still able to fully develop their offensive labor. Soviet forces south of Orel launched an attack with heavy tanks but were repelled by German forces and 28 tanks were destroyed. Another German unit took the risk of carrying out an encirclement operation, resulting in the capture of 29 tanks and 44 artillery pieces. The fiercest fighting is at the base of the spearhead action, where the Soviet command is now concentrating a large army and at the northern end of the spearhead, about 20 miles from Belgorod, where the two armies have fought bloody battles. According to a Reuters reporter stationed in Moscow, German General Kluge launched a large-scale attack yesterday in the aforementioned two locations. German forces added a large number of reserves to the fighting near Belgorod, and fierce new offensives also occurred simultaneously in the Orel and Kursk regions. This attack began at 6:00 AM, preceded by aircraft and heavy artillery bombardment, followed by tanks and motorized infantry. The attack location was the same as the previous day, namely a certain city near the railway. The Soviet side has admitted that German tank units have invaded several places. According to Reuters, on Saturday, more than 300 German and Soviet aircraft engaged in a large-scale aerial battle. Berlin estimates that in the first six days, the total losses of the Soviet army amounted to 1,709 tanks and 1,197 aircraft, and there are probably 800 more that have not returned to base.

### Viceroy Adopts Policy of Appeasement, Releases 318 Political Prisoners

### Preventing Fifth Column Activities

### Reflections on a British Tragedy

— Tokutomi Iichiro (3)

If one were to investigate the list of knighthoods awarded on the British Emperor's birthday over the years, and explain their origins, although not every detail could be clarified, the main factor was the amount of money donated, which determined the rank and title. Therefore, if one were to research who the donors were, it would naturally become clear that Jewish money was at play. It is said that Lord Rosebery had three wishes in his youth: first, he wished to marry a wealthy woman; second, to win the Derby horse race; and third, to reach the position of Prime Minister. He indeed married the daughter of the world's richest Rothschild family. He also won the Derby horse race. As for the third wish, although it was not for long, he eventually served as Prime Minister for a short time. It goes without saying that the Rothschilds, naturally Jewish, were involved. In this way, Jewish blood flowed torrentially into the heart of the British aristocracy. Rosebery, the son-in-law, immediately received a knighthood. It is not difficult to imagine that Jewish blood permeated everything. And this is just one example.

The French once said that from Clemenceau to Jaurès, no French politician was untouched by Jewish hands! Whether this is true or not cannot be guaranteed, but France's downfall due to Jewish politicians and money is a real lesson before us. Similarly, in Germany, former Emperor Wilhelm II favored the shipping magnate Ballin, just as his uncle Edward VII favored Cassel. Ballin committed suicide before and after World War I, but the exact reasons remain unclear. It is commendable that he did his best to maintain peace between Britain and Germany from a Jewish perspective. In short, no country in the world is untouched by Jewish hands. People regard Cecil Rhodes as a great British hero. His plan to build a transcontinental railway from Cape Town to Cairo was indeed ambitious, but he failed because he did not work with the Jews in South Africa. Initially, he fought against them, but later, seeing no hope of winning, he had to join hands with them. Thus, Rhodes became a captive of the Jews. Rhodes invested a lot of money in British politics, especially donating a large sum to Parnell, the leader of the Irish Home Rule Party. But indirectly, it was Jewish money that manipulated the Irish party through Rhodes. Thus, can we say that Rhodes directly prompted Pitt to borrow money and donate it to the Irish Liberal Party?

Arthur Balfour was from a famous Conservative family, the nephew of Lord Salisbury. He had money, status, knowledge, and a handsome appearance, making him a perfect man. There was no need for him to rely on Jews. However, his so-called "declaration" during World War I caused great trouble in the United States. It is not necessary to elaborate on his declaration here. On November 2, 1917, he wrote a letter to Rothschild: "His Majesty's Government views with favour the establishment in Palestine of a national home for the Jewish people, and will use their best endeavours to facilitate the achievement of this object, it being clearly understood that nothing shall be done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish communities in Palestine, or the rights and political status enjoyed by Jews in any other country."

Unfortunately, this letter led the Jews to believe that Britain would use its greatest strength to create a homeland for the Jews in Palestine, and as a result, the Jews actively participated in World War I on the British side. Originally, Palestine was known to the world because of Christianity, and most of it was barren land, only suitable for limited use. But in any case, that place was not enough to support more than 1.5 million people. However, at that time, one million Arabs were already living there. However, because of this declaration, in the ten years from 1923 to 1933, the number of Jews increased from 83,000 to 230,000, and as a result, many disputes naturally arose between Jews and Arabs.

At that time, the British appointed the aforementioned Postmaster General Samuel as the first High Commissioner because he was the most suitable person to govern the Jews. However, a person suitable for governing Jews is not necessarily suitable for governing Arabs. Originally, there was Lawrence of Arabia among the Arabs, who, following the will of the British government, appeased the Arabs and promised them that if they helped Britain, Britain would restore the old Arab territories. Therefore, although the Arabs and the British were like fire and water, they ultimately helped Britain. However, now Britain does not fulfill any of its promises to both sides, causing Lawrence to die an unnatural death. In short, although Britain is suspected of favoring the Jews, the real power lies in the hands of the Arabs. In this way, Palestine has been in a state of unrest, and Britain has lost its credibility and influence in West Asia because it has failed to fulfill its promises to both sides.

As for the British atrocities in Palestine, Keltie has written a book called "British Reign of Terror," which describes them in detail. According to him, Balfour was lying, and Lawrence was lying. If we let the British examine themselves, perhaps there would be considerable justification, but the consequences of the Balfour Declaration are ultimately very serious. Britain's loss of power in West Asia undoubtedly stems from this. However, to interpret it further, it is a manifestation of Jewish power. To fall to Britain is to fall to a Jewish scheme.

### Shanghai's Two Concessions Recovered, Tax Revenue Can Be Unified, Municipal Party Department and Others Expand Propaganda for the Recovery of Concessions

(Shanghai, Central News Agency) Allied nation Japan, in order to fulfill its assistance to our country in completing the integrity of its territorial sovereignty, was pleased to sign an agreement with the National Government on June 30 to return the Shanghai International Settlement. Starting August 1, the government will take back all administrative powers of the International Settlement. As for the issue of returning the French Concession, Foreign Minister Chu has already come to Shanghai to negotiate with the French authorities. It is expected to be realized before the end of this month. After this, all financial advancements in Shanghai will be smoother than in the past. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited various central tax collection agencies in Shanghai to inquire about the future of tax revenue after the recovery of the concessions. A special report is as follows…

Consolidated Tax and Special Tax

The consolidated tax is a major source of financial revenue for our country. Shanghai, in particular, is a large port for trade with industrial nations, with factories lining the streets and businesses standing shoulder to shoulder. Various goods such as cotton yarn, cotton cloth, cigarettes, flour, wheat, minerals, cement, etc., are all manufactured and distributed from Shanghai factories to various places. The collection of consolidated tax is mainly based in Shanghai. However, due to the concessions, our government's tax administration could not extend its collection and inspection work. Except for the cigarette tax, which was agreed upon with the concessions for enforcement and inspection, the inspection work for consolidated taxes on other goods was obstructed, resulting in smuggling and tax evasion. It was impossible to carry out inspections, which greatly affected tax revenue. After the concessions are returned to our country this time, tax administration can be uniformly promoted. The scope of inspection and tax administration for all consolidated taxes and special taxes will gradually improve, and tax revenue will inevitably increase. Currently, the Tax Investigation Department of the Ministry of Finance has begun to study the entire method of inspecting and collecting taxes after the recovery of the concessions.

Income Tax

Income tax is the obligation of the people to pay taxes. It has been implemented abroad for a long time, and our government has made progress in promoting it in recent years. Recently, after the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance actively adjusted it, the income tax policies of various regions have been brought into line. The tax revenue in the 29th year of the Republic of China was only a few million yuan, but by the 31st year of the Republic of China, it had increased to about 20 million yuan. Among them, the tax revenue from the Shanghai District Collection Bureau was the highest. However, due to the special nature of the concessions, the promotion has been repeatedly obstructed. Not only did foreign merchants in Shanghai not declare their tax obligations, but even the amount of income tax payable by Chinese merchants was delayed in reporting. The income tax collection authorities could not seriously promote it due to the special relationship of the concessions. This is also a major obstacle affecting tax revenue. After the recovery of the concessions, all merchants and residents in the Shanghai urban area, regardless of their nationality, have a tax obligation. With the unification of administrative power, the promotion of income tax collection will proceed more smoothly, and merchants and residents will not be able to escape and resist reporting taxes. It is estimated that tax revenue can increase by more than one-third.

Expanding Propaganda for the Recovery of Concessions

The Municipal Party Department of this city believes that since both the International Settlement and the French Concession will be recovered, all citizens are excited and fortunate. In order to make all citizens understand the significance of the recovery of the concessions and their future responsibilities, a meeting of the Standing Committee of the Party Departments of various districts was convened at the Department at 2:00 PM yesterday to discuss and decide on expanding propaganda and holding celebration rallies. It is reported that preparations will be started with the relevant agencies in this city.

The Propaganda Department of Shanghai Special City is also following the seventh item of the expanded propaganda plan for the return of the Shanghai concessions promulgated by the Propaganda Department, which stipulates the composition of "The Great Shanghai March." It has now started work. It is heard that the song has been submitted to Mayor Chen for writing the lyrics and experts have been hired to compose the music. It is scheduled to be officially announced by the Municipal Government on the day the concessions are returned.

This newspaper also received a letter from Master Ku Qi yesterday, saying: "Since your newspaper has been running the scholarship fund, I have not been able to respond to the advocacy efforts, but I have always donated to the best of my ability, and I dare not lag behind others. At the same time, I have been donating scholarships to Shengfangjiao Middle School, Wuben Elementary School, Yongchun Elementary School, and Xicheng Elementary School for several years. Starting from this semester, I will be fully responsible for all the scholarships for the above four schools. All students from poor families can request free admission. If your newspaper encounters requests for scholarships from the above four schools, you can directly refer them to the authorities of each school.

### Naval District Baojia Holds Second Anniversary Celebration Yesterday at Hongkou Park

Since the establishment of a sound Baojia system in the naval district with the cooperation of the Allied naval authorities, the security of various districts and water Baojia has been ensured, so that all residents can live and work in peace and embark on the road to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Yesterday (12th) was the second anniversary of its establishment. The naval district Baojia authorities specially held a grand celebration ceremony at 9:00 am at Hongkou Park in this city. In addition to the full participation of the Baojia personnel of the first, second, third, fourth, fifth, sixth, and seventh military regions of the entire naval district, the office staff of the Naval Baojia Office and the district offices also attended. The commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and Lieutenant Yantian of the Fleet Press Department, the police chief of the Public Concession, and Director Shigeota of the Baojia Guidance Department all attended the meeting. The total number of people was more than 5,000, and the situation was enthusiastic. The details are as follows:

Solemn Ceremony

The Naval District Baojia Second Anniversary Celebration Conference was held on the large lawn in Hongkou Park. The national flags of China and Japan were hoisted high in the middle of the field, fluttering in the wind, creating a solemn atmosphere. The presidium was surrounded by red and white cloth curtains, making it even more beautiful and pleasing to the eye. The Baojia personnel of each district and the members of the self-defense corps in grass-green uniforms lined up in front of the platform, holding flags and looking very serious. The Public Concession drum and flute band also came to the venue to play music. At 9:00 am, the meeting was announced, and all paid the highest respect to the national flags of China and Japan, and prayed silently for the heroic spirits of the fallen soldiers of China and Japan. First, Mr. Hisabo Tokuji, Director of the Naval District Baojia Office, gave a speech, followed by a speech from the Commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force and a congratulatory speech from the police chief of the Public Concession. Then, the Commander of the Army Landing Force awarded certificates of merit to 62 Baojia personnel who had contributed to the Baojia. After the award ceremony, representatives elected by all Baojia members read the oath. Finally, everyone shouted "Long live!" Until 11:30 am, the conference was declared closed amid the high music.

Director Hisabo's Speech

Director Hisabo of the Naval District Baojia Office said in his speech: "Today is the second anniversary of the establishment of the Naval District Baojia. I am very honored that the commander and everyone came to guide us. The establishment of the Naval District Baojia was on July 12, 1941, when I was ordered by the Japanese fleet to start controlling Baojia in the entire district. With the guidance and encouragement of the naval authorities and the various police customs, we were able to complete our work in a short period of time. Today, the Naval District Baojia includes seven districts, with 360 Bao, 3,144 Jia, 121,320 households, and a total population of 611,359 people. This great achievement is due to the wise leadership of the naval authorities, the assistance of all parties involved, and the selfless efforts of the Baojia comrades. In future work, the self-defense corps, youth corps, air defense guidance classes, and epidemic prevention classes that have been organized above are all facts that the Baojia comrades have experienced day and night. In short, under the guidance of the authorities, in the complex Shanghai society, we are shouldering the responsibility of building a new order, ensuring security, and clarifying society, and we have all done our best. Now the Baojia organization has spread throughout Shanghai, and a dense cell organization has organized 3 million citizens, assisting in completing the system for the Greater East Asia War, building a bright Shanghai, and becoming the rear base for this war to establish the road to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We are proud of this, and this glory will be permanently recorded in the annals of Greater East Asia."

Commander's Speech

The Commander of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force continued with a speech, saying: "Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, in view of the excellent achievements of the Shanghai Naval District Baojia, the Baojia organizations have also been established one after another in the western district of the Shanghai Public Concession and the French Concession, allowing the citizens themselves to automatically assist in maintaining Shanghai's security. The difficulty of developing this good custom is great, and its merits are great. Shanghai is not only the center of the new China, but also an important stronghold of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it must be made a place where citizens can live and work in peace. To seek peace and prosperity, we must first maintain good security. Shanghai is a large city with special characteristics. To make it perfect, we need the cooperation of all citizens. The significance of the Baojia organization is very important and great. Looking back on the efforts of all of you in the past two years since the establishment of Baojia, I feel that there is hope. However, we still need to double our efforts. On this deeply meaningful second anniversary, I hope that all of you will rise up and cooperate, unite as one, and move forward for the construction of Greater Shanghai and Greater East Asia, and strengthen the Baojia organization to achieve perfection."

Police Chief's Speech

Next, the visiting Police Chief gave a congratulatory speech, saying: "The spirit of the Hongkou Baojia is good. I hope that you will continue to work hard and contribute to the construction of Greater Shanghai."

Parade

A parade was held immediately. In addition to the Baojia personnel of the entire conference, there were also boy scouts, drum teams, national music bands, military bands from various districts, as well as specially made floats and opera-themed trucks. They all lined up and set off at the entrance of Hongkou Park. The music along the way was melodious, and the flags were colorful and dazzling. The floats and opera-themed trucks were particularly varied. At 7:00 pm, the cadre personnel of the Baojia in the Tonghai Naval District held a joint banquet in the large banquet hall of the Wenlu Japanese Club. The atmosphere was harmonious and the cups were exchanged. It was not until about 9:00 pm that the meeting was dismissed. At the same time, fireworks were set off on the square at the intersection of Tangshan Road and Kunming Road to celebrate.

### The Third "Marine Day"

The Greater East Asia War is a naval war with the vast Pacific Ocean as its stage. On this immense sea surface, the merchant fleet and transport fleet, assisting the navy and operating actively in all directions, are indeed working extremely hard.

### Police Department Notifies All Baojia to Reorganize Their Police Corps; Self-Defense Members Must Fill Out Service Oaths, Must Not Deliberately Be Absent from Duty or Late

The Public Concession Police Department, in order to stabilize local order, recently notified the district Lianbao to instruct each Baojia to reorganize the self-defense corps. The reporter has specially recorded the details as follows:

Strict Prohibition of Absence from Duty Without Reason

Each district Baojia has completed the re-checking of household registrations in its jurisdiction. After receiving orders from the Police Department, it has copied and submitted the qualified men aged 20 to 43 from the new household registration survey forms. They have been assigned posts and notified that if unqualified substitutes or absences are discovered in the future, they will be immediately reported to the Police Department for severe punishment.

Self-Defense Corps Members to Fill Out Oaths

Those who have previously requested exemption from service should also submit definite proof documents and submit them for registration to be filed for verification. At the same time, according to the reporter's reliable information, for the sake of solemnity, the self-defense members of each Baojia district will begin to fill out service oaths starting today, vowing not to deliberately violate the important regulations of the Baojia self-defense corps. It is also found that the heads of each household must also fill out this type of oath, guaranteeing that the self-defense members in the household will not deliberately be absent from duty or late when performing their duties. If any are found, they will voluntarily accept joint punishment and will not shirk responsibility.

### Chinese and Japanese Cultural Circles Welcome Director Liang

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) Since the National Government officially announced the appointment of Liang Xiuyu, advisor to the Propaganda Department, as the Director of the Shanghai Special Municipality Propaganda Office, the relevant authorities in this city, as well as the Chinese and Japanese cultural circles, various newspapers, magazines, and the China Book and Drama Association, have decided to jointly express their welcome. A welcome tea party will be held at the International Hotel tomorrow (the 14th) at 3:00 PM for friendly gathering.

### News Association Advocates Thrift Movement

The Shanghai News Association, recognizing that modern wartime nations all regard thrift as essential to achieving ultimate victory, and since the National Government, cooperating with friendly nations, declared war on Britain and the United States, has made great efforts to promote the thrift movement. However, it has not achieved the expected results. Shanghai, in particular, still sees significant waste of resources and an especially prevalent trend of extravagance, which not only affects wartime material strength but also stimulates high prices, making life difficult for ordinary citizens. Therefore, it has launched a campaign to promote thrift, strengthen war effort, and correct social morals. The association has formulated detailed plans for promoting the thrift movement, using the media to mobilize public opinion, so that citizens can universally practice thrift, and making suggestions to the authorities to lead and promote the movement. The main points include advocating wearing old clothes, cloth clothes, and short clothes; refraining from banquets, drinking, and large-scale entertainment; and using tea and snacks for weddings and funerals, to cultivate a thrifty atmosphere and achieve the goal of thrift. It has been decided that from July 15th to July 31st will be an expanded publicity week. It is reported that the association may invite relevant authorities and powerful organizations in the city to cooperate and jointly promote the thrift movement, and regularly hold public speaking events on the thrift movement, inviting social celebrities to give speeches in turn.

### Public Utilities Bureau Director Reports on the City Ferry Incident

(2) The City Ferry Company has provided compensation to the families of the victims according to their names.

### French Concession Issues Next Month's Bread Certificates

The French Concession started issuing August and September wheat bread certificates, sugar purchase certificates, and artificial butter ration certificates to foreign residents yesterday. Each food-buying household should go to collect them according to the prescribed dates.

### No Horns Allowed Late at Night

According to the Traffic and Air Defense Department of the Public Works Bureau: Recently, the weather has been hot, and most windows are open. Many cars speeding and honking their horns late at night have prevented residents from sleeping peacefully. In previous summers, the Vehicle Affairs Department of the Police Department strictly prohibited this unnecessary and annoying behavior. It is reported that this year it will be carried out again. In addition, the use of high beams by private and taxi cars in prohibited areas will also be severely punished.

### Huatong Cup Charity Soccer Tournament: Lianyi Regular Match Against St. Paul's United; Premieres This Saturday in Xuhui

The Huatong Cup Charity Soccer Tournament, organized by the Huatong Sports Association of this city, invites the Lianyi Association, the new Chinese champion of Shanghai, to compete against the Western Iron Army St. Paul's United. The first match has been scheduled to kick off this Saturday (the 17th) at the Xuhui Middle School field. The second match will take place next Wednesday (the 21st) at Xuhui General Stadium. Huatong Sports Association President Jiang Yimen has donated prizes. Ticket revenue will be used to fund the education of orphaned children. Since reorganizing last year, the Lianyi team has invited famous Hong Kong players Li Tiansheng, Song Lusheng, Liu Xianhan, Zheng Yingquan, Li Yichen, and Qu Yongfu to Shanghai, adding top local talent Sun Jinshun, Zhang Lingen, Wu Qixiang, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua, etc., to form an extremely strong lineup. Subsequently, they participated in the Western League A group, with 7 wins and 4 draws in 11 matches, taking the top spot. Furthermore, the team recently managed to overwhelm the Zhanjun Donghua Association in the North China Disaster Relief Soccer Tournament, seemingly becoming the new Chinese champion. Their momentum is strong and their morale is high. St. Paul's United gathers the elite from St. Francis and the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce teams, with countless war generals under its command. The Shanghai representatives Victor and Foran are already well-known. However, Xu Erz, Olivera, Gayne, Carrolie District, V Su Ruo, and W Shen Tuo Xun Feng are all top-tier talents. Their strength is self-evident. When the Jing'an Baojia Football Charity Game was held at the Racecourse last week, the team managed to defeat the Li Lian team with a score of 4 to 3. The performance was so wonderful that more than ten thousand fans were mesmerized. This time, competing against the Luyi team is tantamount to vying for the Shanghai football throne. At that time, the great battle between the Chinese and Western troops will definitely be an unprecedented and intense competition. Who will be the victor is unpredictable. To avoid the scorching sun, all matches will start at 6:30 PM.

Newspaper Broadcast Time Yesterday: 7:10 PM

Economic Commentary

### Jianbu Begins to Increase Grain Production

The Central News Agency Tokyo电 reported on the 9th of this month that Chen Junpu, Minister of Construction of the National Government and Secretary-General of the National Economic Committee, recently hosted a press group at the Tokyo Imperial Hotel, where he stated: "The Ministry of Construction, in order to adapt to the new situation, reorganized and expanded the former Ministry of Communications and the Water Conservancy Commission in February of this year, with the highest goal of developing the economy and stabilizing people's livelihoods. Furthermore, to develop the undertakings of these two organizations, it was decided to implement a three-year construction plan, striving to achieve it. The three-year construction plan focuses on the development of farmland irrigation. Currently, work has begun on the opening of Mengdong Taihu, and a technical team has been dispatched to work. Once the on-site survey is completed, reclamation will begin. It is estimated that after the Mengdong Taihu reclamation plan is completed, 16,000 hectares of fertile land can be obtained, which can yield 70 million dan of rice. As for the development of other Yangtze River swamp areas, planning has also begun, and a decision has been made to expedite its realization."

On the same day, the Suzhou report from the same agency stated: "The Jiangsu Construction Department recently organized the East Taihu Consultation Team to conduct surveys in order to improve the water conservancy plan... The Ministry of Construction... also appointed Cai Fuchu, a senior commissioner, as well as Wang Jiazhang and Tao Jiaxian, technical specialists from the Water Conservancy Department, and invited Japanese water conservancy expert Aki Kyoi to form the East Taihu Water Conservancy Consultant Group. The group departed from Kyoto a few days ago to inspect the East Taihu Basin and the surrounding area of Fanshan Lake, and to collect general water conservancy-related materials. The inspection area includes Suzhou, Shanghai, Wujiang, Jiaxing, Songjiang, Qingpu, Changshu, and other places. When necessary, important towns and districts along Taihu Lake may also be inspected. The inspection period is more than twenty days."

After carefully reviewing the above two reports, we feel that the government has made a firm decision to implement water conservancy improvements and increase grain production to stabilize people's livelihoods, no longer "sitting and talking without taking action" or "making a lot of noise but accomplishing little" as in the past. If the plan to increase rice production by 70 million dan in the East Taihu area each year can be realized, the food problem in the Southeast can be solved immediately, which will undoubtedly contribute significantly to the successful conclusion of the Greater East Asia War.

### Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding to Suppress Commodity Prices

To thoroughly investigate the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major commodities by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, a Commodity Investigation Committee has been established to vigorously prevent hoarding, thereby suppressing commodity prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. At the same time, Qianzhuang and various industries in the money industry are stopping accepting mortgages on major commodities. Regarding the storage, sale, and manufacturing of major commodities (including raw materials and finished products), all interested parties must register in accordance with the law: (1) owners, (2) warehouse operators or trustees, (3) pledgees, (4) insurers, (5) carriers. If the applicant is a member of a trade association, the application should be forwarded by the relevant trade association, including: (1) the type and name of the commodity, (2) the quantity of the commodity, (3) the source of the commodity and the time and value of its acquisition, (4) the packaging method, (5) the storage location, (6) the trademark, location, and names and addresses of the persons in charge of the commodity owners, (7) the trademark, business location, and names and addresses of the persons in charge of the applicants, (8) the date of filing. The competent authorities will implement inspections of warehouses and the inventory of major commodities in companies and firms in accordance with the reported major commodities. Anyone who hoards major commodities for profit without being a member of a trade association, or sells major commodities to non-members of trade associations knowing that they are not direct consumers, and anyone who conceals or fails to register and report the major commodities they store, will have their commodities confiscated regardless of whether they belong to the offender, and will be punished in accordance with the crime prevention regulations. Those who manipulate market prices and disrupt the market will be severely punished.

According to a Japanese newspaper report yesterday, the Public Works Bureau of the Public Concession, recognizing the high prices on the black market, in order to thoroughly suppress unscrupulous merchants, in addition to previously issuing a statement, will conduct stricter inspections of speculative merchants engaged in major commodities, especially cotton yarn and cloth.

### Ministry of Finance Orders Adjustment of Shanghai Financial Institutions

Regarding the Ministry of Finance's reorganization of financial institutions in Shanghai, there were rumors of mergers. Later, the Ministry of Finance announced the revised Banking Registration Regulations and Provisional Regulations for the Registration of Trust Companies, clarifying that the Ministry of Finance decided not to use mandatory merger methods to reorganize small banks and Qianzhuang in Shanghai, but to increase the capital amount to consolidate the foundation of financial institutions. It is now known that the Shanghai Banking and Qianzhuang Associations have received an order from the Ministry of Finance to instruct all banks and Qianzhuang, based on the new regulations and laws, to increase capital within six months. (1) The capital of banks and Qianzhuang (i.e., those organized as limited liability companies) should be increased to at least six million yuan, with three million yuan fully paid up. (2) The capital of ordinary commercial banks that also operate trust business should be at least five million yuan (three million yuan for bank funds and two million yuan for trust department funds). If the capital is not increased after the six-month deadline and does not comply with the legal regulations, they will be ordered to merge or close down. It is reported that after receiving the order, all banks and Qianzhuang are actively preparing to convene extraordinary shareholders' meetings to decide on capital increase methods.

### Wheat Purchase Progresses Smoothly, Flour Mills Start Operating

The Flour and Wheat Monopoly Association, recognizing that wheat has already entered the market in various regions, in order to implement unified purchase, centralized distribution, and maintain food supplies, followed the "Wheat Purchase Plan" set by the Business Management Committee. Each flour mill entrusted merchants and local wheat firms to register with the committee first, and then purchase uniformly according to the specified prices and regions. Branch offices have been established in Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Anqing, Nantong, Hangzhou, Yangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, etc., and huge loans of 100 million yuan have been provided by the Bank of Communications and other banks. Therefore, the wheat purchase work is progressing smoothly with the cooperation of all parties. Moreover, this year's wheat harvest is relatively poor, with the yield in various regions increasing by an average of about 30% compared to last year, especially in Jiangbei and the Bengbu and Xuzhou areas. The reporter recently learned from relevant sources that the total estimated wheat yield in various regions is approximately 20 million dan. (1) The Beijing-Shanghai Line: Suzhou 1 million dan, Wuxi 2 million dan, Changzhou 1 million dan, Zhenjiang 1 million dan, Nanjing 500,000 dan, Anting 500,000 dan, Kunshan 600,000 dan, Danyang 600,000 dan, Taicang 500,000 dan, Jiading 300,000 dan. (2) The Jiangbei Line: Yangzhou 2.7 million dan, Gaoyou 3 million dan, Taizhou 1.5 million dan, Xinghua 300,000 dan, other counties 3 million dan. (3) Wuhu 1.5 million dan. (4) The Tianjin-Pukou Line: 1 million dan. However, it is heard that the actual harvest in Jiangbei and Tianjin-Pukou Line regions may exceed the estimated quantity. Flour mills in Shanghai, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, and other places in Central China have already resumed operations one after another as wheat has entered the market, manufacturing flour to supply food to various places.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks rose sharply. After the market opened in the morning, there were no sellers, and prices jumped wildly. It was not until 11:20 AM that, forced by investors seeking to realize profits at high prices, the market finally turned firm again at noon. The department store industry took the lead. Wing On stood out and passed major barriers, while Sincere and China Products were also in a state of high demand and short supply. Underwear also surpassed critical points, and Jinglun socks accelerated their gains, breaking through two barriers in a row. Jingfu followed suit and rose. The public utilities industries of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China General Edison Company rose all the way. The former went outside the pass again. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company stood firmly at four barriers. The rise of Great China Match was also unexpected. The rise of Wing On Textile in the textile industry has slowed, while Sintoon and Wing Feng have risen steadily. New China Printing & Weaving and Da Zhonghua Weaving have remained firm and constant. In the cultural industry, China Theatre and New World both flew outside the pass, and Commercial Press also rose strongly. New pharmaceutical stocks still had more consolidation. New Asia, Franco-China, Shanghai Union Dispensary, and Wang Zhou rose in unison. Minyi, China-Western, and Star Perfumery were stable and firm. The transaction price of China Enamelware was unexpectedly high.

### Dynamics of Various Industry Associations

### Brief News

The China Stock Daily, located at No. 613 Securities Building, has been published for over a year, promoting the Hua stock business and introducing industrial and commercial content. It has always been known for its accuracy and is an important reference material for the industrial and commercial circles and investors. Therefore, its sales have been increasing daily. Recently, the newspaper has been seeking further improvement. Starting this month, it has launched a special feature on famous figures in the Chinese industrial, commercial, and financial enterprise sectors, specializing in introducing the successful history of establishing businesses, providing general observation and imitation. The content is all personally interviewed and investigated by staff, so it is extremely authentic. This innovation not only enhances the newspaper but also adds a unique touch to the national enterprise sector.

The Shanghai Zhenya Commercial Bank held an extraordinary shareholders' meeting yesterday afternoon at the Bank Association on Hong Kong Road, with more than 200 shareholders, including Chen Mingxiang, Wang Boyong, and Lu Youbai, attending. Chairman Chen Yafu presided over the meeting and reported on the significance of the extraordinary shareholders' meeting, then began discussing matters. In order to comply with the Ministry's order to increase capital by six million yuan, it was decided that old shareholders would subscribe first within one month, and if there was an insufficient amount, the board of directors would be responsible for recruiting.

### Impressions of the Japanese Economic Mission to China

The Chinese and Japanese Private Economic Mission stayed in Shanghai for four days after arriving on the 7th. They successively had talks with the Army and Navy authorities, Ambassador Tajiri of the Embassy Office, Mayor Chen, and the Chinese and Japanese authorities concerned, the Business Management Committee, the Bank Association, the Qianzhuang Association, the Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Liaison Association, the East Asia Economic Roundtable, and the Central China Headquarters. The business has been completed. They took a car to Beijing on the morning of the 12th, and planned to visit Chairman Wang, Minister of Finance Zhou, and Chief Mei, Standing from the position of Japanese private businessmen, they exchanged views on economic issues after the implementation of the new policies. Although the mission's time in Shanghai was short, it has already achieved great success in promoting Sino-Japanese economic cooperation.

The purpose of the economic mission to China has been clearly elaborated in the speech of the head of the delegation, Ogura. The intention is nothing more than that Chinese and Japanese businessmen should make further economic cooperation to create the foundation for promoting the new economic policy. Since the establishment of the Business Management Committee, the cessation of issuing military ticket new banknotes, the abolition of restrictions on the movement of some materials in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, and the implementation of the return of concessions, the economic situation in Central China has undergone considerable changes. In the current new stage, whether Chinese businessmen have the same opinions as Japanese private businessmen, and what their goals are as Chinese businessmen who shoulder the important task of implementing the new policy, have been made clear by Akira Akashi, Masaji Yoshida, Kojirabara and Sanruo Nango who are in charge of finance, through discussions with the magnates of Chinese financial and textile circles on the relevant issues within the scope of their expertise. The results have been extremely satisfactory. (To be continued)

### National Government Financial Balance

The people are quite concerned about the financial revenue and expenditure situation after the return of the National Government to the capital. This reporter recently met a gentleman familiar with the financial situation, who reported that the national government's financial revenue and expenditure have always been balanced. For three years, there has not only been no budget deficit, but there have also been savings, and there has never been an overdraft from the Central Reserve Bank. Friendly countries should also praise this sound financial situation. In addition, regarding the Central Reserve Bank's supervision of issuance business, the bank has a council of advisors, hiring financial giants as advisors, and the amount of issuance is reported to the council.

### Missed Opportunity

— Zhao Xiang

A friend wrote, saying he missed a "chance" three years ago. At that time, he had too much free time and could have used it to study a foreign language. By now, he would have made some progress, at least laid a foundation, and wouldn't be in his current situation.

It is common to only realize an opportunity after it has been missed. If one could grasp the key to an extraordinary opportunity beforehand, taking advantage of a critical moment to turn things around, that would certainly not be an ordinary talent. However, if one seizes ordinary opportunities one by one, never giving up a moment, without harboring fantasies of instant success, but instead honestly and steadfastly taking each step one at a time, ordinary people can also achieve success.

Today, feeling regret for missing yesterday's opportunity is useless in itself. In addition to regret, lamenting, being frustrated, feeling ashamed, and blaming oneself are also useless. If you don't work hard today, it will be easy to understand why the same sad emotions will reappear tomorrow!

Opportunity never waits for people; only the incompetent wait for opportunity, while the brave create opportunity.

In every tick of the clock, there lies an opportunity to change human destiny; only those who strive in time will catch up and seize it, while the lazy won't even see its shadow!

### Walking as a Carriage

— Li Zhi

The days are getting longer and longer, and the weather is getting warmer and warmer. Because I don't want to endure the life-threatening squeeze on the trams, I always walk to the office and back home every day.

When I walk, I look straight ahead, try to keep my body balanced, and hum a marching song softly. My steps follow the beat, neither fast nor slow, from the vegetable market on Cante Road to the Bund, without feeling breathless at all. While walking, I plan my work schedule: when I go to the company in the morning, I decide what official business I should handle today, how should I handle it? Which should I handle first? Which should I handle later? When I go home in the evening, I also decide on my evening work, what books I should read? What should I write? And so on. By the time my plan is complete, I am not far from my destination, leaving me no time to think about the fatigue of walking.

In this way, I get many benefits:

1.  A reduction in expenses, saving on transportation costs.

2.  Strengthening of the leg muscles.

3.  Developing the habit of waking up early and getting up immediately, making me clear-headed and agile during the day.

4.  Increased work efficiency, making life more disciplined and clearer.

5.  Mental peace, without dreams at night.

### The Righteous Receive Much Help

— Wang Yichen

The children gave me an entrance ticket and insisted that I attend the parents' meeting held at their school. Because that day was originally a holiday, and I couldn't resist the children's coaxing, I went to Zhongying Elementary School, which I had long wanted to see. The location was Lane 668 across the road. I went twice, once in the morning to see the achievements exhibition, and once in the afternoon to see the entertainment. The children were very satisfied, and so was I.

Each classroom was freshly painted, and all the desks and test papers were not only arranged in an orderly manner but also had ingenious new designs. From the achievements shown in the test papers, I must honestly say that they were much better than those of other nearby schools.

The entertainment program was held in the schoolyard. A stage was actually built, and two or three hundred benches were placed to accommodate five or six hundred people. All the programs were performed by the students themselves. Although they were nothing more than various songs, dances, and dramas, what they performed was indeed both beautiful and refined, different from the vulgar.

After seeing all these things, I couldn't help but feel suspicious. The school had only been established for a year, so why did it have such achievements? Could it be that the principal was a wealthy man with ample funding, so everything was easy to do? I took the opportunity to visit Principal Fang, but Principal Fang's answer was beyond my expectations.

Principal Fang said that she herself had no money, and what little money she had was used up at the beginning. This semester's deficit was terrible, but there were some enlightened people in society who listened to partial truths, such as Ma Yinliang, Lu Gao, Xia Zhafang, Pan Yangyao, Wang Wanbai, Yan Yanxian, and Zhou Xingchu. When they heard this news, they automatically donated a lot of money, which not only made up for this semester's deficit but also covered future shortfalls. Most of them also became school directors, laying a permanent foundation for the school. As for why others were willing to help, Principal Fang said that it was because she was truly running the school for education and had gained the trust of the general public over the past year. She absolutely did not want to treat the school as a private possession, as a means of getting rich, or as an easy job.

Oh, so Principal Fang was completely relying on the help of others. I couldn't help but think of the saying, "The righteous receive much help." Therefore, I believe that as long as the motive is pure and the effort is made, any undertaking will succeed. I am writing the above situation to provide a lesson for those who aspire to start a business. (Moved Aid to Study)

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

After a moment of silence, he added, "Go tell that guy surnamed Li to be sensible, or he can forget about having a good night's sleep tonight!" Commander × urged Staff Officer Zhang to take care of it, threatening the town chief Li. Staff Officer Zhang was indeed in a dilemma. If he went, he had already said everything he could to town chief Li. If he didn't go, Commander × wouldn't let it go easily. Besides, he thought, I'm a local, and I might still have to see my neighbors and elders in the future, so how can I be an excessive accomplice? Commander × is just relying on a few guns, doing enough evil things already. One day, the robber will meet his match. This bowl of rice will eventually be hard to swallow. I've been loyal enough to him in the past, and this time I'm prepared to be rejected. At most, I'll go back to my hometown to scavenge, to drive fish for others, and get nothing for myself. It's really not worth it. The more Staff Officer Zhang thought, the more resentful he became, and he couldn't help but say:

"Commander! I really can't say anything more to them, even if I do, it's useless. You can do whatever you want. I came here a few months ago with just a short shirt and pants, and I'm prepared to leave with just a short shirt and pants. You promised me this and that at the beginning, how much profit I would get each month, but today I only see you moving money in and out. I quit, I'm going home tomorrow!" Staff Officer Zhang said in one breath, stood up, his face flushed red, clenched his fists, and walked out. As he passed Commander ×, Commander × suddenly patted Staff Officer Zhang's shoulder with a friendly expression, pushed him inward, and said:

"Oh, Lao Zhang! What's wrong? Are you angry over this little thing? Sit down, let's discuss it again!" Commander × persuaded Staff Officer Zhang to sit down, and Zhang sat down with his head lowered, not saying a word. Commander × thought that Zhang had been here for a few months and had indeed driven a lot of fish for him, but he hadn't received a penny. For a moment, he seemed a little uneasy. Zhang could still write a few words and was very useful here, so he couldn't do without him. Under this idea, Commander × continued to say to Staff Officer Zhang very kindly:

"Lao Zhang! Don't be angry, don't worry, I understand. We will share the good fortune together. Here, I'll give you three hundred yuan for pocket money." As he spoke, he reached into his pocket, took out a roll of banknotes, took three stacks, and stuffed them into Staff Officer Zhang's hand, and didn't mention what had just happened. Staff Officer Zhang reluctantly put the banknotes on the table and remained silent with his head lowered. Commander × seemed very docile, patting Zhang's shoulder and saying:

"Lao Zhang! We are brothers, there's no need to be angry. Go take care of that person's business casually! I don't care!" After saying that, he stood up, put the banknotes on the table into his pocket, helped Zhang up, and pushed him out, showing extraordinary intimacy. (Nine)
