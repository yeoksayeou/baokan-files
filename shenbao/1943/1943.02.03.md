### Strengthening Controls Through Comprehensive Price Freezes

Yesterday's news reported that various industry associations were rigorously evaluating and setting standard price limits for goods, with the aim of thoroughly stabilizing the market and curbing the prices of various commodities on a large scale. This matter is of great importance to the lives of citizens and is not only necessary for Shanghai but should also be earnestly implemented in other regions. This newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions regarding the issue of commodity prices, and we have always believed that it is closely related to the government's overall economic policy and is also part of the overall political problem. If the political problem is resolved and the overall economic policy is sound, then the commodity price problem can be easily solved. Similarly, if the commodity price problem is resolved satisfactorily, then general social problems can also be resolved satisfactorily, and all the government's policies can be smoothly implemented. Therefore, today when we talk about price limits, fair prices, and stabilizing the market, we must first demand effective political solutions and the implementation of comprehensive economic policies, especially since our country has already joined the war, making this demand even more urgent.

The main and fundamental solution to the commodity price problem is to implement a policy of monetary tightening, properly guide idle capital into production, and implement organized and planned production increases. These are positive measures to stabilize the market and society. This newspaper has repeatedly offered suggestions on this aspect, and I will not repeat them today. However, with positive efforts, negative controls are still needed to complement each other for greater effectiveness. Therefore, I would like to offer my views on strengthening controls and comprehensive price freezes as a reference for those studying the commodity price problem and managing price controls today, and I naturally hope that the authorities and the economic community will pay attention to them.

In the past, the authorities had already studied the commodity price problem and had decided and implemented many countermeasures, and it seemed to have achieved considerable success within a certain period. However, judging from the facts in various places, it is still far from the ideal effect of commodity price control. Currently, from the government to the common people, they are still constantly affected by the adverse effects of the commodity price problem. The reason for this is that all controls are biased towards being partial or regional. The so-called partial nature is that the scope of control is limited, only controlling certain commodities or only controlling a certain part of the production and sales process of certain commodities, lacking a comprehensive and thorough plan. The so-called regional nature means that past controls were either limited to certain cities or regions, or those subject to control in area A could be free in area B, or those restricted in area B were let loose in area A; even if both areas A and B were subject to control, the laws, organizations, institutions, and methods of control were either uneven, or slightly different in strictness, or mutually restrictive. It is naturally a big question whether this can actually be effective. In the future, the government should widely adopt public opinion from the people, absorb experts from all walks of life, and conduct thorough research with relevant government agencies to determine appropriate and comprehensive countermeasures and implement comprehensive control through cooperation between officials and the people. Here, it is also necessary to note: (1) Not only must the government closely cooperate with the people, but it must also take into account and advance simultaneously with other political, economic, and social policies. The so-called comprehensive control cannot be handled solely by commodity price controllers, but must be done in close cooperation with all departments and institutions of politics, economy, and society to be effective. (2) The so-called comprehensive control is not a horizontal control without distinction. It should be based on the different causes and varying degrees of commodity price problems in each province and city, and take different measures as much as possible; it should also be based on the different types, characteristics, uses, values, and special circumstances of production and sales of different commodities, and take different measures as much as possible; there is a need to properly distinguish between urgency, leniency, and strictness. (3) The control institutions must be unified, the powers and responsibilities must be clear, the personnel must be well-organized, and the personnel at all levels who implement control must not only undergo serious training, but also undergo strict assessment at any time. The supervision of civil society and the respect of public opinion are indispensable key points. We believe that only after such comprehensive control is implemented, coupled with political improvement and the implementation of wartime economic policies, can a reasonable solution to the commodity price problem be expected.

Regarding price limits, almost all countries have implemented them during this extraordinary period. Not only have all the warring countries long implemented strict price limit systems for goods, but even the neutral countries have adapted to the needs of the environment and implemented price limits. Our country has long implemented them in some areas, especially in this city. However, in the past, due to various reasons, the expected results were not achieved. Therefore, we will not talk about price limits today; otherwise, first, we must implement comprehensive price limits, rather than merely partial price limits. If only a very small number of goods are designated for price limits, while their raw materials, wages, transportation, and general related production costs continue to rise, then the price limits will inevitably be unfair. If they are consumer goods, the market will be suffocated and the source will be cut off; if they are production goods, it will inevitably hinder production and reduce resources. Also, if price limits only apply to certain specific areas, it will inevitably create rapid price increases and cause new panic in the supply chain of materials. Therefore, today we must impose universal restrictions on the prices of most commodities, transportation costs, and wages across the country.

Second, price limits must be based on objective facts and should not be too idealistic or too principled. In general theory, there are so-called "cost price," "production cost price," "standard price," "composite price," etc., but they must all be based on facts. If the stipulated price does not match the cost or production costs, then the government must implement the necessary supply system. It is also unreasonable to only limit production prices while general commerce is not controlled, or control is looser. Therefore, price limits must be enforced in the fields of commerce, production, transportation, and power, and public utilities should set an example first.

Of course, comprehensive price limits must be implemented in parallel with comprehensive controls. Price limits are the work of all fair price measures, but they cannot be separated from other fair price work, so comprehensive price limits can only be achieved under comprehensive control.

Finally, we would like to emphasize that in order to implement the policy of stabilizing commodity prices and securing society, we must combine passive controls and price limits with active production increases in order to achieve practical results, especially in striving to increase production, conserve consumption, and facilitate transportation, so as to balance supply and demand. And how to control finance, adjust tax laws, and tighten budgets to reduce the issuance of currency and recover surplus purchasing power; and how to strictly organize society so that the people assist the government in implementing economic inspections, and strengthen industry associations, cooperatives, etc., to strengthen production and assist in distribution, and then have the government control materials and restrict price increases, are all important points that those who talk about control and price limits today must not ignore. We hope that the economy and politics will go hand in hand, eliminating the ills of past biases and imbalances, so that the ideal of control will be realized.

### Italy Abandons Tripoli and the Situation of the War

The German-Italian allied forces in North Africa have finally abandoned Italian-controlled Tripoli. In addition to the loss of El Agheila last autumn, Italy has temporarily abandoned Libya. This is a major event in history. Italy took over Libya after the war with Turkey more than 20 years ago, making it a base for Italy's overseas development. However, gains and losses are common in war, especially desert warfare in North Africa, which may turn misfortune into good fortune due to the battle of Tunisia. Moreover, when the war ends and the Axis powers are destined to win, the lost territories can be recovered. Italian Minister of National Culture Propaganda, Pavolini, encouraged the people in a radio speech, hoping to pay attention to the new situation in Tunisia, and said: "The determination to win is the greatest weapon," and "The recovery of Libya is just around the corner." We express our sympathy for what Pavolini said.

As for the current situation in North Africa, since Rommel's line of defense in Egypt was breached, although the British Eighth Army has driven straight to Tripoli, the British army's momentum is not sharp, so the Axis forces can still assist General Arnim, who landed in Tunisia. Although Tripoli has fallen today, if General Rommel can contact General Arnim and fight side by side, and the terrain of Tunisia is suitable for defense, then Tunisia, the only barrier for the Axis in North Africa, is still in the hands of the Axis powers, and the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States will not be easily successful. At present, the Axis forces in North Africa are pouring all their efforts into the greatest struggle. After General Rommel transferred his position, he has achieved local success in geography, which is enough to maintain the strength of the mechanized troops. We can see the geographical importance of the war in Tunisia. The issue is not only about the territory of Africa, but also about the control of the sea and air in the Mediterranean. The Mediterranean is one of the important locations for the United Kingdom and the United States to fight the world. From Cape Bon in northeastern Tunisia to Marsala in Sicily, the straight line is only 144 nautical miles. For the sake of defending Italy itself, the new battle situation has a great relationship with Italy. (Transcribed by Ren: from the Asahi Shimbun on January 26)

### Solomon Islands Area: Japanese Air Raids on US Positions; German Newspaper Praises the Victory at Rennell

Lisbon, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to the US Navy Department's announcement yesterday, Japanese aircraft again attacked Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands on the 29th of last month. However, the state of public morale has not been announced.

Buenos Aires, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to a Washington dispatch, the US Navy Department released a battle report on the 1st, stating that Japanese air units bombed US military positions in the Solomon Islands area on the 29th.

Berlin, February 2nd, Central News Agency: On the 1st, Berlin's evening newspapers published the battle situation of the sea battle of Rennell, as announced by the Japanese headquarters and reported to the parliament by the Japanese Minister of the Navy, Shimada, on the front page. The Deutsche Nachrichten newspaper even carried a lengthy telegram from Tokyo correspondent Schulte, praising the unprecedented victory of the Japanese naval air force.

Stockholm, February 2nd, Central News Agency: On the 1st, Swedish evening newspapers all published the results of the Japanese Navy's sea battle at Rennell Island in a prominent position with large headlines. Since the Karlstad talks, the Swedish people have been misled by anti-Axis propaganda regarding the war situation on the Eastern Front and elsewhere. Therefore, when the news of the Japanese Navy's outstanding achievements in this battle came, they were surprised.

Istanbul, February 2nd, Central News Agency: After the news of the sea battle of Rennell Island, as announced by the Japanese headquarters, was transmitted here, it was broadcast by the Tokyo Broadcasting Station.

Lisbon, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to Washington sources, the US Navy Department today refused to comment on the recent announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters regarding the sinking or damaging of seven Allied warships by Japanese aircraft in the sea battle off Rennell Island.

Spokesman for Japanese Information Bureau Comments on Recent Victories

Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Mr. Hori, spokesman for the Information Bureau, recently commented on Japan's recent victories in the South Pacific, saying that the decisive victory won by the Imperial Navy Air Force in the battle off Rennell Island was the first strong response from Japan to the boasts of the United Kingdom and the United States after the Casablanca Conference about a major offensive in 1943. When the Casablanca Conference was announced, it was extravagantly promised to the world that a major offensive would be launched in 1943. However, within a week, the Allied powers received their first response. On January 29th and 30th, our Imperial Navy Air Force achieved outstanding results in the battle off Rennell Island, which shattered the extravagant hopes of the British and American camps and once again proved that the enemy's attempt to break into the vast area controlled by Japan was in vain. US Secretary of the Navy Knox, after inspecting the Pacific war zone, declared to the press in Honolulu with fanfare, "The preparation period is over. We have just begun to fight. We are ready to strike hard and will continue to strike hard. The loss of ships is a matter of great concern to Japan." This is quite interesting. When the US Secretary of the Navy made this extravagant statement, his fleet seemed to have encountered the most tragic disaster, suffering an extremely fierce blow, or perhaps he was unable to report this bad news. In any case, Knox probably wants to shut up now. Or Knox should not forget who is the one who "strikes hard" and who is truly concerned about the loss of ships. Up to now, the American radio stations are still saying that there is no news from the Solomon Islands area, so it is expected that the Allied powers will still be unaware of this major setback for some time to come (two battleships and three cruisers sunk, one battleship and one cruiser damaged, and three fighter planes shot down). It is their practice for the United States to delay announcing war losses. Although officers like Knox are optimistic, British and American people now admit that even the most distant outposts of Japan cannot be slightly penetrated by the Allied powers. Although inspections are strict, the truth cannot be concealed. For example, British military commentator Forbes wrote in the "London Illustrated News" that "the hope of the Allied forces recovering the areas occupied by Japan is very slim," and said that "Australia and the United States have no victories in New Guinea." The Times magazine also said that although the Allied powers are working hard, "there is no progress in the Pacific war." The rapidly deteriorating position of the United States in the Pacific has caused extreme anxiety in the so-called Allied camp and a growing sense of the bitterness of defeat. The Australian people are quite shocked by the unfavorable war situation approaching their coast. Australian Prime Minister Curtin has repeatedly appealed to the United States for more assistance, and Australian Foreign Minister Evatt also said to the Australian people a day or two ago, "Australia needs more American assistance to meet the legitimate needs of the overall strategy in the Southwest Pacific." When Evatt made this statement, he obviously did not know about the tragic defeat of the US Navy. Regardless of Knox's extravagant statements or the promises of the Casablanca Conference, the Australian people have to obey the facts, that is, even if the assistance they need continues to arrive, it will only be a small amount. As for Chongqing, it is said that it is quite disappointed with the Casablanca Conference. A United Press dispatch from Chongqing said, "Unless American supplies, convenient transportation, and other necessities are transported overland through Burma, the Chinese army will not launch an offensive. It is generally believed here that the importance of reopening the Burma Road to China is being underestimated everywhere." Chongqing's neglect is like that of Australia. Other "Allied" countries who want American assistance are no different. The supplies from the self-proclaimed "arsenal of democracy" will not arrive, and the Casablanca Conference has proven to be a desert mirage composed of new promises and guarantees, just like the previous meetings between Roosevelt and Churchill, with no substance at all, only dazzling fools.

### Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Explains War Aims: Defeat the Enemy by Various Means, But No Intention of Dominating the World

Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Prime Minister Tojo said in response to questions from members of the General Budget Committee of the House of Representatives today that the Japanese Empire is determined to use various methods to defeat the enemy's combat power, but Japan has no intention of dominating the world. Japan's true intention is to establish co-existence and co-prosperity among all countries. In order to realize this intention, Japan must inflict a severe blow on the United Kingdom and the United States, complete Japan's self-preservation and self-defense, and restore the freedom and prosperity of Greater East Asia. One year after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has become a "state with resources," and its resources have exceeded those of the United Kingdom and the United States, and its combat power has also increased rapidly. On the contrary, the United Kingdom and the United States are struggling under the heavy burden of increasing difficulties. In terms of materials, Japan has occupied the vast resources of the Southern Region, which has laid the foundation for certain victory. Furthermore, the countries of East Asia have all awakened and are cooperating closely with us. The allied countries of the United Kingdom and the United States are gradually expanding their military lines around the world, so the anti-Axis countries all feel that replenishment is difficult. At this critical moment, the United States has lost its important war materials such as rubber and tin, so it cannot increase the production of war equipment to make up for the huge consumption of the current war. Taking aircraft as an example, the United States now has to manufacture wooden aircraft due to the lack of aluminum. This is only one aspect of the critical shortage of important war materials in the United States. In terms of morale, the American people value individualism and lack true traditional spirit. The American national defense mechanism is fragile, while Japan has a national unity mechanism. The people have a fervent determination to fight to the end until victory is achieved. The United Kingdom and the United States' extravagant plans for a new world after the war are merely to conceal their defeat and deceive the people of their own countries and neutral countries. Japan is not like that. It clarified its war aims in the imperial rescript declaring war on the United Kingdom and the United States, so that all countries can get what they deserve. Japan is always making its greatest efforts for the co-prosperity of all countries in the world. Therefore, Japan's actions are fundamentally different from the ambitions of the United Kingdom and the United States to control the world for centuries. In order to eliminate this ambition of the United Kingdom and the United States, Japan took up arms on December 8, 1941. Today, the development of the war is beneficial to us and is getting closer and closer to the goal. The abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions in China, as well as granting independence to Burma within this year, are the prelude to Japan's complete realization of its lofty goals. The Prime Minister finally said that although Japan is pouring all its efforts into fighting the United States and the United Kingdom, it has no intention of occupying American territory. It is useless for Japan to occupy any part of the United States or South America.

Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo answered questions from member Nakajima Mitani at the general meeting of the House of Representatives Budget Committee on the morning of the 2nd regarding fundamental issues of strengthening combat power, and explained his determination to handle state affairs, roughly saying, "I believe that the harmony between command and state affairs is very important. Therefore, I serve as both Prime Minister and Minister of the Army, and the proper handling of state affairs must be carried out with war as the object. However, while state affairs should adapt to combat, combat should also fully consider the requirements of state affairs. At this moment, the harmony between the two is extremely harmonious, and the liaison meeting between the government and the Supreme Command serves as today's highest policy and seeks to adjust the two. As Prime Minister, I have a clear understanding of state affairs, and at the same time, as Minister of the Army, I can also participate in the command and know its details. Therefore, I can make the relationship of the command immediately reflect on state affairs, and I can make the progress of state affairs reflect on combat. Today, the harmony between combat and command, especially with industry, is the most important, so I believe that combat should consider national strength and properly apply the relationship between combat and national strength."

### Japanese Army Captures 300,000 Prisoners of War

Tokyo, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: Lieutenant General Oyama Fumio, Director of the Legal Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, declared at a meeting of the Committee for the Revision of Military Law in the House of Peers today that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army has captured a total of 300,000 prisoners of war, including 118,000 Westerners, including British, American, Dutch, Australian, and Canadians, most of whom are detained in the occupied areas, and some of them are also detained in Japan, Korea, and Taiwan. As of January 20th of this year, 90 people have been tried by military tribunals. As for the prisoners of war captured in the Chinese war, they are currently treated in accordance with military discipline.

### Burma Border Defenses Consolidated; Allied Aircraft Shot Down 70 Planes

A Japanese air base in Burma, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: It was learned today that in the Indian-Burma theater in January, a total of 70 Allied aircraft were shot down or destroyed by Japanese aircraft or Japanese anti-aircraft fire, which shows that the Japanese defenses in the Burma border area are as solid as gold, and the combat power of enemy pilots has shown a marked decline. Among the enemy aircraft destroyed, 23 were shot down by Japanese fighters, 17 were destroyed on the ground, and Japanese anti-aircraft fire shot down 30 enemy aircraft that invaded Burma. The losses suffered by the Allied air force during Japanese night raids on India are also included in this number. A total of six Japanese aircraft did not return.

### Air Raid on Rangoon

Rangoon, February 1st, Allied News Agency: A squadron of seven enemy aircraft appeared over the Burmese capital Rangoon this afternoon and indiscriminately bombed the city. A Sulta and an Indian temple were hit by bombs, and Burmese and Indians who had taken refuge in them were killed and injured.

### New York Citizens Demonstrate and March

Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to the New York Times, New York citizens held up the banner of "Liberate Indian Prisons" on the 26th and blocked the road to demonstrate in front of the British Consulate General. When the police arrived to try to stop them, a conflict broke out, resulting in the arrest of 22 citizens. It is reported that an anti-British demonstration also took place in front of the British Embassy in Washington on the same day, and 25 citizens were arrested.

### Fascist Legion of Italy Celebrates Anniversary: Mussolini Personally Delivers Address, Vowing to Sacrifice Everything and Never Surrender

Rome, 2nd (Central News Agency) - Yesterday marked the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Legion. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, accompanied by Fascist Party Secretary-General Starace, Fascist Legion Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Giarpiatti, and numerous key figures from the party, government, and military, observed the commemorative exercises held in central Italy. After reviewing the Fascist Legion and student volunteers, Mussolini delivered an impromptu speech, expressing his determination to fight for ultimate victory. He stated, "Today is the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Legion. It is of great significance that we are holding this commemorative ceremony here. I deeply hope that you will demonstrate your strength and value. In this crucial stage of the decisive battle, you should continue to train with unwavering will. Although the scale of the war is large, I believe that ultimate victory will surely belong to us, the Fascist Legion. You should continue to advance and set an example for the nation. I deeply know that you have no other desire in life, and I deeply believe in your loyalty."

Rome, 2nd (Domei) - Yesterday, on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Fascist Party's army, Prime Minister Mussolini addressed the party army, stating that Italy would not cease fighting until it had achieved final victory with its Axis comrades. "Our only response to the unconscious, sinful, and mysterious meetings in Casablanca is that we will not surrender as long as we can hold weapons in our hands."

Rome, 2nd (Rengo) - During the military review held to commemorate the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Legion, the Italian Prime Minister gave an address, saying, "The significance of the Fascist Legion celebrating its anniversary during this period of iron and blood warfare is self-evident. We have been fighting against our primary enemy for thirty-two months, and the enemy has only achieved one victory. When news of the occupation of Libya spread, the Italian people remained extremely calm, firmly believing that our army would eventually recover the lost territory. Temporary gains and losses are not a concern. We vow not to surrender and will continue to advance. I deeply believe that you will not hesitate to sacrifice everything to serve the country."

Rome, 2nd (Rengo) - Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, on the 20th anniversary of the founding of the militia, inspected three battalions of boy scouts from the group, all of whom were seventeen years old. The inspection took place in southern Italy, as a demonstration to North Africa. The newly appointed Italian Army Chief of Staff General Ambrogio and General Bono both participated.

Rome, 1st (Havas) - Today marks the 20th anniversary of the founding of the Italian Fascist Militia. Prime Minister Mussolini delivered a speech this morning, and the evening editions of various newspapers here have expressed enthusiastic welcome, emphasizing the unwavering will of the Italian people to continue fighting until final victory is achieved. For example, the Italian Daily stated that this unwavering determination is the best response to the declaration made by Churchill and Roosevelt in the port of Casablanca. President Roosevelt "spoke of unconditional surrender by the Axis powers, and our response is to fight to the end." As for the Prime Minister's speech, it strongly emphasized the Italian nation's remembrance of Africa, and "we believe that the Axis powers will definitely be victorious in Africa. The Italian nation can always continue to fulfill its civilizing mission."

### Churchill Meets Turkish President in Taurus Mountains Villa: Ankara Announces Purpose of Talks is to Enhance Turkey's Defense and Security

Stockholm, 2nd (Domei) - London announced last night that Prime Minister Churchill, after holding a meeting with the US President in Casablanca, visited Turkey with his military and diplomatic advisors. On the 30th and 31st of last month, he met with Turkish President İsmet İnönü in Adana to discuss the issue of British and American aid to Turkey. After the meeting, Churchill returned to Cairo.

Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - London officials announced last night that British Prime Minister Churchill had met with Turkish President İsmet İnönü. Turkish authorities and Churchill's entourage held several talks and have agreed on measures for Britain and the United States to provide material assistance to strengthen Turkey's defense. Both Churchill and İsmet expressed satisfaction with the outcome of the talks, which took place on January 31st. Churchill returned to Cairo yesterday.

Ankara, 2nd (Rengo) - The Turkish government issued an official statement this morning regarding the Adana meeting, stating that the purpose of the talks was to enhance Turkey's security in defense. Churchill shared the same views as Roosevelt at the meeting, and Roosevelt strongly supported the meeting. The statement further mentioned that the meeting was convened at Churchill's request. Churchill was hosted by the Turkish government during his stay in Turkey. The Adana meeting took place on January 30th and 31st.

Ankara, 2nd (Rengo) - On the 30th and 31st of last month, Churchill and Turkish President İsmet İnönü held a meeting in Adana. The President arrived in Adana by train, and Churchill boarded the train to meet him. They traveled together to the President's summer villa in the Taurus Mountains. Local newspapers published the Turkish government's statement without commentary. Political and diplomatic figures believe that the outcome of the meeting is a victory for Turkey's neutral policy. According to Turkish officials who participated in the meeting, the Turkish official statement stated that both sides had harmonious opinions on post-war issues and did not mean that they had fully recognized the Atlantic Charter. It is widely believed that the British side urged Turkey to abandon its neutrality and fight alongside Britain and the United States, but the Turkish authorities have not decided to abandon their neutrality.

Delegates from Both Sides

Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - According to an official statement released by London last night, the delegates from both sides participating in the British-Turkish meeting in Adana were as follows: On the Turkish side, Prime Minister Saraçoğlu, Chief of General Staff General Kâzım Orbay, Foreign Minister Numan Menemencioğlu, Deputy Undersecretary of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs Erkin, aviation expert of the General Staff General Kâzım Orbay, and Director of the Military Strategy Division of the General Staff Kayabal.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis countries are currently using the Roosevelt-Churchill talks as material for expanded propaganda. Australian Radio broadcast on the 2nd that, according to a dispatch from Ankara, Britain, the United States, and Turkey have concluded a defense alliance, but the content of the alliance was not mentioned at all. Therefore, the so-called British and American enhancement of material transportation to Turkey is nothing more than exaggerated propaganda.

Lisbon, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, British Prime Minister Churchill and the Turkish President held talks in a special train near Adana. It is reported that the results of the meeting will be communicated to Roosevelt and Stalin separately.

Berlin Not Surprised

Berlin, 2nd (Rengo) - The official statement issued by the British authorities regarding Churchill's visit to Turkey and the Adana meeting did not surprise Berlin, as the German Foreign Ministry had already obtained information about this matter in the past two days. According to the British side, Churchill [missing text] continuing the policy decided in the Casablanca meeting. Although the British official statement did not mention that the Casablanca meeting had discussed the [missing text] issue of the Far East, the military preparations made by Britain there are undeniable. Churchill's purpose in [visiting] Turkey was to [missing text] the opening of the Dardanelles. If successful, Soviet ships could take this route to avoid the [missing text] voyage in the Arctic Sea [missing text]. [Missing text] Turkey's neutrality is over. However, Turkey has little interest in this plan, but out of friendship, the Turkish President [missing text] met with Churchill in Adana, and the British-Turkish agreement was concluded.

Germany and Turkey have also concluded a friendly agreement. Therefore, the optimistic attitude created by British newspapers due to the Adana meeting has no [missing text] reason. As for the Turkish side, [missing text] maintained a reserved attitude. The news reported in the newspapers all came from the British side. Therefore, whether the Allied powers will increase their [missing text] pressure on Turkey has become the most important issue at present.

### The Powerful Tojo Cabinet: Promoting New Talents Without Emphasis on Seniority, Implementing the Spirit of Selflessness and Public Service (Translated from the January Issue of "Enterprise") (2)

The Background of Prime Minister Tojo

Prime Minister Tojo was born in Iwate Prefecture. His father was the famous Lieutenant General Tojo Eikyo, who was heavily relied upon for his introduction of German strategic theories during the time when General Kawakami Soroku served as Chief of Staff. Unfortunately, he was not tolerated by General Terauchi Masatake in the army and retired as a [missing character] general. His grandfather was a musician for the Southern Clan. Other figures born in Iwate Prefecture include Admiral Mine Mitsumasa, General Itagaki, and Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army Tada, among others. Prime Minister Tojo also occasionally attended the "Morning Breakfast Meeting" of people from that prefecture. Prime Minister Tojo was born when his father, Eikyo, was the commander of the Kokura Division, and he lived in Kyushu during his childhood, so his connection with Iwate Prefecture is not deep, and he does not carry the accent of people from the Tohoku region.

He was a graduate of the 12th class of the Army War College. He graduated five classes earlier than General Hata Shunroku, the supreme commander of the army in China. He never served as a division commander. When the China Incident broke out, he was the commander of the Tojo Brigade and crossed the border of Manchukuo to advance into Inner Mongolia. He achieved the Battle of Beijing-Suiyuan in military history, so he also has the experience of a division commander. Furthermore, he accumulated a wealth of experience in both the military administration and military command systems. During his time as a lieutenant colonel, he served as an adjutant in the Ministry of the Army, a member of the General Staff Headquarters, an instructor of military science at the Army University, and a section chief in the Maintenance Bureau. During his time as a colonel, he served as a unit commander and a section chief in the General Staff Headquarters. During his time as a major general, he served as the director of military investigations and a brigade commander. During his time as the director of military investigations, the criticisms from political parties regarding the Manchurian Incident stirred up rumors of discord between the military and the people, and he was unable to quell the matter, causing [missing text]. During his time as a [missing character] general, he served as the Chief of Staff of the Kwantung Army, the Vice Minister of the Army, and the Director-General of Aviation. He had already become acquainted with [missing character] Secretary General Hoshino while in Manchuria.

When he was the Vice Minister of the Army, in Showa 13 (1938), he served as the vice minister under Army Minister Itagaki. At this time, he was known as the "Razor Vice Minister," demonstrating his administrative talents. Prime Minister Tojo meticulously recorded even the most minor details, so he had an exceptionally strong memory. From this time on, his reputation became associated with the great military administrator Umezu Mijiro.

He served as vice minister for only half a year, then transferred to Director-General of Aviation. When the second Konoe Cabinet was formed in Showa 15 (1940), he was promoted by his seniors to become Minister of the Army. Upon receiving the appointment, he immediately took a plane to visit the new emperor, then flew to Osaka to instruct the division commander. Such was his manner of doing things. From then on, his life became tense, with no spare time. He went to bed at 11:00 PM and woke up at 4:30 AM, diligently striving to dedicate himself to the country.

In October of Showa 16 (1941), he formed a cabinet after the third Konoe Cabinet—[missing text] for the first time in twenty years since General Baron Tanaka Giichi [missing text], the first cabinet formed by a [missing text] career military officer. The reason for the reappearance of such a cabinet was that former [missing text] Prime Minister [missing text] determined at the Ogikubo meeting that command and politics should be unified. The [missing character] international situation during the third Konoe Cabinet was almost the same as during the Warring States period. In the Warring States period, the ruling power was naturally in the hands of military commanders rather than civil officials. It can also be said to be an inevitable process towards a military-led cabinet. When Prime Minister Tojo formed his cabinet, he concurrently served as Minister of Home Affairs, which was a preparation for this. After entering the Greater East Asia War, the domestic situation became clearer, creating a stronger sense of unity, which is gratifying. Prime Minister Tojo's painstaking efforts, working diligently day and night, bearing the responsibility for the country's safety on his shoulders, are worthy of our praise and admiration.

President Suzuki's Political Power

The top staff member of the Tojo Cabinet, the one who drives political power, is President Suzuki of the Planning Board, who is Prime Minister Tojo's closest confidant, and Secretary General Hoshino. These two men are experienced, knowledgeable, and skillful cabinet members, making them the most perfect politicians. President Suzuki of the Planning Board is a passionate person. Secretary General Hoshino has served in Manchuria, is strong-willed, and has made many contributions to the Tojo Cabinet, making him Prime Minister Tojo's most trusted aide.

When President Suzuki of the Planning Board took office as a state minister, he expressed his feelings, saying, "As a commoner becoming a minister, I can only do my utmost to serve the country in the future." He was born in the mountain village of Futakawa in Sanbu County, Chiba Prefecture. He graduated from Hongo Elementary School and studied at the private Keisei Academy in Shibamachi for two years. In order to pursue further education, he went to Tokyo and entered Kyokuyo Middle School. After graduating, he entered the Army War College as a 22nd [missing character] graduate. After graduating, he was stationed in China and served as a news section chief, an instructor at the Army University, and an investigator at the Cabinet Investigation Bureau. Under the [missing character] Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa Heisuke, he served as the Director of Political Affairs, and was highly praised.

Lieutenant General Suzuki Chuichi is a passionate person. During his time as a lieutenant colonel serving as a news section chief under Army Minister Araki, he said, "To advance the country and politics, only one or two people with the spirit of being willing to go through fire and water are enough, there is no need for many people."

The subsequent developments in the domestic and international situation matched his predictions. His political philosophy became the principle of action, leading to the aforementioned progressiveness. His actions were like a war, moving forward bravely and resolutely. During the Manchurian Incident, as the news section chief, he rejected liberalism, created the term "advanced national defense," and rang the alarm bell for the national total war to awaken the public. From a historical perspective, he has considerable talent. During the Manchurian Incident, in order to persuade the financial authorities to raise the army budget, he visited the then-Finance Minister Takahashi at his private residence in Akasaka and discussed the situation for several hours. Using his qualifications as the news section chief to explain the budget to the finance minister, he was such a decisive and independent person. At that time, Finance Minister Takahashi angrily said to him, "You are an infantry lieutenant colonel, and I am an accounting lieutenant colonel." During his tenure as an investigator at the Investigation Bureau of the Hirota Cabinet, he joined forces with Okumura Kiwao and others to urge the government to implement electricity control. This kind of creative driving force also [missing character] came from passion.

After he became the President of the Planning Board, the political power of the Planning Board was greatly strengthened. The new [missing character] of the Greater East Asia Ministry and the simplification of administrative functions in various ministries were also designed by the political power of this Planning Board, and were implemented on the political power of the Cabinet, achieving the goal in one go. The Planning Board formulates everything. National plans, production expansion, and material mobilization all became the duties of the Planning Board, gaining the preemptive right to important national policy budgets, becoming a major part of the Cabinet, thanks to the great efforts of Lieutenant General Suzuki.

After Director-General of the Asia Development Board, Lieutenant General Yanagawa, transferred to [missing character] Minister, he became the [missing character] Director-General in fact and guided the Asia Development Board. During the Second Konoe Cabinet, he became a state minister and the President of the Planning Board, so he resigned from active duty. When Lieutenant General Yanagawa was the Vice Minister of the Army, Lieutenant Colonel Suzuki was the news section chief. They were old [missing character], and Lieutenant General Yanagawa trusted and entrusted everything to him when they worked together at the Asia Development Board.

Some people have criticized his stubborn and arrogant personality, saying that he is too sharp and has too many rough edges. But the current him is very different from when he was the news section chief and investigator. He has been successful after years of political experience.

Secretary Hoshino's Tenacity

Secretary Hoshino seems younger than President Suzuki of the Planning Board, and has not lost the youthful vitality and vigor of his youth. During his time in Osaka, he lived in Nishinomiya, and he and his wife used to pick up balls for people. His shabby clothes and hats remained the same even when he became famous. During the Second Konoe Cabinet, he was summoned to Ogikubo. He wore the Concord Association uniform and wiped his tears with a crumpled handkerchief. Everyone was shocked by his unconventional and unrestrained appearance.

He was born in Kamishu Shioda, and his father was a pastor of the Christian church. He grew up in Tokyo and Yokohama, retaining the characteristics of the Shioda tradition. After arriving in Manchuria, his unique style was further enhanced. After years of hard struggle, his character became quite tenacious. The couple had a sincere bond, and their love was deep. His wife was very virtuous and good at socializing. When lecturing on the stage, she spoke eloquently, captivating the audience. She was very active during the Manchurian era, frequently visiting the city hall and was known as the "Soong Mei-ling of Manchuria." Secretary Hoshino would not eat any dish that was not made by his wife, so his wife had to make dishes that suited his taste despite her busy life, making her his best domestic helper. His wife and Prime Minister Tojo's [missing character] are relatives. Recently, to avoid suspicion, even official exchanges have gradually decreased.

Hoshino Naoki left the Ministry of Finance for Manchukuo in Showa 7 (1932). During his time in the Ministry of Finance, Hoshino, along with Ishiwatari Sotaro and Irimano Takeo, were known as the Three Birds of the Ministry of Finance. He served as the chief of the management section of the tax bureau and the chief of the national property section of the construction and property bureau. In Showa 7 (1932), he went to Manchukuo to serve as the director of the general affairs department of the finance department of that country, then the vice-director of the general affairs department, and then [missing character] the director-general of general affairs. Before leaving for Manchukuo, his father-in-law encouraged him on his deathbed, saying, "You will be buried in Manchuria, so there is no need to be too sad now." After he said these words, he stepped onto the land of the continent. His activity in Manchuria was as expected by his father-in-law. Hoshino succeeded Ohtachi Shigeo as the secretary-general of general affairs. The director of the general affairs department often held the position for no more than one year, but he served for more than four years, successfully completing his task as the director-general of general affairs, presiding over this difficult position.

Hoshino has achieved a lot in the economy of Manchukuo. As the saying goes, "One hand holds the scriptures, and the other hand holds the sword." Hoshino, on the one hand, crushed the great ideals of the Wang Dao national construction, and on the other hand, he was calculating the accounts. So he got along very well with the military, and when he argued with arrogant soldiers, he would often say, "Please look at the numbers, isn't it very clear?" So his calculation for Manchukuo can really be called a master.

He worked hard in Manchukuo for about ten years and is a supporter of the Pan-Asianism (economic groupism) of Japan, China, and Manchukuo. The establishment of the high national defense system of Japan, China, and Manchukuo, before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the importance to Japan, needless to say, Hoshino has experience in the practice of the economic group of China, Japan, and Manchukuo after the first five-year plan in Manchukuo, he personally experienced its necessity and importance. Because of this experience, when the Second Konoe Cabinet was formed, Hoshino was appointed as the President of the Planning Board.

Hoshino returned to the country during the Second Konoe Cabinet and served as the President of the Planning Board, and later as a Minister without Portfolio. He resigned in the middle and became a member of the House of Peers, introduced by Count Sakai Tadamasu and joined the research association. At this time, he indulged in [missing character] music. When Prime Minister Tojo organized the wartime cabinet, he humbly declined the position of secretary-general, saying that he was not capable. After taking [missing character] the position, he showed his unique personality and tenacity, becoming the pillar of the Tojo Cabinet and gaining the prime minister's trust.

### Intense Fighting to Occur in Tunisia: Rommel's Troops Engage in Rearguard Action, British Eighth Army Suffers Heavy Losses

Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - Churchill returned from Adana last night and told reporters that there would be intense fighting in Tunisia in the coming months or weeks. The British hope to drive out the German and Italian troops and prevent them from gaining a foothold in Africa.

Tangier, 2nd (Rengo) - The command of the Free French forces in Algiers announced that the Axis forces occupied the Feïd Pass in southern Tunisia yesterday afternoon after a massive tank assault. The Axis forces also launched attacks in the areas of Faïd and in the mountainous region between Sbeitla and Kairouan.

Berlin, 2nd (Rengo) - The Axis forces in North Africa, retreating into Tunisia, have arrived at a certain location some days ago. The terrain there is treacherous, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Rommel's strategy often involves a sudden rearguard attack on the enemy after the troops' advance automatically slows down, inflicting heavy damage. The battle between the British Eighth Army and General Rommel's Axis forces is currently taking place in this manner. Reports that the vanguard of the British army has reached the Mareth Line are completely inaccurate. Perhaps a few British motorcycles have crossed the Tunisian border, but the main force of the British Eighth Army is still in western Tripolitania. The Axis forces in Tunisia continue to expand their defense line, but it cannot be considered that they have already launched an offensive. The important mountain passes, such as the pass between Sfax and Gafsa, the pass between Gafsa and Meknassy, and the Sened Pass in the south, have all fallen into the hands of the Axis forces, which is sufficient to resist the Allied advance.

Stockholm, 2nd (Rengo) - London newspapers today published a report from the Allied Forces Command in North Africa, admitting that the city of Faïd has fallen. The city was occupied by a German tank unit after fierce fighting.

Soviet pressure in the Voronezh area has shifted to the southern flank. Soviet forces in Kursk continue their offensive. East of Rostov, between the Don River and the Caucasus, there has been no major fighting in the past few days. The movement of German troops has not been hindered by the enemy.

Bern, Switzerland, 2nd (Havas News Agency) - According to Berlin sources, the headquarters of General Paulus, commander of the German forces in Stalingrad, was originally located in the former Soviet political police headquarters in the city. The intensity of the fighting there for the past five days has been unprecedented.

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - Authoritative sources announced that General Paulus was injured several days before the fall of the secret police headquarters in Stalingrad.

Berlin, 2nd (Haitong News Agency) - It was revealed last night that the area occupied by the southern flank of the German Sixth Army before it was subdued by Soviet forces on Sunday was only 300 meters long. The unit ran out of ammunition and could not withstand the enemy's artillery fire. When the enemy infantry rushed in, fierce fighting broke out inside the secret police headquarters.

### Second Anniversary of the Establishment of the East Asia League; Speech by Director Lin; The East Asia League and the Greater East Asia War

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The 1st was the second anniversary of the establishment of the China General Association of the East Asia League. The Central Broadcasting Station specially invited Lin Bosheng, Director of the Propaganda Committee of the Association, to broadcast a speech entitled "The East Asia League and the Greater East Asia War." He first stated that two years after the signing of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, according to the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Great Asianism and the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, the China General Association of the East Asia League was established to launch the East Asia League ideological movement. After one year, the Greater East Asia War broke out, and the East Asia League movement changed from ideology to fact. After another year, the National Government resolutely joined the war, which further proved that our promotion of the East Asia League was not just a kind of speech, but a concrete action to achieve its realization. He then stated that a small number of people misunderstand the Greater East Asia War as a struggle between Japan and Britain and the United States in the Pacific, which is a great mistake. At the beginning of the peace movement, friendly countries advocated the construction of a new order in East Asia. The Sino-Japanese Treaty and the Three-Power Declaration clearly stated "the construction of a new order in East Asia based on the spirit of morality." The so-called new order, the so-called spirit of morality, is the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, and also the foundation of the East Asia League. In other words, the Greater East Asia War is a war of the spirit of morality against hegemonicism and colonialism, and the combination of aggressive powers is a combination of utilitarianism. The East Asia League is a permanent combination based on the spirit of morality. Finally, he said that the Greater East Asia War is not just a military struggle. In the economic, political, and cultural aspects, a thorough struggle must be launched. Not only must we use force to drive out the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia, but also overthrow the political, economic, and cultural systems of British and American utilitarianism. At the same time, in the positive aspect, we must establish new political, economic, cultural, and military systems based on the spirit of morality, replace colonialism with the principle of a co-prosperity sphere, and replace utilitarianism with the spirit of morality, so that the East Asian nations can, within the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, build a new East Asian order based on the spirit of morality according to the four major guidelines of political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication of the East Asia League. On the second anniversary of the establishment of the China General Association of the East Asia League, we recall with the greatest sincerity and encourage all compatriots to work together under the four major guidelines of the East Asia League and with the spirit of the New National Movement to strive for the Greater East Asia War, completely revive China, and defend the mission of East Asia.

### British and American Anxiety Over the Difficulty of Counter-Offensives

-Sakura

The lingering pain of New Guinea still lingers, German submarines are difficult to deal with

"Lisbon Special Telegram 24th dispatched by Sakura Special Correspondent" - The Soviet counter-offensive, the retreat of Rommel's army, and the British military commentators with agreed propaganda materials, have produced optimistic arguments. But there are still two real problems to consider. First, the threat of submarines, American assistance in materials and personnel is absolutely necessary for Britain, and this is also the key to victory or defeat, without American assistance, attacking Europe will be a dream. The activities of Axis submarines in all the world's oceans are becoming more and more aggressive. The revised Roth wartime insurance rates on the 16th listed the northern waters of the United Kingdom and the area near Malta in the western Mediterranean as outside the scope of coverage, indicating that these sea areas are considered the most dangerous places. The insurance rate for the Atlantic route from the United Kingdom to the Americas and the west coast of Africa has increased to 10%, the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope to Australia to 15%, the United Kingdom to the Red Sea, Aden, Suez, Port Said, Alexandria to Malta to 20%, and the United Kingdom via the Cape of Good Hope and the Red Sea to Syria to 17%, and to Turkey to 20%.

Military commentator Harky said in the Sunday Times: "More submarines are being built than sunk, but half of the ships lost by the British and Americans this year cannot digest the attacking power with their transportation capacity." Emmanuel said in the Daily Express: "The German submarine according to the Secretary of the Navy has 500 ships, but in fact there are probably more than this number. Since the beginning of the war, the losses of the British and Americans have exceeded the total tonnage of Britain in 1935. Even if the United States builds a lot of ships, if there are no fast and defensive cargo ships, escort warships, and escort aircraft, the shipbuilding plan will eventually be disappointed."

Although experts have various countermeasures for submarines, they are nothing more than bombing submarine factories, naval and air force escorts, and building fast cargo ships. Because none of these can achieve absolute results, it is impossible to decide which strategy to focus on. The results of bombing the factories did not reduce the production of submarines as the government claimed. In short, without a proper solution, the threat posed by submarine tactics in this war is far greater than in the last war.

Another problem is that the land battles in New Guinea have made the difficulty of fighting Japan even more painful. A special correspondent from The Times reported, saying that the Japanese army is strong, unafraid of death, and difficult to attack. The newspaper's editorial on the 14th advocated that a policy of piecemeal destruction should not be adopted, but that all efforts should be made to defeat Japan first. The editorial argued: "Sea power depends on air power, and air power depends on land power. If airfields are opened in China to carry out large-scale air strikes, Japan will immediately occupy them with its army. Therefore, at this time, when fighting Japan, strong land forces should be placed in Burma and the Pacific, and the air force should launch attacks from Burma to attack transport ships in the Pacific." Both newspapers simultaneously opposed making the continents the first battlefield and the Orient the second battlefield, and warned against the general battle theory of defeating Germany first and then attacking Japan, and downplaying the mistake of Japan. Due to the losses of huge warships and lives in the battle of New Guinea last year, a major warning was given. In order to defeat Japan, this kind of war should no longer be continued in the future, and it advocated regaining East Bengal Bay, reopening the Burma Road to assist the Chongqing army, and attacking Japan. The Sunday Times said on the 17th:

"This is the most correct argument. We are too far away from Japan to understand Japan. The only ones who can attack Japan are the Soviet Union, but the Soviet Union has not yet joined the war with Japan. The biggest obstacles to the offensive theory are submarines and the Japanese army, and this is also the aim of the Axis powers." (翔: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun on January 27th)

### Japanese Air Force Active in Southern China

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain frontline base of the Japanese army, the Yu army, which raided key points such as Shaoguan, Guilin, and Yong'an, has suffered severe bombing by the Japanese air force. Its troop strength and military facilities in these areas have been almost completely destroyed. In order to regroup and make a comeback, they are attempting to stir up trouble. In order to thoroughly punish them, the Japanese air force continues to bomb the Yu army's bases in the Xijiang and Beijiang areas. They also repeatedly attacked the Yu army units advancing in spite of the bad weather. The following is a record of the activities of the Japanese air force from the 26th of last month to the 1st of this month. On the 26th, a bomber squadron attacked Wengyuan, 60 kilometers southeast of Shaoguan, and severely bombed the barracks of the 156th Division of the Yu army, 4 kilometers northwest of the city, destroying 60 houses. In addition, it bombed military facilities south of the city. Another squadron attacked Zhaoqing, dropping heavy bombs on the headquarters of the 64th Army of the Yu army and its military facilities. On the 27th, it attacked Heyuan, 70 kilometers northeast of Huizhou, severely damaging Yu military facilities. On the 30th, it again attacked Zhaoqing from the air, destroying the Yu army headquarters there. Another squadron attacked Fogang, kilometers east of Shaoguan, destroying six Yu army barracks. On the 31st, it attacked Qingyuan from the air, severely bombing the headquarters of the 159th Division of the Yu army. Another squadron attacked Huizhou, dropping many bombs on warehouses along the coast, causing a large fire. On the 1st, the Japanese air force flew at low altitude in spite of the bad weather, attacked Qingyuan, and severely bombed it. It also discovered about 300 Yu army soldiers marching near Sicheng Road, 25 kilometers south of the city. They were immediately pursued and machine-gunned, and completely wiped out.

### Prison Names in Various Provinces Changed to Local Place Names

Nanjing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - The new prisons in various provinces under the Ministry of Judicial Administration have been named with the order of establishment, such as the First and Second Prisons of a certain province. This has been the case for a long time without change. However, since the incident, some prisons in various provinces have been destroyed by war and cannot be restored. Those that are restored later still use the original names, resulting in situations such as Jiangsu province having no First or Second Prison, but having the Third Prison, and Anhui province having only the Second Prison, but no First Prison. The order is reversed, and the names do not match the reality. In view of this, the Ministry has made corrections, canceling the First and Second, etc., names of the prisons in various provinces and changing them to the place names where they are located, in order to make them uniform. The matter has been reported to the Executive Yuan for record yesterday, and instructions have been issued to the high courts of various provinces to instruct the prisons under their jurisdiction to comply. The following is an excerpt of the corrected names: The Third Prison of Jiangsu is changed to Suzhou Prison of Jiangsu, the branch prison of the Third Prison of Jiangsu is changed to Suzhou Prison Branch of Jiangsu, the Fourth Prison of Jiangsu is changed to Nantong Prison of Jiangsu, the Fifth Prison of Jiangsu is changed to Wuxi Prison of Jiangsu, the Sixth Prison of Jiangsu is changed to Zhenjiang Prison of Jiangsu, the First Prison of Zhejiang is changed to Hangzhou Prison of Zhejiang, the Third Prison of Anhui is changed to Wuhu Prison of Anhui, the First Prison of Hubei is changed to Hankou Prison of Hubei, the branch prison of the First Prison of Hubei is changed to Hankou Prison Branch of Hubei, the First Prison of Jiangxi is changed to Jiujiang Prison of Jiangxi.

### Establishment of the Ministry of Food: Minister Gu Talks About Policy Guidelines

Central News Agency, Beijing - The Ministry of Food was officially established on February 1st. Minister Gu Baochong announced his assumption of office at the same time and made an important speech on the policy guidelines of the Ministry of Food in the future. The main points are as follows: The National Government has established the Food Administration Commission for two years now. It first implemented management from the aspects of purchasing rice and distributing food to the people. Because there are other competent authorities for improving agriculture and increasing production, the Food Administration Commission did not take this into account. Now that it has been reorganized into a ministry, it will transition to the stage of overall management. From production to consumption, from main food grains to non-staple foods and substitutes, they will be guided and adjusted separately. When necessary, control will be implemented. The purpose of the Ministry's administration can be summarized as: making the best use of people's talents, land, and resources, enriching national reserves, and stabilizing people's livelihoods, thereby increasing the strength of the Greater East Asia War. According to the scope of food under the jurisdiction of the Ministry, in a broad sense, it includes not only rice, wheat, and flour, which are the main food grains in agricultural products, but also other non-staple foods such as miscellaneous grains, fish, meat, vegetables, eggs, and beverages such as tea, wine, soda, and seasonings such as oil, sauce, sugar, vinegar, etc. All those that can be used as food and are related to nutrition are included. However, salt is still under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Finance due to tax relations. Among the main agricultural food grain management affairs, production policy is the most important, in other words, the issue of increasing production. It is now planned to first plan and implement facilities for the overall improvement of farmland, the widespread establishment of agricultural improvement experimental areas, the replenishment of seeds and fertilizers, the increase of agricultural tools and plowing cattle, the assistance of rural economy, the restoration of wasteland, the repair of dikes and ditches, and the breeding of livestock, the improvement and addition of food factories, etc., to promote the increase of wartime food production.

Regarding the strengthening of management, all manufacturers and vendors will be organized in order to promote the implementation of planned economic policies. Subsequently, it is planned to strictly implement the registration and licensing system to guide the organization of legitimate and systematic commercial groups. All legitimate merchants will be given practical protection to restore and increase the vitality of merchants. Speculation and black market trading will be cracked down on in order to thoroughly control and strengthen the guidance of general price reduction. Regarding distribution and consumption, in this extraordinary period, fairness and thrift are the first priorities. It is necessary to be consistent from top to bottom, work hard and be self-reliant, and at the same time, maintain adequate nutrition and avoid waste, in order to jointly overcome today's difficulties. From the government's standpoint, it must enable the general public to obtain various foods within the necessary limits at reasonable prices. In order to achieve this goal, in addition to requiring the public to help each other sincerely and promote self-awareness, the government will implement a ticket system when necessary. For example, essential oils and other items will be implemented in the same way as the rice ration method implemented in Beijing.

In short, today's food administration is extremely important and complex. I have been ordered to preside over it, and I vow to work carefully and diligently with all my colleagues in order to live up to the heavy trust of the country and the ardent expectations of the people. As for the rice and grain business handled by the Food Administration Commission in the past, a General Management Office for Rice and Grain Procurement and Sales has been specifically established to manage and operate it independently and continuously. This is where the nature of the Ministry and the former Food Administration Commission are slightly different.

### Federal Reserve Notes and Japanese Yen Maintain Parity

Beijing, 2nd (Central News Agency) - When the Director of the Economic Affairs Bureau No. 1 of the Beijing Office of the Japanese Embassy in China met with a group of reporters a few days ago, he talked about the recent currency issue in North China. The main points were that the principle of parity between the yen (Japanese yen) and the yuan (Federal Reserve Note) will be maintained from beginning to end. It is true that various contradictions have arisen in economic policy due to the parity between the yen and the yuan, but abandoning the principle of maintaining parity will lower the value of the currency in North China, which is also not a good solution. The problem in the future lies in how to eliminate these contradictions, promote the exchange of materials, and revitalize industry. All this must be based on the solution of the price problem. In this regard, the North China Political Affairs Commission should strive to strengthen its financial strength and improve its political strength.

### Supreme Advisor Matsui Returns to Beijing After Inspecting the Political Situation in Eastern Zhejiang

Hope That Students Cultivate Morality and Study Hard

The committee members, in the midst of their busy official duties, braved the wind and rain to attend the meeting at this newspaper yesterday. Committee members Chen, Lu, and Shen gave detailed guidance and encouragement to the colleagues on the future scholarship work, and their sincere concern for the situation of poor students and their kind words are always the original intention of people from all walks of life to donate funds.

### Meeting of Japanese Administrative Officials This Morning: Discussing Resident Association Finances and Drafting Guidelines for the Support the War Effort Movement

Dispatch from Allied News Agency, Shanghai: According to news last night, Japanese administrative officials from Central and Southern China are scheduled to meet at the Astor House Hotel in Shanghai at 10:00 this morning to discuss the budget of the Japanese Residents Association for the fiscal year 1943-44 and to draft guidelines for the Support the War Effort Movement for Japanese nationals in China.

### Request for Metered Grain Distribution for the City District

— 3rd installment

The metered grain distribution of the concession authorities, with ten days as a period, ordered the rice shops to sell, never failing to do so on time, and there was never any difference in the quality and price of the rice sold by each rice shop during the same period of metered grain distribution. Looking back at the metered grain distribution in the city district, it is completely different. It has never been possible to distribute it on time. Delays pile on delays, and the three installments per month are completely delayed and vanish without a trace. Moreover, within the same period of so-called metered grain distribution, there are often differences in price and rice quality. As a resident of the Nanshi district, I am very familiar with the metered grain distribution in Nanshi, having personally experienced it. I would like to describe it in detail so that the relevant authorities can understand the general situation and implore the City Grain Administration Bureau to sympathize with the people's plight and improve the system.

For the first month or two, the metered grain distribution in Nanshi was actually household-based, not individual-based, with each household receiving one dou of rice per period, without a fixed schedule. It was not until October of last year that individual-based metered grain distribution was implemented. However, the three installments of grain that should have been received in mid-October were not issued until the end of November. The quantity was also reduced from two sheng of white rice per person per period to one sheng and five ge of broken rice per person per period. One installment in between was supplemented with one jin of flour per person. The November installment was delayed until early December, with 1.4 sheng of brown rice per person (another ge of rice less), and the half jin of flour per person missing from the second installment in October was provided as a supplement. Later, on December 25, the second installment for November was issued, totaling 1.4 sheng of white and broken rice. The third installment for November was not distributed until January 7 of this year, with 1.4 sheng of white rice and 1.5 jin of flour. Afterwards, the rice tickets were changed, effectively canceling the December installment, and the rice tickets received were the three-part rice and flour tickets for January of the 32nd year of the Republic. The first part, the rice ticket, was used to receive two sheng of brown rice per person on January 20 (according to the household rice issued in the first and second wards, it was 1.6 ge of white rice and 4 ge of broken rice per person, costing five yuan, while in the third ward where I live, it was purely brown rice, and the selling price was one jiao more expensive, at 5.1 yuan per person). The second part, the grain ticket, was used to distribute 1.8 sheng of white rice per person on January 30 (another two ge of rice less than the previous installment), costing 4.6 yuan. As of February 2, there has been no news of the distribution of the third installment, and the three-part flour ticket has not yet been issued. Originally, the household rice was not enough to maintain the minimum needs of an individual. Now, the city district's distribution is much less in quantity than that of the two concessions, and there is no flour to supplement it. Moreover, it is often delayed and canceled altogether. Therefore, all the innocent people in our million-strong city district are craning their necks and longing, hoping that our city district authorities will quickly improve the situation to help our million starving people. I believe that our wise city district authorities will be able to understand the feelings of the people and make some gestures. At the very least, they should be able to effectively implement the following points in the shortest possible time:

(1) Determine the date of grain distribution. (2) Supplement each installment with flour. (3) Ensure that the quality, price, and quantity of rice are the same in all districts. (4) Order all rice shops not to deliberately create difficulties.

The Second Voice, He Lan

Your newspaper's loud call for attention to the food problem has obviously achieved considerable results. Isn't the ration of household rice and household flour increasing installment by installment? Although the current ration is still not enough to meet all the needs, the severity of the food problem has gradually decreased with the increase in the ration. But this is referring to the two concessions. As for our Shanghai Fourth District, the food problem is still very serious. At the same time, the grain administration authorities seem to think that everyone can still buy 1.5 sheng of white rice, 6 ge of brown rice, 7 ge of broken rice, and 1.5 jin of flour. Today, the rice purchase certificate was finally issued, but each person is only allowed to buy 7 ge of white rice, 1.1 sheng of brown rice, and 2 ge of broken rice. In total, each person will buy 2.2 sheng of white rice, 1.7 sheng of brown rice, 9 ge of broken rice, and 1.5 jin of flour this month. I ask, how many days will this amount of food last one person? This problem is serious enough in normal times, let alone now that the authorities have issued a ban prohibiting the free entry of food, which naturally makes the problem even more acute. Although the Shanghai West District is not without wealthy families, the hidden poor and the destitute still account for the majority, no, they account for the vast majority. I have an income of one thousand and several hundred yuan per month, and the organization I serve allows me to buy 1.35 dou of specially rationed rice per month, but in recent months, there has not been a single month where I have not spent more than I earned, resulting in borrowing and pawning. I examined my accounts and found that most of the money was spent on supplementing food. Now, the black market rice is more expensive and not easy to buy. If the grain ration cannot be increased, then I simply cannot live. I think there must be many residents in the Shanghai West District who are in the same situation as me, or even worse. The threat they face from the food problem can naturally be imagined. On behalf of the 1.5 million residents of the Shanghai West District, I earnestly hope that the grain administration authorities in the Shanghai West District can understand the difficulty of the people's food and quickly achieve the following two points:

(1) Issue another 1.2 sheng of rice and 4.2 jin of flour per person this month. This, together with what has been issued before, is exactly equal to the quantity distributed by the two concessions in one month.

(2) From February onwards, the method and frequency of monthly distribution, and the quantity of each distribution, should be exactly the same as in the two concessions.

I believe that what the authorities of the two concessions can do, the grain administration authorities of the Shanghai West District can certainly do as well. I also believe that the grain administration party authorities in the Shanghai West District must be no less concerned about maintaining the people's food supply than the authorities in the two concessions. I hereby express my sincere hope!

The Third Voice

Since the strict control of the grain administration was implemented on January 13, street vendors and rice merchants have almost disappeared from the market, and rice and noodle shops are all out of stock. The citizens are eager for household rice, but it cannot be distributed according to the same schedule as in the concessions. There are rumors of increasing the ration, but the most recent installment in the city district has actually been reduced. The first installment of household rice in January was not issued until the 21st, with 2 sheng per person, and the second installment was issued on the 29th, with 1.8 sheng per person, without any flour. There is still no news of the third installment. According to the ration in the concessions, it is only enough for five days, while in the city district, each person has only received 3.8 sheng in the two installments this month, making it impossible for people to eat their fill. The authorities implemented strict control originally to suppress the black market and benefit the people, but like an elastic, the black market is becoming more entrenched and the resilience is higher.

### Temporary Extension for Purchasing Gunny Sacks; Overdue Violators Will Be Penalized and Confiscated: Announcement by the Office of the Japanese Embassy

The office of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, in view of the peak season for agricultural products and to ensure the supply of gunny sacks for packaging agricultural products, had previously consulted with the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau to purchase gunny sacks stored in the city. However, the purchase period was very short, and the purpose of the authorities' purchase had not been fully understood by the general public. Therefore, the purchase period has been extended to February 13. It is hoped that the citizens will cooperate. Those who miss the deadline again and fail to sell to the authorities will be confiscated, and the owners will be severely punished. The office of the Japanese Embassy has recently issued the following statement regarding this matter: "Our embassy office previously consulted with the municipal government, the Public Works Department, and the Public Works Bureau to implement the purchase of gunny sacks stored in the city, as you citizens are aware. The results of the purchase have been very smooth recently. However, because the purchase period is very short and the methods for informing the citizens have not been thorough, there are likely many who have not fully understood the details of this plan. Therefore, the municipal authorities have decided to extend the deadline to February 13. During this extended period, the purchase method will be the same as before. We will not take coercive measures. It is hoped that the citizens will cooperate voluntarily. If the expected goal is not achieved during this period, then the three municipal authorities will take coercive measures such as confiscation for any gunny sacks found thereafter, regardless of the circumstances. We sincerely hope that the citizens understand that this purchase plan will achieve significant results in the restoration of Shanghai and the reconstruction of Central China. We hope that everyone will take the lead in cooperating with the authorities to avoid coercive measures that are not originally intended by the authorities and are also extremely dishonorable for all citizens."

### Women's Welfare Association Seeks Members

Since its establishment on the 29th of last month, the Shanghai Women's Welfare Association has spared no effort in promoting its affairs. In order to expand its organization, it has started publishing advertisements on the 1st to openly solicit members. Intellectual women from all walks of life are welcome to participate enthusiastically. It is said that the procedures are very simple. The association's address is No. 984, Lane 972, at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Muir Ming Road. Registration hours are from 2:00 pm to 5:00 pm, Monday to Friday. Latecomers will not be entertained.

### Central Reserve Bank to Move to New Location

Before the August 13th Incident, the Bank of China started constructing a new building on the Bund. However, due to the outbreak of the incident, the construction was interrupted. Later, the Central Reserve Bank hired workers to continue the construction of the new building, which has now been completed. Therefore, the Central Reserve Bank will soon move into the new building to conduct its business.

### Retail Sales Tax May Not Be Exempted; Invoices Must Be Issued for All Purchases, Regardless of Amount

The Public Works Department of the Public Concession and the Public Works Bureau of the French Concession stipulated that all companies and merchants must collect a 2% retail sales tax when selling goods at retail. Since its implementation, the results have been remarkable. It is now learned that some shops sometimes exempt this retail sales tax, which is a violation of the law. Therefore, special personnel will be dispatched to investigate at any time. Any merchant who sells goods, if they are indeed retail sales, must collect the retail sales tax in accordance with the law and may not freely exempt it. Otherwise, if discovered, they will be severely punished according to the law. At the same time, all retailers must issue invoices for the sale of goods, regardless of the amount, so that the authorities can review whether the amount of goods sold is consistent with the retail sales tax collected.

### Final Settlement Period for the Banking Industry; Ticket Collection Hours Remain the Same; Chinese New Year is Approaching, Work is Tense

All banks and money shops in the city's banking industry are particularly busy with the final settlement procedures for the end of the lunar year, as the deadline is approaching. Although it is impossible to find the exact amount of all ticket exchanges, customer account receipts, and interbank lending figures, they have increased more than twice as much as in the previous week. The work of each bank, shop, the Banking Association, the clearing house, the Money Industry Reserve, the Money Industry Market, and other aspects has been very tense, and the office hours seem to have been extended. In the concentrated areas of banks and shops, the personnel for collecting accounts and remitting funds are coming and going frequently. The reporter learned from the financial sector yesterday that the ticket collection time for the final settlement of the money industry will not be changed, as the association decided at the executive committee meeting last time to wait for consultation with the Banking Association before issuing a notice for compliance. Now, the money industry has sent personnel to consult with the Banking Association, and the ticket collection time for the two industries has been decided to remain unchanged, with the time ending at 4:00 pm. The external business and office hours and the return time for tickets have also been decided to remain unchanged. It is reported that the interbank foreign exchange rate of the money industry was reduced to 1.4 jiao yesterday.

### Councilor Okazaki Comes to Shanghai to Promote Economic Measures; Conveys the Intentions of the Greater East Asia Ministry to Various Agencies; Will Consult with Economic Giants of China and Japan on Various Issues

Okazaki Kahira, Councilor of the Greater East Asia Ministry, came to Shanghai via North China to promote the economic measures of the National Government participating in the war, to convey the intentions of the Greater East Asia Ministry to various agencies stationed in China, and to consult with relevant parties on important matters. He arrived in Shanghai on the 1st and stayed at the Whiteaway Laidlaw Building. Okazaki met with Okuda, the Minister of Economic Affairs at the Shanghai Office of the Embassy that day and had some discussions. He will also consult with economic giants of China and Japan on various economic issues.

Brief Commentary

### Concessions Increase Household Rice

Increasing the quantity of household rice has been a unanimous demand of the people of the city. In the past, this newspaper's suggestions and the public's appeals have been repeated again and again. The authorities have also expressed deep concern about this issue. First, on January 13, they issued an order prohibiting the free transfer of food, in order to uniformly purchase food from the interior and transport it to Shanghai for distribution. Now, they have decided to increase the quantity of household rice, from 4.8 kilograms per person per month to 6 kilograms (i.e., from 6 sheng to 7.5 sheng), an increase of a quarter. The increased quantity may not yet meet the needs, but it is enough to prove that the authorities can value public opinion and adopt the people's will. Here, on the one hand, we firmly believe that the authorities will continue to find ways to increase it to the most basic quantity per person as soon as possible; on the other hand, we thank the authorities for their concern for the people's suffering. At the same time, now that the concessions have decided to increase, we also hope that the food authorities in the city district will quickly plan to improve the situation, as this newspaper has repeatedly received reports from readers in the city district (see this newspaper's Reader's Forum today) that the ration quantity is less than that of the concessions, and the distribution dates are not accurate.

### Central Reserve Bank Moves to New Location

The Central Reserve Bank will soon move into the former Bank of China's new location to conduct business. Before August 13, the Bank of China was building a large building on Nanking Road and the Bund, but the construction was interrupted due to the incident. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the building was regarded as enemy property and managed by the Japanese army. Now it has been returned to the National Government and designated for use by the Central Reserve Bank. This move by the Japanese authorities aims to assist the development of the Central Reserve Bank. How the bank will operate well in the future to consolidate finance, strengthen the wartime economy, and fulfill the mission of the national bank is something we eagerly look forward to.

### More Than One Hundred Groups Registered with the Public Works Department Have Been Approved and Given Certificates

Since the Public Association Department of the Public Works Department Police Headquarters was established and ordered all industrial and commercial groups and trade associations within the concession to apply for registration, the deadline has expired. It is reported that a total of 422 groups have registered, and 124 units have been issued certificates for establishment. The rest are still under strict review.

### The Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance Intensifies the Collection of Profit Tax; Orders Subordinates to Compile a Merchant Register

Since the income tax of the Ministry of Finance has been levied, the tax collection has been on the right track. However, there are still many who do not declare and pay taxes. In order to increase tax revenue and prevent tax evasion, the Ministry of Finance has decided to intensify the collection of profit income tax for the first category of Class A and B profit-making enterprises. It has been ordered to compile a merchant register for verification. A notice has been sent to the tax collection bureaus in each district to send personnel to investigate the addresses, capital amounts, and profit status of each company, shop, and factory in the district and to start compiling a merchant register. Unified bookkeeping is also being implemented to facilitate verification and report taxes on profit income as accurately as possible. The compilation of the merchant register must be completed before the end of March of this year and reported for approval.

### The First Batch of Standard Water Ladles Is Temporarily Limited to Use in the City District; The Two Concessions Will Set a Separate Date for Issuance

The Shanghai Boiled Water Shop Association was previously notified by the Metrology and Testing Office of the Social Bureau that all water ladles used by the boiled water shops must be in accordance with the 1000cc standard capacity to standardize them and must be replaced within a limited time. After receiving the order, the association immediately produced a batch of standard water ladles and began issuing them in late last month. It is learned that the issuance of the first batch of water ladles is temporarily limited to the city district members, while the members in the two concessions are waiting for a separate date.

### Public Works Department, Industrial and Social Affairs Department Report for January

Last month, several rubber factories that had stopped work previously resumed work, and many small chemical factories were established, manufacturing chemicals to replace imported goods. The bleaching powder factory business was not as good as before. The coffee essence factory was affected by the decline in the price of its products. Recently, the atmosphere has been dry, and the tap water contains salt, which has made the manufacturing of the products quite difficult.

Seventy-six students in the 11th Boiler Stoker Training Class received their completion certificates. The 12th Fire Training Class is located in the East District and currently has seventy-four students. The two night schools for young technicians in the East and West Districts held major exams, and the students performed well, averaging above 80 points.

Job Placement

Since its establishment, the Job Placement Section has registered 624 technicians and has introduced 127 to various factories. Among them, 27 have been hired, 31 are not suitable, and 42 are under consideration.

Dispute Resolution

The Industrial and Social Affairs Department mediated three industrial disputes, affecting 74 workers. The department convened many factory owners to discuss issues relating to wages, allowances, and the dismissal of workers.

Lost Children

### After the Implementation of the Rationing System, the Problems of Oil and Sugar Still Remain Unresolved. A New System May Be Implemented After the Lunar New Year.

The problems of oil and sugar, two major food items in this city, have not been completely resolved recently. However, after the Lunar New Year, the supply of these two major food items will eventually have a formal solution implemented, no matter what.

Insufficient Distribution of Oil

Sensing the urgency of residents' needs during the Lunar New Year period, the wholesale office of the food oil industry held sales of oil at retail stores for the first two days of this month. However, because the ration was not large, most residents were still unable to enjoy this right. As for the automatic distribution of oil by population in some Baojia districts, it was entirely temporary in nature, and due to the cessation of rationing by the wholesale office, it eventually came to an invisible halt. Therefore, the oil industry authorities are now planning to implement a universal system of oil distribution by population, so that every resident can enjoy this major food item, so that it is not monopolized by a few people, and so that residents do not feel deeply troubled. Half a Catty of Sugar Per Person: After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military allocation authorities to implement sugar rationing by population, all sugar distribution rules have now been decided. It was originally scheduled to start the fourth phase on February 1st, first piloting in the Nanshi area, based on the Baojia household registration book. The cooperative business office and the Baojia authorities have agreed on assistance measures. However, due to the inability to complete the household registration book in time, it was decided to postpone it to February 10th, and purchases will be made with the sugar purchase certificates issued in advance. However, according to the reporter's inquiry, the amount of sugar rationed in the pilot program is said to be temporarily set at half a catty per person. The price will be announced by the cooperative business office according to the official price limit, so that the public can be informed. Afterwards, the allocation amount will be determined according to the population ratio based on the monthly amount approved by the military allocation authorities. If the pilot program is effective, it will be universally implemented throughout the city from the fifth phase on March 1st. Before implementation, the Public Concession, the French Concession, as well as Huxi, Hongkou, and Zhabei will temporarily issue sales based on house tax tickets, all in accordance with the newly established improvement measures.

### Small-Scale Noodle Shops Have Been Given Flour Rations First

The noodle product shops and stalls in the two concessions have repeatedly submitted documents to the authorities through the guild requesting the restoration of flour rationing. It is now known that the distribution of flour to cooked noodle businesses began yesterday. However, it is limited to small-scale noodle shops of the third and fourth class. The flour for the first and second class cooked noodle shops has not been rationed. The sliced ​​noodle industry (i.e. raw noodle shops) has been closed for a long time. The day before yesterday, representatives were dispatched again to petition the competent authorities, following the cooked noodle industry, to quickly restore flour rationing to maintain livelihoods and facilitate public purchases. It is now known that the authorities are reviewing it. As for the flour rationing for the flatbread and fried dough stick industry and the cake and steamed bun industry, the flour rationing office of the Materials Control Department once convened representatives of the two industries for discussions the day before yesterday, considering that they are foods for the working class, and other remedial measures will be discussed and given priority to supply products, so as to facilitate the public in the lower classes.

### The 25th Term of Rations Shortened the Purchase Period

The registered rice shops in the two concessions issued a temporary announcement yesterday, stating that the water shops have been instructed by the authorities to handle the 25th term of rations per capita starting from February 1st. All white rice will be issued at two liters and flour at one catty and twelve taels per ration ticket for 8.85 yuan. However, the sales period for this term has been shortened to seven days. The 5th and 6th of each day (the first and second days of the Lunar New Year) will be closed as usual. It is hoped that citizens holding tickets will come to purchase them as soon as possible. Once the deadline is exceeded, it will be regarded as self-abandonment, and the rice flour ticket will not be used. We hope that all sectors pay close attention. This is a special announcement.

### After the Merger Publication, a New Lineup of Small Newspapers

The small newspapers in this city, under the responsible management of Director Feng of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, were ordered to be adjusted and merged for publication in order to seek rational development. It is now known that the small newspapers have complied with the order and implemented the merger publication starting yesterday (1st). The new lineup of the merged small newspapers is revealed as follows: (1) The Seaport merges with the Telegraph, (2) The Power Daily merges with the Guangming Daily, (3) The Oriental Daily merges with the Shanghai Daily, (4) The Society Daily merges with the Xiong Daily, (5) The Shanghai Great News is changed to the Baojia Youth Organ Newspaper, (6) The Shanghai Daily is independent, (7) The Great News is independent, (8) The Robin Hood Shanghai Yue Opera Newspaper, the Drama Daily, and the Shen Opera Art Sea Daily are merged into the United Opera Newspaper, (9) The Lucky Daily, the Ten Thousand Words Newspaper, and the Peach Blossom News are merged into the Lucky Daily.

### French Concession Bans the Sale of Fireworks

The French authorities have issued an order that, in order to maintain public security and order, the sale and setting off of firecrackers are absolutely prohibited within the French Concession.

### Resolutions of the Shanghai West Security and Mutual Assistance Guidance Council: Unified Collection of Security and Mutual Assistance Expenses Commencing January 1st, Divided into Four Classes

The Shanghai West Security and Mutual Assistance Guidance Council, recognizing that the collection of security and mutual assistance expenses in the Shanghai West District in the past was handled separately by each joint security office, inevitably leading to irregularities, has, through its fifth meeting, passed a resolution to unify the collection method, entrusting the Shanghai West Office of the Finance Bureau to handle the collection. Hereafter, residents of Shanghai West, in addition to paying the aforementioned security and mutual assistance expenses, will not be required to pay other security and mutual assistance fees. It is reported that the collection of January's security and mutual assistance expenses commenced on the 1st. The monthly security and mutual assistance expenses for residents are divided into four classes: Special Class, three yuan; Class A, two yuan; Class B, one yuan; Class C, exempt.

### Provisional Relief Center in Putuo District Continues Distribution of Relief Rice

The Provisional Relief Center in Putuo District was established this spring. Appreciating the urgency of the matter, enthusiastic individuals from all walks of life have actively sponsored and donated funds and rice to assist in providing porridge and emergency relief in this district. For half a month, over 30,000 people benefited. At the end of the emergency relief, there was a surplus of over 14,000 national currency units. A survey was then conducted of 284 impoverished households in the district, totaling 997 individuals, and 10,264 national currency units were distributed. The remaining 4,000 yuan was divided and sent to (1) Renji Infant Nursery, (2) Labor Hospital, (3) Pushan Villa, and (4) Jingye Nursing Home, 1,000 yuan each. Furthermore, Accountant Li Wenjie of Lixin Accounting Firm was requested to voluntarily and personally audit all accounts. There was a remaining surplus of 13 bags of broken rice, totaling 2,600 catties. The Board of Directors resolved to use it for winter relief. The other day, relief rice was distributed at the Jade Buddha Temple. A total of 1,190 impoverished residents in the district received one sheng of broken rice each, and an additional two yuan in savings currency was distributed to each person, totaling 2,380 yuan (this amount was raised by the directors through donations). Another 220-plus people who arrived later were also given one sheng of broken rice each. The work of the center is now complete, and it is announced that it will be concluded.

### Shanghai Municipal Council's Chinese Children's Elementary School Changes Payment Date

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announces that the dates for paying tuition fees at the various Chinese children's elementary schools established by the Council were originally scheduled for February 8th and 9th. It has now been determined that the 8th is a regular holiday for the Council, and the office will be closed. Therefore, the payment dates for each elementary school have been changed to February 9th and 10th. Parents of students are requested to take note.

### Enhancing Familial Happiness for Citizens: "Children's Happiness Week" Begins, Led by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department, Ensuring Parents Gain Child-Rearing Knowledge

In order to allow residents of this port to obtain the joy of family, to stabilize social order, and to maintain the normal development of the future masters of the world, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department is holding a "Children's Happiness Week" starting today, scheduled to conclude next Tuesday.

Increase in Cases of Lost Children

According to reporters, the reason for the Shanghai Municipal Council's launch of the Children's Happiness Movement is due to a particular increase in the number of children lost or running away from home. It has been found that a total of 912 such cases occurred last year, of which 635 cases were resolved satisfactorily through the efforts of the police. However, the whereabouts of the remaining children are still unknown. Therefore, the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department has launched a large-scale publicity campaign to seek the attention of parents and other guardians in this port.

Expanding Publicity and Child-Rearing Knowledge

During "Children's Happiness Week," the slogans and books for publicity are donated by the China Biochemical Pharmaceutical Factory at 32 Jiangxi Road. The methods of publicity include posting slogans on the walls of various roads, sending staff to give street lectures, broadcasting propaganda stories on the radio, and showing educational films in cinemas. The content of these slogans, lectures, stories, and films generally aims to provide parents with sufficient knowledge of child-rearing, not to excessively indulge children, and not to excessively apply harsh methods. According to an official of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Welfare Department who told reporters, the authorities hope that residents will not allow their young children to go out in the evenings, and hope that parents should weave their names and addresses on the clothes worn by their children with cotton yarn, so that in case of getting lost, the police can lead them back home. The authorities hope that the public will assist the Shanghai Municipal Council in handling this work. If a lost child is found crying in the street, an effort should be made to report it, in order to reduce the phenomenon of separation of families this year.

### Iron Wire and Wire Nails Rise Sharply

Yesterday, the market for iron wire nails from Japanese factories was affected by the shortage of circulating goods, and the sentiment of fellow merchants holding a small amount of inventory was extremely clever. The raw materials for the goods (wire and wire rod) have disappeared from the market, with no production at all. What is currently available is entirely from past inventories, so the market is unusually strong. Standard wire nails are rising step by step. Yesterday, the price of wire nails was already shouted to 1,300 yuan per barrel, four-point nails were selling for 1,750 yuan per barrel, five-point patterned nails were opening at 1,650 yuan per barrel, six-point goods were selling for 1,600 yuan per barrel, sesame nails, three-point patterned, were 1,900 yuan per box, four-point patterned were 1,800 yuan per box, five-point patterned were 1,700 yuan, and six-point nails were selling for 1,600 yuan.

Industrial raw materials, with depleted inventories of various goods, lack a formal market.

### Jiang Yilong Suddenly Retracts Confession in the Hua Liying Murder Case, Summons to All Witnesses, Retrial Postponed to Joint Collegiate Court

The sensational murder case of Hua Liying, a dancer at the MGM Ballroom, who was strangled to death on November 12 of last year by young men Zhang Hongsheng and Jiang Yilong for failing to borrow money, was solved and sent to the Second Special Court, which sentenced Zhang to fifteen years of imprisonment and Jiang to seven years. The law enforcement authorities and Shen Wenjie, chief prosecutor of the Second Special District Court, both filed appeals to the Third Branch Court, arguing that the initial trial was inappropriate. The two defendants also appealed, hiring lawyers. Yesterday, Cai Rixin, chief of the Criminal Division of the Third Branch of the High Court, sat in the Third Criminal Court to investigate the case. Zhang Hongsheng was defended by lawyers Wu Linkun, Wang Shuxun, and Shen E, while Jiang Yilong was defended by lawyer Wang Yigong. First, Zhang Hongsheng was interrogated. According to his statement, "The initial judgment said that I strangled the deceased with a tie because I failed to borrow money, which I cannot accept. I want you to know that I had been with the deceased, Hua Liying, for many years and spent a lot of money. Moreover, my family is wealthy, so there is no need to borrow money. I had a very good relationship with the deceased and had no intention of harming her. Therefore, I am appealing because I do not accept this." The official asked him to explain the whole story. Zhang replied, "I have known Jiang Yilong for three years. He is addicted to gambling. Although I often went with him, I never gambled.

Gambling During the Day, Dancing at Night

On the afternoon of the incident, I went to Xiyuan to gamble with Jiang. He lost three or four hundred yuan. In the evening, we went to the MGM Ballroom, where we met a classmate, Xie Shanxin, who was also acquainted with Hua Liying, and danced with Hua on the stage. At that time, Hua Liying told me that Xie often pestered her and prevented her from doing business, so she asked me to mediate and invited me to talk at her house. So, I went to Hua's house after the ballroom closed. When leaving the ballroom, Jiang Yilong asked me where I was going, and I explained the situation. Jiang wanted to go with me. When we got to Hua's house, Jiang asked me to borrow money from Hua, but I refused. He then opened his mouth to Hua himself, and she ridiculed him."

She Called for Help, I Pressed Her Mouth

"Jiang became angry out of humiliation, went forward and pushed Hua onto the bed. She called for help, so I went forward and pressed her mouth shut. She then scratched my face and neck with both hands. I got up and went to the dressing table to look at my face. In that instant, Jiang jumped onto the bed and strangled Hua with a tie. When I realized it and pulled Jiang away, Hua had already died. The official asked, 'Why did you stuff a towel into her lower body after strangling Hua?' He replied that it was actually done by Jiang and Zhang to avoid the ears and eyes of the detectives, indicating that the deceased had been forcibly raped without success. Later, Jiang also took out the jewelry and gave it to me.

Exchanged for Cash, Then Went to the Casino

The next day, after exchanging it for cash in various places, Jiang gambled and lost in the Nanshi casino. He still had 1,050 yuan left, which Jiang returned to me for Dr. Fan's medical expenses and loan shark debts." The official then asked, "Your statement says that Jiang Yilong wrote a letter stating that he did this. What is the situation?" He replied, "Because I was crying in the detention center, his conscience discovered it, so he told me not to cry. He wrote to his father to try to rescue me from prison. The letter stated that he had done this and asked his father to try to rescue us." Jiang Yilong's interrogation stated, "Although I wear a suit, the tie used to strangle Hua was not mine."

They Quarrelled, I Went Outside

"On November 12, Zhang and I went to the casino to gamble during the day. After going out, we went to the MGM Ballroom. After Zhang finished dancing with Hua, Zhang asked me to accompany him to Hua's house. I saw them talking and laughing as if 后, but suddenly they quarrelled, so I went outside." The official asked, "You admitted at the morgue that you conspired with Zhang to kill her. Why are you retracting your confession today?" Jiang replied, "Zhang asked me to admit it." The official also asked, "Did you write a letter to your father stating that you did this and asking your father to rescue Zhang Gong-sheng?" Jiang replied, "Zhang also asked me to write it. It was not my intention." Then, the court summoned the handling detective, the fathers of the two defendants, Wang Hongshi, the nanny employed by the victim, and Zhou Peide, who collected Hua Liying's body, to testify. Because it was already 7:30 PM, the court decided to postpone the case and reopen it for a joint collegiate court trial.

### Chemical "Ammonium Sulfate" Fertilizer to Be Sold Throughout Central China, Already Adopted in North China Last Year

The chemical fertilizer required for Chinese farmland is all produced by the British firm Brunner Mond & Co. Therefore, since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source has been cut off. As a result, the price of soybean cake, a domestic fertilizer, has recently soared, rising from 60-70 yuan to over 110 yuan. According to reporters, a large batch of chemical "ammonium sulfate" fertilizer will soon be shipped from Japan. Japan is a sulfur-producing country, and the military industry has been particularly developed recently, so the residue from the manufacture of gunpowder can be used to make fertilizer. North China has already adopted it last year, and this year it will be transported and sold to Central China. Therefore, the soybean cake market will gradually stabilize in the future.

### The Teacher Speaks of Himself - The Edge of Life and Death

— Jing Ling

My wife's abdomen is gradually swelling, and my eye sockets are slowly sinking. My wife understands my sorrow, and she sighs all day long. Life is so pressing, life is so difficult. The little life is lurking in her belly, and a tragic fate has already been arranged.

My monthly salary is difficult to cover the living expenses of my wife and me. We live in a pigeon cage-like attic, eat watery porridge, and wear old clothes with countless holes. I often confess to my wife that I feel sorry for her. Tearful eyes often meet. I say that I am too weak, but she also complains about her own incompetence, unable to share the burden of this small family.

Living beyond our means has become a daily routine, and the pawnshop has become a familiar acquaintance. The northwest wind blows incessantly, and the cold pricks make my teeth chatter. The thin jacket is still waving in the wind...

Seeing me coming home with books and papers, constantly trembling, my wife's eyes are filled with tears again.

The next day, while I was at school teaching, my wife pawned her only cotton robe and redeemed my cotton robe. The money was not enough, so she borrowed from the sister-in-law upstairs. When I came back, I saw her wearing a jacket and blouse, and doubts arose in my heart. My nose felt sour, and I remained silent. She had already taken the cotton robe for me to put on.

After she put it on for me, feeling a little warmer, she comforted me and wiped away my tears, touching her cold fingers, my tears welled up even more.

The oil pressing queue snaked through the streets. A ruthless whip fell on people's heads, and a burst of screams shook the queue. How difficult it is to continue life! I wanted to lower my head and not look at the reality in front of me, but a kind of inexplicable emotion gnawed at my heart.

Walking into the attic, turning on the light, preparing to grade some papers, reading the children's innocent and pure words, perfect ideals, living beautifully like in heaven, they have no filth and suffering.

Just as my thoughts flew over ten years, a heavy and slow footstep on the stairs awakened my memory. I have only walked twenty-seven years on the road of life, and the past happiness seems to have been decades ago.

What is present before my eyes is my wife's disheveled hair and two dull, lifeless eyes, putting down the empty bottle next to the bed, pressing one hand on her abdomen and falling onto the bed, murmuring:

"Ling! I'm in some pain..."

I was stunned. It's only been eight months. How can I cope? I stood there like a wooden chicken. My wife tugged at me...

Two inexperienced people stared at each other, looking at my wife's face. I counted the banknotes in my pocket, piecing together less than ten yuan. I helped my wife to lie down more comfortably and ran downstairs to the school...

Walking into the principal's office, the principal was reading the newspaper, looking at me sideways through his glasses, as if surprised, feeling that my arrival was abrupt. I opened my mouth but then shrank back. I remembered that I had already drawn two months' salary in advance. Finally, braving great courage, I opened my mouth:

"Principal, my wife is about to give birth. Please allow me to borrow two months' salary."

"Haven't you already drawn two months in advance? I think you know the school's financial situation very well. The price of salt rises with the sun, and you are already an exception, drawing two months in advance, and now..."

"When I came out, she was already in severe abdominal pain. Please help me especially, because I am really in a hurry..."

Seeing how anxious I was, he leisurely tapped the pencil on the cup a few times. I couldn't help but get angry and turned around to run out. He sneered behind me:

"Heh... Giving birth to a child is not easy..."

I heard him but didn't argue with him, and pleaded with Uncle Wang, the gatekeeper, explaining my urgent matter. He generously lent me twenty yuan, and I ran straight home as if flying.

Rushing upstairs, my wife was in even more severe pain. The sister-in-law upstairs was carrying an oil bottle and said to me directly:

"Sir, your wife injured herself pressing oil. You shouldn't have let her go. She is so pregnant. You men don't take care of women. It's the same with my man." She gestured and started giving medical advice, blaming the men. I could only say to my wife:

"I think I should ask a doctor to come and have a look first!"

My wife was in too much pain to respond. I went out without thinking, borrowed the neighbor's phone and called the obstetrics hospital.

The doctor came, and my wife screamed loudly in pain. After examining her, the doctor told me to prepare hot water. I looked at my wife and had to take the hot water bottle to make hot water. When I came back from the tiger stove, the door was closed. I heard my wife's groans, and then I heard a low and high-pitched sound. I knew that a small life had arrived in the suffering human world...

At noon, I went home and walked into the attic. My wife was breastfeeding the baby. The baby was very small, and the two small eyes were very bright, desperately sucking on the nipple. The scarcity of milk made the mother even more painful. My wife frowned and looked at the little thing. I kissed him with pity. My wife was afraid of making him cry and pushed me away. I asked my wife:

"Can milk powder be fed to him?"

"I think I should eat and drink more, and the milk will be more plentiful!" I felt a surge of love and warmth from being a mother, warming my heart.

Taking the rice jar to cook porridge, there was not enough rice for even one meal of porridge. I secretly took it to cook it, letting my wife eat more, and I only drank half a bowl of porridge soup. My wife asked me if I was full, and I said I was full.

Some friends generously helped me find ways to get money and bought rice and vegetables for my wife to eat. My wife is very clean. The sister-in-law upstairs often helped her wash some dirty clothes, but she had many children, so my wife felt bad and secretly washed them herself without telling me.

Once, twice, she caught a cold, got sick, and had a high fever again. The sister-in-law upstairs saw me and warned me:

"Sir! A fever is not good for your wife. Be careful!"

I tried desperately to borrow money to ask a doctor to examine her, but doctor's fees and medicine seemed to be the exclusive property of the rich, and we had no share. Heavens! How wide is the distance between life and death? (Proceeds will be used for scholarship aid)

### Review of "The Simpleton's Love History"

— Liu Chang

Just looking at the silly appearance of Wang Er (the protagonist of the film) wearing tortoiseshell glasses reminds one of Roscoe Arbuckle. And "The Simpleton's Love History" is indeed a slapstick comedy with a Roscoe Arbuckle flavor.

The story tells of Sugiyama Fumio, who, following his mother's words, takes his first ancestor Sugiyama Daisaku as a model, and wholeheartedly wants to relive the ancestor's experiences today. However, the past is the past. How can such things be recreated now? So he, like Don Quixote, suffered a lot of ridicule and mockery. However, the fool has his own luck, and he actually survives in desperate situations, gains advantages everywhere, and finally wins the favor of the daughter of the manager of a product company, and they set off together to Manchuria for an inspection trip.

As mentioned above, the story is quite interesting. If the contrast between the past and the present can be emphasized, and many jokes can be unearthed in the middle, and then a romance is added, writing about the crowd's mockery of Sugiyama Fumio and the manager's daughter Hiroko's sincere love for him... In this way, it could become a satirical comedy, that is certain. However, after watching "The Simpleton's Love History," I feel that the screenwriter and director have failed such a good subject.

In film art, the "speed" and "consistency" of camera cuts are the first things to pay attention to. In terms of content and awareness of American films, don't worry about it first; at least, they pay very close attention to the grasp of emotions. That is to say, they are very good at understanding the tricks of taking the long and supplementing the short, simplifying the complex, and using jump-cut shots to tightly hold the audience's heartstrings from beginning to end. In this way, it often makes old ladies who are not used to watching movies feel as if they have fallen into a fog of five miles, feeling inexplicable, but more importantly, it fully demonstrates the characteristics of modern film art.

"The Simpleton's Love History" is not very sufficient in these points. According to the overall count, there are no less than four or five battle scenes in this film, each lasting no less than seven or eight minutes, so half of the film is taken up. In old novels, when Zhang Fei met Ma Chao, they fought one round after another, and the author could follow along and describe one round after another. But in movies, this is completely unnecessary.

On the contrary, some places make people feel too hasty. Perhaps because unnecessary descriptions take up too much space, many shots can only see some figures wriggling, someone goes out, someone comes in, like a revolving lantern, letting the director control the plot. When the plot is over, the movie is over. But the strength of a slapstick comedy is definitely not in narrating the plot. It should use many concrete actions, tones, deeds... to create jokes and move the audience.

Also, since the story contrasts ancient and modern times, then, obviously, the ancient part should occupy less space, and the modern part should occupy more, and the two should be organically linked together. Although this film also pays attention to this point, I think the ancient part can still be largely deleted. On the contrary, more shots of Sugiyama Fumio and Hiroko falling in love should be added. (Hiroko has almost no scenes in the film).

There is also a small flaw, that is, the section where he dreams of catching thieves later. Dreaming easily makes people suspect that it is real. The director does not seem to have treated the dream world and reality differently.

In short, "The Simpleton's Love History" is a work worth watching. But to criticize it seriously, there are still many uneven and uneven places, and the director is asked to pay attention to them.

### Seeking a Full Meal in Winter

### The Teacher

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

(10) (1)

All the above passed through his mind in a moment of protest and anger, but he didn't say a word of it. He only straightened his tattered robe and walked away a few steps, "Ahem—ahem." He had argued enough. At the door, he turned around and said: "I—ahem—don't want to resign—you do—ahem—what you want with the matter!"

Chips turned to look back at that scene of more than twenty years ago, and couldn't help feeling a little sorry for Alston in his heart. Especially because Ralston had no idea what forces he was dealing with. Even Chips himself was like that regarding this matter. Neither of them correctly estimated the strength of the Brookfield tradition, and its determination to protect itself and its protectors. Because things happened by chance: that morning, there was a student waiting to see Ralston, and he happened to hear all the conversation between the two of them inside outside the door; he was of course very nervous when he heard these words, and told his friends. Some of them, in a surprisingly short period of time, told their parents: therefore, soon everyone knew that Ralston had insulted Chips and asked Chips to resign. The result of this development was a surge of sympathy and bias that Chips had never dreamed of in advance. He felt it was simply shocking that Ralston had completely lost people's hearts; he was respected and feared, but not liked; in this matter of Chips, his being disliked even exceeded his being respected and feared. Some people were talking about that if Ralston really drove Chips away, there would inevitably be a disturbance in the school. Many of the teachers in the school were young people, who usually thought that Chips was unbearably old-fashioned, but now they also supported him, because they hated Ralston's kind of driving slave thorns and saw in this old teacher a style of not fearing the strong. One day, Sir John Rivers, the chairman of the board of directors, visited Brookfiled without notifying Ralston and went directly to Chips' place. (29)

### A Few Words

— Yi Wen

If I could be reborn, I would practice patience and never be hindered by difficulties.

The result of patience can match genius, as the saying goes: "There are only two creatures that can surpass the pyramids (that is, do difficult work), namely, eagles and snails (referring to talented people and patient people)."

If I could be reborn, I would cultivate courage, for courage is the most kind and weakness is the most cruel in the world (the courageous have a small heart, while the cowardly bully the weak).

If I could be reborn, I would always be optimistic, life is like a mirror, if you laugh at it, it also laughs at you; if you frown at it, it also repays you in the same way.

Inner joy not only warms yourself, but this warmth will also enter the people we come into contact with. (Returns a reward) Social Service

### Reader's Letter Launches Spring Festival One Yuan Charity Movement

Editor:

The weather has suddenly turned cold in the past few days. When I sleep at night, I cover myself with two quilts and still complain about being cold! But looking back at the homeless men, women, old and young people on the streets, not only do they have no home to return to, but they also don't even have three meals a day. Then, if this continues, won't they just be heading towards the road to death? We are all human beings and should love others. We cannot watch our poor compatriots suffer from hunger and cold, and even die on the roadside. In this chaotic world, we should bring out our conscience and do some relief work. I think your newspaper, with the purpose of serving society, will definitely be happy to launch it!

Now I have proposed a method, which is that during the Spring Festival period, enthusiastic staff members from various stores will voluntarily save money and donate. As for the amount of the donation, each person only needs to donate one yuan. If the store has a population of ten people, then ten yuan will be donated. After this donation is automatically collected, it will be handed over to your newspaper for safekeeping, and then your newspaper will forward it to charitable organizations. After the charitable organizations receive it, they will hold charity events such as distributing porridge and clothes. I think that such a method is only a small expense for the donors, but it is a great gospel for the general compatriots in distress! At the same time, it is also the benefactors creating boundless blessings. The above is just my humble opinion, and I hope your newspaper will further solicit donations. I am also a store employee, and I would like to donate five yuan first as a prelude. Sincerely, the initiator, Anonymous
