### An Appeal to Transportation Authorities

The current difficulties in transportation and travel have become a shared suffering for the common people. This is indeed one of the most serious problems at present. Transportation is like the blood of the human body. If blood circulation is obstructed, the body will suffer from a multitude of ailments. Similarly, if transportation services are poor, social order will inevitably be threatened. Therefore, the various problems in transportation must be resolved quickly, appropriately, and properly. The efforts of Japanese transportation authorities to improve the situation are especially urgently needed. The whole world knows that Japan is the most developed country in transportation and the best in transportation management. Anyone who has been to Japan has a good impression. Take Tokyo as an example. It is one of the largest cities in the world with a population of over six million eight hundred thousand (estimated in 1941). The railways are intricate and dense like spider webs, and vehicles travel day and night without ceasing. However, the Japanese transportation authorities manage with ease, so upon entering Tokyo, the order is well-maintained, and there is no crowding at all. The Japanese transportation authorities not only manage well in peacetime, but also demonstrate a surprisingly high degree of scientific technology, especially in wartime. For example, in recent operations in the South Pacific, whether it is water or land transport, they can maintain smooth and safe operations in the midst of war. Moreover, in occupied areas, transportation can be quickly restored. This high degree of scientific technology is truly admirable.

Now, the transportation between Shanghai, Nanjing, and Hangzhou is managed by Japanese transportation authorities. We sincerely hope that the responsible authorities will apply their advanced scientific technology and the most reasonable management methods that have already been successful in Japan to provide some convenience to the Chinese people. At present, the most urgent expectations of the common people are nothing more than the following:

First, the essence of transportation is convenience. If overly complicated procedures are implemented in purchasing tickets, boarding trains, or taking ships, causing ordinary passengers and businesses to be delayed for one or two days each time, it will inevitably lose the primary objective of "convenience." Therefore, it is hoped that in the future, procedures will be simplified as much as possible. Or, even if there are complex procedures, they should be implemented with the most scientific and reasonable methods, and strict prevention of difficulties created by staff members, etc.

Second, in the future, in order to facilitate transportation, develop transport, and increase the circulation of goods and the convenience of personnel, all transportation agencies should strive to increase transportation vehicles on the one hand, and improve management on the other. For example, train, ship, and public long-distance bus stations should add more entrances and exits to reduce congestion and save time. This would not only be more convenient for passengers, but the transportation agencies themselves would also feel more convenient. Secondly, setting up more ticket sales agencies can also reduce temporary congestion and confusion. In addition, all levels of staff and laborers at each station must be trained, have a service ethic, and be polite to passengers. They must know that transportation is a commercial undertaking and that passengers are customers. How can they be rude to those who pay to travel by boat or train? Otherwise, the meaning of transportation agencies facilitating civilian travel will be lost.

Finally, we acknowledge that the convenience of transportation also relies on the coordinated efforts of the military police. For example, inspection methods seem to need further improvement, with the primary goal of saving time and facilitating passengers. Similarly, the technical and service ethics training of inspection personnel are necessary conditions for increasing transportation efficiency and reducing passenger difficulties.

We firmly believe that transportation agencies and military police authorities have paid considerable attention to these issues. Now, in the peaceful areas, there are no special circumstances that would cause transportation inconvenience. All phenomena that cause unnecessary suffering to the people should not be allowed to persist. Because the suffering of the general public inevitably provides an opportunity for a few lawless people to do evil. Only when transportation is truly convenient for the general public, and not just a few, will it be possible to improve transportation efficiency, strengthen the coordination of materials and manpower, increase industrial and agricultural production, and consolidate social stability.

### Intense Artillery Battles Erupt in Central Tunisia; War Situation Favors Axis Forces; Several Important Heights Occupied

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – The German military provided the following information on the Tunisian and Tripolitanian front lines on the 29th: (1) In the central Tunisian region, Axis forces made contact with strong anti-Axis forces on the 29th, engaging in intense artillery battles. The war situation is developing in favor of the Axis forces, and several important heights have been captured by the Axis forces. (2) Axis air forces, braving adverse weather conditions, bombed enemy supply depots and transport routes, and shot down seven enemy aircraft in aerial combat. In addition, an air raid on an enemy air force base destroyed three enemy aircraft on the ground in addition to severely damaging airfield facilities. (3) Enemy air forces attacked Sfax but were intercepted by the Axis air force, suffering heavy damage and fleeing in disarray. (4) The last defensive units of the Axis forces on the Tripolitanian front line engaged in artillery battles with strong enemy forces in the Siala area west of Tripoli. The enemy attacked with tanks but was repulsed by the Axis forces, resulting in a complete retreat.

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – According to information obtained by Haitong News Agency last night, the Axis forces led by Marshal Rommel in Suara did not engage with the enemy according to the original plan.

### Anti-Axis Forces in North Africa Hold Important Meeting; Rumors of Changes in British and American Military Leadership

Stockholm, Sweden, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – According to London correspondents, military circles in London are saying that the meeting convened by Generals Eisenhower, Alexander, and Marshall at the Allied Command in North Africa is of great importance. The plans for offensives against Tunisia and Europe, formulated at the Casablanca Conference, will be discussed in detail at this meeting. A well-known pro-British Swedish newspaper, "Göteborgs Handels- och Sjöfartstidning," reports from London that the Allies are considering launching a large-scale operation on the Tunisian front. Recent information received in London regarding the situation in Tunisia is contradictory, making it difficult to judge the current war situation. The attention of military circles in London is now focused on the threat posed by the American forces behind the Mareth Line. According to semi-official sources, the American forces have reached the strategically important town of Maknassy, but it has not yet been confirmed whether the town has been occupied. The Allies' objective seems to be to break through the Axis forces' rear in order to sweep the Axis positions from the south.

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The British-American military leadership operations meeting held in Algiers concluded on the 29th. According to reports from Algiers, as a result of the meeting's agreements, there will be changes in the British-American military leadership in North Africa. It is expected that the commander of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa, Eisenhower, and the commander of the British First Army, General Alexander, will be replaced. Announcements are expected next week.

### Anti-British Sentiment Among Indians Intensifies; Attack on British Military Barracks; Indian Governor Negotiates Military Leases with the United States

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) – Anti-British revolutions in the Northwest Frontier Province of India have intensified due to the 26th Indian Independence Declaration Commemoration Day. According to a broadcast from the Indian radio station on the 28th, the Pashtun tribes, with the Red Shirts as the core, led by Baftan Kiryal, launched a large-scale attack on the British military barracks and armory in Peshawar, killing many British officers, soldiers, and technicians at that time. It is reported that water, telecommunications, and telephone lines were also cut off, and the British military roads and railways leading to the border were also destroyed early on. Therefore, all communication from that side to the outside world has been completely cut off. As a result, when the British troops there were attacked, they were unable to request external support, and the situation is deeply worrying.

### Tenth Anniversary of the National Socialist Party's Rule; Hitler Delivers Address, Read by Goebbels; Recounting Achievements of the Past Decade

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – Today is the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule. Fuehrer Hitler was unable to attend the commemorative meeting due to overseeing the war effort at the Eastern Front's headquarters. He specifically had a speech drawn up by the headquarters, which was read by Propaganda Minister Goebbels. The main points are as follows: Hitler first described that on this day ten years ago, President Hindenburg authorized him to form a government, and then described the situation created by the Treaty of Versailles, which caused Germany to lose its military defensive capabilities, be deprived of all rights politically, and become economically bankrupt forever. Therefore, the result of the Treaty of Versailles caused Germany to face economic bankruptcy. Hitler then mentioned his first proclamation, in which he declared his determination to unify the country to eliminate the emotional turmoil within the country and resist the oppression imposed from abroad. Then, he recounted the achievements of the National Socialist Party's rule over the past decade, claiming that "Over the years, my work to rebuild Germany has been deeply supported by comrades and compatriots, so the problem of unemployment has been solved, Jewish criminals have been purged, agriculture has been stabilized, the economy has flourished, and the nation's finances have been ordered in a well-organized manner."

General Goering Delivers Speech

Berlin, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – On the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule, German General Goering delivered a broadcast address to German officers and soldiers, stating briefly that Germany has the confidence to defeat the Soviet Union. Fuehrer Hitler's decision to destroy Bolshevism is the most important decision in Europe historically. All countries must recognize that if Germany collapses, the Soviet Union will not be stopped by any neutral country. Bolshevism will ravage the entire Europe, so Germany is the pillar of blood to resist Bolshevism. The Soviet army's winter offensive is the "final great offensive." The Soviet Union has used all its manpower. I firmly believe that the Soviet army headquarters has used the most brutal methods to engage all reserve troops in the current offensive. The German army has repeatedly defeated the Soviet army and will continue to defeat the Soviet army in the future. For the next thousand years, the German people will surely still understand that the German army in Stalingrad has laid the foundation for the final victory. Any nation with the fighting spirit of the German army in Stalingrad will surely achieve victory. If the German army in Stalingrad had not restrained sixty, seventy, or eighty Soviet divisions, then the Soviet army's attempt to break through the German line would have been realized. At present, the Soviet army has lost the opportunity. The German army has organized its resistance and consolidated its new line of defense. The German army headquarters knows the magnitude of the Soviet army's losses. The German army in Stalingrad must resist. They will fight to the death for Germany's survival if necessary. Those who hope to compromise with Bolshevism are utterly foolish. The current question is whether the German nation will be annihilated or whether the German nation will control its future. Only Germany can destroy Bolshevism in European countries. Germany has become the guarantor of Europe's destiny. The German army will launch a new offensive in the spring, just like last year. This spring's offensive will not be weaker than last year. Germany will compensate for the losses in Stalingrad with new troops and new weapons. Germany will also have a day of retaliation for the British air raids on German women and children. After the end of the Eastern Front war and the total destruction of the Soviet resistance, the German air force will take revenge on Britain. I will firmly remember the facts and have the determination to strike. General Goering, at the end of his ninety-minute speech, on behalf of the German army, made a guarantee to make any sacrifice for Fuehrer Hitler. He said, "Fuehrer Hitler will lead us to achieve Germany's greatest victory." Goering delivered his speech in the Hall of Honor of the German Aviation Ministry today. Military leaders and National Socialist Party leaders were in attendance. He had changed the time three times and began the speech at noon, which was the moment ten years ago when General Hindenburg ordered National Socialist Party leader Hitler to form a cabinet.

Mr. Hori Reviews Germany's Great Achievements; Tokyo, 30th (Domei News Agency) – Today marks the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany.

### The Tank Division Launches a Counterattack; One Soviet Division Routed; The German Army on the Middle Don River Achieves Remarkable Feats; The Situation in Stalingrad Unchanged

Fuehrer Hitler's Headquarters, 30th (Haitong News Agency) – This afternoon's German military report stated that fierce battles continue at several points on the southern route of the Eastern Front. The intensity of the Soviet offensive in other areas seems to have decreased slightly. The situation in Stalingrad remains unchanged. The defenders continue to resist. Our forces are moving freely between the Caucasus and the Don River, unaffected by enemy interference. Our positions on the middle reaches of the Donets River were subjected to fierce enemy attacks several times. The enemy made no progress and suffered heavy losses. Our counterattack routed one Soviet infantry division. South of Lake Ladoga, the enemy launched another large-scale offensive under the cover of tanks and artillery. After a fierce battle, 42 enemy tanks were destroyed, and the enemy retreated without success. On the middle reaches of the Don River, the German 24th Army and the Italian Alpine Army achieved remarkable feats. Volunteer soldiers composed of Soviet people also participated in our operations.

Berlin, 20th (Haitong News Agency) – The fiercest fighting on the Eastern Front is currently west and southwest of Voronezh. The Soviet High Command has apparently concentrated a large army there. Whether the Soviet army will launch an offensive from Voronezh itself or shift the center of the war hundreds of kilometers south is still a question. Therefore, although the war zone between the Donets and Don Rivers is currently still calm, the Soviet army has the potential to launch a fierce attack there. The details of the fighting on the Eastern Front are described as follows: The greatest pressure from the Soviet army is currently being applied northwest of Voronezh, which is located at the dividing line between the southern and central routes of the Eastern Front. Although the Soviet army has made slight progress here, the sacrifices are huge, and the gains are not worth the losses. Many of the villages that the Soviet side has claimed to have occupied are currently still under German control. In addition, the number of reserve troops concentrated by the German army headquarters is very large. Only a portion of them is currently being used. As soon as the time is right, a large-scale counterattack will be launched. The fighting on the lower reaches of the Don River, between the Don and Manych Rivers, and south of the Manych has temporarily stopped. The situation in the Kuban region has also not changed. The position of the German army in western Caucasus has not been shaken. In addition to repelling the Soviet army's offensive, the German army inflicted heavy losses on the enemy. In this battle, a total of 1,000 Soviet soldiers were captured. The fighting south of Lake Ladoga is not as fierce as before. The Soviet army's offensive in this area has not been successful.

### U.S. Lend-Lease Director Announces Failure to Fully Aid Chongqing

Lisbon, 30th (Domei News Agency) – U.S. Lend-Lease Director Stettinius reported to the House Foreign Affairs Committee yesterday that although China is a major battlefield in this world war, we have unfortunately failed to fully supply it. Because transportation was extremely difficult before and after the fall of Burma, all military supplies now have to fly over the world's highest mountains in extremely difficult conditions. In terms of Chongqing's needs, the quantity is really like a drop in the bucket, insignificant, he said.

### Headquarters of the Independence League Broadcasts to All the People of India; Calling on Indians to Accept Japan's Aid for Indian Independence; Burma to Hold a Mass Rally to Thank Japan

Bangkok, 30th (Central News Agency) – The headquarters of the Indian Independence League in Bangkok was deeply excited after receiving the news that Japanese Prime Minister Tojo had reaffirmed Japan's determination to support India's struggle for independence. It dispatched personnel on the night of the 29th to deliver a broadcast address, calling on all the people of India to rise up together and strongly stating that all Indians should henceforth accept Japan's assistance without hesitation. The main points are recorded as follows: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo yesterday reaffirmed that Japan is deeply sympathetic to India's struggle for independence and has decided to support it, which is truly worthy of our gratitude. Oh, my Indian compatriots! Our struggle has been in an isolated and helpless state since 1857, and now we have obtained Japan's assistance. This statement from Japan is tantamount to sending a million reinforcements. Before declaring Japan's attitude towards India, Prime Minister Tojo also agreed to recognize Burma's independence. Burma, which has been under British oppression together with us, has now obtained Japan's thorough support and is about to gain the glory of complete independence, which is truly enviable. However, compatriots, you should know that although Japan has decided to give us the same glory as Burma, whether it can be realized depends on how you act and how comprehensively you accept Japan's national strength.

Manila, 30th (Central News Agency) – Several branch chiefs and representatives of the Indian Independence League in the Philippines visited the military administration of the Philippines Island at 11:00 AM on the 30th, expressing gratitude for the goodwill expressed by Prime Minister Tojo in his parliamentary speech and stating their determination to complete Indian independence.

Rangoon, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese Indians and Chinese in this area were all grateful for Prime Minister Tojo's statements regarding Burma and India.

Chief Minister Ba Maw explained the meaning of Prime Minister Tojo's statement allowing Burma to become independent. Then, Burmese folk representative U Tun Tin proposed that all Burmese people should express their deep gratitude to the Japanese government for allowing Burma to become independent. The whole room unanimously passed the proposal. It was also decided on the spot to hold a mass rally to thank Japan.

### Current Situation of the US-China Air Force in Chongqing

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to recent intelligence obtained from the area, the US-China Air Force in Chongqing suffered greatly due to the intense operations of the Japanese Air Force from December 8th of last year until the beginning of this year. The current situation of the US-China Air Force is as follows: (1) The US-China Air Force's attempts to conduct air raids on Japan have been thwarted due to the brave attacks of the Japanese Army Air Force. Most of the frontline aircraft have been destroyed, forcing them to retreat inland and work hard to replenish their combat power. (2) The US-China Air Force has a total strength of about 150 fighter and bomber aircraft. One-half is mobilized on the front line. According to prisoners, Commander General Chennault is an excellent general, but the quality of the lower-ranking officers is generally very low. (3) The Chongqing Air Force, dispersed in the interior, is now working hard to study tactics under the guidance of US Air Force officers. US aid to Chongqing has gradually increased since July and August of last year, reaching about 140 aircraft by the end of January of this year. However, many of the fighter aircraft imported from the Soviet Union since the previous year are unusable and are only used for training in the rear. When the Chongqing Air Force blindly bombed Jingmen last year, the Japanese side shot down two aircraft with ground fire and captured Shen Dexian, the head of Chinese aviation affairs in Chongqing. According to Shen, Chongqing students sent to the United States are assigned to the Air Force after returning, but there are not many aircraft, so there are few opportunities to participate in actual combat. From this point of view, one can determine the combat power of the Chongqing Air Force.

### Riots in the Capital of South Africa

However, sales are limited to being sold out within one or two days. Oil sales will be suspended from the 3rd to the 8th. As for the implementation of the method of distributing oil based on household population, the edible oil wholesale office held a meeting yesterday to discuss it, but no proper method has been decided yet. This is because the office has consistently failed to fully communicate with various Lianbao districts, and there are conflicting opinions. According to a Central News Agency reporter who inquired with relevant parties, after the general conclusion, the Lianbao districts under the jurisdiction of each police station will still be the pilot areas for selling oil using the population-based distribution strategy.

### After the Results of the Elementary School Group Screening are Announced - Assistance Funds Will Be Disbursed on the Same Day - Lists of 5th and 6th Graders Will Be Announced in the Next Few Days - Students Should Pay Attention to the Time for Collecting Funds

The list of students receiving assistance from the 4th Shen Bao Student Aid Fund for the elementary school group will be announced tomorrow. University students will come to the office for interviews starting tomorrow. Over 5,000 yuan in donations have been received from all sectors yesterday. The amount still falls short of the total student aid funds to be disbursed. The end of the lunar year is fast approaching, and the time for students to enroll is imminent. At this time when student aid funds are still in great need of donations, it is hoped that all sectors will continue to contribute to complete the student aid work of this session.

Elementary School Group Has Completed Review of General Scores and Reflections

The elementary school group has reviewed more than 800 test papers from students applying for student aid. Teachers from various schools were hired to grade them. The Student Aid Office sent personnel to investigate the family conditions of each student. The final review has been completed. It has been decided to announce the lists of students in the 5th grade on February 1st and the 6th grade on February 2nd, as well as the number of students approved for assistance. Students can bring their registration certificates to the office to collect the funds from 9:30 AM to 11:30 AM and from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM on the 1st and 2nd of February after the announcement. The following are some reflections on the scores of the students in this screening: (1) General scores have improved compared to the previous session. (2) The scores of students from schools with higher tuition fees have not been in direct proportion. (3) Only 60% of the Chinese language scores are satisfactory. (4) Students in the 5th grade who were selected as top candidates have extremely difficult family circumstances, and the tuition fees at their schools are also relatively low. However, their academic performance is remarkable. (5) The physical fitness of some students is not healthy, and malnutrition is the main cause. In addition, other points that are worth recording or should be corrected will be solemnly pointed out by the teachers in charge of the examination after the student aid work of this session is completed and will be published in this newspaper successively.

University Group is Reviewing Transcripts - Should Be Submitted Quickly

The university group has approximately 400 students and is currently reviewing their transcripts. The investigation of the family circumstances of each student has also begun. Those with relatively wealthy family circumstances will be eliminated to ensure the proper use of student aid funds. It has been decided to send letters to a portion of university students to come to the office for interviews on January 2nd. Only those who receive a notice will be interviewed. The rest are being investigated separately. University students who have not yet submitted their transcripts should send them as soon as possible without delay.

### Poor and Sick Relief Association Reviews Grant Applications from Charitable Organizations

In accordance with its charter, the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association uses all of the donations it raises to subsidize charitable organizations in the city. However, the review of applicants for subsidies is extremely strict. The members of the review committee are all well-known lawyers, accountants, doctors, and education experts in Shanghai who serve purely on a voluntary basis. Each time a grant application is reviewed, one or more committee members are designated to conduct a detailed on-site investigation to thoroughly understand the organization's operations and financial situation before submitting a final report to the plenary meeting for discussion. Only those organizations with truly effective operations and insufficient funds can be approved for subsidies. At 5:00 PM yesterday afternoon, the 7th Review Committee meeting was held at the Hang Seng Bank Club on Hong Kong Road, with over 20 committee members in attendance. The applicants for grants included: the Shanghai Relief and Education Institute for Refugee Children, Renji Shantang, the Shanghai Charitable Organizations Joint Disaster Relief Association, the Chinese Christian Young Women's Association Nursery, the Shanghai Christian Refugee Children's Education Institute, the China Women and Children Relief Federation, the Bethel Orphanage, and the Shanghai Disabled Persons' Home. All of the committee members attended on time with a passion for disaster relief. The cases that were approved will have the funds disbursed after the resolutions are passed.

### Shanghai Municipal Council All Official Documents

The Shanghai Municipal Council, in view of the current situation, has decided that all announcements, notices, license regulations, and receipts will soon be changed to use Japanese as the primary language. However, Chinese or English may be used when necessary. Starting from February, the Council's gazette will be printed in Japanese. The Japanese version of the annual report will continue to be published. Furthermore, meetings of the Council and its committees will be conducted primarily in Japanese, and meeting minutes will also be recorded in Japanese. However, for the convenience of other foreign nationals, the original Japanese text will be translated into English.

7,000 Chinese and Foreign Employees to be Taught Japanese Next Month

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Information Office announced that, in view of the recent enthusiasm of employees for learning Japanese, preparations have been completed and Japanese will be taught to approximately 7,000 Chinese and foreign employees starting from February 1st. At that time, Japanese language courses will be taught separately according to the nature of the employees' work, so that each employee can acquire basic knowledge of formal Japanese or ordinary Japanese conversation. Starting from the above date, classes will be held for one hour each day. The elementary class is expected to be completed within one year. In the future, employees who pass specific examinations will be considered for cash bonuses as an incentive. It is reported that senior Chinese and foreign employees of the Council and all Chinese officers of the Police Department have already been studying Japanese in their spare time.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Urges Surrender of Equipment of Shanghai Volunteers

Those who are far away or inconvenient to deliver in person should call 16008 or 10185 to notify the former Shanghai Volunteer Corps Records Office so that arrangements can be made to send someone to collect them.

### Current Factory Situation Authorities Increase Food Rations for Workers and Coolies - Propose to Double the Amount to Maintain Work Efficiency

The Shanghai Chinese Factory United Office believes that the quantity of food rations for workers and coolies is insufficient for consumption, which is of great importance to the production of manufacturers and the transportation efficiency of the city. Therefore, it has made a special request to the Shanghai Municipal Council and formulated two methods, which read as follows: "Since the distribution of food based on household population, residents in the area have generally felt that the allocated food is not enough to satisfy them, but the general working class feels even more difficult. These laborers are the elements of production. The supply of all daily necessities, as well as transportation, public utilities, all rely on the labor force. If food rations are not provided or are insufficient, all production factories and transportation agencies will be in danger of stopping. This will harm local order and affect the city's security. This is extremely important. The methods proposed by our association are as follows: (1) Increase the rice rations for workers in each factory. The amount should be doubled according to the actual number of workers in each factory so that the production work of each factory will not be interrupted. (2) Increase the source of flour and distribute it to stores that manufacture flour foods, especially stores that sell large cakes and fried dough sticks, which are the only food for rickshaw pullers and coolies. It should not be lacking for a day, and the quantity should be increased and supplied continuously to maintain the lives of ordinary coolies. The above two items are urgent measures for today. It is hoped that your office will adopt and implement them. The food and production prospects of the city depend on it. Respectfully submitted to the Shanghai Municipal Council, Public Concession."

### American Pharmacy Heir Sibling Murder Case: Xu Daquan Executed by Hanging Yesterday Morning; Repenting at Death, He Pleaded to Say Farewell to His Parents

The sensational case of the murder by the heir of the Huamei Pharmacy, in which the principal offender Xu Daquan, after being sentenced to death by the Supreme Court in the third instance, finally reached a final verdict. Now, under the instruction of the Judicial Administration, the execution was carried out yesterday morning by transferring him to the Nanshi execution ground for hanging. The details are recorded below.

Facts of the Crime

Xu Daquan is currently twenty-three years old and lives at 26 Pushi Road in the French Concession, together with his elder brother Xu Songyao. Their father, Xu Xiangsun, is a prominent businessman in the city with substantial wealth. He successively opened the Huamei Pharmacy, Jihua Hospital, and Shengsheng Maternity School, earning a considerable reputation. Xu Xiangsun, being old and ill, entrusted the management of Huamei Pharmacy and family affairs to Xu Songyao. Xu Daquan initially went to Hong Kong to study, then returned to Shanghai for medical treatment. He deeply indulged in Xu Xiangsun's doting, frequenting dance halls and spending lavishly. He often asked his brother Songyao for money, leading to resentment. The cause of the incident stemmed from a dispute over Xu Songyao buying a pipe, which occurred around half past five in the afternoon of the 21st day of the tenth month of the thirtieth year. On that day, at around 5 PM, taking advantage of Songyao's unpreparedness upon returning home for rest, Daquan used a wood-splitting axe to strike Songyao's head violently, hitting him eight times, penetrating five places, causing him to fall immediately. His father heard the noise and rushed over, but Daquan had already fled back to his bedroom in panic. The next morning, Songyao was sent to Shishi Hospital for treatment, but due to the severity of the injuries, rescue efforts were ineffective. He died on the 26th of the same month at 4 PM. After the incident, the principal offender Xu Daquan was arrested and imprisoned. This is the factual account of the crime.

The Execution Ground Was Heavily Guarded

At 8:10 AM, Xu was escorted to the Nanshi Chegu Road execution ground under the close guard of judicial police. As he was being taken off the prison van, Luo Junqiang, the Minister of the Judicial Administration Department, and Man Qiwei, the director of the Special Ordinance Medical School Management Office, personally led ten armed tax police to the scene for security. The Municipal Police Bureau also dispatched police for security. A large crowd of onlookers attended the execution.

### Our Weapons

— Feng Jie

Broadcast speech on Shanghai Radio yesterday

Fellow compatriots, we have declared war on Britain and America! If we want to defeat Britain and America, we must have weapons. What are our weapons? First, our weapon is to awaken the consciousness of East Asian nations for independence and autonomy. As the Greater East Asia War has developed to the current stage, the footholds of Anglo-American imperialism in East Asia have already been recovered by our friendly nation, Japan. Therefore, Britain and America will never be able to overcome our East Asian front. Our vanguard ally, Japan, now has only one aim: to create division among the East Asian nations within the Japanese sphere of influence, to instigate, manipulate, and exploit them. We can see their intentions by observing how Britain and America are desperately clinging to Chongqing, which is already powerless. Second, our weapon is to assist Japan in completing the war. Britain and America also know that their offensive against the Japanese army can only become empty talk on paper, so they want to economically trap Japan. According to their calculations, America, with its abundant resources, can use submarines to disrupt transportation and cut off maritime trade, exhausting Japan's resources, at which point Japan will naturally surrender. However, their calculations will only be effective if the East Asian nations do not cooperate with Japan. As long as we do our best to assist Japan, Britain and America will have no way to distress them. And our assistance to Japan in completing the war becomes a powerful weapon for us to fight against Britain and America. Third, our weapon is the national spiritual mobilization to consolidate the East Asian front. Anglo-American imperialists believe that the National Government and the people who govern China today, under Japanese military power, are lifeless and dispirited. However, we cannot look at China today in this way. China's independent and autonomous declaration of war means that it is a friend of Japan, not a colony of Japan. The Chinese people, for the sake of the restoration of their motherland, must rise up to share the responsibility of defending East Asia. To defend East Asia, we must cooperate with the Japanese. Therefore, the Chinese people's national spiritual mobilization to assist Japan and consolidate the East Asian front is precisely the opposite of what Britain and America desire. This is their fatal wound, and it is also our most powerful weapon. At the same time, in strategic application, military affairs must be coordinated with politics. Only by achieving a clear military objective through political success can strategic methods be properly applied. Anglo-American imperialists have already realized that a purely military approach is insufficient in the war against Japan, and they are also employing political and economic means. Therefore, our weapons are also political and economic. We must use a tit-for-tat political and economic approach as our weapon. This is the only weapon to defeat Britain and America.

Business News

### Cultural Stocks Surge: Commercial Press Soars by Thirty Yuan

Yesterday's market situation for Chinese stocks was limited, because Saturday met the Spring Festival holiday, but a few colleagues were still doing some business in secret.

In the cultural sector, the Commercial Press was sold out, and the price rose to 570 yuan amid buying pressure, still difficult to acquire, a surge of 30 yuan.

### Government Bonds Remain Firm: Competition Not As Fierce As Previous Days

Yesterday, government bond prices were slightly firmer compared to the previous day, but due to Saturday, trading was extremely light. Only domestic bonds had some activity, while other types of bonds had very few transactions. The trend seemed to be strong, as the selling party had repeatedly pressured the market in recent days, but the market remained very firm. Currently, due to the longer New Year holiday, competition has decreased. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially traded at 7.5 yuan, rising to around 8 yuan, then falling back to 8.23 yuan. After trading stopped, there were buyers at 8.5 yuan. Type A bonds traded at 7.45 yuan, Type B at 6.45 yuan, Type D at approximately 3.67 yuan, and Type E at approximately 6 yuan.

### Cotton Cloth In Demand, Supply Scarce

The morning price of Peach Girl Muslin, a colored cloth, was quoted at over 470 yuan, later rising to 485 yuan.

### North Mountain Almonds Rise

Almonds have recently become more active due to market demand, and the market trend has gradually tightened, so the market price has risen by hundreds of yuan. Yesterday, North Mountain almonds reached 1,300 yuan, and other grades also rose accordingly.

### Bitter Almonds Sought After by Both Traders and Customers

### Soybean Cake Trading Relatively Light: Grain Market to Close for Holiday Next Week

### Last Year's Woolen Fabric Market: Rising Steadily

The woolen fabric market in the 31st year was thriving, and the profits of various stores all exceeded previous records. In January, due to the Pacific War, people were uneasy, and there was nothing worth mentioning. In early February, due to the end of the lunar year, transactions were scarce and prices were weak. In the second half of the month, the market turned red, prices were improving, street sales were smooth, road transport was free, and hoarders became active again, pushing prices above the red plate. Paisi, Huada and Thin Serge saw particularly rapid increases. In early March, Spring sales and sales from Nanjing high street were strong, there were many stockpiles, and the market atmosphere suddenly tightened. Standard daily prices rose rapidly, accelerating further during the month. At this time, the Woolen Fabric Trade Association, the Woolen Spinning Association, the Wool Dyeing and Weaving Association, and the Wool Cold Trade Association, jointly formed the Woolen Fabric Industry Production and Sales Joint Association, to carry out centralized registration, limited mobile transport orders, etc. In April, (1) due to less incoming production, inventories gradually became depleted; (2) because woolen fabrics were not yet controlled, transportation could be done with mobile permits; (3) due to the increase in the new currency, averaging up to 0.3 yuan, various reasons caused non-industry owners with assets to hoard goods, and the market rose like a horse without reins, with prices rising by 30-40 yuan compared to March. In May, the momentum continued to move forward bravely. From June 8th to 20th, all transactions were based on the new currency, and wealthy people continued to blindly buy in. In July, the authorities stabilized prices and implemented strict restrictions, and retail prices mostly automatically decreased, but wholesale market prices still declined less. At the same time, without association transport orders, truck deliveries were often hindered, and hoarders had to contact woolen fabric or Western clothing operators to formally establish a company name and join the association. In August, due to strict investigations by the authorities, actual sales declined and prices fell. In September, there were no major fluctuations, and prices were mostly stable. After mid-September, the authorities formally limited prices, mostly based on weight, which was difficult for outsiders to identify. In addition, the limited prices were slightly more lenient than market prices, people's hearts were stable, and they began to stir again. In October, sales did not improve, and the authorities reduced the limited prices by 2%, people's hearts turned weak, and market transactions decreased. All stores adopted the principle of following the market, leading to a clear price decline. In early November, due to Xuzhou, Nanjing, and Bengbu customers purchasing, the trend gradually turned around. At the same time, sales in men's and women's clothing stores on this street improved, and business was also good. From the 1st to the 28th, grass green and primary color breeches serge first increased, and wealthy people in the industry began to hoard and absorb considerable goods. Light goods made of broken serge and wool were particularly popular. Outsiders followed the lead of insiders, and hoarding was also fierce. Therefore, in December, prices rose sharply from beginning to end, mostly matching the limited prices, and in some cases even exceeding the limited prices. The market atmosphere was unprecedentedly brisk, with more buyers than sellers, and owners treated their goods as rare commodities, unaffected by transport restrictions. As the end of the year approached, the impact of tight money was observed. The outlook for the market is still trending upward.

### Soap and Candle Market Stabilizes

Yesterday's daily necessities market trend was stable. Transactions were less active due to the approaching end of the year, so the price of various goods changed very little. However, it was generally no different from the previous day. Beauty brand matches were priced at 4,200 yuan per box, Phoenix brand at 4,000 yuan, Golden Tripod brand at 3,400 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 2,250 yuan. Gu Ben soap was priced at 790 yuan per box, Baixiangmao 720 yuan, Huangxiangmao 660 yuan, and Scissor soap 750 yuan. Bailey's foreign candles were priced at 560 yuan per box, Monk's Hat brand at 480 yuan, and miscellaneous brands at 340 yuan.

### Daily Use Medicines and Sundries: Spring Sales Active; Buyers Raise Prices, Prices Increase

Yesterday's market for medicines and sundries was driven by active spring sales, attracting the attention of wealthy people. Under the pulling of hoarders, market prices continued to rise. Golden Tower Oil was priced at 52.5 yuan per dozen, Headache Powder 40 yuan, Bagua Dan 46 yuan, Partridge Vegetables 76 yuan, and Dragon and Tiger Ren Dan 40 yuan.

### Inheriting the Precious Legacy of the East

— Sun Xingrang

The precious legacy of the East is indeed too much. Here, I will only talk about a book related to the art of war—namely, Sun Tzu's Art of War, which enjoys considerable international reputation. I think in this era of fire everywhere and global turmoil, when countries are at a critical juncture of deciding life and death through war, it naturally has new significance for existence.

Textual Research of the Book

Sun Tzu's Art of War was written by Sun Wu of Qi during the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods. The Historical Records, Biography of Sun Tzu, records thirteen chapters of Sun Wu's book, while the Book of Han, Art and Literature Records, records eighty-two chapters of Sun Tzu's Art of War and nine volumes of illustrations. Therefore, Zhang Shoujie's Justice uses thirteen chapters as the upper volume, and there are also middle and lower volumes. Du Mu also said that Wu's book originally had hundreds of thousands of words, all of which were cut and refined by Cao Cao to form this medicine. However, the Historical Records precedes the Book of Han, and it is often used as the basis, while the others may not be credible. Ye Shi suspected that the person was not seen in the Zuo Zhuan, and suspected that the book was written by a hermit in the mountains and forests at the end of the Spring and Autumn period and the beginning of the Warring States period. However, the Historical Records record that Guan Lu said to Wu, "I have read all of your thirteen chapters," which proves that it was indeed written by Sun Wu without any doubt—as stated in Gongyang Shou's A Collection of Chinese Military Books.

About the Annotations on the Book

Many people have annotated Sun Tzu's Art of War, some focusing on military strategy and some on theory, each with its own strengths. The first person to annotate this book was Cao Cao. Later, Wang Ling of Wei, Zhang Zishang, Jia Yi, Wu Shen, and You Du had commentaries, but unfortunately, they have all been lost. By the Song Dynasty, Ji Tianbao had ten annotated versions, the ten being: (1) Emperor Wu of Wei (i.e., Cao Cao) (2) Meng of Liang (3) Li Quan of Tang (4) Du Mu (5) Chen Hao (6) Jia Lin (7) Mei Shengyu of Song (8) Wang Xi (9) He Yanxi (10) Zhang Yu. In addition, there are Sun Hao and Ji Xie and others, which I will not list in detail. As for those who annotate this book in modern times, Jiang Fangzhen of Haining's Sun Tzu's New Interpretation (1913) and Gongyang Shou of Changshu's Philosophical Research on Sun Tzu's Art of War are more famous. Jiang studied in Japan and Germany and was one of China's leading military experts. In his annotations, he cross-references the principles of this book with Clausewitz's The Great War and Berloher's Theory of Strategy and Moltke's History of the Franco-Prussian War, with many original insights. The latter focuses more on philosophical research and has no historical references, but it is also quite essential.

Re-evaluation of Value

No matter how advanced weapons are or how novel tactics are, the basic principles of war remain unchanged by time and space. A few examples can show the profundity and breadth of Sun Tzu's theory. For example, the Chapter on Planning says: "War is a matter of great importance to the state." Jiang's interpretation of the word "war" is the meaning of war. Now, no country is willing to easily start a war, because war is a major event for a country, related to survival and extinction, and must be carefully considered before a decision is made. Another example is the Chapter on Offensive Planning: "Therefore, to win a hundred battles is not the best of excellence; to subdue the enemy's army without fighting is the best of excellence. Therefore, the way to use troops is to keep the country intact is best, to destroy the country is next; to keep the army intact is best, to destroy the army is next." Once a war begins, the consumption of national power must be great. Therefore, in modern times, countries want to achieve a certain national purpose and hope to use strategic success instead of armed conflict. This is the meaning of this. Also, assuming that the war has already begun, or after surrounding an enemy city, the first thing to do is to send a letter of surrender, hoping to capture it without attacking. This method of preserving strength is also nothing more than the application of this principle. I think there is no shortage of examples of the application and compliance with various principles in this war of East, West, South, and North, which can be confirmed.

Conclusion

Mr. Sun Yat-sen once said that Sun Tzu's Art of War is a book of military philosophy in our country. It is necessary to read it. This book is not only an essential book for those who govern the army in our country, but foreigners are also often studying and applying it. Japan has long had a translation of this book, which is a must-read for military officers. In Germany, it is said that there is also a translation of this book (Jiang once saw it). This is definitely not a reckless statement. Historical records show that during the Warring States period in Japan, the brave general Takeda Shingen used the warning phrase "Swift as the wind, serene as the forest, plundering as fire, immovable as a mountain" as a motto and inscribed it on his banners as a guideline for implementing mobile warfare, which shows the value of this book. After this World War ends, there will be a newly annotated version of Sun Tzu's Art of War published, which is beyond doubt, just as Ouyang Xiu said: "The key to military strategy is to be unpredictable."

I still remember when Mr. Jiang Fangzhen was studying in Berlin, he met Berdromay, the director of the Operations Department of the Prussian Army Headquarters during the Franco-Prussian War. When he said goodbye, the general stroked his shoulder and said: "Be good at it, I hope your sincerity will be implemented. I have heard that Napoleon said that a hundred years later, a military strategist from the East will emerge to inherit the principles of ancient teachings and become a great enemy of Europeans. Be good at it." Alas! Now Mr. Jiang has suddenly returned to the mountains. In the future, who will be the Eastern military strategist? I really cannot make a rash guess.

### A Visit to the Fragrant Snow Garden to View Plum Blossoms

— Jing Wan

In the flower market of the past few days, daffodils, nandinas, and wintersweets have appeared together. I happened to find a few elegant potted plum blossoms in the display window of the New Asia Restaurant on Nanjing Road. The posture was old, and the flowers were not abundant. The pots were also inscribed with elegant names, such as "Plum Blossom Recluse," "Crane Release Pavilion," and "Luofu Flying Arrival," which were produced by the "Fragrant Snow Garden" hosted by Zhou Shoujuan, of course, they are different from the ordinary. However, these few pots cannot satisfy my desire, I got the instructions from the garden address sign next to the pot, and led me to the garden at 27 Kader Road.

After finding the garden address and stepping onto a few stone steps, I saw small works on bamboo shelves, exquisite and lovely. Suddenly, I glimpsed a huge ancient plum tree in the corridor, planted in a large rectangular ancient pot. The bark was mottled and ancient, like a "wrinkled, thin, transparent" rockery stone. Branches stretched out from the top, crisscrossing, like a swimming dragon, with many flowers on the branches, just about to bloom. A masterpiece by the famous painter Qian Shoutie was hung on the wall, taking a photo of the ancient plum tree. On both sides were couplets written by Chen Dingshan, with the words "Open the window on a sunny day, the flower whiskers are warm" and "Righteous people, eternal chivalrous spirit," which also fit the ancient plum tree. Originally, it was the Righteous Plum, which has attracted the appreciation of many poets and painters in the past two years. It is said to come from the tomb of the Five Righteous Men in Huqiu, Suzhou, which is a relic of the Ming Dynasty and has been around for three or four hundred years. No wonder it is so old-fashioned.

Inside the corridor is a garden, with many small potted plum blossoms on display. They are all full of scholarly and poetic meaning, red plum, green plum, cliff plum, cold friend, etc.? The colors are complete, matched with exquisite figures and pavilions, complementing each other, and also titled "Hermitage of the Lonely Mountain," "Waiting for the Crane to Come," "Boating on Plum Island," "Plum Blossom Study," "Sparse Shadow Slanting," "Branch of Yuling," etc., making it even more elegant and interesting, and it cannot be compared with those more or less same potted plum blossoms on the market.

### Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (4)

— Hua

——To My Daughter

Moreover, some, even if true, are too wasteful. Like Lao Laizi, who, even in his seventies, still wore colorful clothes and cried like a baby. It would be better to do something else earlier, which would be more fulfilling for oneself, others, and one's parents. That could also be considered filial piety. Secondly, I believe that those who created stories of filial sons seemed to be not very filial themselves. Their impressions of their own parents were not good, which led to their unfavorable impressions of parents throughout history. The parents in their stories are often cruel, harsh, and eccentric, possessing a "child abuse" (forgive my coinage) trait, which is far from the usual situation. In Semyonov's "Hunger," the father is reluctant to give food to his children, which is a special case. During great turmoil, food is too difficult to obtain, which inevitably reveals the selfish side of human nature. Turgenev's "Fathers and Sons" writes about the conflict between the old and new ideas of fathers and sons, avoiding direct confrontation. In reality, direct confrontations may be even more cruel. Parents interfering with their children's thoughts or marriages is quite common. But this is limited to situations where parents are particularly backward and children are particularly progressive, and parents do not necessarily have a cruel heart towards their children. In "Dream of the Red Chamber," Jia Zheng is very strict with Baoyu, and I have also written that my mother often beat me. This was all because of teaching and the mistaken belief that beating was teaching, which cannot be said to be abuse. On the contrary, it was because of love. As the saying goes, "Only the melon loves the vine, not the vine loves the melon." Parents mostly love their children, and their love is probably more sincere than children's love for their parents. However, the parents in the Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars are often very different. Shun's parents tried desperately to kill him, and although his mother was a stepmother, and she was partial, why did she have to kill him? Moreover, the father is always one's own. Huang Xiang's parents watched their son fend off mosquitoes without making a sound themselves. Lao Laizi's parents knew that their son was in his seventies and still made him carry water, which is already very strange. Wang Xiang and Meng Zong's mothers, as adults, insisted on asking small children for carp and bamboo shoots in winter.

### Reflections After Reading Nie Yuntai's "Method of Preserving Wealth" - 3

— Lingnan Hermit

Equality is linked to cause, freedom is established by one's own ability.

Natural talents have differences in usage, and the benefits of the land have no fixed right.

Dogs and horses are supplied for driving and use, and cattle and sheep are readily slaughtered and cooked;

Flowers in bloom are worth enjoying together, and ripe melons can be used to season soup.

Fate stops at any time, what level of life is ascended.

The form and spirit come from above and below, education and nurturing are based on the levels of conduct.

Elders should be good at setting examples, and children should work harder;

Benefiting others benefits oneself, and thorough learning becomes the measure.

### The Paragon of Teachers

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

Then they began to argue, Ralston becoming colder and more sarcastic, Chips becoming more ardent and excited. Finally, Ralston said coldly, "Since you force me to tell the truth, Mr. Chipping, then listen carefully. Some time ago, you were not doing much here. Your teaching method is slow and old-fashioned; your personal habits are shabby; you ignore my instructions, which, if done by a younger person, I would take as complete insubordination. I don't want this, Mr. Chipping. You must understand my patience, and I have been patient for so long."

"But—" Chips began, looking completely bewildered; then, he picked up a few words, scattered, from that severely critical speech.

"Shabby—ahem—you said—?"

"Yes, look at your gown. I already know that your gown is a frequent topic of amusement for the whole school."

Chips knew this, but it never seemed to be a regrettable thing.

He continued, "And—you also said—ahem—something about—insubordination—?"

"No, I didn't say that. I only said that if a younger person did this, I would consider it insubordination. In your case, it's probably a mixture of slowness and stubbornness. For example, the problem of Latin pronunciation—I think I told you years ago that I wanted the whole school to use the new method. The other teachers obeyed me; but you would rather stick to your old method, resulting in confusion and ineffectiveness."

Finally, Chips found something he could understand and deal with. "Oh, is that so?" he replied disdainfully. "Well, I—ahem—I admit I don't approve of the new pronunciation. I never have. Ahem—it seems like nonsense to me. To have students say "Kiekero" in school—ahem—and then as soon as they leave school, they keep saying "Cicero"—they've always—ahem—said it that way, isn't that better. And instead of saying "Vicissim"—good heavens—you want them to say "Wekissim," ahem—ahem—he constantly chuckled, forgetting that he was in Ralston's study, not in his familiar classroom. (26)

Social Services

### Recent Situation of the Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society

The World Red Swastika Society was founded by local gentry and merchants through donations. It has a history of more than twenty years and is dedicated to the purpose of disaster relief and assistance to the needy. In addition to setting up soup kitchens, free clinics, and work-study programs for displaced people, it has a sanatorium on Yuyuan Road. The sanatorium was established in 1937. Recently, after Mr. Li Sihao, Li Tianzhen, and Hu Chuqing took on the roles of Chairman of the Board, they have spared no effort in promoting the Society's affairs. The sanatorium has also been thoroughly reorganized and renamed the Shanghai Hospital of the World Red Swastika Society. The medical affairs have been reorganized accordingly. In addition to Dr. Li Bangzheng continuing to serve as the responsible director of the hospital, Dr. Yuan Junchang, the former medical director of the Shanghai Puji Sanatorium, has been hired as a special consulting physician and is in charge of the hospital's Department of Mental and Neurological Diseases. At the same time, he supervises all hospital affairs. Recently, various facilities and treatment methods have been improved. The general internal medicine department is managed by Dr. Rao Youji, the medical director. Resident physicians are on duty day and night to respond to emergencies, providing free diagnosis and medication every morning. The cost of hospitalization is extremely low. The hospital is located at 1171 Yuyuan Road.

### Enthusiastic Registration for the Scholarship of the Anti-Anglo-American Association

Registration Procedures Will Continue as Usual Tomorrow and the Day After Tomorrow. Since the Anti-Anglo-American Association launched the first phase of scholarships, those who have gone to register have been extremely crowded, especially in the last two days, when the number of people has been even greater. Unfortunately, the application forms have long been exhausted, resulting in a significant number of students being unable to apply, which is deeply regrettable. It is reported that the scale of the next phase of the scholarship campaign will be larger than this phase, and every poor student will have the opportunity to receive assistance. The Association's handling of the application registration matters this time, with the cooperation of Mr. Zhang Yipeng and the responsible personnel of each group, has been handled very quickly, and the procedures are also quite meticulous. Regarding the qualification examination, it is said that it will probably be held after the Lunar New Year. It is hoped that students will pay attention to the news. The father's registration procedures were originally scheduled to end at 4:00 pm today. However, it is feared that there are still many students who have been unable to register as scheduled due to time constraints or other reasons. Therefore, it has been decided to extend the period for one or two days, and registration procedures will continue as usual tomorrow and the day after tomorrow.

### Citizens Should Pay Attention to Tuberculosis Prevention

During this extraordinary period, the number of residents in this city suffering from lung disease tends to increase daily. The service department of the Hongqiao Sanatorium has put forward several warnings to promote tuberculosis prevention and urge the public to pay attention: (1) Modern medicine, both Chinese and foreign, has not yet invented a specific drug for lung disease. (2) Except for pneumothorax therapy for lung disease, there is currently no so-called rapid therapy. (3) To seek a cure for lung disease, the first thing is a correct diagnosis. In order to implement the above measures and popularize early treatment, the hospital has issued X-ray examination and free treatment certificates to help the poor and sick and fundamentally eliminate tuberculosis. The certificate is currently sold on behalf of this library for 10 yuan per certificate. Once lung disease is detected, the most effective modern artificial pneumothorax therapy can be performed free of charge, which is truly good news for those suffering from lung disease and poverty.

Lost and Found: Staff at the sales department of the Zhongxi Great Pharmacy General Distribution Office on 4th. Ma Road picked up some cash along with a note on the afternoon of the 29th around 6PM. Hope that the owner can identify the amount and the information contained on the note within 3 days, or it will be donated to charity.
