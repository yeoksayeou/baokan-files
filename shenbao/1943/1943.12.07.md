### The Greater East Asia War and the Chongqing Regime

Two years ago, Britain, the United States, the Netherlands, and the Chongqing regime vigorously promoted the so-called ABCD united front, with Chongqing taking pride in joining it. Consequently, they estimated that Japan would not, and dared not, launch a war. Their reasoning, of course, was "how strong the united front is in terms of strength, and how weak Japan is." This was their theory. It is not worth discussing the self-praise of Britain and the United States, who have always used aggression to deal with the various ethnic groups in East Asia and always appear with a deceptive and cunning mask. However, the Chongqing regime also believed it to be true, was complacent, and completely miscalculated Japan's intentions. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the ensuing facts were completely contrary to what Britain and the United States boasted about. Britain and the United States were caught off guard, and the Chongqing regime also suffered a major blow.

The outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was caused by Japan's objective environmental pressure, which forced it to launch the war. Here, we should recognize that Japan was not betting everything on one throw at the time, and had made an accurate assessment of the enemy's strength. Therefore, after the outbreak, in no time at all, the British and American forces collapsed rapidly everywhere. As a result, the so-called ABCD united front suddenly disappeared and became just a laughing stock. Under this situation, Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands themselves could not win because their strength was insufficient, and the Chongqing side, having witnessed the bubble of the ABCD front disappear, still did not realize the error of their past estimations. They further believed that Britain and the United States, having suffered a severe blow, would definitely prioritize the Pacific as their primary focus, concentrate their efforts to counterattack, and inflict a fatal blow on Japan. Chongqing harbored this extravagant hope, especially making various propaganda appeals to the United States. However, facts speak louder than words. Japan has already established a solid foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and Britain has its own crisis in Europe to cope with. So, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing regime's extravagant hope that Britain and the United States would prioritize the Pacific again fell through, which was the second blow.

Since the last meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec, the United States seems to have launched a counterattack in the South Pacific. Of course, during this meeting, the Chongqing side would have tried its best to act coquettishly, but the decision of the United States to counterattack was more accurately attributed to its own unchecked ambition for aggression than to the encouragement of the Chongqing side.

However, the American counterattack in the South Pacific has been repeatedly defeated. The recent great victory of the Japanese Navy at Bougainville Island is comparable to the surprise attack on Pearl Harbor. Therefore, even though the enemy American counterattack is what the Chongqing side desperately seeks, the current reality is that the failure of the counterattack answers Chongqing's request, which is another blow.

The blows that the Chongqing regime has received in the two years of the Greater East Asia War are such, but the Chongqing regime is still stubborn and still wholeheartedly depends on Britain and the United States, which is the misfortune of China's future unification.

Today, we want to frankly say that at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War and now, two years later, Japan's relationship with China and even with East Asia has undergone great changes. We must recognize and accept this fact.

The Chongqing regime relies on Britain and the United States and cannot be expected to participate in the Greater East Asia War. China must be unified and built, and the Chongqing regime's division and resistance cannot be tolerated. Then, how to improve politics, stabilize people's livelihood, and strengthen the political position in the peace zone, so that the people of the whole country unanimously incline towards it, this important responsibility completely lies with the National Government in Nanjing.

### Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War - Philippine President's Remarks - Hopes that All Ethnic Groups Will Cooperate to Achieve the Goal

Manila, 6th (Central News Agency) - Philippine President Laurel issued a statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the main points of which are as follows: Asia is our motherland, and it was under the aggression of the Four European powers for a long time, but now it has finally awakened from its slumber. The aggression of the Four European countries against Asia and Africa began with the discoveries of Columbus and Magellan, and the Philippines was transferred from Spanish to American rule. However, after Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War, the Asian nations gradually awoke, and the sense of superiority of Europeans lost its mystery, giving rise to the new principle of "Asia for Asians." The Western European powers, after Japan's victory over Russia, deeply felt that their expansion of imperialism was greatly hampered by cooperation with East Asian countries, especially with Japan. However, Britain and the United States still engaged in expanding their influence in East Asia by using the deceptive means of so-called assisting the economic and cultural development of weak countries. Japan has long seen through the intentions of Britain and the United States, but has always remained silent, focusing on strengthening its domestic economic, political, and military strength. In order to secure the necessary raw materials, it further eliminated all obstacles from Britain and the United States and established trade relations with various East Asian countries. Unfortunately, Japan's efforts for many years were not rewarded, and the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred. Britain and the United States then seized this opportunity to provide military, political, and other assistance to Chongqing. The United States further intensified its efforts, banning the export of scrap iron and oil to Japan and freezing its funds, and even adopted economic blockade measures. Subsequently, it increased its pressure on Japan from all aspects. For the sake of peace among the various ethnic groups in East Asia, Japan sent ambassadors Nomura and Kurusu to the United States in 1941 in an attempt to improve the situation. However, the United States showed no sincerity, and Japan resolutely rose up and devoted itself to building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As soon as the Greater East Asia War began, Japan completely crushed the power of Britain and the United States in East Asia, astonishing the world. Since then, the East Asian nations have also become aware that they no longer need to rely on the support of the Western European countries and should rise up to build a paradise of coexistence and co-prosperity for the East Asian nations. We see the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the recovery of concessions by the Republic of China, the restoration of lost territories by Thailand, the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, and the participation of the people of Malaya and the East Indies in politics, etc., and know that the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is gradually being realized. Especially the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration passed at the Greater East Asia Conference is truly the greatest charter in human history. At the same time, it can also be said to be a declaration by one billion people in East Asia to protect their vested interests and prevent foreign invasion. Moreover, the five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, economic prosperity, cultural advancement, and contribution to the world's development in the declaration are truly the supreme ideals that constitute the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the mother of a sound ethical and just nature. Today, the Greater East Asian nations have reached a situation of great difficulty and hardship, and this hardship is quite profound, but for the sake of our own future, we will not hesitate to make a lifetime sacrifice. At the same time, with firm determination, we will work closely with Japan to continue to move towards the achievement of peace in Greater East Asia. Only when we, the great Asian nations, have achieved this final goal can we ensure the happiness of the East Asian nations and contribute to the well-being of mankind. As the Greater East Asia War reaches its second anniversary, when we look back on the gains we have made through our efforts, we are convinced that the unity of the one billion people in Greater East Asia will become closer and closer, and our belief in the future of Greater East Asia will also be strengthened.

### Based on the Traditional Spirit of the Two Countries, the Relationship Between Japan and Vietnam is Becoming Increasingly Good

Hanoi, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnamese Governor-General Decoux issued a statement entitled "Message for the Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War," which reads as follows: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Vietnam's position has changed accordingly. Vietnam is inextricably linked to the East Asia War, especially its relationship with Japan. Based on various agreements, Vietnam and Japan have united as one, so there is no need to worry about changes in relations with the belligerent countries. The economic, cultural, and other harmonious system established in Asia is fully in line with the laws of freedom and is adapted to the development of the general situation in the world. Therefore, I am convinced that this harmonious system will be able to overcome the war and achieve prosperity. To this end, the general economy of Vietnam has undergone fundamental reforms. In order to fulfill its mission in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Vietnam had long ago deemed it necessary to take new measures. The efforts of the past two years have been to accomplish this mission. As a result, Vietnam's economy has been stabilized, the treaties have been fulfilled, and security has been ensured. It is generally believed that the achievements of the Vietnamese authorities in completing their tasks and the smooth progress of Japan-Vietnam joint defense, etc., are due to the sympathy and the spirit of deep understanding shown by the Japanese authorities, and we are extremely pleased with this. I am convinced that the close relationship between Japan and Vietnam, the cooperation between the Japanese and Vietnamese authorities, and the cultural and commercial relations between Japan and Vietnam will become increasingly good in the future, based on friendship and in accordance with the traditions of both sides.

### On the Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Information Department Chief Kishi Broadcasts - Striving to Build East Asia with a Belief in Certain Victory

Nanjing, 6th (Central News Agency) - On the occasion of the upcoming second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Japanese Embassy in China Information Department Chief Kishi will broadcast at 7:00 PM on the 6th on the Central Broadcasting Station, entitled "Belief in Certain Victory," to the 600,000 Japanese expatriates in China, urging them to implement the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty in the spirit of equality and mutual benefit and to strive for the construction of Greater East Asia with a belief in certain victory. His words were concise and meaningful, and the gist is recorded as follows:

"This month's 8th is the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. As we welcome this memorable day, I would like to share my thoughts with the expatriates in China on this important period in Japanese history: Why did we take up arms against Britain and the United States? The Greater East Asia War is a struggle between Japan and the Anglo-Saxon peoples. In other words, it can also be said to be the Japan-US war. The purpose of Japan and the East Asian nations fighting Britain and the United States is not only to drive Britain and the United States out of East Asia, but also to use their own strength to build a new East Asia. China declared war on Britain and the United States in January of this year. On October 30th, China and Japan concluded an alliance treaty, establishing a permanent and unchanging friendly relationship between the two countries, and jointly shouldering the heavy responsibility of building East Asia. As a result, the East Asian nations have concentrated their efforts, and the combat system against Britain and the United States has been clarified at home and abroad.

The Greater East Asia Conference was a conference for the East Asian nations to join hands to drive out British and American aggression. Since the start of the war, the Japanese army has repeatedly achieved brilliant victories, and Britain and the United States are still trying to counterattack, resulting in fierce battles between the islands in the South China Sea. However, the construction of Greater East Asia is progressing step by step, and the unity of the Greater East Asian nations is becoming increasingly consolidated. Britain and the United States are extremely threatened by this fact, so Britain and the United States are launching political offensives in addition to military counterattacks. They are using scheming propaganda and attempting to alienate the East Asian nations and the Axis powers. After the Quebec Conference, Britain and the United States held a tripartite conference with the Soviet Union. Recently, after the Roosevelt-Churchill-Chiang meeting, Roosevelt and Churchill also met with Stalin in Iran. However, their common war aims are not consistent, and their mutual interests are conflicting. Under these circumstances of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams, they have never been able to articulate a grand policy like the Greater East Asia Declaration. Although they have repeatedly promoted the so-called "unconditional surrender of Japan" and other nonsensical remarks, the Sixth Bougainville Island naval battle, which echoed the Greater East Asia Conference, resulted in a resounding victory for the Japanese army. The third and fourth great victories in the Gilbert Islands and the results of yesterday's battle in the Marshall Islands, where more than 120 enemy ships were sunk and destroyed. The number of aircraft carriers alone reached 20, and the number of enemy aircraft destroyed was more than 900. This is truly an unprecedented great victory.

Furthermore, the soldiers and officers of the front line and the 100 million citizens are united in spirit, all holding the belief and determination that the war will be won. With just this great victory, no amount of enemy rhetoric can conceal it. In the future, the enemy's counterattack will inevitably become more intense, and we must be aware that we will engage in fierce battles in all areas. We must never forget the belief that we will not stop until we have destroyed the enemy. In particular, we who live among the Chinese people should always be aware and need to personally practice the spirit of equality and mutual benefit in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty. We should always have a belief in certain victory and an enthusiasm for construction. We firmly believe that once we have a firm belief in certain victory, then the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese peoples in building the Greater East Asia order will be realized."

### Soviet Troops Land on the Kerch Peninsula Again Without Success; Fierce Fighting Continues in the Middle Reaches of the Dnieper River

### To the American People

— Kichisaburo Nomura

A glimmer of hope has also vanished.

It is now undeniable that President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull engaged in Japanese-American negotiations with preconceived notions. This can be clearly understood from the documents previously released by the U.S. State Department. They did not and did not want to understand the concept of Asia for Asians or the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Can there be compromise in negotiations with such people as opponents? Frankly speaking, I really thought this was a difficult problem. So why did I go to America? As for myself, I had no plan and accepted this important mission. Facing the Emperor above and the people below, I hesitated with indescribable feelings and decided to go. There were several reasons, but what I can say now is only the following: Because of this, I dared to assume the important task of Ambassador to the United States, despite my limitations, to deal with the difficult situation in Japanese-American negotiations. Although it might have been just a glimmer of hope, or just a faint light.

Here we need to recall the situation in the Pacific during the previous World War, especially the Japanese-American relations centered on the Ishii-Lansing Agreement. At that time, the United States of America, harboring the ambition to invade the world, attempted to enforce its policies in the East and the West with an arrogant and overbearing attitude. But the distance between the will of the leaders and the feelings of the people did not allow for sufficient military preparations to realize that ambition, even now. Therefore, during the previous First World War, various difficult issues piled up like mountains between Japan's policy toward China and the United States' policy toward the Far East. As a result, each and every one of them was temporarily compromised, and Japan concluded the Ishii-Lansing Agreement. There is such a past history. Since then, military preparations have been actively strengthened, and ambitions have increased accordingly, but the situation in between does not seem to have changed essentially.

If such a change occurred, it would be tantamount to an act of suicide by the United States. For this reason, no matter how much they boast, because there is no real strength as a background, there is still room for bargaining, and it is not necessarily hopeless to mend Japanese-American relations.

The situation finally deteriorated.

I am a navy man myself. To assume this task, it is essential to be familiar with the Ishii-Lansing Agreement and other situations concerning the Pacific and Japanese-American relations. I often thought that this might not be my forte. I often heard various opinions about Japanese-American negotiations from among the people. But once I accepted it, I should have worked hard to prevent the war from happening, but I was incompetent, and the war finally happened. How can I explain this? I did not fulfill my responsibility. However, for several months, I hesitated, thought, endured, and respected myself, and worked hard to find a solution. After returning to Japan and hearing various things, my thinking has advanced one step further from here. All the means that should have been implemented in the problems between all countries were implemented, and all the policies that should have been requested were investigated, to the point that every possible method was exhausted. Unless it came to a foreign war, it was difficult to hope for a true national unity. We fully understand the Japanese government's policy. On the road to negotiations, we have traveled every possible path we have seen. We will do our best until the very last day.

However, on November 26, the worst situation finally occurred, and the final memorandum was received. Before this, there was a glimmer of hope in the state of failed negotiations. In mid-August, Prime Minister Konoe handed a joint communique to Roosevelt, and at that time, Roosevelt was very moved by the content of this communique. Roosevelt was originally a person who liked this kind of drama very much. He was very happy for a while.

But the State Department, which has been studying Japan and Far East policy in its own way for a long time—the State Department, which has written two hundred and several dozen letters of protest against Japan since the China Incident—did not seem to know about this situation. Later, when I hoped that Ambassador Kurusu would fly to America to provide support, the opportunity to end these talks was mentioned in only one-tenth of the newspapers. What the person in charge of the State Department said to the newspaper reporters was openly a speech expressing despair. So they naturally knew very well about the proposal on November 26, although Japan did not know about it.

After this, according to what the other party said, around this time, the naval commander issued a warning to the army and navy at the front to prepare for war. Also, in the documents recently released by the State Department: "On January 29, the Secretary of State met with the British Ambassador to the United States and told him that the diplomatic aspect of the Japanese-American issue has come to an end, and this issue is now being handled by the army and navy." Many people say that the American side actively prepared for war, waiting for December 8 to arrive, and I mention it casually.

If so, the Roosevelt government kept the American people in the dark, throwing them into the whirlpool of war. As Roosevelt and Hull themselves said, they saw ten years ahead of the American people, and gradually dragged the emotions of the people to their own ambitions. Dragging the tail of Congress, they desperately expanded the military. Peaceful America was filled with the air of war. Provoking the world, the American people were gradually dragged there, and finally entered the war, which spread to the borders of the Solomon Islands and the Aleutian Islands. The scale of that war is far beyond what the previous World War could compare. Roosevelt's rude and presumptuous words, such as absolute victory and unconditional surrender, and the fourteen-point declaration advocated by Wilson, or the idea of preventing revenge wars from occurring after the war, what do the American people think of the huge difference between these two? Under the rule of these two great presidents, I happened to be stationed in Washington twice. Remembering the previous time and the later time together, I cannot help but feel moved. Can the American people fully understand and resonate with the aforementioned policy of world invasion that the Roosevelt administration attempted? Moreover, do you believe that bold, ridiculous words such as absolute victory and unconditional surrender, from the perspective of ordinary common sense, are an unjust purpose that can be achieved with the power of the United States? Can Japan tolerate it? These can only be judged by the American people.

The operational objectives of the Pacific War.

What the Japanese people generally think is that the current war is being fought in a place far away from the Japanese mainland. Whether it is an air raid or a submarine, in short, this war is far away from the Japanese mainland by more than 2,000 miles. This idea is unbreakable. This is a very big mistake. Just by looking at the current strategic position of Japan, it can be immediately understood that the center of Japan, the heart of Japan, is by no means just the Japanese mainland. Although the Japanese mainland certainly has important places, at the same time, in the far reaches of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, there are also several places that Japan considers most necessary.

The enemy knows this very well. Mr. XX, who is still holding an important position in the United States, etc., said: "Mr. Nomura, Japan seems to be going to war with the United States. But won't it run out of oil first? Japan only bought this little bit of oil from the United States." He raised unbelievable figures and expressed this argument to me, who was running around trying to open up Japanese-American negotiations. Of course, I was not the opponent of that kind of argument, but after carefully studying the places that Japan considered painful, there was not the slightest feeling of gloating. At this time, the heart of Japan is in both parties, in various places in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. These places have the same importance as the Japanese mainland, and the enemy wants to cut them off from the Japanese mainland. I hope to remember this together with the people. The operational objectives of the British and American forces in the Pacific are entirely here.

Britain and the United States have always been countries that used blockade tactics as their main strategy. Needless to say, the war methods implemented by the world's major powers are all based on the national conditions of their countries and are the weapons that their countries traditionally excel at, so they cannot be taken lightly. Blockade tactics mean blockading the enemy and freely controlling the sea themselves. The fundamental spirit is to obtain the necessary materials for themselves while preventing the enemy from obtaining the materials they need. From this point of view, the United States previously advocated freedom of the seas, gradually built a large navy, and soon became a 5:5 ratio. This was not enough, and then they planned to double the large navy and call it the two-ocean fleet.

This attempt to simultaneously suppress the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans clearly shows the idea of using sea control to control the world. This will ultimately come down to the navy. When their own strength is insufficient, they advocate freedom of the seas, but now they want to allow the Stars and Stripes to cruise freely on the seas. The US Navy's policy after the expiry of the naval treaty has been acting with this point as the center, and it is clear. Hicks and others take every opportunity to proclaim freedom of the seas without any scruples. Suppressing the world's oceans, monopolizing the world's resources, and not stopping until they dominate the world—this is the great ambition of American imperialism.

The fundamental strategy is the blockade policy.

After I took office in Washington, I personally felt the rapid changes in US naval policy and could not help but be frightened for the American people. During the previous World War, when Wilson was president, I was a naval attache in Washington. Wilson also tried his best to advocate interventionist policies, but compared with Roosevelt, there was a world of difference in scale. With heaven-sent abundance and abundant resources, why do Americans living in the American continent have to bury the rights and lives of free American citizens in the mountains and dense forests, in the coral reefs and [blank] of the deep sea, as far as the ends of the earth in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea? There is only one answer, and that is the ambitious world policy of President Visforth, who is most enthusiastic about the recent major military plan. Their intended war aims against Japan, of course, focus on the above points. Therefore, while conducting psychological warfare to confuse people and perhaps guerrilla actions as one of the means of war, the fundamental emphasis is still on blockade warfare, cutting off the connection between the south and the Japanese homeland and hindering the supply of necessary materials, so that Japan cannot carry out the war. Judging from the traditions of laughing countries and the recent expansion of the naval policy, the strategy currently adopted against Japan is not only the most likely one for blockade warfare, but also the fundamental strategy.

In short, we should recognize that the heart of Japan is in the Japanese mainland, and also in the far reaches of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan's self-reliance and prosperity depend on the self-reliance and prosperity of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and then they can be implemented thoroughly. We cannot fail to know that MacArthur is desperately trying to take back Rabaul, and Mountbatten is eyeing us from the Indian Ocean. The two enemy maritime forces in the east and west are waiting for an opportunity. From this point of view, the five principles of the East Asia Joint Declaration are extremely important and as bright as the sun and the moon.

Coexistence and co-prosperity, respect for independence, promotion of culture, economic reciprocity, thorough abolition of racial discrimination, and opening up resources to the world—these are ideas that countries around the world have shared for many years and hoped to realize. They have been hindered by the selfishness of various nations and have not been implemented to this day. Now, the nations of East Asia are running ahead of the European and American powers and will realize them. This is a major event in history, internationally, and even humanely, and Japan's war goals are indeed of the greatest importance.

The American people cannot help but humbly listen to this joint declaration of the nations of East Asia. When you humbly and frankly read the spirit of this great declaration, how will you explain the cruel reality of throwing the lives of tens of thousands of your compatriots into the Solomon Sea and the dense forests of New Guinea?

### Rumor that Marshall Will Be Commander of Anglo-American Forces in Europe

Madrid, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch: The New York correspondent of the Arriba newspaper stated that a recent meeting decided to unify the Anglo-American command. It is expected that General Marshall will be the commander of the Anglo-American forces in Europe, General Eisenhower will succeed Marshall as US Chief of Staff, and the person who will succeed Eisenhower in his original position may be General Alexander, the British Deputy Commander-in-Chief in the Mediterranean. The Western newspaper correspondent also stated that the merger only refers to the command of the Anglo-American forces. As for the Soviet Union, it can still fight independently.

### The Soviet Union Makes Demands at the Iranian Conference

Stockholm, 6th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch: A report from London relayed from Moscow stated that Stalin has returned to Moscow from Tehran. Personnel from the British Embassy in the Soviet Union said that Churchill and Roosevelt have also left Tehran. According to sources related to Soviet affairs, the Tehran conference is more willing to have an expression of action than to see it only in words, so the communique has not been released for a long time. Stalin would not have gained nothing after such a long journey.

Belgrade, 6th (Central News Agency) – Spałajković commented on the Iranian meeting in the "Novo Vreme" newspaper, stating that Stalin, under the pretext of shortening the war, has placed seven hands on the throats of the anti-Axis powers and demanded that they rape Turkey. Stalin is very anxious, because the Rhine River is too far away, while the Balkans are much closer. Tito, Dimitrov, and Vinnish are Stalin's experts on Balkan issues, and Stalin listens to them. These three advocate demanding the opening of the Dardanelles as the gateway to the Balkans. Churchill's demand for Germany's unconditional surrender is a great opportunity for Stalin to propose and demand the opening of the Dardanelles as a shortcut to achieving this goal.

Wheeler, an isolationist, stated his reasons for adopting new insights, believing that the United States is in a position of world power and must take this path. He suggested organizing the United States of Europe to form an economic group, and that the current economic situation does not allow for the restoration of the pre-war economic state. Johnson also advocated close international cooperation after the war, warning against repeating the mistakes of the Treaty of Versailles. Republican Prosser demanded that the United States guide international affairs. He opposed ideas that transcend the nation and rejected the ideal of joint British-American citizenship.

### German Planes Attack Bari Harbor, Destroying Fourteen Ships, German Forces Recapture a Small Town in Eastern Italy

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report: German planes heavily attacked the Allied supply base of Bari Harbor on the night of the 3rd, sinking enemy ships totaling over 30,000 tons. This included one merchant ship of 10,000 tons, another of 6,000 tons, one oil tanker of 15,000 tons, and one ammunition ship of 4,500 tons. In addition, nine other merchant ships and one warship of 5,500 tons were also hit. The latter ships sank soon after. The weather that night was excellent, and flares illuminated the targets, making it easy for low-flying aircraft to aim. When the German planes attacked again, the oil tanker caught fire. As the German bombers arrived at their destination, a convoy approached the harbor and was immediately bombed, suffering numerous hits. As the German planes returned, they saw the ammunition ship exploding. Bari is an Allied supply base on the eastern coast of Italy, its importance comparable to Naples on the west coast.

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report: After the failure of the British Eighth Army's breakthrough and encirclement strategy, localized battles ensued, and the situation in southern Italy has eased. Although the British army had air and artillery support, their advance has been halted by German forces. German military sources believe that although the British army advanced several kilometers, it contributed little to the plan to occupy Rome. Two British tank units, assisted by armored vehicles, attacked near San Vito along the coast but were repelled. German forces recaptured the town of Frisa south of that location. Near Orsogna and Guardiagrele, only artillery and reconnaissance activities by the British army were observed. On the western front, the U.S. Fifth Army shelled German positions. The U.S. and British forces engaged in only localized activities there. In the mountainous region of the Tyrrhenian coast, the U.S. army attacked near Calabritto but was repelled by German forces from the high ground. On the Cassino front, U.S. forces attacked north and south of Mignano during inclement weather but were repelled by German assault troops. British and American reconnaissance units in the mountains of Isernia were ambushed near Filignano and strafed by German machine guns.

### Finland Declares Determination to Fight to the End, Nation Celebrates Independence Day

Helsinki, 5th (Central News Agency) - In light of December 6th being Finnish Independence Day, the Finnish newspaper "Social Democrat" published a short article reviewing the various stages of Finland's struggle for independence. Finland first became independent twenty-six years ago, amidst ongoing internal strife and mutual killing. By 1939, the country had gradually unified, and all disputes between the so-called Red and White factions had dissolved. The Finnish people, with five times their previous strength and the latest weaponry, united to face foreign enemies. However, the enemy used despicable means against the small Finnish nation. On December 6th, 1939, Molotov, speaking for the Soviet Union, declared to the world that the Soviet Union maintained friendly relations with democratic Finland and had no demands whatsoever. This was truly the most contemptible statement of a hypocrite. Currently, the Finnish nation faces the same enemy. Finland will never yield until it achieves final victory.

### Italian Armaments Ministry Moves to Northern Italy

Rome, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report: The Ministry of Armaments of the Italian Republic has now moved to a city in northern Italy, but the secretary-general remains in Rome to work.

### Badoglio Issues Statement

Lisbon, 6th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas report by Reuters' Italian correspondent: Marshal Badoglio, when interviewed by reporters, stated that Italians in the occupied territories should receive at least 300 grams of bread and 50 grams of flour per day to survive. One hundred grams of bread is definitely not enough to sustain one person's life. If the Allies could provide assistance, most political disputes could be easily resolved.

### Metal Collection Campaign to Begin Tomorrow, Mayor Chen and Minister Tajiri Issue Statements

(Central News Agency) Metal resources are among the most important materials in wartime. As the Greater East Asia War enters its decisive phase, ensuring these resources becomes even more critical. Municipal authorities from both China and Japan have designated the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, December 8th, as the starting date for a metal collection campaign. The initial target for the first phase is 30,000 tons of ferrous metals, 500 tons of copper, as well as lead, zinc, and other metals. Metal collection committees organized by both Chinese and Japanese sides will be responsible for carrying out this effort.

Mayor's Statement

Mayor Chen stated: "The launching of the waste metal collection and purchase campaign in Shanghai on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War is of profound and significant importance, needless to say. In times of war, all belligerent nations rigorously control materials to ensure resources and aim for the completion of the war. Metal is an important material related to warfare. Now that the Greater East Asia War has victoriously unfolded, in order to assist our allies in achieving a complete victory as soon as possible, we should launch this campaign. For the above reasons, the Shanghai Special Municipal Government has established a Metal Collection Committee to handle the collection and purchase of waste metals."

Implementation Measures

To facilitate understanding by all sectors, the implementation measures for this event are explained as follows:

Scope and Methods of Collection and Purchase. The scope of waste metal collection and purchase includes ferrous metals, copper, aluminum, zinc, tin, and other non-ferrous metals. The collection of waste metals from municipal government offices, schools, public places, factories, large stores, and streets will be without compensation. However, for collection from small stores and households, in addition to encouraging donations, purchasing methods will also be adopted.

Start Date. The collection and purchase period is set to begin on December 8th, 1943.

Implementation Methods. A. Collection of waste metals from government offices, schools, and public places: The responsible authorities and the First and Second Police Bureaus are instructed to investigate and report, and are required to investigate all waste metals, list them clearly, and submit the list to the municipal government for extraction. B. Collection of waste metals from factories and large stores: Except for items related to production, such as machinery, which are absolutely not included in the collection, other waste metals will be donated by members of the municipal Chamber of Commerce and various trade associations, and then submitted to the municipal government on a monthly basis. C. Collection of waste metals from the streets: The Bureau of Public Works and the Bureau of Health, in conjunction with the public works offices of the one to eight districts, are responsible for conducting cleaning operations, paying attention to submitting these items at any time. D. Collection of waste metals from general households: The Propaganda Department and the Baojia Offices will cooperate to ensure that people actively donate and submit them to the Baojia organizations, which will transfer them to the First Police Bureau and the Municipal Government Baojia Committee, which will then submit them to the municipal government on a monthly basis.

Purchase Implementation Methods. A. The formulation of standard prices will be carefully studied by the Economic Bureau, convening relevant guilds, and determined by the municipal government. B. Purchase methods and procedures: The Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee will publish the standard prices of waste metals in newspapers. If people voluntarily sell waste metals, they should first send them to their respective Baojia offices for storage, and a temporary receipt will be issued. The Baojia offices will create a register of sellers and the quantity sold, and submit it to their respective competent authorities for submission to the municipal government for record. C. Method and procedures for issuing funds: The Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee will issue the purchase funds to the competent authorities according to the register of sellers and the quantity sold in each district, based on the standard prices. The Baojia offices will then transfer the funds to the sellers to collect. D. The storage of waste metals: The municipal government will establish a storage committee to be responsible for safekeeping. Members of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government Metal Collection Committee: Zhao, Pan, Wu Songbi, Ying, Su Chengde, Xu Tianshen, Ye Song, Zhang, Sun Mingqi, Lin Jiong'an, Yuan Jufan.

Tajiri's Statement

Minister Tajiri stated that the joint Chinese-Japanese metal collection campaign launched under the cooperation of the Shanghai Special Municipal Government is a timely move given the current war situation. Steel and other non-ferrous metals are important war materials. Therefore, the effective use of what is no longer important or needed to enhance war capabilities is the duty of every citizen. The resource-rich United Kingdom and the United States have long been actively collecting metals. Thus, the joint Chinese-Japanese effort to contribute metal resources is a manifestation of the spirit of cooperation in the war between the peoples of China and Japan. It is hoped that China and Japan will work together to achieve great results.

Collection Outline

Collection Agencies: Both Chinese and Japanese sides will organize metal collection committees to develop collection plans and handle various matters. The metal collection committees will establish administrative bureaus to handle administrative affairs. Chinese-Japanese Liaison Method: The Chinese and Japanese committees will hold joint meetings at any time. Important matters will be decided by the general meeting. The Chinese and Japanese administrative bureaus should maintain close contact on practical matters to ensure consistent steps. Scope of Metal Collection: Ferrous metals, copper, lead, zinc, tin, and other non-ferrous metals. Collection Items: The first phase (December 8th to the end of March) is limited to easily collected metal products. A cleaning campaign will be carried out in the streets, government offices, public facilities, general households, and general factories. After the third phase, it will be gradually strengthened, such as mandatory provision, demolition, and suspension of factory equipment. Collection Period: Starting December 8th, 1943. Collection Target: For the first phase, 30,000 tons of ferrous metals, 500 tons of copper, lead, zinc, tungsten, and as many other non-ferrous metals as possible. From the second phase onwards, targets will be progressively increased depending on the situation. Collection Order: First, cleaning government offices and public facilities; then, cleaning general factories, businesses, and households. Dates will be specified separately by region. Collection Methods: For collection from street facilities, public facilities, and government offices, the committee will directly contact the owners and collect the items after handover. For some street facilities and general household items to be collected, Baojia personnel will be mobilized to be responsible for the collection. Items provided by military-managed enemy properties and factories will be collected by the committee through the enemy property management committee. For items provided by general factories and businesses, the Chinese side will be assisted by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Japanese side will be collected by various industry groups. Other items to be collected will be collected directly by the committee. Handling of Items to Be Removed: The removal of specifically designated items should be directly carried out by the committee. Private individuals are prohibited from freely dismantling them. Other items should be dismantled and provided by the providers. If the provider wishes the committee to handle the dismantling, they may do so. The providers will handle the sorting and other matters after dismantling. However, the committee will handle it if necessary. Transportation: The transportation of collected items will be handled by the committee, members of civilian organizations, to ensure speed. If necessary, military authorities will be asked for assistance. Storage: Before disposal, the collected items will be kept in a suitable place by the committee. Compensation: In principle, the policy is to purchase at a fair price, but donations from all sectors are encouraged. Disposal: All collected metal items will be provided for military needs.

The construction of Manchukuo is progressing faster than what I saw three years ago, and it is indeed a powerful unit in the rear of the Greater East Asia War. The film industry is also actively developing. In the future, cultural exchanges between China and Manchuria will be more closely cooperative, complementing each other's strengths. After we return to Shanghai, we will strive to make further efforts, hoping to contribute to film and social education.

### New Price Ceilings Set for Coal Briquettes and Coal, About Ten Yuan for 250 Coal Briquettes

The First District Office, in cooperation with the Japanese authorities, has recently set new price ceilings for coal briquettes and officially announced them. These new price ceilings are extremely low. The unit is one metric ton, or twenty dan (each dan weighing one hundred jin in the market). Calculated based on this unit, 250 coal briquettes should sell for approximately ten yuan in national currency at retail stores. The authorities have also set limits on the quality of the coal briquettes. The coal dust content in the coal briquettes produced by each coal briquette factory must not be less than 75%. In the future, if citizens suspect the quality of coal briquettes purchased from retail stores, they can report it to Office No. 191 of the Economic Department at No. 209 Jiangxi Road for verification.

Coal Briquette Rationing to Be Implemented Soon

In the near future, coal briquettes will be rationed per capita at the newly set price ceilings. However, before the preparations for the implementation of this plan are completed, the above-mentioned new price ceilings will apply to all coal briquettes currently sold. If citizens encounter coal merchants selling at inflated prices or selling substandard goods, they should immediately report it to the authorities for investigation in order to cooperate.

Price Ceilings for Coal Also Specified

In addition to adjusting the selling price of coal briquettes, the authorities have also revised the price ceilings for various grades of bituminous coal and anthracite coal. These price ceilings are also based on one metric ton (equivalent to eight standard baskets). Each basket of coal, including the basket itself, weighs 290 pounds, or approximately 131.5 kilograms. The quality of each grade of coal has also been specified separately. Standards have also been set for the coal dust content of various grades of unrefined coal and coal lumps. Citizens with questions can inquire at the Economic Department at No. 109 Jiangxi Road, the Coal Merchants Association at No. 12 Waibaidu Bridge, or the Dazhonglian Coal Company at No. 33 Sichuan Road.

Excess Coal Stocks to Be Rationed

The currently announced price ceilings for bituminous coal and anthracite coal are mainly applicable to the sale of coal to users who have been formally approved. However, these price ceilings are also effective for all coal stocks held by coal merchants that exceed the rationed amount. In order to ration these excess coal stocks, the Economic Department plans to conduct registration for industrial and commercial users and households. The registration deadline will be announced within two weeks. Once approved, applicants will be allocated coal at the new price ceilings starting in January next year.

The annual year-end settlement period for banks and money shops is approaching, and they are preparing for settlement. It is reported that interest will be paid separately on savings, commercial accounts, and other parts.

Settlement Dates

The settlement date for the savings department is the 20th, and the commercial department is the 25th. However, the settlement of interest for the savings department of banks such as Zhejiang Industrial Bank has already been implemented at the end of last month. As for loans from various industries, such as overdrafts and credit loans, they must be repaid before the year-end settlement period, unless otherwise specified in the contract. According to convention, new loans will be temporarily suspended during this year-end settlement period, except for the legitimate needs of various industries. It is also reported that the Banking Joint Reserve Council and the Money Shops Joint Reserve are striving to accommodate the interbank lending of member banks and money shops within the possible scope, but they must provide collateral and follow the interbank lending methods. The preparation for legitimate uses of various banks and money shops, and for businesses, has also been done separately, to ensure a smooth year-end settlement period.

### Interbank Lending in Money Shops Depends on Sufficient Reserves

The Shanghai Money Shops Joint Reserve, in order to emphasize the creditworthiness of various money shops and prevent accidents, in addition to strictly limiting the amount of money each shop must deposit as the Reserve Fund before participating in interbank transactions and bill clearing, requires each shop with a need for interbank transactions and interbank lending to pay the reserve assets within the specified limits. Any interbank exchange transactions, remitting and settling accounts, or interbank lending that exceeds the reserve or deposit amount should be supplemented with the corresponding difference to balance the accounts daily.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds. Yesterday, the prices of government bonds varied widely. Class C bonds fell slightly, while miscellaneous bonds rose. This trend was due to different needs, resulting in an unusual surge. However, this is likely to be a temporary phenomenon. Class C bonds initially rose in early trading yesterday, but then gradually declined. The final price at noon was slightly lower than the price at the end of last week, while Classes A, B, D, and E all saw increases.

Interbank Lending Rate. Yesterday, the interbank lending rate of the Money Shop Association remained unchanged at 1.8%, and interbank lending was tight again.

Tea. Trading remained extremely weak, but purchases by tax-paying households did not decline. The market was unusually brisk, and the floor price was stable. Only Taiji Tea Shop in the city imported twelve dan of green tea, and twenty boxes of black tea were sold by Zhiji and Zhenhua Tea Shops. According to staff reports, there have been frequent large-scale purchases of red silk tea lately.

Grain. Yesterday, domestic rice prices remained stable. The amount of rice transported by train and from the four districts was sufficient to supply the city's tax-paying households, and prices changed little.

Miscellaneous Grains. Yesterday, miscellaneous grains also strengthened, and trading was not quiet. She beans, Shuangyuan soybeans, and yellow sand beans all rose.

Cigarettes. Yesterday, cigarettes rebounded. British American Tobacco's Qianmen remained at its original price, while the prices of Old Knife and Quanlu varied. Demand was slightly stronger. Daily necessities, such as wax candles, were sought after and reached new highs.

Economic Commentary

### On the Unified Purchase and Distribution of Cotton

The unified purchase and distribution of cotton by the Cotton Control Committee is currently being actively promoted in accordance with the established plan. The focus of current consideration is on determining the cotton purchase price, raising and using the purchase funds, and establishing public warehouses in the central areas of the cotton-producing regions. These three points are analyzed and reviewed below: Regarding the price of cotton purchases, like other agricultural products, the price ceiling should not be too low, which would disappoint farmers. As a result, not only will farmers be reluctant to sell the cotton they have harvested, but they may even change the unplanted cotton fields to plant other crops, such as miscellaneous grains, which will have a significant impact on future cotton production. Therefore, the purchase price must be appropriately increased after considering the situation. Regarding the raising of purchase funds, if only the purchasers handle it themselves, it is feared that neither the raising nor the use can reach the ideal state. The authorities should assist in or finance it, such as in the North China Agricultural Increase Plan, where the Cotton Industry Revitalization Association provides financing for cotton production increases based on the increased output per unit area of cotton. Therefore, in Central China, the cotton control authorities should cooperate and provide loans from national banks. Regarding the establishment of public warehouses in cotton-producing areas, it is heard that the locations are not limited to Nantong and Shanghai, but are spread to other cotton-producing areas, which is a reasonable approach. In addition, in terms of storage, attention must be paid to the equipment of the public warehouses to prevent the risk of fire and water.

As for the unified distribution, it is said that the premise is to allocate to various factories for manufacturing, and the specific methods are being drafted. Now that the price of cloth has been approved, distribution can be implemented. At the same time, the Commercial Control Committee announced that the free purchase and sale of cloth will not be restored, then the quantity of cloth distribution must be reasonably increased so that the people will not be unable to keep warm. However, sufficient distribution depends on sufficient production. In order to promote the production of cloth, cotton must be supplied to various factories as much as possible for the manufacture of cloth. This is what the factories that manufacture cloth hope for, and especially what the people who receive cloth distribution hope for.

### Tightening of Credit Leads to Setback in Chinese Stock Surge

Yesterday, Chinese stocks entered a a consolidation phase, with most gains retreating and prices falling. This was attributed to the tightening of credit and weakened investor confidence. However, the World Book Company continued to surge on positive news, and New Asia Construction showed strong stability. The cotton and textile industries experienced across-the-board declines, while New Abandoned Industries and Jiufu remained firm. The largest declines were recorded in [unclear - name of stock or industry]. The highest, lowest, and closing prices of the major stocks of the day are listed below:

### Oil to be Distributed with Rice Purchase Certificates Starting From the 8th; Price at 7 Yuan Per Coupon (4 Ounces)

Regarding the implementation of the 52nd, 53rd, and 54th rice purchase coupons, it is determined that from December 8th to December 20th of this year, retail oil stores shall sell cooking oil upon presentation of the 52nd rice purchase coupon. The store should sell four city ounces of raw oil or soybean oil for seven yuan in national currency, including the two [unclear - unit of measurement] retail tax, upon receiving each coupon marked with the store's number. Furthermore, the retail addresses for this distribution of cooking oil are different from those listed on the previously issued 3rd and 4th oil purchase certificates. Citizens purchasing this round of cooking oil must inquire at the distribution office for clarification. Universal Sale of Household Sugar to Begin Soon

The eleventh-month sugar for this city will be managed by the sugar merchants' cooperative, having obtained approval from the military authorities. The procedure of picking up goods has already begun. According to the person in charge of the cooperative, this period's sugar is expected to begin its universal sale around the 10th. The amount is not expected to change. However, the price will be adjusted and will be presented to the responsible authorities for approval and officially announced in a public notice soon.

### To the American People (Continued from Page 2)

The Existence of Isolationists

But unless our military force is defeated to the uttermost extreme, there is absolutely a second way to end this war. Only after the enemy's naval power is uprooted will the opportunity for the Americans to initially awaken arrive. The accumulation of vast war results obtained by Solomon now will make it increasingly difficult for the United States, soon reaching a turning point in determining the outcome of the war. Even if there are various weaknesses in the United States, such as internal riots, that merely stimulate and induce the war situation to gradually become more serious, its military force remains solid as before. While the war is proceeding slowly, no weakness should be expected to have an excessive impact on it.

What the United States is doing now is what the Americans call interventionism. Whether it is isolationism or interventionism, its content changes slightly with the times, but today isolationists still exist in the United States in considerable numbers. Even among powerful politicians, there are such isolationists. Although their numbers are small, they were quite influential before the war. After the war began, isolationism was called [unclear - term] and disappeared, but the existence of isolationism is a stark reality.

However, it must be especially noted here that these isolationists, regarding the recent situation in the Pacific, strongly advocate [unclear - extreme view] on matters related to Japan. American trends have always placed special emphasis on the Pacific. Even the isolationist faction has broken its previous silence on this matter, acting like active supporters of the government, speaking tough. We must not overlook this fact either. If isolationists have the power to act as an opposition party, then the current government will add another failure to its failures, which is when Japan's military force pierces the enemy's heart.

Weaknesses—Race and Strikes

The second weakness of the United States is the race problem. For example, although statistics vary, there are approximately five to six million German Americans, four to five million Italian Americans, and roughly the same number of Irish Americans. In addition, there are very many immigrants from Southern and Northern Europe. Black people number twelve to thirteen million. With Anglo-Saxons at the center, these various races are united on the first point of being American, but what if the war goes unfavorably, the war is prolonged, and this race problem combines with other social problems? Compared to Japan, how big and how important is the American weakness?

Speaking of the recent intensified strike problem, my view is this. Within the disputes, there are roughly various political and ideological machinations—but the mainstream is still economic reasons. As for rebelling against the national order, it doesn't seem to reach that point! It is generally believed that [unclear - something] knows nothing about the current situation! In short, prices are gradually rising, reportedly about one percent per month, and have risen by twenty-five percent in the past two years. On the one hand, the government fears inflation and implements methods such as fixed wages and fixed prices, but taxes are rising daily, so prices cannot be suppressed. Fixed wages are in fact becoming impossible. Due to a shortage of supplies, life is becoming more difficult. This is the main reason for the repeated strikes. The organization of the American labor movement is very powerful, and some even say it is a major enemy of the Roosevelt administration. Following the progress of the war, due to the urgent need for industry, the intensification of disputes has expanded its power. According to recent reports, strike incidents often lead to the deployment of troops for suppression. So, it is natural that I said earlier that this has become a major problem in the United States. But even so, setting aside the success of our military force and placing excessive expectations is a matter that requires great caution.

A Country Bound by Public Opinion

The United States is indeed a so-called country of public opinion. Even a president, when faced with things that surprise the nation, tirelessly tries to influence public opinion. On the contrary, for this reason, he has finally become a captive of the public opinion he himself created. He must always consider public opinion and is always bound by public opinion. Whenever I met with the president and the secretary of state, I felt this way. This is different from so-called respect for public opinion. Their minds can no longer leave public opinion, unable to take a step away from it.

That the US-Japan negotiations could not be hopeful no matter what. Newspapers said that the chance of the negotiations ending successfully was less than one in ten. With American public opinion at this point, even if the president was moved by Japan's views during the talks, the president could do nothing. Roosevelt himself may have thought that war was unavoidable and that he had to do this, but I want to say, that's not the case. He could not rely on public opinion no matter what. He could not carefully consider the great hundred-year plan for the US-Japan relationship from a higher place than public opinion. This is the characteristic of the fate of American politicians. After ten months of talks, I wondered why he couldn't take a step forward, but I couldn't figure it out.

The Future of the War is Difficult

In short, this is one aspect of the powerful activity of public opinion in the country of public opinion—the United States. On the one hand, it says that the war is progressing smoothly, while on the other hand, it drives the people to the Solomon Islands and New Guinea, and repeatedly loses battles. This exposes the big talk of America's war aims, but public opinion doesn't know it. Perhaps this is the aforementioned weakness of the United States, which permeates this public opinion and eventually dominates everything. American leaders fear public opinion more than anything else. Even if they have accumulated such powerful military equipment, is it used to travel across the oceans and wage an unreasonable war of world invasion? When the war is unfavorable, do they stubbornly defend themselves and drag the people to the end? At this point, why is the United States still concealing the truth of its defeats from its people? Even though the situation is becoming unfavorable, it still has to forcibly delay things. Americans probably like to gamble, that is, they are a nation of speculative risks. Next year is the presidential election, and the results of the elections in various places are unfavorable to the Democratic Party. Facing this political turning point, they must in some way get the people to agree with this aspect. Launching large fleets to the Solomon Islands one after another, America's war intentions are indeed terrifying, and its strategy is also very dynamic. If they encounter weak enemies, they will surely achieve great success. But confronting a strong enemy like Japan is exactly what we want.

The Beginning of Victory Has Been Created Already. The Japanese people will not become complacent because of these war results, and the enemy, the United States, will probably not be afraid because of this either. The former will become increasingly serious, and after twists and turns, it still lies in the future. (End of full text) (Sho: From the Yomiuri Hochi from November 19th to 21st)

### On Liu Haisu's Oil Paintings

— Li

Modern art, since Impressionism, started a revolution of color, and finally buried its future in dazzling mediocrity. The one who rose to the world art scene in its place should be Cezanne, the great artist who advocated the expression of self and inner truth.

He negated the objective reproduction and capture of momentary impressions, pursuing the eternity of art. The shining light of the 20th-century world art scene should really be attributed to Cezanne, the father of this emerging art.

Mr. Haisu, who has a sweeping talent, naturally follows the path that Cezanne took in his efforts in oil painting. In other words, he starts from Cezanne's realism, expressing his own noble and great character, and indomitable personality. "Snow in Luxembourg", "Cockscomb", and "Lingyin Temple" can be used as clear explanations of this aspect. His method is rigorous and full of the fervor and reverence of color.

Mr. Haisu also has a fiery passion, so he also likes to use colors like gold, vermilion, cyan, and sky blue like Van Gogh. "Express Train", "Purple Hydrangea", and "Smoky Haze" have such a feeling, but in Van Gogh's fervor and intensity, there seems to be a tragic cry, with a terrible fate hidden, while he is only magnificent and splendid.

We must also pay attention to Mr. Haisu's continuous exploration of the art of his ancestors and his pursuit of the path of Chinese new art creation. This seems to be felt more strongly in his Chinese paintings, but the grandeur of "Mount Babadayang Volcano", the vigor of "Phoenix Tree" and "Buffalo", the solidity of "White Horse" and "Pagoda", and the simplicity of "Remnant Lotus" and "Cormorant", does this not point out a new style of oil painting? It is the creation after the fusion of Chinese and foreign ancient and modern cultures, and it is precisely Mr. Haisu's unique creation in art.

Originally, the essence of art is not in the object being copied, but in the ability to create one's own inner world, so the purer the art, the more it can express this inner spirit.

(Note) Mr. Liu Haisu's exhibition has been held for several days, and the audience has been very large. It will close on the eleventh of this month.

### Methods for Preventing Lung Disease

— Lu Sheng

Lung disease is a respiratory system disease. The respiratory system is in constant contact with the outside world and is most susceptible to disease. Therefore, the "Inner Classic" says that the lungs are delicate and cannot withstand evil invasion, which is what it describes. As for the transition from the disease period or from recuperation to social activities, it is a great transformation in the process. In terms of employment, everyone knows that outdoor work such as gardening or forestry is the most suitable. But at this time of food shortage, obtaining a job is not easy. How many can get a job as ideal as desired? It must be known that the relationship between lung disease and occupation is relative rather than absolute. Furthermore, if lung disease is cured by [unclear - medical term] to treat the root cause, then the person's original essence has been restored, and qi and blood have been replenished, and it is no longer the old view of the past. Therefore, the way to choose a career can be broadened.

In addition, there is an even worse habit in Shanghai, which is late sleeping. This bad habit is rarely found in rural areas, although it is partly due to the nature of occupations in the industrial and commercial circles of Shanghai. However, there are also many who do not go to bed early for non-essential reasons. It must be known that sleep is the most thorough rest. People work hard all day long and rely on sleep to restore their spirit. [unclear - medical term] is due to insufficient original essence and yin deficiency, and sound sleep can best restore what has been consumed. Washing feet with hot water at night can harmonize the blood vessels and promote sound sleep.

The way to treat the root cause of lung disease lies in nourishing yin and replenishing the lungs. In addition, inhalation therapy can allow the medicine to directly reach the lungs and has a quick effect. However, this must be done after a doctor's examination. If you want to seek self-treatment and get the effect of tonifying the lungs, then Chinese pharmacies have ready-made tonic medicines called Qiong Yu Paste. It is made by decocting codonopsis, rehmannia, poria, and white honey. It can be taken once each morning and evening, one or two spoons each time, and it also has the effect of nourishing.

### Taoist Association Distributes Clothing and Congee Vouchers

Taoists Ai Langxuan, Liu Yongxiang, [unclear - name] Hongqing, Zhou Yangzhen, Zhang Weixin, and Wang Qiquan initiated the establishment of the China Taoist General Association. After reporting to the Ministry of Interior and the Ministry of Welfare for record, it is heard that preparations are complete and it will soon be established. Hundreds of people have joined the association. The association, noting that the cold winter has arrived, has specially printed tens of thousands of congee vouchers. Each voucher is worth two yuan for congee. In addition to the association bearing a certain amount, those who are benevolent can also purchase vouchers from the Tongbai Palace General Office on Weihaiwei Road to distribute. It is also heard that some great benefactors have each donated 100 sets of cotton clothing, which will be distributed by the general association at the Bai [unclear - name] Temple on Fangxie Road.
