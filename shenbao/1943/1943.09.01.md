### Reaching the Public

August 1st marked the day Shanghai's municipal administration was unified, and the day the term "concession" became a historical relic. The people of the entire nation, especially the citizens of Shanghai, hold boundless concern and anticipation for the new construction and future prospects of the Great Shanghai Municipality. This is because Shanghai is China's metropolis, the gateway to international transportation, and the center of national politics and economy. Its every move, good or bad, is observed by international figures, and its social atmosphere has an impact on all parts of the country. Therefore, from the standpoint of Shanghai citizens, and with the perspective of hoping for Shanghai's prosperity and stability, neither celebratory glorification nor passive indifference is the appropriate attitude towards the takeover of the concessions. We must understand that building a new Shanghai is the responsibility of every citizen. Celebratory glorification alone cannot achieve anything, nor is indifference desirable. Only with a proactive and supervisory attitude can we promote the improvement of municipal administration. We know that the government exists to serve the people, and its policies should naturally be based on the needs and interests of the people. However, the government inevitably has blind spots and incomplete investigations. Thus, there may be measures that do not fully meet the needs and interests of the people. In this case, the people must adopt a proactive and supervisory attitude to offer suggestions for improvement. If the people's opinions are reasonable, the government will surely heed public sentiment and be happy to adopt them.

We firmly hold the above view, believing that only through sincere collaboration between the people and the government can we achieve efficient cooperation and facilitate the construction of an ideal Shanghai. As for how to promote a unified front between the people and the government, we in the journalistic field are willing to take on this task with all our strength, without any reservations. At the same time, we believe that this is an undeniable obligation. We want to start by bridging the gap between officials and the public. Therefore, over the past half month, we have continuously published announcements seeking opinions from citizens on the facilities of the Great Shanghai Municipality. The announcement stated: "The new construction of the Great Shanghai Municipality is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the direction of municipal administration deserves the attention of citizens. And, before the establishment of public opinion organs, citizens should express their opinions with utmost sincerity. This newspaper is willing to serve as the voice of the citizens, and has specially opened a space to disclose citizens' suggestions and reflect public opinion, starting from September, with the first day of each month as the publication date. Citizens are invited to draft written opinions on the dynamics, merits, demerits, progress, and regress of all aspects of municipal facilities, which will be selectively published. If there is a need for confidentiality, they will also be confidentially forwarded to the municipal authorities for their consideration." Since the solicitation, we have received enthusiastic submissions from citizens, totaling over two hundred items, which further proves the citizens' eagerness to care about municipal administration. Before the analysis, we would like to present the sincerity of all citizens to the municipal authorities.

We have carefully examined and compared the citizens' opinions received. First, the opinions cover all departments of municipal administration, large and small, which demonstrates the improvement and universality of citizens' understanding of municipal administration. Second, the focal point of the opinions is on livelihood issues, especially the issue of food for the people, which is the central argument, proving that the ancients' saying "food is the paramount necessity of the people" is indeed based on experience. We have always believed that the food issue is the most important aspect of the people's livelihood, and that the food issue is the most serious issue today, which is not an overstatement. Next, regarding issues related to the people's livelihood, such as stabilizing prices, cracking down on hoarding, enforcing leasing regulations, building more affordable housing, improving transportation and public health, and practicing frugality. Regarding administrative facilities, such as enforcing clean governance and rectifying education, reducing and standardizing taxes, improving the treatment of civil servants, strengthening the Baojia system, building water conservancy projects, eradicating opium and gambling in the Nanshi district, and establishing public cultural institutions, and so on. Some are based on facts and propose improvements suitable for the current situation; others are concrete plans based on theoretical considerations. Among them, there are many excellent insights of considerable value. We originally planned to publish as much as possible, but due to the limited space of this newspaper, we were unable to adopt them all, which is a matter of regret. We should apologize to all citizens and the municipal authorities for this. Today is September 1st, the first month after the takeover of the concessions. In addition to selecting and publishing the best articles on page four of this newspaper for two consecutive days, we will also publish the longer articles in the "Shen Bao Monthly." Some of the opinions will also be compiled and submitted to the authorities for reference.

We have said before that the so-called citizens' opinions are based on personal experience and are honest words. Therefore, we do not take empty theories, do not emphasize rhetoric, and do not mind being repetitive. Of course, personal issues often have similarities, and we cannot regard them as bland platitudes. We should pay attention to the seriousness and universality of the problem. The more common things are, the more easily they are overlooked. This is the attitude we should have when observing public opinion.

In addition, we will continue to raise the issue of food, a problem that everyone agrees on, and that neither the government nor the people can ignore. Yesterday's newspaper reported that the procurement and distribution of food will be taken over by the National Commercial Control Association, and that the association's preparatory team has established a special agency, with personnel already designated. We have been sincerely appealing to this issue for days, and now we see that the implementation is imminent, which is a testament to the government's willingness to listen to public opinion and attach importance to the people's livelihood. As the ancients said, "The overturned cart ahead is a warning to the cart behind." Regarding the future measures for the procurement and distribution of food, we must reverse the previous mistakes and thoroughly reform. Therefore, with the same sincerity, we are soliciting citizens' opinions on the food issue, such as comparing the advantages and disadvantages of various aspects of procurement and distribution, especially listing the facts of past abuses, and then proposing appropriate improvement strategies. On this day next month, we will compile and publish selected articles for reference by the relevant authorities. We are willing to continue to work tirelessly on this task of conveying public opinion until the establishment of a formal public opinion organ. We firmly believe that all officials and citizens who care about the construction of Shanghai will agree with this!

### On the New Guinea Island Front: Japanese Army's Achievements in Three Months; Enemy Suffered 5,000 Casualties and Lost Over 300 Aircraft

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 PM on the 31st: Our troops in the vicinity of Salamaua, New Guinea Island, along the line of Kamidam-Mubo-Noso Bay, have been engaging in counterattacks against enemy forces advancing from Noso and near Wau since June 3rd, under the support of superior air power, inflicting heavy casualties. They are currently engaged in fierce battles near Salamaua. During this period, enemy losses are estimated at over 5,600 casualties. In the New Guinea region, our air force and ground forces cooperated to attack enemy air bases such as PeNo PeNo and Hopubu, and engaged attacking enemy aircraft. Fierce fighting continues, during which a total of 358 enemy aircraft were shot down, with 53 unconfirmed. Our losses were 103 aircraft.

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – The fighting in the Salamaua region of New Guinea appears to be intensifying daily, with the Japanese army inflicting significant damage on the Allied forces. According to a dispatch from San Francisco, a frontline correspondent for the Associated Press reported on the 30th regarding the situation in that area: the Allied forces in Salamaua were forced to retreat from several locations in the past two to three days due to the fierce counterattacks by the Japanese army.

### Japanese Forces Land in Sandu Ao, Safeguarding Maritime Security and Holding Profound Historical Significance

Nanjing, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese naval landing forces successfully landed in Sandu Ao, Fujian Province, on the 28th and are actively clearing out the remaining enemy forces. Sandu Ao is the finest natural harbor within the eastern sea fortress of Fujian Province on the Chinese coastline, located on the southern shore of Sandu Island in Sandu Bay. The island is over 20 li in circumference, with rolling hills and lush bamboo forests, offering scenic views. The waters within the harbor are deep and calm, allowing giant warships to moor safely. Previously, there was a small village. In the 24th year of the Guangxu Emperor (1898), Italy requested to lease the area, which was then developed into a commercial port. In the 25th year, it became a dedicated port for exporting tea. However, due to the surrounding mountains, trade was difficult to develop. Nevertheless, because the area faces the Taiwan Strait, it has become a military stronghold. Americans planned to establish a naval coaling station there in the 26th year of the Guangxu Emperor, but it was halted due to Japanese opposition. Now, the American attempt to use it as a submarine base has been quickly thwarted by the Japanese army. This is of great significance for ensuring maritime security in the Greater East Asia region. At the same time, the Japanese army can seize the opportunity to land in Ningde County, Fujian, as a precursor to the attack on Fuzhou. This is of even greater historical significance for achieving overall peace in China and defeating the United Kingdom and the United States, thereby completing the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, the development of the war situation is highly anticipated.

This time, I was ordered to come to Wuhan to inspect the quality and training of the National Army to provide a basis for improvement. After the inspection is completed, the inspection situation will be announced."

### Director of the Hagihagi Reporting Department Gave a Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Major General Hagihagi, Director of the Army Reporting Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, made the following remarks on the 31st:

The Chongqing regime, based on the Lend-Lease Act, has borrowed a huge amount of money from the United Kingdom. Even if it uses the land resources under Chongqing's control, or even enslaves its people to the United States, it will be difficult to repay the loans. Furthermore, the regime purchased a large amount of materials, resulting in a huge debt. Before the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in the 25th year of the Showa era (1940), the amount of money Chongqing borrowed from the United States, excluding those related to the Lend-Lease Act, was already $31,943,000. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War (i.e., the 17th year of Showa), it has reached $1,047,743,000 (equivalent to 20,954,860,000 old legal tender). Among them, about 500 million was the US dollar public debt issued for the direct purpose of helping Chongqing's finances. Furthermore, according to the Times, the materials transported to Chongqing based on the Lend-Lease Act, from the 16th year of Showa to February of the 18th year, have reached more than 1 billion US dollars. However, the exact amount that actually arrived in Chongqing is unknown. The repayment method stipulated in the Lend-Lease Act is also problematic. According to the treaty, after the war, the President of the United States will determine what is useful for the defense of the United States or the Western Hemisphere, and use it as the consideration for repayment. This means that all materials, even land, railways, and other rights and interests, can be decided by the United States as compensation. Currently, Chongqing has suffered tremendous sacrifices for the United Kingdom and the United States, especially in terms of personnel losses, but the United States has no sympathy for this. According to a resolution of the Chongqing Senate in mid-August, after the United Kingdom and the United States abandon extraterritoriality in China, foreign investment in China tends to be hesitant. However, because China needs to actively develop in the future and now, it welcomes foreign investment. Therefore, the government has decided to provide absolute guarantees and has announced relevant measures. The so-called absolute guarantee is nothing more than wanting to give the right to control China to foreign capitalists. In other words, Chongqing is sacrificing the interests of the Chinese people to save itself in the short term, and is selling hundreds of millions of Chinese people to British and American capitalists. Even if Chongqing can end the war with favorable treaties, it will have to dedicate the land of the entire country to the United Kingdom and the United States to repay the debts incurred during the war. If Japan no longer exists in East Asia, the United Kingdom and the United States will use this debt as a basis to raise unreasonable demands. At that time, even if Chongqing attempts to compensate for the great sacrifices it suffered during the war, it will be absolutely impossible.

### Minister Aoki Pays Homage to the Emperor of Manchukuo

Xinjing, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – Japanese Minister of Greater East Asia Affairs, Aoki, visited the Jian'guo Shrine at around 11:00 AM on the 31st.

### The Quebec Conference and the Unresolved Issues Between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union

In addition to addressing the new situation in Europe after the Italian coup, the Anglo-American conference in Quebec had many other issues. It seems that the issue of coordinating between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union remained the central topic of discussion. To what extent can the opinions of the countries concerned be reconciled? To what extent can the disputes between the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union since the Casablanca Conference be resolved? Needless to say, these were the main topics of the conference. Below is an introduction to the background and nature of the Anglo-American-Soviet disputes, according to the New York Times.

The Second Front Issue

Regarding this issue, the New York Times stated: "The Soviet Union demands the implementation of direct and large-scale operations on the northern coast of France." The Soviet Pravda reprinted an article from the magazine "War and the Working Class" on August 5th, stating that the Soviet Union clearly informed the United Kingdom and the United States of the significance of the Second Front. The article said:

"At the Casablanca Conference in January of this year, a plan for the military actions of the Anglo-American Allied forces for the nine months of this year was decided. Although it also included the Second Front, the nine months are coming to an end, and the Second Front has not yet been formed. Looking at the achievements made to date, the Anglo-American forces have not yet truly clashed with the German army. The Anglo-Americans defend the delay of the Second Front with the reasons of the European Fortress, the unresolved shipping problem, and the risky nature of the invasion. But the European Fortress is a product of imagination, and the shipping problem has been solved due to the increase in American shipbuilding and the experience of the Anglo-American landing in North Africa and the Battle of Sicily. And the risk of invasion could be said in the first year of the war, but it is no longer applicable this year."

In response, the New York Times argued: "If the Anglo-Americans did not have the determination to carry out the above-mentioned operations, then what need was there for discussion?" The Second Front issue had already created a considerable gap between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union before this Anglo-American conference.

Poland and the Three Balkan Countries

During the Soviet-Polish border dispute this spring, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union openly expressed their differing views on small countries, using the Atlantic Charter as a basis. At the time, Churchill said: "After the war, the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union should coordinate with each other to establish a European conference composed of many countries, a national union that is consistent with the lofty and permanent interests of the three countries. However, it is foolish to discuss borderlines in the current state of the war." Thus, this issue was left unresolved. In this conference, if the aim is to adjust Anglo-American-Soviet politics, the first realistic topic will be this. The New York Times stated:

"The United Kingdom and the United States often look at the Soviet Union with suspicion, and the Soviet Union sees the United Kingdom and the United States using these countries to encircle the Soviet Union."

This proves that the Polish border issue remains profoundly divisive. The authoritative British magazine "Nineteenth Century and After" boldly attacked the Soviet Union on this issue in its June issue, incurring the anger of the Soviet Union. The magazine's argument was:

"The loss of its eastern part is a matter of life and death for Poland. That is to say, Poland has lost half of its territory and one-third of its people. But on the Soviet side, the gains from the merger are minimal. The Soviet-Polish dispute is not an isolated phenomenon. The Soviet Union is using the same methods in its policy towards the southern countries. The Soviet Union regards General Mihailovic of the southern countries as the equivalent of Sikorski. After the Soviet Union occupied eastern Poland, it bordered Carpathia-Ruthenia in Czechoslovakia. The residents there have similar relations to the Galician residents, so the Soviet Union's claim of annexation is well-founded, and it should be said that it reveals the true intentions of the Soviet Union."

From this, it can be seen that the Polish issue contains significant interests for the United Kingdom, so British public opinion openly focuses its suspicion on the Soviet Union, even more so than what the New York Times pointed out.

The Result of the Conference

In summary, the truth about the disagreements between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is that they are completely united and have no differences on the military objective of defeating Germany. However, with regard to the political objectives of the three countries, profound conflicts are exposed. Therefore, this Anglo-American conference, with the above-mentioned issues as the center, in terms of political adjustment, if it is to achieve any development, it should at least be to satisfy Stalin's reciprocity diplomacy with the realization of the Second Front and concessions on Eastern European issues. Without the participation of the Soviet Union in the Anglo-American conference, in terms of resolving problems, the outcome of the conference will not be clearly expressed. The future negotiations between the three countries related to the progress of the war situation are extremely noteworthy. (Xiang: Translated from the August 25th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Stalin Agrees to Hold Three-Country Conference; Maisky Arrives in the UK

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – According to a dispatch from London, Roosevelt's special envoy, Hopkins, arrived in London on the night of the 29th. Also, Soviet Deputy People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs, Maisky, has arrived in London and has reportedly held multiple meetings with British Foreign Secretary Eden. The New York Evening Post reported on the 28th in a dispatch from London that Soviet Chairman Stalin has agreed to hold a three-country conference between the Soviet government and the United Kingdom and the United States. It is said that People's Commissar for Foreign Affairs Molotov has informed the ambassadors of the United Kingdom and the United States in the Soviet Union of the above decision. Since the news spread, the Allied propaganda machine has been doing its best to promote the three-country conference. Coupled with the arrival of Roosevelt's special envoy, Davis, in London, it is widely speculated that preparations for the Anglo-American-Soviet conference may have already begun.

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency Telegram) – New York Daily Mirror writer Pearson said in a radio address yesterday that Soviet leader Stalin has agreed to meet with Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, and predicted that before his resignation last week, U.S. Undersecretary of State Welles was sent to the Soviet Union to prepare the groundwork for the conference. Pearson also said that Roosevelt will not participate in the 1944 presidential election.

Soft licenses have been prepared for one year's use. Therefore, all types of military licenses will temporarily maintain their original state and must be replaced from January 1, 1944.

Rental Disputes in the City
Arbitration Procedures Available
Arbitration Committee Organized and Rules Promulgated

In view of the increasing number of rental disputes in recent years, the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau has requested mediation and has resolved them fairly in accordance with the Special Law on Wartime Housing Leases. Now, in order to facilitate the resolution of such disputes, the Bureau has organized a Housing Rental Dispute Arbitration Committee and formulated the "Provisional Rules for Handling Housing Rental Disputes in Shanghai Municipality," which have been submitted to the Municipal Government for approval and promulgation.

Restaurant and Dance Hall Operating Hours Specified
Municipal Government Notice to Be Implemented Today

The Shanghai Municipal Government, in order to regulate the operating hours of restaurants and dance halls, has issued a notice stating: For the matter of the notice, at this time of national revival and construction, it is the time for the people of the country to endure hardship. The Central Government is promoting the New National Movement to inspire a decline in bad customs and to establish the foundation for honesty and integrity. All our citizens should deeply restrain themselves and forge ahead. However, Shanghai is known for its extravagant eating and drinking, and extravagance and indulgence have become commonplace. Now that the concessions have been abolished, the blemishes should be thoroughly cleaned. Starting from September 1st, all restaurants are only allowed to sell alcohol from 5:00 PM to 11:00 PM every day. Dance halls must not be open past 12:00 midnight. Afternoon tea dances are limited to Saturdays, Sundays, and other national holidays. Other than these times, they are strictly prohibited and must not be exceeded. It is hoped that all citizens will conduct a thorough self-examination in order to gradually develop a sense of frugality and establish the foundation of civic virtue. Those who deliberately violate the rules, whether restaurant owners or banquet hosts, will be punished without leniency. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee to assist in publicity and ordering the First, Second, and Third Police Bureaus to instruct all restaurants and dance halls to comply, this notice is hereby issued for widespread knowledge.

North China Journalist Delegation Left Shanghai for Hangzhou Yesterday
Visited the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank Before Departure
Talked with Consultant Kimura About Shanghai's Economy

Shanghai Central News Agency: On the third day of the North China Journalist Delegation's visit to Shanghai, they continued to visit the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank and the Shenxin Textile Factory, accompanied by personnel from the Municipal Propaganda Department. Details are as follows:

Visiting the Central Reserve Bank Branch

At 9:00 AM, the entire delegation went to visit the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. Zhang Jusheng, Deputy Manager of the branch, Wang Liqing, Assistant Manager, and Pan Tongyun, Section Chief of the Investigation Department, greeted them and guided them to visit the various departments of the bank. They introduced them to the bank's economic advisor, Mr. Kimura. During the tea party, Advisor Kimura expressed his thoughts on the financial situation centered on Shanghai and talked freely for more than an hour before they departed. At 10:30 AM, the journalist delegation went to visit the No. 9 Factory of Shenxin Textile Factory on Macau Road, Tokyo Road. Wu Shihui, Chief Engineer of the factory, _ Li Wu Zhongyi, and Guo Zuyi greeted them and invited them to sit down. Wu Shihui delivered a speech, expressing his welcome and informing them of the factory's brief history and everything inside. They were then guided to visit the factory, dormitory, hospital, Shen Jiu Cooperative, and Shuangma _ Club for more than an hour before the visit ended. It is also learned that the journalist delegation went to Hangzhou at 3:00 PM yesterday and will return to Shanghai at 9:00 PM today. It was originally scheduled to return to the north on the morning of the 2nd. However, in order to facilitate the members' free browsing, they were persuaded to stay one more day to show the hospitality of the hosts. It is reported that Zhou, the President of the Central Reserve Bank, has scheduled a banquet for the delegation at 6:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. It is also heard that the Shenxin authorities are very happy about the delegation's visit to the south and will also _ the delegation to stay in Shanghai and will hold a tea party at the Xindu Restaurant at 5:00 PM on the afternoon of the 2nd. In addition, during the delegation's visit to Hangzhou, the Propaganda Department has set up a temporary _ contact office at No. 223, Xinyuan Hotel, and has sent personnel from the department to reside in the office to facilitate contact from all walks of life.

Advisor Kimura's Speech

Advisor Kimura of the Central Reserve Bank gave the following speech at the tea party to welcome the North China Journalist Delegation: Gentlemen, since its establishment the year before last, our bank has issued reserve notes, which are the only currency in Central and Southern China. Since its issuance, it has been very well circulated, and the number _ has also been increasing day by day. Recently, the _ has risen sharply, increasing day by day. The outside world believes that this is due to the increase in the amount of currency _ issued. But the reality is not so. Judging from the current ratio of prices, the amount of currency issued is still insufficient. To give an example, the silver market has been extremely tight recently, and general commercial banks have felt the lack of funds, and the interest rate has even reached two points. This is because the market has a need for currency issuance. Shanghai is a large commercial port. Before the war, all kinds of materials could be imported from abroad. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the import of foreign materials was suddenly cut off, and the lack of materials in Shanghai became more and more serious. At this time, the general public absorbed and hoarded a large amount of materials, which is one of the major reasons for the current shortage of materials in the market. In fact, although the source of materials in Shanghai has been cut off, there is still a large inventory of materials. Among the commodities in the country, cotton cloth and cotton yarn are the largest. Therefore, the authorities should purchase them in order to lower prices and stabilize people's livelihood. In the future, how to allocate the purchased cotton yarn and cotton cloth evenly, and the problem of lowering prices and other related difficulties exist. If these difficulties can be resolved, it will not be difficult to stabilize people's livelihood. Currently, all countries in the world are experiencing economic difficulties and are implementing controlled economies. China is no exception. As you all know, controlled economy is not successful without two supports: _ There must be a strong political force as its background, _ The general public needs to fully understand the controlled economy. Although China has political power, the general public has a weak concept. So it is very difficult in China. However, from my personal observation, China's civil autonomous organizations are very strong. It is very easy to implement controlled economy by using civil autonomous power. Looking around at the autonomous power of a country, there are very few countries as strong as China. Now that China has such strong autonomous power, then the general guiding class and government leaders _ can use this power to implement controlled economy. The so-called guiding class does not only refer to general government officials. You are the guiding class of public opinion in North China. I hope you can assist politics and implement controlled politics.

Economic Circles
Comment on the Unification of Control

The National Commercial Control _ Association is fully responsible for all matters related to the controlled purchase and distribution of yarn and cloth, and is also fully responsible for all matters related to the controlled purchase and distribution of grain. The former is related to the people's clothing, and the latter is related to the people's food. Therefore, whether managing yarn and cloth or managing grain, the greatest mission and responsibility is to wholeheartedly meet the needs of the people's livelihood in wartime. Therefore, we cannot help but say more about purchase and distribution.

Purchase and distribution are the two main tools for promoting a controlled economy. They must be complementary and work together to achieve the goal of stabilizing people's livelihood. Otherwise, it is impossible. Originally, to take must be to give. What is taken from the people must be used for the people. Only then can the people be sincerely convinced. Otherwise, it is impossible.

The most important thing for people's livelihood is clothing and food. Now, the full power of purchase and distribution of clothing and food is concentrated in one institution. It can be said that the control is unified. What we hope for after the unification of control is that we must do our best to ensure that these two things that people cannot live without - clothing and food - are not in short supply. And the way to ensure this is to distribute them universally. Of course, if we talk about distribution without first talking about purchase, then even if we talk about distribution, we will suffer from not being able to say something substantial. However, if we talk about purchase without considering distribution at the same time, then even if we talk about purchase, we are afraid that we cannot say something reasonable. Therefore, purchase and distribution must be complementary.

All Industries Sell Goods
Limited to Sales to Legitimate Users
Industry Associations Issue Notices for Compliance

The city's industry associations have successively completed their reorganization. However, in order to assist the authorities in stabilizing the commercial market and ensuring that various daily necessities are available in the market for a long time, and to prevent shortages, meetings have been convened separately to discuss effective methods. It has been decided that all members of the industry associations must only sell any goods sold in retail outlets on a daily basis to legitimate users and must not sell them to retailers at high prices. When purchasing goods, they should be asked to present their citizen certificate. The industry associations have now notified all members to comply.

Transactions Must Be Documented

According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, all companies, firms, or manufacturers must limit the sale or addition of any goods of any nature to companies or firms in their respective industries. At the same time, after the goods are delivered, both the buyer and seller must issue a sales receipt. In addition to each party holding a copy, another copy must be sent to the Municipal Market Management Committee or the respective industry association for record and future verification. Failure to comply with this procedure will be considered an illegal transaction, and any disputes that arise in the future will not be mediated.

Brokers Prohibited from Entering the Market

As for various goods previously transacted through brokers who took commissions from them, these people often deliberately fabricate rights and wrongs when people are uneasy, in order to gain outside profits, which is very harmful to commodity prices. It is now learned that the persons in charge of each industry association believe that the brokerage system must be temporarily prohibited. Notices have been posted separately to prohibit brokers from entering the market without permission. If any traces of those who are active in the market are found, they will be expelled from the market. If any member entrusts them to sell spot goods, they will also be subject to appropriate fines.

Cotton Industry Association to Purchase New Cotton

The new cotton from various producing areas in the Central China region is about to enter the market, and the Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Cotton Industry Association are currently preparing a comprehensive purchase plan. As for the cotton merchants' purchase funds, they may follow the precedent of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee and have the Central Reserve Bank release them by rediscounting bills. It is learned that if the cotton production plan for the current year can be fully implemented, the number is expected to be

Four Million Bales

The cotton field of 7200 acres is directly under the Central China Cotton Production Improvement Association, and 18,500 acres are lent to designated farmers, while another 100,000 acres are open to general farmers based on special regulations. In addition, the _ cultivated cotton fields _ in the six provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Hunan, and Hubei

A total of 15,356,000 acres are hooked to maintain and distribute excellent seeds and improve technical irrigation work, in order to ensure that the amount of cotton production can reach 4 million bales this year. According to the _ fields cultivated in the six provinces, Jiangsu Province has 7,654,000 acres, Jiangxi Province has 222,000 acres, Zhejiang Province has 943,000 acres, Hunan Province has 542,000 acres, Hubei Province has 5,538,000 acres, and Anhui Province has 456,000 acres, which is about three times more than the production volume of last year.

Corn and Sorghum Can Be Purchased for 600,000 Bales

The estimated purchaseable amount of corn in various regions of Central China this year is estimated as follows: Chongming District, 50,000 to 10,000 bales, Qingpu District, 45,000 bales, Nanjing Zhenjiang District, 10,000 bales, Wuhu District, 150,000 bales, Anqing District, 100,000 bales. Tonghai District, 30,000 bales. The amount of sorghum is estimated as follows: Northern Anhui District, 50,000 bales, Yangzhou Taizhou, 50,000 bales. A total of 490,000 to 450,000 bales of corn and 100,000 bales of sorghum.

Reduced Household Rice
Hope the Grain Department Improves

Since the quantity of rice distributed in this cloth allocation has been reduced since July 1, it has had a serious impact on the people's minds and commodity prices, forming a major economic problem. The Chinese and Japanese parties sincerely hope that it can be resolved quickly. However, from the 29th of August to the 5th of September, the amount of household rice in the 45th issue was changed again from one liter per issue to half a liter. In order to solve the problem of people's livelihood and commodity prices, it is necessary to implement emergency countermeasures. Today's reduction is the most recent since the implementation of the distribution. At this time of year when the old and new crops are not connected, all parties are concerned and hope that the Grain Department will handle it well. All sectors of the Chinese side believe that the only way to establish a private organization is to engage in solving the food rice question. (Congressman Yunpeng, Mainland New Daily, August 31)

Reserve Fund Discount for Silver Shops
China Reserve Bank Revises Measures

The China Reserve Bank's deposits for silver shops as collateralized discount loans were originally intended to regulate the temporary positions of various banks and shops, and required the Silver Industry Association to issue a letter of certification to show caution. However, it has been found that recently, the bank shops have made this _ present and often applied for extensions repeatedly, and the winter connection has lost the meaning of the China Reserve's temporary relief. It has recently been stipulated by the China Reserve Bank that those who make this discount for the second time should apply seven days after the first discount expires, and the third time should apply half a month after the second discount expires, and the fourth time should be at least one month after the third discount expires, in order to show restrictions. In addition, it has been found that the deposit reserve guarantee discount should be limited to those who pay cash in full. In the future, when the Silver Industry Association issues this certificate of certification, it must comply with the above regulations.

Reaching Public Opinion
Citizens of Shanghai Provide Opinions on Construction
Opinions on Improving the New Shanghai Municipal Administration by Yao Shaosheng

Special Collection 1

Since _ the recovery of the concessions in Shanghai, the government should show a spirit of "starting anew with the people" everywhere. Taking advantage of the opportunity of the China Daily soliciting citizens' _ Shanghai municipal _ implementation opinions, I am writing down the _ points that I feel, hoping for guidance from the authorities and citizens.

Food Supply

"Food is the most important thing for the people." This is already a "divinely ordained" saying. In the past, the distribution and procurement of household rice were the responsibility of the Allied Forces Command. The handling was quite satisfactory. However, once it was transferred to our official hands, the procurement seemed to be quite slow. Therefore, the distribution of household rice in each issue also seemed to be slow. Also, due to the limited quantity purchased, the distribution quantity of household rice is also being reduced. At first, there was only one liter, and this issue there is only half a liter. In the past, two liters were not enough, so how could one liter be enough? Another point is that the price of household rice is also constantly being increased. Rice is the most important of all major commodities. Since the official price of rice has been increased, it will certainly result in rampant black market rice prices. Not only rice, but the impact has also led to price increases in other commodities. The government's move may be considered unavoidable by the government itself. How can they know that this move will produce many stable evils? This is definitely not what a wise authority should do. If the government authorities are determined to "suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihood," then please increase the quantity of household rice allocated as soon as possible. According to my observation, assuming that one liter of rice per person is sufficient for two days, it is best to allocate five liters every ten days. At the same time, reduce the selling price. If it can be effectively implemented, then prices will be suppressed naturally, and people's livelihood will be truly stable.

Donation Issues

In the past, during the Concession era, citizens had to pay many donations every month or at any time. Almost everything required donations, and the amount of donations was constantly increasing. This was really a harsh government that squeezed the fat of the Chinese people. Now that the concessions have been recovered, we should relieve our Chinese compatriots of this heavy shackle. I believe that the government authorities should quickly readjust the various taxes levied during the Concession era by foreigners. Which should be paid, which should be abolished, and which should have the amount of donations reduced. I believe that the "loss tax" should be distinguished, and not _ everything should be taxed. All daily necessities, such as cooking oil, sugar, _ soy sauce, soap, matches... etc., should all be canceled. On the other hand, things that are not necessities, such as cigarettes, alcohol, and cosmetics, should still be taxed. Entertainment such as movies, Peking Opera, and dancing can increase the amount of donations, on the one hand, it can also restrict unnecessary consumption by the people.

Police Affairs

I think the purpose of using police in local areas is to maintain law and order so that people can live and work in peace and contentment. For the attendance of police officers, their degree of maintaining law and order should be used as the standard. After the recovery of the concessions, this situation should be considered under the reform of police affairs.

Public Health

In the past, during the administrative era of foreign rule in the concessions, although there were many malpractices, there was one point that could not be buried. That is, they handled public health in the area quite seriously. Vaccinations, injections, and food inspections need not be said, but they also paid attention to the cleanliness of the roads. But

### President Roosevelt Returns to Washington; Hull Denies Anti-Soviet Stance

Lisbon, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Washington news, President Roosevelt returned to Washington yesterday morning and immediately convened military leaders and others regularly with White House Secretary O'Leary. A "post-Quebec Conference meeting" was held. Regarding the purpose of British Prime Minister Churchill's upcoming visit to Washington, there has been no official announcement, but it is believed that his discussions with President Roosevelt and others will focus on wartime and post-war political issues, and may also determine the details of the policies established at the Quebec Conference. A British spokesman in Quebec announced yesterday that Churchill's broadcast today will not contain any special announcements. At the same time, Canadian Prime Minister King traveled from Ottawa to Quebec yesterday afternoon to confer with Churchill.

Lisbon, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: According to Washington news, U.S. Secretary of State Hull yesterday denied at a reception for the press allegations by New York commentator Bellson that he and other senior State Department officials were anti-Soviet and hoped for a large-scale Soviet bloodshed. He said, "I usually do not pay attention to attacks on the State Department or on me personally, but if this attack concerns our relationship with our allies, then I must pay attention to it."

### British Troops Unsuccessfully Land on the Southern Coast of Italy; Quickly Repelled by Garrison

Berlin, August 31st, Central News Agency dispatch: It was announced here today that the British army's attempt to land on a small scale southeast of Reggio on the southern coast of Italy a few days ago was quickly repelled by the garrison. Only 400 British troops were involved, who sailed to the southeast of Reggio and landed there.

### Residents Eagerly Await Household Sugar and Oil

Residents have been looking forward to the implementation and distribution of the fifth phase of household oil and the sixth phase of household sugar for a long time. However, although the sugar industry has already completed the delivery, and the oil is also being prepared for delivery, the date of sale has not yet been clearly determined. It is understood that sugar and oil are essential daily foods. The authorities' order to implement a per capita distribution method is purely to alleviate the people's difficulties, and should not be delayed, let alone change prices.

### Establishment of a Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office Assessment Committee

Divided into Three Groups: Cotton Yarn, Grey Cloth, and Processed Cotton Cloth

The National Commercial Control General Association's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, in accordance with the provisions of Article 5 of the Organizational Outline, has appointed textile technology experts and experienced yarn and cloth merchants as members to form the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Quality and Price Assessment Committee, which held its first inaugural meeting yesterday (31st) at 4 p.m.

Assessment Committee Members

The following assessment committee members attended: Bu Boxun, Ying Yuanzai, Xu Xiuxiao, Gong Dingluo, Ping Linbo, Zheng Weizhang, Mi Wenjun, Zhou Rongsun, Wu Shihhuai, Fang Weiping, Chen Shouyi, Zou Lin, Yang Yuelin, Guo Zhongkang, Wu Xinqi, Wu Mingyong, Tao Shanzhong, Ling Jianxin, and 18 others. Absent was committee member Qin Defang. The meeting was led by the head of the office, Nie Lusheng, and the deputy head, Cao Boquan. First, the chairman of the committee, Nie Lusheng, head of the office, reported on the preparation process, and then the proposed resolutions were discussed. Regarding the review and approval of the price standards for purchasing yarn and cloth and the increase or decrease in purchasing prices, it was resolved to divide into three groups: cotton yarn group, grey cotton cloth group, and processed cotton cloth group, which will hold separate group meetings to assess quality and price.

Minister Okazaki Stated That Evasion of Purchases is Strictly Prohibited

(Central News Agency) Minister Okazaki, Director-General of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, made important remarks on the issue of cotton yarn and cloth purchases by the Chinese and Japanese authorities at a reception for Chinese reporters yesterday. Minister Okazaki first stated that the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth, under the joint promotion of the Chinese and Japanese authorities, has achieved good results. However, some merchants disregard the law and secretly transport goods to various places through transportation companies in order to avoid the purchasing authorities. Once this illegal situation is discovered, not only will they be severely punished, but the authorities can expand the scope of purchases to areas where yarn and cloth can escape. Therefore, even if merchants can transport yarn and cloth out of Shanghai, they will still be purchased by the authorities in other places. In addition, some cotton cloth shops have been cutting and selling cloth in pieces in recent days, and the authorities will strictly investigate this. As for the distribution of yarn and cloth in the future, the authorities have decided to distribute as much as possible to various parts of Central China. Therefore, some people are concerned about whether this yarn and cloth will flow into the interior. Minister Okazaki said that this is not so important, because the purpose of the Chinese and Japanese authorities' purchase of yarn and cloth is to promote the exchange of materials and stabilize currency, in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods. Therefore, even if some of it flows into the interior, it can also benefit the people there and stabilize their lives, so there is no need for special concern.

Commissioner Honda Talks About Purchase Not Being Postponed

(Central News Agency) Commercial Control Association Commissioner Honda Daisaku gave a speech: Regarding the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth as a national policy, it is decided that the deadline is September 6th, and it will not be postponed. Those who wait and see and mislead themselves within the deadline will not only have their goods confiscated, but will also be punished for violating national laws. From September 1st to 6th, deliveries to Lao Bi will be very enthusiastic, so it is decided to have normal office hours on Sunday the 5th. Regarding the speculative retailers in the market recently who are calling for large price reductions, this is a complete violation of national policy. The Commercial Control Association recently summoned such illegal shop owners and warned them not to take advantage of loopholes. If the amount of cotton yarn and cloth sold in August exceeds the average amount from January to August of the 32nd year, they will be severely punished. Allied cotton yarn and cloth businesses are handing over all cotton yarn and cloth to the office. I hope that our country's merchants will handle it as soon as possible and do not mislead themselves. Citizens should not blindly purchase unnecessary amounts of cotton cloth, because after the government purchases and distributes it, the price will definitely be lower than the selling price of other retailers.

### Municipal Primary and Secondary Schools Officially Start Classes Today
