### On Love

— Yoshida Tosuke

Japan, although it has already concluded an alliance treaty with China, declaring "equality for the Chinese people," the majority of Chinese intellectuals still do not genuinely and wholeheartedly want to "fight together" with Japan. What is the reason for this? - A "China expert" once angrily asked me this question. "True scholars want to read books that point to the truth of things; while vulgar scholars only want to read books that record things as they hope they are (Gu Hongming, The Spirit of the Chinese Civilization, page 111)," this "China expert" does not observe the genuine feelings of Chinese intellectuals towards Japan, but only reads reports that "record things as they hope they are," hence such a question. The feelings of Chinese intellectuals towards Japan are definitely not as simple as this "China expert" imagines. Although the United Kingdom and the United States are loudly trumpeting and including Chongqing among the "world's four major powers," Chinese intellectuals are very clear about how Chinese expatriates in the United States are enduring racial discrimination. Frankly speaking, the Anglo-Americans' sense of racial superiority is deeply rooted and has a long history. It is Japan that has broken this and raised the profile of Asian nations. Chinese intellectuals have not forgotten this; therefore, if they knew that Japan was truly "treating the Chinese people equally," they would always be happy to fight together with Japan. However, Chinese intellectuals will never immediately become arrogant simply because Japan has announced the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, believing that China has already stood on an equal footing with Japan.

A Chinese intellectual once said to me at a symposium: "Japan has vowed to 'live and die together' with China. However, the related amount between Japanese 'rationed rice' and Chinese 'household rice' is more than two-thirds. In that case, even if the Chinese are willing to die together with the Japanese, it is impossible. Two-thirds of the Chinese people will definitely die before the Japanese." Another Chinese intellectual said to me: "Japan promises to 'share weal and woe' with China, but traveling by train from the North Shanghai Railway Station to Nanjing, there is absolutely no talk of Japanese and Chinese 'sharing weal and woe.'" Yet another said: "Look at Shanghai's roads. When Chinese people transport coal briquettes by car, they have to go through countless inspections on the way, but if they walk with Japanese people, they can pass without hindrance." "In short, Chinese people in the Peace Zone always have a sense of politeness towards the Japanese. However, the Japanese are not polite to the Chinese, the masters of the land, as if the Chinese are living abroad. Therefore, no matter how beautifully China is described as 'independent and autonomous,' isn't the difference between name and reality very far?" This was said by the last person.

What they say are all very small things, but they are all things that Chinese intellectuals care about most, there is no need to doubt that! There are many Japanese people who completely ignore these kinds of facts and only stick "sharing weal and woe" and "living and dying together" slogans on the walls of streets and alleys, thinking that this is the completion of "Asia Development Work." However, the real "Asia Development Work" is first of all to make the Chinese people sincerely convinced on the small issues mentioned above, and to make the Chinese people fully realize, in actual life, and feel that "independence and autonomy" are consistent with reality. When there is a feeling of genuine "sharing weal and woe" in "sharing weal and woe," when there is a feeling of equality in "equality" that is consistent with reality, and when there is a feeling of independence and autonomy in "independence and autonomy" that is consistent with reality, then China can assist Japan with a truly 'live and die together' spirit.

### Japanese General Headquarters Announced Yesterday: Battle Situation on New Britain Island: 58 Enemy Aircraft Attacking Rabaul Destroyed

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4 PM on the 25th: The Imperial Navy Air Force bombed enemy strongholds at Cape Gloucester and Pilelo Island on New Britain Island before dawn on December 24th, causing one major explosion and four major fires. On the morning of December 24th, the Imperial Navy Air Force intercepted 135 enemy aircraft attacking Rabaul, shooting down 58 of them, including 5 unconfirmed. 6 of our aircraft did not return to base.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the American forces landed at Cape Gloucester, southwest of New Britain Island, they have been trying to establish a strong bridgehead in that area to maintain their supply operations. At the same time, they have intensified air raids on Rabaul. From the 15th to the 23rd, they sent more than 210 aircraft to attack, but they were intercepted by the Japanese army, which shot down 51 of them. In total, from the 15th to the 23rd, there were more than 210 enemy aircraft attacks, an average of more than 20 aircraft per day. In the past, the enemy air force used to attack with 100 aircraft, but recently, since the enemy has built bases near the main battle lines of the Japanese army in the south, the number of enemy aircraft attacks has visibly decreased. What is particularly noteworthy is the complexity of the types of enemy aircraft. For example, most of the enemy aircraft that attacked on the 23rd were carrier-based aircraft. This is also due to the development of the strategic deployment of enemy bases close to the military strongholds of the Japanese army, but the fundamental reason is that the enemy aircraft carrier fleet suffered military setbacks in the sea and air battles in the Solomon Sea area and the central Pacific Ocean area. Since then, they have tried their best to avoid sending aircraft carriers out to attack. Currently, the enemy forces are using Goodenough, the Trobriand Islands, and Woodlark Island as the center at the eastern end of New Guinea and launching attacks on New Britain from Bougainville Island and Torokina. However, that area is under the control of the Japanese air force, and enemy attacks only increase their consumption.

### In Order to Realize the Great Enterprise of Revitalizing Asia, The Sino-Japanese Association is Established in Tokyo, With Konoe as President, to be Established in January Next Year

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) - Former Japanese Prime Minister Prince Fumimaro Konoe recently published an article in the December 20th issue of the East Asia Common Culture Association's organ newspaper (China Monthly) entitled "On the Greater East Asia Declaration," elaborating on his views, saying that we should strive to understand the essence of the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance, and at the same time hope to launch a major movement to make this spirit of Asia permeate the 1 billion people of Greater East Asia. Now, in order to promote mutual understanding between China and Japan and realize the great enterprise of permeating the spirit of Asia throughout East Asia, Prince Konoe has decided to establish the "Sino-Japanese Association" and dedicate himself to the new movement. It is heard that the association will be established in late January next year, with the aim of realizing the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance in spirit and sharing the mission of Asia. Therefore, the governments of China and Japan have decided to actively support it. The Chinese side will also participate in the association at that time. It is heard that the post of President will be held by Prince Konoe, and Generals Nobuyuki Abe and Sadao Araki, Ryutaro Azai and other famous figures from the government and the public will be recruited to participate, so its lineup is extremely strong. The association is a corporate organization. In addition to receiving support from the governments of China and Japan, it will also receive donations of approximately 10 million yuan from Chinese and Japanese patriots. It has now been decided to use a certain person's mansion in Tokyo and the Meguro Gajoen as the headquarters and guesthouse of the Sino-Japanese Association to carry out activities.

### The Greater East Asia Literary Conference Will Be Held in China Next Year, and the Writers Association is Actively Preparing

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - Since the publication of the outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy, the issue of wartime cultural construction in our country has gradually attracted attention from all parties. It is now learned that relevant people in the literary field are rapidly preparing to organize a literary writers association (provisional name). The Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference has been scheduled to be held in our country next year, so literary writers from all parts of China, both north and south, intend to organize a group and establish a national association. In Beiping, Shen Qiwu of the Peking University Department of Literature, Liu Longguang of the North China Writers Association, etc., have had discussions. Jiang Yifang of the Xinmin Bookstore also participated and decided to abolish the existing organization and prepare to be a branch of the future writers association. The above three people have been recommended as drafting committee members to start drafting the association's draft. In Shanghai, a meeting was held in the middle of this month by Zhou Huarren, Ju Yueran, Tao Jingsun, Lu Feng, Qiu Shimu, and Liu Yusheng to discuss the matter. Masao Kume, Director of the Secretariat of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association, and Chiji Abe and Shimpei Kusano also attended. As a result of the consultation, it was decided to write to various parties within the year to initiate and convene a meeting in Nanjing to review the association's draft proposed by the North China side, and after deciding on the regulations, a general assembly will be held next year. The Propaganda Department of the National Government believes that this matter will greatly assist in the promotion of the outline of wartime cultural propaganda policy, so it has decided to provide maximum assistance. It is also heard that after the association is established, branches will be established in major cities such as Nanjing, Shanghai, Beiping, Hankou, and Guangzhou. It has not yet been decided whether the secretariat will be located in Nanjing or Shanghai. However, committee members will be elected by each branch to form a committee. The matters decided by this committee will be handed over to the secretariat for processing.

Shimpei Kusano's Remarks

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) - The Third Greater East Asia Literary Conference has been decided to be held in our country next year, and literary writers from all parts of our country, both north and south, intend to organize literary groups and establish national associations. In order to understand the work situation of the Japan Literary Patriotic Association and its opinions on our country's organization of literary groups, the reporter interviewed Allied Japanese poet Shimpei Kusano, who gave a speech, the gist of which was: "At the time of the Sino-Japanese Incident, although there were many literary groups in Japan, there was no organization that unified the literary national body at that time. It was not until the Greater East Asia War broke out that the various literary groups were dissolved and the 'Japan Literary Patriotic Association' was reorganized, with approximately 5,000 members. Although the association is a civilian organization, the Cabinet Intelligence Bureau, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Military Press Department, and the Greater East Asia Ministry and other government agencies are all supporting the association. Therefore, the association has made great contributions to the Greater East Asia War with the assistance of various agencies. Looking back at Chinese literature, although it was very active before the incident, there was no center, and its promotion of national self-awareness was only an anti-Japanese idea. At this time when the ideal of Greater East Asia is being built, it is necessary for Chinese literary groups to unite and organize a unified literary national body and actively promote it. Moreover, China and Japan are the center of the construction of the new culture of Greater East Asia, which is what we deeply hope for. After the Chinese Writers Association is established, it should have close contact with the Japan Literary Patriotic Association. Therefore, we have great hopes and expectations for the development of the new culture of Greater East Asia. We believe that the beginning of this new literary concept should start with China and Japan, and the activities of the new world literature should be guided by China and Japan." The reporter asked again about his feelings about the new literature of China and Japan. He said that China has no real new literary ideas. Before the incident, there were chaotic ideas such as Proletarian literature and Marxist communism. After the incident, there was a lack of firm peace ideas. It was not until after the three stages of participating in the Greater East Asia War and receiving the concessions that they had a deep understanding of peace and promoted the idea of new literature. China and Japan have followed the same path of new literary ideas in the past. After close contact in the future, the future of East Asian new literature has great hope.

### Shan State Under Burmese Rule, Bhamo Representative Urges the People to Hope for Mutual Understanding and Effort for the War

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese side abolished military administration in the Shan State, it was officially placed under the rule of Burma. The opening ceremony of the state office was grandly held in Taunggyi yesterday. The first Governor U Ba Yin and local natives all attended. From now on, the administration of the area will be under the jurisdiction of the Burmese government. The Bhamo representative also clarified the fundamental policies of the Burmese government on the civil affairs of the area as follows: The complete integration of Burma with the Shan State and Karenni. In order to achieve this goal, the cooperation of the two regions is required, so that mutual understanding between the residents of the two regions can be promoted, and efforts for the war can be boosted.

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that Burmese administration will soon be implemented in the Shan State, the Burmese national representative issued a letter to the local chiefs and residents on the 24th, the gist of which is as follows: The people of the Shan State and the Karenni region are originally related to the Burmese people by blood and are brothers. They were separated by the evil hands of the British. But today they have reunited again. From the perspective of history, it is clear that Burma and the Shan State and Karenni region belong to the same government under the same land and name. The former Burmese dynasty included the Shan State and other places. Now that Burma has gained glorious independence, we can reunite again. We hope that we will continue to do our best to develop. In order to adapt to this new era, we must unite to go forward. After we are united, on the one hand, we will jointly gain the honor of independence, and at the same time, we must strive to prove that we have fulfilled our due obligations. From now on, the people of the Shan State and Karenni are completely Burmese citizens. I, in the capacity of a Burmese national representative, based on justice, respectfully tell everyone that in the future, we will treat the people of the two regions fairly and equally.

### Second Anniversary of Japanese Occupation of Hong Kong

Hong Kong, 25th (Central News Agency) - Today is the second anniversary of the Japanese occupation of Hong Kong. Since Lieutenant General Rensuke Isogai took office as the first Governor of Hong Kong in February last year, he has been actively reorganizing the colony, sparing no effort, and it has been two years now. Since Hong Kong is not a material production area, the work of evacuating the population was first implemented. The pre-war population of 1.7 million has now been reduced to 800,000. The restoration of various industries has also been extremely rapid. This is the foundation for stabilizing people's livelihoods. More than 600 light industry companies have opened in Hong Kong, and general stores have also restored their pre-war prosperity. In addition, mechanical sailing ship shipyards are actively carrying out shipbuilding work, which has made a great contribution to maritime transportation.

### Eve of Christmas, Fierce Fighting Still on the Eastern Front, Soviet Forces Increase Pressure South of Nevel

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports, military news: In the Vitesk war zone on the Eastern Front, German troops engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles against the invading and powerful enemy forces throughout Christmas Eve. No less than 44 enemy tanks were destroyed. Soviet troops southeast of Kholoston also launched a fierce offensive yesterday, but were repelled by German troops. German troops northwest of Richtse once again drove back several troops eastward, thus occupying several positions and gaining important expansion. There was fierce fighting northeast of Shropping. The Soviet offensive southwest of Nevel was repelled. There were no major battles on the north and south routes.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - Maritime News Agency reports: The battle south of Nevel is the second phase of the war in December. Soviet troops attacked in three routes. Those from the east had at least six infantry divisions and three tank brigades, those from the north had three infantry divisions and tanks, and those from the west had at least five infantry divisions, also carrying a large number of tanks. The battle was carried out in dense forests and swamps, and the difficulty is imaginable. When the German troops abandoned the second line of defense, the artillery had to be reorganized, and the Soviet troops planned to join the two armies advancing northwest to cut off the German troops, and the situation became increasingly critical. The Soviet troops' plan was to cut off the road line, where the backbone of the German defense line was located. Fortunately, the superior strategy of the German command established an isolation line, allowing the isolated German troops to reunite with the main force, and the strength was preserved.

### Roman Pope's Christmas Broadcast

Rome, 25th (Central News Agency) - Pope Pius XII of Rome broadcast to Catholics around the world on Christmas Eve, saying that the Church has made great efforts to alleviate human suffering. The war is now becoming more and more fierce, and I think many Catholics around the world must be repenting day and night. But no matter how hard the Church tries, it cannot stop this war. I hope that this year's Christmas can be the last Christmas in the war. The new peace is not dominated by the spirit of happiness, but must follow the laws of religion and thoroughly base itself on the spirit of social unity.

### German Troops Fire Rockets for the First Time Across the Strait of Dover

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency) - What kind of retaliatory measures the German army will take against the inhuman and indiscriminate bombing of the anti-Axis forces is attracting the most attention from various countries. The anti-Axis side is also particularly afraid of whether surprising new weapons will appear in the German army. It is said that German rockets were fired on the 23rd from the German artillery positions along the Dover Strait. Berlin news, German rocket teams engaged in artillery battles with the British long-range artillery on the night of the 23rd from Dover Strait.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency) - According to Maritime News Agency: A German convoy safely arrived at its destination under the joint attack of British long-range artillery, torpedo boats, and aircraft while passing through the Strait. In this battle, the British lost three torpedo boats, and it is still uncertain whether four other boats have been lost.

### Terrorist Air Raids on Berlin Cause Growing Resentment; Goebbels Claims Germany Will Prevail

Berlin, December 25th (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels, in his capacity as the Nazi Party's Berlin regional leader, delivered a Christmas message to the citizens at 9:00 PM on the 24th, stating: For weeks, the anti-Axis forces have repeatedly claimed to have inflicted significant blows on Berlin, but a look at the damage caused by the bombing reveals that their target is not to destroy Germany's military-industrial complex, but to disrupt the morale of the German people. They failed in cities like Hamburg, Essen, and Cologne, and thus shifted their target to Berlin, attempting to shake the morale of Berlin citizens. However, the British and American press have already acknowledged that the German people have not lost their will to fight due to the bombing, and their morale has only grown stronger. Therefore, I dare say that even if the anti-Axis forces intensify their threatening bombings of the German people, the citizens of Berlin will continue to prevail. On this joyous Christmas season, I offer these words as a tribute to the courageous citizens.

### Turkey Convenes Emergency Cabinet Meeting

### "Dangerous" Teams Discovered on the Adriatic Coast; Fierce Fighting for Ortona

Southern Italian Front, December 25th (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report, the anti-Axis forces have recently been sending paratroopers behind German lines on the Adriatic coast at night, and also using submarines to land troops at night. Their motive is to seek out and rescue British and American prisoners of war who were captured after September 9th and then escaped. The Germans call these paratroopers or soldiers "dangerous teams." They carry large amounts of Italian currency, up to 100,000 lire, as well as the latest telephones and wireless telegraphs.

Lisbon, December 25th (Central News Agency) - The British Eighth Army is currently engaged in combat in the eastern region of the Bescara front in the south, attempting to occupy the key point of Ortona south of Bescara. Fierce fighting is taking place along the fifteen-mile line from Ortona to Orsogna.

The German army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with Canadian troops. The American Fifth Army is currently engaged in fierce fighting with the German army outside San Pietro in the western region, with no progress. In addition, anti-Axis air units have repeatedly attacked German rear areas and northern Italy, and it is reported that they also attacked Ibelia, Pienti, Micria, Altona, and other places on the 23rd.

American Troops Linger on the Road to Rome

Lisbon, December 25th (Central News Agency) - The anti-Axis forces previously claimed that they would attack Rome before Christmas, but to this day, the anti-Axis forces are still lingering on a line 60 to 100 miles from Rome, making no progress. A special correspondent from the American International Broadcasting Association broadcast on the 24th that the anti-Axis forces still face unlimited difficulties in their war prospects since the Battle of Naples. It is said that there are still many German positions blocking the advance to Rome, and even if Cassino is captured, it does not open a direct road to Rome, because the road from Cassino to Rome is narrow, and the German army is constantly improving its positions. Therefore, if the anti-Axis forces want to attack Rome, the British and American armies must make greater sacrifices.

### The Two-Year Development of Manchukuo

Amidst the glorious and brilliant war results, Japan is strategically establishing an absolutely invincible, ever-victorious position. To echo this, Manchukuo safeguards the tranquility of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, striving to establish a self-sufficient food supply system between Japan and Manchuria under the supreme command of enhancing war capabilities. At the end of October, Director-General Takebe visited Japan and discussed matters, resulting in the formation of an emergency farmland creation project under close cooperation between Japan and Manchuria. The completed projects independently undertaken by Manchukuo before this, as well as new projects jointly operated by Japan and Manchuria, are also being rapidly implemented. Therefore, in less than two or three years, the food self-sufficiency of Japan, Korea, Manchuria, and North China has been well-established.

That is to say, the first four-year plan for farmland creation in Manchuria has been underway since the year before last. Flood control development in Yinma River, Chalu Kou (Jilin Province), Heitai (Dong'an Province), Suihua (Bei'an Province), Dui Li (Sanjiang Province), Panshan, Xinlitun (Jinzhou Province), Binjiang, and other areas has achieved substantial results, and efforts are being made to promote future achievements within two years. On the other hand, the areas that are gradually being concretely implemented according to the newly established plan are the approximately 20-kilometer-long coastal area centered on Fuyu Street, Jilin Province, on the Second Songhua River, as well as the area near Didabangzi, Lishu County, Siping Province, and the already underway areas. Thus, the new development of cultivated land has been completely successful.

In the Second Songhua River area, half of the total area will be put into production according to plan in the year after next, and all of it will be put into production by 1946. This is where the currently enforced key projects are located. The Land Reclamation and Grain Bureau and the Manchukuo Land Development Company have already selected the locations for the main waterways and conducted other on-site surveys. Parallel to this, they are actively preparing to secure materials, construction, and motive power in preparation for starting construction next year.

The characteristic of this Second Songhua River shoreline rice paddy creation is that, due to the terrain, it is planned to use dedicated pumping irrigation. Therefore, the banks of the Second Songhua River in Fuyu Street are equipped with large pumping machines with a diameter of 0.0 meters, arranged like fortresses attacking the United States and Britain, which can truly be said to be a magnificent sight.

In addition, from Dongyuan River to Didabangzi, under the guidance of the Ministry of Communications and the Reclamation General Bureau, and according to the principle of water flow adjustment, water conservancy is controlled, so that the vast fertile fields in the middle reaches of the Dongliao River will no longer suffer from floods. The wetland area of Yarge on the lower riverbank will be improved and made into rice paddies. From the end of November this year, an additional budget of 860,000 yuan was added for this year's project. There have always been various difficulties in terms of materials and technology for these projects, but thanks to the mutual assistance between Japan and Manchuria this time, the pumping machines, electric motors, and other machinery that are key to solving the projects have been given priority allocation. Even technical assistance from Japanese land development organizations can be expected.

Talk by the Minister of Greater East Asia

The Imperial Government's fundamental policy of cooperating with and assisting Manchukuo's emergency farmland creation plan was formally decided at the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, as announced by the Information Bureau.

In addition, not only is it relying solely on Japan for important materials, but it is also planning to increase domestic production and divert idle materials. At the same time, the labor force needed here also reaped great achievements and won praise this summer. Centered on the Manchukuo Labor Service Corps, it forcibly mobilized local labor.

Along with the progress of this great project, the advance of land reclamation also begins to work without wasting time. It hopes to colonize Manchuria with the population of mainland Japan, use the Labor Service Corps, and actively cooperate with Korean immigrants or Manchurian farmers to connect with reclamation work and seek a vigorous increase in production. The Manchukuo government and the public are concentrating their efforts to increase food production and devote themselves to supplying Japan's war effort, for which I am deeply grateful. In terms of the current food supply and demand relationship, Manchukuo's mission as a food supply base is becoming increasingly important, and there are great expectations for the future leap in food production in Manchukuo. In order to actively adapt to this demand, the Manchukuo government should not only thoroughly strengthen the various policies it has been pursuing in the past, but also establish effective counter-measures for increasing production and epoch-making farmland creation plans. In order to complete the mutual cooperation between Japan and Manchuria, Director-General Takebe and others have recently visited the capital to request instructions, and the government immediately reviewed the situation based on the local conditions with the relevant authorities. Due to the consensus of opinion, it was finally seconded at the Cabinet meeting on the 22nd, and the basic policy for cooperating and assisting this plan was decided.

This emergency farmland creation plan will start next year and be completed in 1945. In just two short years, it will not only create new rice paddies in the Second Songhua River area and the Dongyuan River area, but also complete the implementation of the established creation plan areas. When that arrow of success is shot, its products can also be supplied to the Japanese nation, which will be of great help to the food needs of the Japanese people. However, in order to succeed, it is necessary to invest huge amounts of funds, cumulative labor force of tens of millions of people, and throw in a considerable amount of materials, machinery, and technology, just in terms of land creation. The Empire's attack on the government believes that the significance of this undertaking is great and the effect is powerful, so it is determined to actively participate and cooperate to complete the sufficiency of funds, materials, technology, and other aspects.

In order to carry out this matter, although it can be imagined that many difficulties will be encountered in the future, in order to accomplish this, it is necessary to strengthen the active cooperation between Japan and Manchuria, and to deeply hope for the understanding and cooperation of all parties concerned.

According to the implementation of this plan, the entire food needs problem of Japan and Manchuria can be solved satisfactorily, which is truly a fortunate event amidst misfortune in the decisive battle period. (Shi Yan returned from the Mainichi Shimbun on November 23, 1943)

### Fifteen Factories Designated to Manufacture Household Coal Briquettes; Officially Rationed with Tickets Starting on the 4th of Next Month

Regarding the rationing of coal briquettes, an essential fuel for residents of this city, the responsible authorities have been closely consulting and planning. It is now due to the urgent needs of the citizens, but various procedures have not been completed. Therefore, temporarily from tomorrow (December 27th) to January 3rd, residents can purchase one "jin" of coal briquettes from designated retailers with the No. 53 rice purchase certificate, priced at six "jiao" of Central Reserve Bank notes. This Shanghai News Agency reporter learned from the coal industry yesterday that the Economic Division of the First District Office convened a meeting with the responsible persons of various coal briquette factories the day before yesterday. According to the person in charge of the division, the current per capita rationing of coal briquettes is being carried out to meet the needs of the citizens.

Limited to 300 Tons Per Day

It is stipulated that within the First and Eighth Districts, with a population of 2.2 million, it is limited to 1,050 tons, averaging one "jin" per person, and 200 retailers have been designated to be responsible for issuing old coal briquettes, supplying 300 tons of coal briquettes to each distribution point (retailer) daily starting on the 26th. As for Zhabei, Hongkou, Nanshi, and other areas, it will be handled by the municipal government. It is stipulated that the total tonnage for this period is 500 tons, the amount that each person can purchase, and the date of sale will be announced by the municipal government. However, retailers who obtain the No. 53 rice purchase certificate, printed with the registered number of the certificate, must sell the stipulated amount of one "jin" of coal briquettes and must not deduct any amount.

Officially Starts on January 4th

As for the issuance next year, all purchases will be made with the official "Coal Briquette Purchase Certificate" from designated retailers. The amount that each person can purchase with the ticket has not been formally decided, and whether it will be three or four periods per month is also under study. The municipal authorities have designated fifteen large coal briquette factories such as Yi Taixing and Nanyang to be responsible for the manufacture of coal briquettes. Smaller factories will be merged into larger manufacturing plants for joint cooperation so that the production volume can be increased. However, the authorities will be responsible for allocating the raw materials needed by each factory to make the briquettes. The manufactured coal briquettes must contain 50% of legitimate raw material content.

North China Coal Briquettes Will Be Transported to Shanghai Soon

It is also learned that the Shanghai Coal Association, the authority responsible for allocating coal briquettes, has dispatched responsible personnel to negotiate procurement matters in order to increase the city's coal briquette reserves and resolve the fuel panic as soon as possible. An idea has already been conceived and a large amount has been collected, so it is hoped that the supply can be increased by one-third or more from this month. Therefore, the city's fuel supply is expected to improve starting next month.

### Rationed Cigarettes; Purchase with Empty Packs; Implemented on January 5th

The Central China Tobacco Rationing Association, in order to eliminate the black market for cigarettes and prevent speculation, has implemented a new system of graded rationing of cigarettes based on empty packs. The method is as follows: The sale of rationed cigarettes will be changed from unboxed to based on empty packs. Regardless of soft or hard packs, the purchase is limited to one pack per day. The price of rationed cigarettes is divided into nine levels: 10 yuan for the first level, 8 yuan for the second level, 6 yuan for the third level, 5 yuan for the fourth level, 4 yuan for the fifth level, 3 yuan for the sixth level, 2.5 yuan for the seventh level, 2 yuan for the eighth level, and 1.5 yuan for the ninth level. Smokers can exchange empty packs of the same level for rationed cigarettes of the same level. If small retailers have sold out the specified quantity of the same level of cigarettes for the day, they can exchange for a higher level of rationed cigarettes, but they cannot purchase higher-level cigarettes across levels. There are no restrictions on exchanging empty packs for lower-level cigarettes. Small retailers sell rationed cigarettes in packs. Empty packs of 10 cigarettes can be exchanged for 10 cigarettes, and empty packs of 20 cigarettes can be exchanged for 20 cigarettes.

Empty Packs for the 22nd Period Are Exempted

Empty packs for the 22nd period of rationed cigarettes are exempted so that smokers can collect them in advance for the next exchange. From the 23rd period onwards, cigarettes will be purchased with empty packs. Empty packs before the 22nd period will still be handled according to the old method. Small retailers must not take advantage of the situation or deceive. Small retailers should hand over the empty packs, separated into soft and hard packs, to their respective wholesalers for delivery to the rationing office according to the quantity of rations. The handling fees that each wholesaler and retailer should receive will still be issued as before. This method will be implemented from January 5th of next year. For the 22nd period of cigarettes, the payment has already been made and the goods have been picked up from the designated rationing office for sale over ten days.

### Rationing of Flour in the 23rd Period in the City; Rationing Will Be Implemented at the Beginning of the Month; Payment and Pickup Scheduled to Start on the 28th

Central News Agency - The Shanghai Flour Distribution Office, in order to meet the needs of the people's food and prevent malpractices, has decided to improve the flour rationing system so that every citizen can receive the amount of flour they are entitled to. Therefore, after the reorganization and establishment of the office, it immediately secretly drafted implementation measures for household rationing and special rationing and began to actively carry them out. It is learned that in addition to allocating household flour in the First and Eighth Districts to the District Offices as scheduled and distributing household flour according to the original method, the office has consulted with the Municipal Food Bureau regarding the household flour in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South District of Pudong. The rationing method has been improved, and all preparatory procedures have been completed. The household flour for the 23rd period in Nanshi, Hongkou, Zhabei, and the South District of Pudong will be rationed with tickets by the public rice shops in each district at the beginning of next month. The Distribution Office has issued a notice stipulating that all public rice shops must pay and collect the flour line orders from the factories for delivery starting on the 28th of this month.

### Collection and Delivery of Food Rations for the 29th Period in Hongkou to Take Place Soon

The Hongkou District's 29th period of per capita food rations, totaling 2,370 packages, has been notified by the Municipal Food Administration Bureau to the Joint Affairs Office of the District Office, and payment and delivery will be made soon.

### Yesterday's Farewell Tea Party for Four Groups: Secretary Iwai's Departure Marked by Enthusiastic Gathering

Mr. Eiichi Iwai, Secretary of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, is taking on a new role and will soon leave Shanghai to assume his new position in Guangdong. Four organizations, including the Shanghai Business and Industrial Association, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, the Shanghai News Association, and the National Diplomacy Promotion Association, held a tea party yesterday afternoon at 5 p.m. in the meeting hall of the Asia Development Building's Business and Industrial Association to bid him farewell.

Chinese attendees included Wen Lanting, Li Sihao, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Wu Hufan, Liu Haisu, Chen Shaojui, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Yuan Shu, Huang Jingzhai, Wang Changchun, Lin Jiong'an, Li Fang, Yan Jiabao, Hong Hanbin, Cheng Zhongquan, Zheng Hongyan, Xian Nanqun, Wang Haibo, Zhao Jinqing, Xu Changqing, Xu Jingfu, Yao Qingsan, Ren Yunpeng, Zhao Xuantang, Chen Bin, and others. Japanese attendees included President Takashima, Toyu Yoshida, Professor Kubota, Professor Suzu, Hado Hiroshi, Minoru Yatsuya, Toraji Kurimoto, and over a hundred others.

Mr. Iwai arrived at 5 p.m., shaking hands with each of the well-wishers before taking his seat for tea and refreshments.

First, Mr. Wen Lanting delivered a farewell speech:

"Today we are holding this tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Iwai as he takes up his new post in Guangdong. Although Mr. Iwai does not hold the highest rank in the Japanese Embassy, he has been studying at the Shanghai Tongwen College and serving at the Shanghai Consulate for many years. He is most familiar with the Chinese people's personality and general customs. Therefore, he has maintained very close friendships with people from all walks of life in China. As we part ways, we feel especially reluctant.

Mr. Iwai is meticulous in his official duties, but he also values friendship. He is very warm and affectionate towards his friends, but he never neglects his official duties. We are particularly reluctant to part with Mr. Iwai precisely because of these admirable qualities.

Therefore, we believe that interactions between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians should not only focus on official matters but also consider friendship. However, focusing solely on friendship and neglecting official matters is also insufficient. We sincerely hope that Mr. Iwai, although leaving us, will return to Shanghai in the near future. At the same time, we hope that Mr. Iwai's attitude of balancing official duties and friendship will always be integrated into the interactions between Chinese and Japanese officials and civilians. We wish Mr. Iwai a safe journey and a bright future."

Next, Secretary Iwai delivered a thank-you speech:

He briefly stated that he was very grateful for the warm farewell given by everyone upon his appointment to Guangdong. He was even more grateful for Mr. Wen Lanting's farewell speech. He never imagined that everyone would give him such a warm send-off. He spent one-third of his life, from his passionate student days to the most valuable years of his youth, in Shanghai. Shanghai can be said to be the center of Sino-Japanese friendship, and it can also be said that effective Sino-Japanese friendship can be achieved in Shanghai. Therefore, he wanted to work hard and strive in Shanghai. He had a belief that Shanghai could achieve the true goal of Sino-Japanese friendship. Therefore, for more than ten years until now, he has been working diligently in Shanghai every day. However, due to his limited talent and knowledge, he has not been able to achieve perfect results. However, he has high hopes and continues to work hard to achieve true friendship. Shanghai can be said to be his second hometown, or even his first hometown. He believes that after serving in Shanghai, Shanghai is the most important place for both China and Japan in terms of politics, economy, and culture. Working hard here and extending it to the whole country can achieve the true and peaceful goals of Sino-Japanese friendship. He did not expect to be given a farewell party here today. However, after receiving his orders, he carefully considered that national affairs are of utmost importance. He sacrificed his beliefs and went to Guangdong. However, the authorities understand his feelings, so he will be able to return soon. Therefore, he is very grateful for everyone's farewell today. In the near future, he will impolitely ask for everyone's welcome. Finally, he hopes that everyone can work hard in Shanghai. Everyone knows that Shanghai is now in a very difficult situation. For example, the transportation of miscellaneous grains is very difficult. To solve this problem, the government should be responsible. However, everyone present is powerful and authoritative, not only for Shanghai but also for the whole country and even for Sino-Japanese relations. They can effectively solve this problem and take responsibility. If they can work hard, they will surely be able to achieve the goal of solving various difficulties. He will be leaving for Guangdong soon and has not had time to say goodbye to everyone individually. He is very sorry and thanks everyone here, etc.

Following him, Mr. Zhang Yipeng delivered a farewell speech:

He said: As Mr. Iwai is about to leave Shanghai, all of us friends feel a deep sense of reluctance from the bottom of our hearts. It is not only because we often meet and chat, and feel lost once separated, but also because Mr. Iwai's treatment of people is kind and approachable. He does not give us a sense of being a foreigner. Even among brothers of the same country, there is rarely such love and sincerity. Today's farewell party is really not enough to express even one ten-thousandth of our feelings. I want to express our passionate emotions, but I can't help but give an example. It would be more natural and interesting to analyze and elaborate on his four-character name. The first character is "Iwai" (岩). "Iwai" means mountain rock. Whether it is igneous rock or sedimentary rock, it is always solid, dignified, and upright. It will never change its silent and unmoving nature due to the influence of external objects. This represents Mr. Iwai's quiet side. The second character is "I" (井). "I" means a well, which is a source of water for everyone to draw from. It can give us the right amount of moisture, and it does not appear more when drawing water or less when not drawing water. This generosity just represents Mr. Iwai's active side. It truly symbolizes prosperity and rising upwards. Although Mr. Iwai is already middle-aged, he is full of vigor and vitality, no different from a young man. There is an old Chinese saying, "Heroes have a hard time passing the 'beauty pass.'" When Mr. Iwai encounters a beautiful woman, he is more devoted than anyone else. The third and fourth characters are "Eiichi" (英一). "Ei" is single-mindedness. Mr. Iwai's personality is that he means what he says. We have never heard him say anything frivolous. The so-called "uniform and unwavering" is Mr. Iwai's hallmark. Therefore, the four characters of "Iwai Eiichi" completely depict his full appearance, even more clearly than a photograph. We respect him, and that is because of these four characters.

Finally, Wen Lanting, on behalf of the Business and Industrial Association and the Citizens' Welfare Association, presented Mr. Iwai with a large silver cup engraved with the four characters "Peng Cheng Wan Li" (鹏程万里, meaning "Boundless Future") as a memento. Zhang Yipeng presented a personally inscribed scroll with a farewell poem: "风流上国宾，每邀促膝话和亲，居然倾盖成知已，颇觉停杯愧主人，东亚文明同信仰，大和武道见精神，岭南不似阳羡远，小别归来正早春" (A distinguished guest from a cultured nation, often invited to sit knee-to-knee to discuss peace, unexpectedly becoming a close friend at first meeting, making the host feel ashamed to stop drinking. East Asian civilization shares the same beliefs, the spirit of Yamato Bushido is evident. Lingnan is not as far as Yangxian, a brief farewell, returning in early spring). Mr. Iwai accepted each gift and expressed his gratitude. After a group photograph, the farewell tea party, filled with warm emotions, ended at 6:30 p.m.

### Preparation Begins for the Sixth Student Aid Program: Generous Donations from All Sectors, Anonymous Donor Generously Donates 20,000 Yuan Yesterday

Our newspaper's sixth student aid program has begun preparations, and the number of donors from all walks of life is increasing daily. However, due to recent changes in commodity prices and tuition fees, this year's situation will be different from the previous year. We sincerely hope that our readers will continue to donate so that impoverished students can continue their studies. Yesterday, our newspaper received a generous donation of 20,000 yuan for student aid from an anonymous donor. This anonymous donor enjoys helping others and does not want to reveal his name. On Christmas Day, when everyone is celebrating, he donated money to help students, which is a noble and outstanding act. We also received 7,000 yuan from Mr. Fei Yabo, who donated his friends and relatives' congratulatory gifts for his eldest grandson's one-month celebration to help students. Benefiting students and blessing relatives and friends is a profound and thoughtful gesture, which is extremely admirable.

Yesterday's Donations

The list of student aid funds received yesterday is as follows: Fei Yabo (congratulatory gifts from friends and relatives for the eldest grandson's one-month celebration) 7,000 yuan, Nanyang Colleagues (saving from the Winter Solstice Festival) 1,865 yuan, Sun ( 品 missing character) 1,000 yuan, Yao Li Shen (gifts for Fan's mother's birthday celebration) 300 yuan, Gu Mingwen 250 yuan, Second Joint Security First Guarantee of Lao Zha District 200 yuan, Chuan Yanchen (gifts for sending off Pu Jiting's mother) 100 yuan, Colleagues of the Banjiang Grand Theater 80 yuan, Pu Jiting (in memory of the two virtuous mothers, Meng and Yue) 10 yuan, Mr. Feng (brought by Ren Jinping) 20,000 yuan, Qi Ji 500 yuan, Fourth-grade students of Gu Bo Elementary School (saving from New Year's cards) 218 yuan, Lu Lianchun (拾 missing character price) 200 yuan, Yao Shouchun Lu (missing character) 10 yuan.

### Detention Center of the District Prosecutor's Office Plans to Increase Prisoner Food Rations

Central News Agency: Due to rising commodity prices, prisoner food rations are also facing serious difficulties. The regulations stipulate that each prisoner receives 1.3 yuan, but based on the actual cost of living, this is far from sufficient, which can directly and indirectly affect the health of the prisoners. The Detention Center of the Shanghai District Prosecutor's Office plans to increase the food ration for each prisoner to 2.6 yuan. A request has been submitted to the District Prosecutor's Office for forwarding to the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval.

### Brief News

Postal Parcel Notice: Due to transportation difficulties, all parcels and small packages mailed to and transshipped through the Xiamen Post Office will be temporarily suspended.

Grand Opening of the New Central Pharmacy Building

Yesterday, the new Central Pharmacy building held its grand opening ceremony. Because the prices were particularly low and there were free gifts, customers were extremely crowded. The pharmacy will continue to hold special prices, etc.

### Translation and Commentary: Expectations for the Rice Control Association

Given the importance of the food issue, perhaps our expectations for the Rice Control Association are too high. We believe that regarding rice, there is no other way than to rely on the sole rice control agency, the Rice Control Association. However, the Rice Control Association's performance in recent months cannot be said to be satisfactory.

According to the Rice Control Association, the total amount of rice purchased by the association in both A and B zones reached 1.4 million shi (石). There is no reason for the general public to feel uneasy about food rationing. What makes the general public so uneasy is the inability to eliminate rice smuggling and black markets. Recently, the soaring black market prices in Suzhou, Wuxi, and other places are also a fact. The inability to eliminate smuggling may be due to the lax enforcement of administrative agencies, but the Rice Control Association also bears some responsibility. If the relationship with administrative agencies becomes closer, these problems will naturally be resolved.

The rampant smuggling of rice and the soaring black market prices in various cities make it very difficult to purchase rice in the future. This cannot be eliminated simply by suppression. To strengthen suppression, at least the rice ration in Shanghai must be increased to ensure sufficient food, and new rationing systems must be established in Suzhou, Wuxi, Nantong, and other places. Rice storage must be registered, and national accumulations must be suppressed. However, allowing rice businesses to implement autonomous grain control carries the risk of allowing businesses to hoard grain in the name of control.

Furthermore, some speculators seem to exist among the purchasing merchants designated by the Rice Control Association, especially in Zone B. Some designated purchasing merchants will pay attention to profits beyond those stipulated by the Rice Control Association. Smuggling and black markets are mostly instigated by these people. Therefore, if the Rice Control Association wants to fulfill its original mission, it must rectify these elements.

The importance of the food issue is self-evident. However, the essence of the problem is not the lack of absolute food quantity, but the difficulty of purchasing and rationing. To reasonably solve the food problem, we believe that at least the above-mentioned measures should be taken. (Xiang: Translated and abridged from the Mainland News)

### Order from the Ministry of Food to Merge the Wine Industry into Wine Associations

Central News Agency, Shanghai: The Ministry of Food plans to adapt to the wartime system, adjust economic institutions, and adjust various food groups in the city. Similar trade associations in each industry will be merged to achieve unity. In the wine industry, there were originally five trade associations for Liang Shao wine, Shao wine, Tu Huang wine, (missing character) wine, and Fen wine. The associations have been ordered to merge into the Shanghai Special City Seasoning Industry Wine Sales Trade Association, and the original associations have been ordered to cease activities and merge into the association to jointly promote the rational development of association affairs. It is reported that the Fen Wine Industry Trade Association has complied with the order to merge. The association has more than 200 members, and registration procedures have been completed.

### Expensive Rayon Cotton and Wool Fabrics

Rayon cotton and wool fabrics are currently unusually expensive and in short supply. The factory has limited stock, and there is no supply for those who seek it. Eighty to ninety percent of the new products contain rayon and silk. Therefore, those who have old-fashioned, non-rayon cotton and wool fabrics from thirty years ago are hoarding them and reluctant to quote prices. As for transactions, they have been reduced because the end of the year is approaching, and various stores are taking stock and settling accounts.

### Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)

Foreigners often say that China is a country with backward rational life, and many Japanese also hold this view. If the term "rational life" is interpreted as scientific life or logical life, then this criticism may be correct to some extent. Chinese people cannot be said to have a logical rational life. However, on the other hand, people almost forget that Chinese people have been living an emotional life for the past five thousand years—in the words of Gu Hongming, a "Life of the Heart"—Chinese people are not a nation that thinks with their "heads" but a nation that contemplates with their "hearts." Therefore, even if the Chinese understand the reasons with their heads, if their hearts do not understand, it is still in vain. If Chinese people are treated like other semi-civilized races simply because they do not think with their heads, then it would be a big mistake. The Chinese people's five thousand years of "life of the heart," even if they cannot understand the logic of things, will give the Chinese the ability to distinguish the truth. "Distinguishing the truth" means distinguishing whether the name and reality are consistent. Chinese people do not believe in things before they feel them in practice. Japanese people who think with their heads and act logically believe that since Japan and China are allies, Japan treats China equally. Therefore, the Chinese people's feelings towards Japan should change rapidly according to this theory. However, Chinese people who think with their hearts and act according to "passion," if they do not have a feeling of equality with the Japanese that matches the name and reality, then they do not believe that China and Japan have truly formed an alliance. As the Japanese say, "总不落于肺腑 (There is always some suspicion—Translator)." In fact, this feeling is the psychological basis that makes them suspect that there is something shady behind the Sino-Japanese alliance.

If Japan focuses on the psychology of these Chinese intellectuals and can thoroughly grant them autonomy and equality that matches the name and reality, I dare to believe that not only Chongqing, but even the youth of the Chinese Communist Party, would happily embrace Japan and fight with full enthusiasm for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. Chinese intellectuals do not oppose Japan's advocacy of "Asia for Asians." At the same time, they deeply feel that it is China's national duty to work hand in hand with Japan to jointly complete the sacred cause of liberating Asia. However, they believe that in order to realize "Asia for Asians," we must first realize "China for Chinese." At the same time, they believe that the process of "China's liberation" is the process of "Asia's liberation." Therefore, the more they feel that their motherland is a "China for Chinese" that is fully realized, the more enthusiastic they will be about the war for the liberation of Asia. Chinese intellectuals are by no means passive or disinterested in the Greater East Asia War. Although their passion for the liberation of Asia is burning fiercely in their hearts, this passion is now being suppressed because of their fear of Japan. A virgin who is deeply in love with a man always does not speak loudly or express herself much in front of that man, just as if she does not like this man. The reason is that she has not truly judged whether he loves her. Before judging, she tries not to reveal her passion. If he can resolve her doubts, then she will immediately jump into his arms. Japan is like this man. If it knows the passion burning in the hearts of the Chinese and can instantly resolve the doubts of the Chinese, then China will immediately jump into Japan's arms. However, in this case, even if Japan is like Don Juan, the number one love tactician, and says in an exaggerated manner, "I absolutely love you," as long as these words are not fully realized and do not match the name and reality, then Chinese intellectuals will give him the cold shoulder. If you want to persuade Chinese intellectuals with sweet words, Japan should not adopt "frivolous love methods" towards China. Respect the other party's personality, do not think of it as an object for venting sexual desire, intend to take the other party as a lifelong partner, and say it frankly. It is not intended to take a concubine, but to welcome her as the main wife. On this point, I think it is very appropriate to say that Chinese intellectuals are very much like experienced old maids. When they hear a man's sweet words, they first want to know how much truth there is in these words. The sweeter the words, the more they want to know what medicine is being sold in the gourd to avoid being deceived. To gain the trust of this old maid, it is not with words, but in daily life, even trivial matters must show sincerity and be moved with the man's true heart. If Japan wants to win over Chinese intellectuals, it must make them deeply feel Japan's sincerity in small issues in daily life, and further, make them fully, authentically, and realistically feel the Sino-Japanese alliance.

Confucius said: "Great fear of the people's will, this is called knowing the root, this is called knowing the ultimate." According to Gu Hongming's explanation, it means "Care like being afraid of the hearts of the people is the foundation of the education industry, and it is also the highest education." However, I think it might be better to interpret this sentence as "Fearing the hearts of the people, paying attention to the hearts of the people, is the foundation of cultural work and also the highest goal."

### Not Content to Be a Parasite: An Aspiring Paralyzed Man Strives in the Education Industry for Twenty Years

Mr. Hu Duzhou, the principal of the private Fuguang Elementary School (located on Sanpailou Road), has been working hard in the education industry as a paralyzed person for twenty years, and his spirit is admirable. According to a letter yesterday, "Duzhou knows that his ability is weak and cannot handle the management of this school. But there is no one to take over, so he has to do it reluctantly. Fortunately, there are no major mistakes in teaching affairs, but the economic aspect is slightly lacking, and the facilities are not complete. Looking back on the past twenty years, those who have had contact with paralyzed people mostly plan for themselves and are nothing more than begging or emulating Wu Xun. Hard work and eating are beneficial to others, because hard work can dispel worries and time, and can also slightly make up for the shortcomings of others, avoiding being a (missing character) parasite burdening others. If the authorities can encourage (missing character) to do more for society, it would be of great benefit."
