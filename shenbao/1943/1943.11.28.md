### East Asian Liberation and Unity

— Yamaga Sokō

The words of revolutionaries often ignite a raging wildfire in people's hearts. The revolutionary, Mr. Bose, President of the Provisional Government of Free India, who came to China for a visit on the 20th of this month, delivered a radio broadcast to China via wireless, and in his declaration, there was a passion and righteous spirit that could only be expressed by a revolutionary who had escaped death several times. This moved me deeply, and I admired him wholeheartedly. Among them, what touched my heartstrings the most would be the following three points:

On the path to realizing the liberation and unity of the peoples of Asian countries, there are two kinds of difficulties: one is the existence of Western European imperialism, which dominates and divides the various ethnic groups of Asia; and the other is the lack of Asian power that can provide assistance to the weak nations of Asia.

However, the only force that can revive Asia is Japan. Before Japan openly broke off relations with the Western European imperialist powers, it was unable to provide assistance to weak countries. However, on December 1941, an excellent opportunity finally arrived for Asia. ... From then on, the revolutionary wave shook the entire Japan. That is to say, a new self-awareness permeated the souls of the Japanese people; today's Japan is no longer the Japan of five years ago. ...

Today, Japan is ready to do its best to build a new order in East Asia based on the principles of justice, equality, independence, autonomy, mutual benefit and mutual assistance. At the same time, this is also the duty that all Asian nations should fulfill. These principles are, in the final analysis, the only basis for realizing Asian liberation and unity...

If liberation is not accompanied by unity, then the liberated people will be like a flash in the pan, and will once again be ravaged by imperialist countries. This danger cannot be said to be non-existent. ... The peoples of all Asian countries must strive for liberation and unity at the same time. ... In order to complete the liberation and unity of Asia, it is first necessary to take the steps of first, Chinese unity, and second, Indian freedom.

Whether to push the people of India and the Near East into the tide of the struggle for freedom, or, on the contrary, to make them live in a dreamlike state, the key is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. At the same time, if the Chinese people are willing, the unification of China can be realized within twenty-four hours. I ask you: "Who is preventing the unification of China?..." Chinese friends! Do not hesitate for a moment, reflect carefully, and then make a decision!

Regarding my special feelings about this visit to China, I would like to briefly mention one or two things, namely that the current China is suffering from two major difficulties. One is that China itself is divided into two, and the other is that China and Japan are still at war. ... Japan has concluded a Sino-Japanese alliance, and the treaty stipulates that complete peace will be realized and troops will be completely withdrawn. ... Before that, all the special circumstances that damaged China's sovereignty and independence will, of course, be cancelled. Therefore, why must China and Japan fight each other now? This makes me puzzled and unable to understand why...

—! What highly insightful, passionate, and straightforward words! In his calm and continuous speech, he revealed a pure heart and a burning desire; in his loud and urgent calls, one could feel the滔天 wave rolled up by the revolutionary hurricane. (Continued on page four)

Finally, Li Zuyu, chairman of the Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Association, gave a speech. After Director Wen gave a reply, the meeting was adjourned for refreshments. The details are as follows:

Attending Committee Members, Officials, and Guests

Chairman Wen Lantong, Vice Chairman Tong Lüyu, Hisada Itsuji, Committee Member Jiang Shangda, Nie Lusheng, Chen Baochu, Guo Shun, Tong Runfu, Katsuta, Tsutsumi Takashi, Tomonaga Tozaburo, Noda Yoichi, Tanaka Kijiye, Guo Kuohuo, Shen Yanmou, Liu Jingji, Feng Chongsheng, Tiao Yixiong, Supervisors Huang Shoumin, Miyoshi Seiichiro, etc. Also present were leaders and guests from various agencies and organizations, including Chen Jianting, the representative of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Industry, Xu Tianshen, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau representing Mayor Chen, Li Zheng, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, Chen Guangzhong, Member of the Materials Control Review Committee, Tang Tongmin, Director of the Business Control Council, Secretaries Zhang Peishen, Zhang Enhe, Shen Leichun, Luo Nayan, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice Control Council, Li Zuyu of the Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Association. Japanese officials included Minister Tajiri of the Japanese Embassy, and Ding Fangyuan, Xu Guanqun, Wu Kunsheng, Kodama Chojiye, Yamada Rokuheifu, Tanaka Shigemitsu, etc. from Sino-Japanese business circles.

Chairman Delivers Opening Speech

Wen Lantong, Chairman of the Cotton Control Committee, said in his opening speech: "The government has established the Cotton Control Committee, and Lantong and others have been appointed as chairman, vice chairman, and committee members. I feel that my talent is limited, and I dare not accept this important task. However, considering that we are in the midst of the Greater East Asia War, cotton is an important material. The quality of control is not only related to people's livelihood, but also to the economy of the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, I will do my best. Fortunately, in terms of cotton control, there are still the established rules of the former Cotton Industry Professional Committee and the Huazhong Cotton Control Committee. On the one hand, I will receive guidance from the relevant authorities, and on the other hand, I will be able to obtain the cooperation of my colleagues in the industry, so that I can have standards and interests to work towards. I hope to receive more guidance in the future so that I can avoid making mistakes."

Premier Wang's Speech Has Two Objectives

Minister Chen, representing Premier Wang of the Executive Yuan, said in his speech: "Today, the Cotton Control Committee is established, and I feel very honored to come to Shanghai to participate on behalf of Premier Wang. The promotion of the wartime economic policy of the National Government should be based on the implementation of material control. There are two objectives of material control: 1. Increasing the production of cotton can help the Greater East Asia War. 2. Increasing the production of cotton can benefit the country and the people. Cotton is one of China's main agricultural products and an important material for industrial raw materials. From this, we can see the importance of people's livelihood, and even more so, the important mission of the Cotton Control Committee. The Business Control Council's Cotton Control Committee is formed by important members of the Sino-Japanese cotton industry to promote control work and achieve the hope of increasing production. This is the completion of the Cotton Control Committee's important mission."

Minister Tajiri Hopes for Increased Production

Minister Tajiri said in his speech: "Today, the Cotton Control Committee is established, and I am very grateful for the invitation. In terms of materials in Central China, cotton and rice are the most important. This time, the mission of the Cotton Control Committee, whether viewed from the Chinese or Japanese perspective, can be said to be to meet the requirements of the current situation. Therefore, the future work and achievements will be focused on increasing production. From the perspective of the Cotton Control Committee, the results of cotton collection this year have been very good, and it is expected that the results of future purchases will be even better. I hope that the Cotton Control Committee will pay attention to how to increase production in the future. Obviously, increased production is greatly related to purchases. For the funds loaned for the collection of cotton, more attention should be paid to ensuring that they are loaned to the real farmers who produce cotton. I am an amateur in cotton and cannot make good contributions at all. Fortunately, the entire Cotton Control Committee is composed of experts in the cotton industry, and I hope you will pay attention to this important point."

Tang Shoumin Expresses Five Points

Briefly said: Regarding cotton, the importance of this material is closely related to both military needs and people's livelihood. Minister Chen and Minister Tajiri have already elaborated on this, so there is no need for me to repeat it. At this grand meeting, I would like to briefly express my humble opinions on various hopes: 1. For cotton collection, the most important thing is to set the price. The price should be set reasonably. 2. Setting a reasonable price is the basis for collecting sufficient cotton. It is hoped that the amount collected this year will reach the expected target. 3. In addition to collecting a large amount of cotton, it is also hoped that we can increase production next year. 4. The funds for cotton collection are the price that farmers should receive, and we must ensure that they are returned to the farmers as capital for their re-production. 5. Farmers may not understand the official plans, and it is hoped that we can enlighten them so that everyone can be of one mind and thoroughly understand the differences in old and new scales, etc., and listen to the official efforts with understanding. The Cotton Control Committee is an external organization of the Business Control Council, and some of the chairman, vice chairman, and committee members are also directors and supervisors of the Business Control Council. In addition to providing support from the Business Control Council, I would like to briefly express my hopes and wish the Cotton Control Committee complete success.

Chen Guangzhong Speaks on Developing Cotton Farmers

Chen Guangzhong, the representative of the Materials Control Review Committee, said in his speech that the focus of cotton collection work should be on enabling cotton farmers to develop in a balanced manner and achieving the purpose of unified purchase and distribution of cotton. Finally, Li Zuyu, chairman of the Huazhong Cotton Production Improvement Association, gave a speech on behalf of the attendees, hoping that after the establishment of the Cotton Control Committee, the discussion of the value of collected cotton should take into account the lives of farmers in order to achieve the goal of increasing production.

### India is Fully Prepared, Final Struggle to Begin, Bose Declares Government to Move to Burma

Two Islands Renamed

Shonan, 27th Central News Agency Electric - Chandra Bose declared at a meeting with the press corps yesterday: Japanese Prime Minister Tojo clarified on the second day of the Greater East Asia Conference that the Andaman and Nicobar Islands would be transferred to the Provisional Government of Free India. The Provisional Government has now decided to rename the Andaman Islands as the Martyr Islands and the Nicobar Islands as the Autonomous Islands.

Shonan, 27th Central News Agency Electric - Since the President of the Provisional Government of Free India, Chandra Bose, attended the Greater East Asia Conference and visited China and the Philippines, he returned to Shonan on the 25th. At noon on the 26th, he announced to members of the Southern Indian League, stating the following key points: Regarding my visit to Japan, the first thing I want to say is that the Japanese people are completely united and have absolute confidence in winning the Greater East Asia War. The purpose of the Greater East Asia Conference, in summary, is to complete the Greater East Asia War and establish a new order in East Asia. Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw specifically proposed that all assistance should be given to India's struggle for freedom, which is especially meaningful as Burma is a friendly country to India. On my way back to Shonan, I visited the Republic of China and the Republic of the Philippines. Our belief in mutual unity and permanent cooperation is becoming firmer. The Japanese government's statement that it will transfer the Andaman and Nicobar Islands to the Provisional Government of Free India is of great significance to the Indian people, as we now have our own territory and have completed a government that matches its name and reality. All the prerequisites for the Indian people's actual struggle have been completed. Our work from now on is to start the final struggle to liberate ourselves from the shackles of Britain. For this struggle, we have abundant courage. The first thing we should do is to further expand and strengthen our current national military force and start the war. Part of our army has already begun to be stationed in the Indian border area. In order to reward the bravery of the soldiers on the front line, the government has prepared to announce a system of rewards and a law to protect the veterans who died or were injured in battle. Secondly, the preparations for my government to move to Burma have also been completed and will be realized soon. After the government moves to Burma, I will further strengthen contact with comrades from various agencies and strive to promote the mobilization plan. I firmly believe that the day when the Indian National Army will enter India is near, and the banner of the Indian National Army will be hoisted high over the British Governor's Mansion in New Delhi. This will require a long and arduous struggle, but the comprehensive preparations for handling all situations have been fully completed.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th – A Havas report from Washington states: The meeting of the three giants, Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin, is imminent, and there is a possibility that Chiang Kai-shek from Chongqing will also participate. Washington political circles hope to establish a four-power conference. This new organization will establish a permanent headquarters in Washington.

This four-power conference will handle issues of wartime and post-war cooperation among the anti-Axis countries. A certain Swedish correspondent stated: This meeting will face two difficulties. First, whether the Soviet Union is willing to participate in a global organization, as it must consider its relations with Japan. Washington is even more afraid that Stalin will insist that the location be in London because of the existence of the 20-year Anglo-Soviet treaty. And the Anglo-Soviet treaty will be the basis for the four-power conference before any new arrangements are made.

### Promoting Relations Between Japan and Thailand Focuses on Cultural Communication

After returning to the embassy, he spoke about his aspirations for his new post as follows: In the future, I will strive to further strengthen Japan-Thailand relations. If all the ethnic groups in Greater East Asia exert all their efforts and cooperate in this war, victory will surely belong to us. In the future, in order to promote relations between Japan and Thailand, we will first focus on cultural communication, because politics and culture have a close and inseparable relationship. Japan and Thailand must also understand each other culturally. Therefore, in addition to introducing Thai culture to Japan, it is also necessary to make Thais understand Japan. I hope to publish a "History of Japan" in Thai to enable Thais to further understand Japan.

The Japanese army's air and ground artillery immediately attacked, and eventually shot down three of the (PAU40) type (one of which was not confirmed). The Japanese side suffered no losses. Also, between 3:48 PM and 3:55 PM that afternoon, 13 North American enemy fighter-bombers jointly attacked the Nicaladon airfield and were again damaged by Japanese forces, forcing them to flee. The Japanese side suffered minimal losses. Enemy aircraft attacked the vicinity of Yangon again on the morning of the 26th with ten Wellington aircraft, and one was shot down and one was damaged by the Japanese army. The rest retreated, and the Japanese side suffered almost no losses.

### Washington's Pipe Dream

— Meng Shi

A ludicrous message

The capital of Uncle Sam – Washington, has once again passed along a most ludicrous message. What we find comical, our readers must also find laughable! The message goes like this: According to Washington radio broadcasts, on September 24th, Senator Tydings, representing Maryland, will submit a resolution to the Senate recognizing the immediate and complete independence of the Philippines, for discussion. Everyone knows that Senator Tydings is an advocate for Philippine independence and drafted the Philippine Independence Act. Readers should recall that the Independence Act stipulated that Philippine independence would be granted on July 4, 1946, ten years after its implementation. Now, according to reports from a few days ago, Tydings' resolution, submitted to the Senate for discussion, would amend the Act and grant the Philippines independence immediately, without having to wait until 1946.

The above is the latest news of the American attempt to deceive the 16 million people of the Philippines, as well as its entire political sphere. This news is truly worthy of derision. For it is feared that all Senators, save Tydings, know – and cannot not know – that the United States has long had no intention of granting the Philippines independence. America's influence in the Philippines has been completely eliminated since the surrender of the American forces on the island to the Japanese army in May of last year. Yet America still has idlers who talk about withdrawing American sovereignty from the Philippines! Comparing the Philippines to a family of free nations, giving it equal status – and continuing to make such useless and empty arguments.

However, America has ulterior motives for this laughable attitude towards the Philippines. They guarantee in Tydings' resolution that Uncle Sam will continue to work hard to liberate the Philippines. What do readers think of this? There is nothing more ludicrous than this guarantee. Why? Because, first, the people of the Philippines have been liberated from American control for over a year. Second, at the 82nd Japanese Diet session last June, Prime Minister Tojo had already declared that the independence desired by the Filipino people would be realized this year, without waiting for one or two years. Prime Minister Tojo's speech stated:

Japan's Attitude

"Our attitude towards Philippine independence has been explained repeatedly. Now we further declare that the glory of independence will be granted to the Philippines this year, so that the Filipino people, who have been painstakingly pursuing the illusion of independence for many years under the cunning American control, will gradually fulfill their long-cherished aspirations less than two years after the outbreak of this war."

Try comparing Japan's policy towards the Philippines with that of the United States. Uncle Sam wrote the so-called Philippine Independence Act into the statute books nine years ago, promising to allow it independence in ten years.

However, in 1934, when this Independence Act was passed, all of the Philippine intelligentsia were asking themselves: Why is independence not granted immediately? Why can't we wait another ten years? Of course, we fully understand the reasons for refusing immediate independence to the Philippines. There are two reasons: First, American imperialists are unwilling to lose control over the Filipino people; second, the supporters and friends of Philippine independence within the United States completely lack sincerity and a sense of justice regarding the question of Philippine independence. But now the stage manager for Philippine independence has no more work to do. The members of the new Philippine Republic's congress have been elected, and with great enthusiasm, they are determined to rebuild their country and contribute to the rapid completion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere by assuming a glorious mission. Their industrious and sincere efforts will surely bear fruit in the near future, of this we can be undoubtedly certain.

A Sudden Change in Facts

Americans, who stubbornly refuse to understand and acknowledge the reality of the rapid changes occurring in East Asia, must at least acknowledge the following facts: First, the United States is now completely cut off from the Philippines; second, the Filipino people have already gained complete independence. That is an absolutely certain fact. On September 30th, three leaders from the Philippines visited Tokyo: Dr. Laurel, chairman of the Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee and presidential candidate; Mr. Vargas, chairman of the Philippine Executive Committee; and Mr. Aquino, candidate for speaker of the Philippine Congress, all of whom are confident in their ability to manage the new nation. Under the guidance of such outstanding politicians, the people of the new Philippine Republic have broken free from over forty years of American oppression and are enjoying their right to the longed-for life, freedom, and happiness.

Faced with this reality, yet challenging the common enterprise of building a co-prosperity sphere by all the nations of East Asia with military force, the war-mongering of the anti-Axis side cannot but be said to be an inexcusable crime. If they truly respect the rights of other ethnic groups and other nations to chart their own destinies, as they claim, then they have no reason to interfere in East Asian affairs. The nations of Greater East Asia only hope that no interference will hinder them, and only ask to chart and save their own path.

### Remarks by Head of Delegation Xu at the Greater East Asia Press Conference

Xu Liqiu, head of the Chinese delegation to the Greater East Asia Press Conference and acting president of the China Daily News, returned to Shanghai by plane on the 26th after the closing of the conference due to public affairs, and made the following remarks:

I was warmly received and assisted by all parties during my trip to Japan to attend the Greater East Asia Press Conference, and I am very grateful. This conference brought together representatives from all over East Asia, which was unprecedented. Although the conference only lasted for two days, the atmosphere was harmonious, and there was no separation due to language issues. The most　gratifying thing was that the establishment of the Greater East Asia News Council, which had been negotiated for several years but had not been realized, was proposed by the Chinese delegation and unanimously supported by the conference. The entire proposal was passed. It was decided that, in addition to all the attending representatives from various countries being members, the members of the presidium (i.e., the heads of the delegations) would be the directors. After the members return to their countries, they will contact their domestic colleagues to join in succession. During this trip to Tokyo and other places, I deeply felt the high morale of the citizens of the allied nations under the wartime system, the strength of the war effort, and the perfection of national training. This further strengthened the belief of the attending representatives from various countries that the Greater East Asia War would be victorious, which was the most　valuable gain of this conference.

### Group A Football Showdown: Friendship vs. Overseas Chinese United – 10:30 AM at Recreation Ground

The highly anticipated Group A football match between Friendship and Overseas Chinese United will take place this morning at 10:30 AM at the Recreation Ground. The referee is Chen Jixiang, and the linesmen are Liu Chunshu and Gu Zhengzhu. Having lost to Overseas Chinese United in the Reporter's Cup, Friendship will undoubtedly seek revenge today. Meanwhile, the Donghua vs. Three Provinces match will be held at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park. Originally, there were nine football league matches scheduled for today, but the Group B and C match between the Soviet Union and the Japanese Association has been postponed.

Analysis of Strengths

Friendship has lost Sun Jinshun and Zhang Lingen this year, but the addition of the "Ball Freak" Xu Wenkui has compensated for the loss, maintaining their strength. However, the retirement of "Lazy Cow" Li Yiju has forced Qu Yongfu to be moved forward, leading to the collapse of what was praised as the best central defense line. Nevertheless, A-Fu's forward position is exceptionally fierce, and with "Ball Freak" A-Kui taking charge as the central commander, the attacking power is quite remarkable. In terms of defense, Liu Xianhan is the goalkeeper, with Wu Qixiang and Li Tiansheng as defenders, forming an impenetrable wall. The overall team lineup is well-organized and solid. The Overseas Chinese United team is composed of both new and veteran stars. Their defense includes Victor and Xerxes, and their attack features Favic and Carlo Lequio. Last week, they defeated the Portuguese Business Association 5-3, demonstrating their supreme power. Today's match is crucial for their standings, and it is expected that both sides will give their all, resulting in an exciting and intense game.

Donghua vs. Three Provinces

Another Group A match, Donghua vs. Three Provinces, will be held at 3:30 PM at Jiaozhou Park on Changping Road. Donghua is expected to win without any problems. Tickets for both matches are priced at $40 and $20.

Today's Schedule: Overseas Chinese United vs. Friendship (Group A) 10:30 AM (Recreation Ground); Three Provinces vs. Donghua (Group A) 3:30 PM (Jiaozhou); French Business Association vs. Overseas Chinese (Group B) 10:15 AM (Jiaozhou); Zhenyuan vs. Nie School (Group C) 2:00 PM (Hongkou); Hequn vs. Zhenhua (Group C) 9:00 AM (East); Wuzhi vs. Shenghua (Group C) 10:30 AM (East); Elementary, Youlian (Group C) 2:00 PM (East); Customs vs. First Police (Group C) 3:30 PM (East)

Friendship: Liu Xianhan, Li Tiansheng, Wu Qixiang, Cai Shengmiao, Song Lingsheng, Zheng Yingquan, Qian Jingyong, Zhai Yongfu, Xu Wenkui, Gao Baozheng, Fei Chunhua (Reserves: Yu Zhenyue, Li Yichen)

Overseas Chinese United: Huang Zijie, Victor, Xerxes, Lang Shaoshan, Pan Tuosun, Xue Erfo, Jin Lusheng, Carlo Lequio, Fafanxiao, Yagefu, Shen Yi (Reserves: Borage, Pulihuo)

### America Cancels Chinese Exclusion Act: Department Head Hirota's Remarks Criticizing American Hypocrisy

Central News Agency Report: Hirota, a spokesperson for the Japanese Embassy in China, stated last night to the Central News Agency that the US Senate's passage of a bill to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act, which would allow 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year, does not address the fundamental issue of equal treatment for East Asian people. The United Kingdom, the United States, and various Central and South American countries have long practiced discrimination against East Asian people. It would be ridiculous for the US government to believe that repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act would erase the racial prejudice that Americans have historically held towards Chinese and other East Asian people.

A Wartime Expedient Measure by the United States

It would be even more laughable if Chongqing believes that Chinese people will receive social and political equality. Hirota believes that the proposed repeal of the Chinese Exclusion Act is a wartime expedient measure by the United States to prevent Chongqing from defecting from the Allied camp. The United Kingdom and its dominions, as well as various Central and South American countries, have always refused entry to East Asian people, and even Indians, who are British citizens, are not allowed to freely transit through British territory. Hirota continued by stating that the clear answer of the 1 billion East Asians to this question can be seen in Article 5 of the Joint Declaration announced at the recent Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, which states that "East Asian nations will strive to eliminate racial discrimination throughout the world." Laws excluding East Asian immigrants apply not only to Chinese people but also to the 1 billion people of the East. This is not only the case in the United States, but also in the United Kingdom and Central and South American countries.

The Real Motive: Appeasing Chongqing

Hirota continued by stating that allowing East Asian people to enter their countries is not an important fact, but the fundamental issue lies in their social and political lives after immigration. For those with a typical American mindset, allowing 105 Chinese immigrants to enter the United States each year is considered equal treatment for Chinese people. The bill to repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act was submitted to Congress last year, and despite strong opposition from traditional American racial prejudice, it was eventually passed by the Senate. This gesture demonstrates the US government's desire to appease the Chongqing regime. The true motive behind this "American high-minded behavior" with a false mask can be seen in the remarks of US Navy Admiral Yarnell before the Senate committee discussing the bill, who believed that the collapse of the Chongqing government was a serious possibility without effective assistance. Supporters of repealing the Chinese Exclusion Act have also stated that Chinese people cannot immigrate to the United States during wartime, and the US government is unwilling to grant Chinese immigrants equal treatment, advocating that this issue be reconsidered after the war. In other words, the US government has no sincerity in improving the treatment of Chinese people. Its sole purpose is to appease Chongqing and prevent it from defecting from the Allied camp.

The Slave Life of Chinese Laborers in the Past

The history of Chinese immigration to the United States can be traced back to the California Gold Rush. Chinese people went to the United States as slaves to supplement the shortage of railway workers and miners in the central and western parts of the United States. Many Chinese coolies died in the slave life in the railway construction camps in the Rocky Mountains and in the mines of Hui'anming and Timer. Hirota pointed out that if Chongqing believes that allowing 105 immigrants each year can compensate for the lives of previous immigrants, then they are not qualified to be leaders of the Chinese people. The Chinese people are determined to restore China. Historically, Chinese people who immigrated to the United States were treated as slaves. In 1871, the United States recruited a large number of Chinese laborers in Ningbo, promising them excellent pay. However, as soon as the ship left Chinese territorial waters, the cabins where the Chinese laborers were living were sealed off, and no supplies were provided. When the ship arrived in Yokohama, the Chinese laborers dispatched two representatives to request assistance from the Japanese authorities. The Japanese government immediately intervened and, during the trial, recognized the ship as a slave ship, and all the Chinese laborers on board were freed. Although the ship's destination was Peru, many other ships of the same nature sailed to the United States, and the Chinese migrants who were deceived into slavery were all freed. In conclusion, Hirota reiterated that the fundamental issue is not the admission of a small number of Chinese people into the United States, but the key point is equal treatment. If Chongqing cannot see through the American appeasement policy and cannot grasp its true meaning from the standpoint of the Chinese people, then Chongqing will become a traitor to East Asia.

### Hua Stock Spot Transactions Must Not Be Implemented Without Approval, Still Limited to Spot Next-Day Delivery

Since the Hua Stock Exchange opened on the 8th, it has temporarily limited transactions to spot next-day delivery of Hua stocks and designated the Guoxin Bank to handle delivery settlement matters. In order to facilitate the delivery of various stocks, the exchange considered implementing a new "convenient delivery" system for spot transactions, stipulating that delivery would be handled every Monday and that speculation and manipulation would be curbed in accordance with the business rules. Yesterday, reporters learned from brokers that the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry had ordered the administrator of the exchange not to implement the convenient delivery system for spot transactions without approval. Furthermore, trading in Hua stock futures is temporarily prohibited, so the implementation of "convenient delivery" for spot transactions is not likely to materialize in the short term. It was also learned that the exchange has temporarily suspended trading since the 25th due to calculation issues with Hua stocks established on the 23rd and 24th of this month, which have not yet been settled. Trading will resume after settlement is completed, but the principle of spot next-day delivery will still be followed.

### Flour Bran Allocation Office Will Officially Open

All Associations Must Submit Reports Quickly

In order to unify the allocation of flour and bran, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, with the approval of the Commercial and Trade Council, established the "Shanghai District Flour Bran Allocation Office" to handle the unified allocation of flour in the city. It has been learned that the Allocation Office will officially open on December 1st and has already notified various associations, such as the Tea and Gold Industry Association, to quickly submit the rosters of their members within three days of receiving the notice in order to facilitate allocation. The opening dates of each member's store must also be indicated. All industries that use flour as a raw material have been notified to comply. Subsequently, the Allocation Office will determine the allocation quota based on the actual needs of the members according to the membership roster. The association will allocate the quota to each member, and non-members of the association will not be entitled to allocation rights.

### Hua Stock Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks continued to fluctuate within a narrow range. During the stock exchange's suspension, a small number of firms engaged in active trading outside the exchange. Although the end of the month was approaching and there were sellers seeking cash, strong buyers absorbed the supply, and many new and old stocks generally rose.

Economic World

### Translation and Commentary: The Issue of Currency Adjustment in the Su-Huai Region

The Su-Huai region, located in a special state bordering North China, can demonstrate centralization and promote the self-strengthening efforts of the National Government through this currency adjustment. This epoch-making policy will be implemented starting next month and will have a significant impact on the economic circles of both China and Japan. General sentiment is that it should be fully supported because this measure not only expands the circulation area of the Central Reserve Bank notes but also carries political significance, namely, that it can promote the integration of politics and economy. Furthermore, the implementation of this policy will gradually lead to reasonable solutions to various fundamental issues such as financial exchange, material exchange, and others between North and Central China, thereby enabling China's economic unification to embark on a path of independent development.

The Su-Huai region was designated as a special administrative area under the jurisdiction of the National Government in February 1942. However, in terms of economics, the circulation and use of the United Reserve Bank notes were governed by the North China Political Affairs Commission until today. As a result, administration and economics were divided into two separate spheres, which inevitably led to contradictions and obstacles in policy implementation. The current determination to make adjustments can at least strengthen the economic ties between Central and North China, increase the credit of the Central Reserve Bank notes, and strengthen the foundation of the Central Reserve Bank. These are all foreseeable effects. However, it is important to avoid taking drastic measures during implementation, as this could lead to competition between the two currencies and hinder the work of acquisition and transaction operations. Therefore, a gradual approach must be adopted. This point has already been emphasized in the statements of Finance Minister Zhou of the National Government.

Regarding the exchange transaction plan, we believe that freedom should be given within the scope of the plan to smoothly promote the exchange of materials between the two regions. For example, the formal recognition and public permission of Huai-Shanghai exchange is also a matter worth considering. In the past, the national capital of North China has always depended on Central China for development. Now, the Chinese financial community is eager for both sides to be able to exchange and develop mutually. The exchange of national capital between Central and South China must also be closely developed. By following this path, we can expect the completion of the unification of Chinese national capital.

### Weekly Commentary (Continued from Page 1)

The meaning of the speech is self-evident, perhaps already understood. But to summarize its content succinctly: The age-old aspiration of Asia is to drive out Western European imperialism and achieve liberation, and this has already been resolved by Japanese military force in today's Greater East Asia War. At the same time, Japan today is no longer the Japan of five years ago. It has now become the towering leader of all of Greater East Asia. It has not only abolished the unequal treaties that hindered China's construction, but also promised in the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty that it will withdraw its troops as soon as full peace is achieved between China and Japan. If so, why are China and Japan fighting each other? This is something that I cannot understand. If the Chinese people are willing, they can achieve Chinese unification within 24 hours. Chinese gentlemen! Why are you still hesitating? Don't miss a single second, stand up! Make a decision!—This is the general idea.

This is a perfect depiction of the current situation in Asia! At the same time, we should ponder that the liberation and unity of Asia must be achieved simultaneously. If liberation is not accompanied by unity, then the liberated people will soon be in danger of being sacrificed by Anglo-American imperialism. After giving this warning, it is strongly emphasized that in order to achieve true liberation, it is necessary to complete the great unity of East Asia simultaneously with liberation. If you want to complete the liberation and unity of Asia, then you must first advance to the stage of the unification of China and the freedom of India. For the liberation of India, and thus for the liberation and unity of East Asia, the unification of China, that is, the realization of the unification of China, which resolves the Sino-Japanese problem, is a prerequisite.

Are not the Anglo-Americans who split and conflict China to create two countries and to establish permanent objects of exploitation as the conspiracy of imperialism enemies? Is not Japan, which considers itself an "era of equality and assistance" and sincerely offers love, friendship, and respect to its friendly nation China with the intention of making China permanently exist in the world, a partner? This is obvious at a glance and does not require further explanation.

I would like to say a few words to my Chinese friends. That is, you must recognize that the modern era is not an era of conquest and exploitation, but an era that has changed to an era of equality and assistance. Furthermore, you must recognize that the series of policies toward China since Japan's Konoe Statement are all based on this recognition of the era of equality and assistance. At the same time, the mission and responsibility of realizing this on a global scale are placed on the friendly relationship between China and Japan. The establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expected, and this unwavering belief and reason, based on this self-awareness, is constantly growing and developing. If you interpret this Japanese policy toward China as aggression, as a form of imperialism, it is as wrong as calling a horse a deer. If you think that the substance is the same because the form is the same, then you will inevitably be regarded as a fool who cannot see through the leap of history and the changes in the ideas flowing deep within history. I believe that what saved East Asia was not so much the great victory of Japan in the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War, but rather the Twenty-One Demands and the Manchurian Incident from the perspective of China. These were the deep-rooted and good foundations for protecting East Asia today. If there were no Twenty-One Demands back then, there would be no Manchurian Incident. If there were no Manchurian Incident, then what would the world of East Asia be like today?

In order to protect East Asia and achieve great unity, we must rewrite the fifty years of Sino-Japanese diplomatic history written in foreign languages in the past. Japan and the United Kingdom and the United States, with completely different moods and ideals, are ostensibly so-called imperialism, but they are actually the same in form but different in substance, seemingly similar but not so. As long as you look at Japan's China policy after the Manchurian Incident through this mirror of historical truth, you can correctly understand its true meaning. The philosophy in Boss's words can only be made more brilliant and brilliant if it is confirmed from this perspective.

I appeal to the people of China and Japan to rewrite the Sino-Japanese diplomatic history written in European and American languages over the past fifty years! Then recognize the reality of East Asia and restore the natural posture of China and Japan! This is the only way to complete the liberation of East Asia. This is the only way to simultaneously achieve liberation and unity, as Boss said, in one fell swoop. This is the only way to build the great unity and the new order of Greater East Asia, the long-cherished wish of East Asia. (Ji Translation)

### The Bureau of Commercial and Trade Considers the Poor, Allocating Winter Clothing Fabric Early

After this newspaper received generous donations of winter clothing from enthusiastic benefactors, it immediately undertook the task of purchasing materials and making clothes. Yesterday, we were fortunate to receive early allocation of cotton cloth from the Bureau of Commercial and Trade, totaling 11 pounds of cotton cloth at $500 per bolt and 10 pounds of lining cloth at $440 per bolt (cotton is still being purchased). The length of the cotton coat is 2 feet 3 inches, and the length of the cotton trousers is 2 feet 3.5 inches. The materials used are 8 feet 8 inches of black fabric for the outer layer, 9 feet 2 inches of white fabric for the lining, and 2 pounds and 4 taels of cotton. The cost of materials and sewing, etc., is approximately $160 per set (this is still an approximate price; the exact number will be known after the cotton is procured). A detailed cost account will be published at a later date. The organizers are working completely voluntarily. We plan to produce 5,000 sets, which will require approximately $480,000, far exceeding the current donations. We hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate to save the poor and needy of Shanghai. The merit is immeasurable. Donors who wish to deliver the clothes themselves can obtain winter clothing tickets from the donation collection office to distribute themselves.

### The YMCA Launches a Winter Clothing Charity Sale

In addition to the display and sale of calligraphy and paintings by famous figures of the past and present at the YMCA's winter clothing charity market, other items will be sold publicly from 1:00 PM to 6:00 PM today on the second floor of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA. A wide variety of items are available. People from all walks of life are welcome to participate enthusiastically.

### Winter Clothing Donation Report

Since this office has received generous donations for winter clothing from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, the amount has reached more than 30,000 yuan. In recent days, as the weather has warmed slightly, donations have gradually decreased. However, in the blink of an eye, the north wind is blowing and severe winter is approaching. In order to prepare as soon as possible, this office has applied to the relevant authorities for cotton cloth to rush to make winter clothing. However, the amount of donations is far from the original target, and we await continued support from all walks of life. We hope you will show your benevolence and make donations early so that we can make more winter clothing and benefit the poor. We are deeply grateful to the entire body of students in the Chu Shang 2 and Chu 2 Bing classes of Mingde Girls' High School for donating 1,100 yuan. In addition, De Shan Ji Ji donated 50 yuan, Huang Yu 300 yuan, and Xue Shao Sheng 1,000 yuan, totaling 2,450 yuan. The total amount outstanding is 39,660.50 yuan. Acknowledgment: Thank you to Mr. Shen for sending a western-style overcoat, six western-style suits, and six pairs of shoes and socks, instead of donating winter clothing money to this office. We thank you on behalf of the beneficiaries.
