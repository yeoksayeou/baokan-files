### New Trends in the European Situation

Italian Prime Minister Benito Mussolini resigned on the 26th of this month due to illness. King Victor Emmanuel III has assumed the supreme command of the Italian military and appointed Marshal Pietro Badoglio as the new Prime Minister. Simultaneously, the King and the new Prime Minister issued declarations to the Italian people, reaffirming their determination to defend the country and stating that the established national policy remains unchanged. They encouraged the people to remain loyal. Originally, during wartime, partial cabinet reshuffles and personnel changes to strengthen combat power in response to internal and external situations are not surprising. Moreover, Mussolini's resignation is reportedly due to health reasons. He did not want to delay the serious situation and made appropriate changes, which is a normal move. However, we should have a correct understanding of the general trends after this event. In particular, the market in this city has always been nervous and impulsive, and troublemakers spread rumors, causing public anxiety, which is an unnecessary worry. Therefore, we need to give a correct explanation.

First, we must point out that a week before Mussolini's resignation, on the 19th of this month, he met with German Chancellor Adolf Hitler in a town in northern Italy. According to the German official announcement: "They discussed military issues," "Reviewed the situation, and weighed the measures required by the current situation, and reached an agreement." (Central News Agency Berlin urgent telegram on the 20th) On the same day, the Haitong News Agency clearly pointed out the significance of the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini, saying: "This meeting between Hitler and Mussolini was held during a military crisis. The political leaders of the Axis powers are also military commanders. Therefore, their joint review of military affairs is inevitable. This situation coincides with the fierce battle on the Eastern Front and the Anglo-American invasion of Sicily. The Eastern and Western Fronts will both determine the fate of Europe. The future of Italy will be determined by the Mediterranean, and the future of Germany will be determined by the Eastern Front, which is the same. Therefore, it has a close relationship with the strategy of the Western Front. The enemy on the Western Front is driving its entire army to set foot in the territory of the Axis powers. Therefore, Hitler and Mussolini must conduct a realistic review. This meeting will surely prepare the path for victory." From this, it can be seen that Mussolini's resignation was the first item decided in the Hitler-Mussolini talks and implemented. This event was entirely a necessary measure taken to adapt to the new battle situation on the Eastern and Western Fronts. Therefore, we can assert: (1) Due to this move, the Italian front will be more organized and powerful, enough to deal with the enemy at hand, to fully support and counterattack the Western Front war; Italian internal and external problems can seek more appropriate solutions. (2) Italy's determination to resist will be firmer, its internal unity will be stronger, and its cooperation with Germany will be closer, to effectively implement the decisions of the Hitler-Mussolini meeting.

Second, we must know that in the current European war situation, the German-Soviet war on the Eastern Front and the Mediterranean war on the Western Front are both important, but in fact, comparing the two, the German-Soviet war has always been the center of Europe. According to recent telegrams, the Soviet Union is using all its national strength, staking everything, to promote its counter-offensive. An unprecedented large-scale decisive battle is about to begin. In order to take care of the overall situation, the Axis powers must pay attention to reality with a long-term perspective and an overview of the situation. Strive for a proactive position to seek opportunities. Therefore, in military terms, the Eastern Front is dominated by "blood-sucking strategy" and "attrition warfare," instigating the enemy's "passive offensive" to achieve its goals. On the Western Front, since the end of the first ten days of this month, the Axis forces have never launched a major real battle against the Anglo-American forces landing in Sicily. On the one hand, they lured the enemy deep into the northeastern mountainous area, in order to give them double consumption, on the other hand, they planned to give the enemy a greater blow. The most noteworthy point is that in addition to military affairs, they also focused on politics. We can point out today that Mussolini's resignation is undoubtedly the first step in responding to the political offensive in the Hitler-Mussolini talks a week ago.

Third, the unity of the German-Italian Axis has been integrated not only militarily, politically, and economically for several years, but also spiritually. Moreover, in continental Europe, the two countries have already become one, an alliance of offense and defense. No matter how rampant enemy rumors are, it is no longer possible to shake the unity. We can see from the clear declaration of the successor after Mussolini's resignation that there is no trace of discord, which further proves that the trend of the Axis future is clear.

From the above three points, it can be seen that Mussolini's resignation is entirely a planned action by the Axis powers against the enemy's actions, and is the beginning of the most powerful political offensive response outside of military affairs. In our East, we should recognize any hostile rumors, maintain calm, strengthen the Axis' confidence in victory, and pay special attention to combating any new attempts and unrest from the British and American sides. Today, our friendly country Japan maintains an advantage in the Pacific and on the East Asian continent. It also forms the most powerful wing for Europe. Everyone should look at the big picture to get the right conclusion.

### Fierce Battles on the Munda Front, Changes in the Dense Forest Land

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on the 27th, the Japanese and American forces have been fighting fiercely for days on the Munda front in New Georgia Island. The two sides have been shelling each other day and night. As a result, the dense forest area in that area has changed significantly. Seven enemy destroyers invaded the area on the 25th and continued to fire, and enemy planes also responded to this. From morning to dusk, they bombed repeatedly. The total number of enemy planes attacking reached 213, attempting to counterattack. The Japanese army is now fighting, still holding the battle line since July 21. They have either shot down enemy planes with ground artillery fire or defeated enemy forces attacking from the sea. The morale of the entire army is boosted, and they are determined to annihilate the enemy.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to a report on the 27th from a certain place, Mr. Ono Sataye, a Japanese who recently returned from the southern front, said: The Japanese and American forces are now engaged in a fierce decisive battle in the Solomon Islands of New Guinea. The morale of the Japanese army is far superior to that of the enemy army. The gist of the report is: I went to the south in May this year and experienced hardships with our soldiers. The impression I got from this trip is that there is absolutely no need to worry about the defense of the front. The Japanese have established an invincible energy. Because in a certain place where they lived, enemy planes often came to bomb twice a day, taking advantage of the night or cloudy days. This proves how strong the Japanese air supremacy is. Japanese soldiers welcomed the arrival of enemy planes. Because of the relationship of controlling the enemy's power, the small bombs that were dropped only slightly damaged the ground. The Japanese army not only suffered no losses, but also got a full meal because the fragments hit the coconuts and fell down. Recently, the Japanese army in the area has been planting sweet potatoes, pumpkins, cucumbers, etc. The captain took the lead in leading them. This is enough to show that even in the midst of fierce fighting, the lives of the Japanese soldiers are still comfortable.

Tokyo, 27th (Central News Agency) According to the front line news, the enemy air force previously attacked Makassar on Celebes Island and Surabaya on Java Island. Until the 24th, squadrons of giant bombers attacked the northern part of Timor Island and Dili, the southernmost part of the Japanese-occupied area, as well as Maikor in the Aru Islands of Anti-Buddha, Samlaki in the Tiirlaut Islands, and Kikuhua on the southwest coast of New Guinea.

### Japanese Planes Attack Chongqing-American Air Base

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – A squadron of Japanese army planes launched a surprise attack on the enemy’s forward American air base on the 23rd, preemptively striking to thwart the enemy's attempted movements. This action by the Japanese planes seems to have caused great terror on the Chongqing side. According to a Chongqing dispatch, the "Chongqing Central Daily News" on the 26th published an article emphasizing the strength of the Japanese army's air force, and hoping that the United States would increase its air power. The gist of the article was: Although the war in the Munda area of the South Pacific is extremely fierce, the Japanese army's attacks on the Chongqing forces have not diminished at all. They are concentrating many aircraft against Chongqing. This challenge to the American air force with new aircraft should not be underestimated. The anti-Axis countries should quickly increase air power in that area.

Guangzhou, 27th (Central News Agency) – According to news received from this source, an advance American air force base stationed in Chongqing, as well as Zilin, Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, and other places, have been repeatedly attacked by the Japanese air force in recent days, leading to extreme disarray. It is rumored that air raid alerts have been issued several times a day in recent days, creating an atmosphere of panic. Furthermore, the American air force stationed in Chongqing maintains strict secrecy regarding its actions due to the Japanese air raids. Every decision made is not communicated with local Chongqing authorities, which leads to Chongqing being unable to know details of the American planes' deployments and returns. Consequently, Chongqing authorities often mistakenly identify American planes as Japanese planes, issuing false air raid alerts. This lack of communication and cooperation between the American air force and Chongqing is now exposed.

### Model Youth Corps Going to Manchuria for Observation

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency) – The Model Youth Corps, led by Training Director Jiang Guangqi, will depart by train this afternoon (the 28th) for Manchuria to observe youth movements.

At 10:00 AM the same morning, they also visited the headquarters of the Japanese Expeditionary Force, where they were received by Staff Officer --sawa. They engaged in earnest discussions for more than an hour before taking their leave.

### American Reporters Join Chongqing Intelligence Department

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) – The U.S. State Department announced yesterday that, at the request of Chongqing, it has appointed four American reporters as advisors to the Chongqing Intelligence Department. Neutral sources here interpret this move by the U.S. government as an attempt to direct Chongqing's propaganda activities.

### Regulations on Withdrawals Cancelled in Syonan and Other Places

Syonan, 27th (Central News Agency) – After the Japanese army occupied Syonan, Malaya, and other places, it imposed restrictions on withdrawals of pre-war deposits in Chinese and Indian banks in the region to adapt to the situation after the occupation. As the business of local banks has improved daily, and new savings have increased day by day, it has been decided to cancel these withdrawal restrictions starting from the first of next month. Therefore, all pre-war deposits can now be withdrawn, which will undoubtedly invigorate the economic activities of the local population.

### Fierce Fighting Continues in Orel and Other Places; German Forces Recapture Mountainous Terrain Near Mius

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – A military correspondent for the Havas News Agency reports: Large-scale battles continued on the Eastern Front over the weekend. Soviet forces are continuously reinforcing their attacks on German positions. The enemy is increasing pressure south of Lake Ladoga. Whether this is a temporary phenomenon or the Soviet forces are establishing a second operational focus is difficult to predict at present. The enemy is also employing considerable forces in the Volkhov area and on the Shlisselburg front. German aircraft and reconnaissance teams are closely monitoring Soviet preparations for an offensive, and the German command has taken precautionary measures. German armored units counterattacked in the Mius River area, recapturing important mountainous terrain.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency) – Havas News Agency reports: The fierce fighting in Orel and other places has not ended. Military sources here believe that three weeks of fighting have weakened the Soviet offensive capability. The Soviet command has likely realized that repeated advances have yielded nothing and are tantamount to defeat. Soviet pressure on Orel has not decreased, but Soviet losses there have been heavy. The Soviet offensive between Belgorod and the Sea of Azov has diminished.

The third committee, chaired by Oda Nobutsune, discussed issues related to increasing food production and domestic self-sufficiency. The fourth committee, chaired by Tanaka Chie, discussed issues related to thoroughly implementing decisive battle living. The four committees convened for the entire day. Around 8:40 AM, Prime Minister Tojo, amidst his busy political affairs, took time to inspect each committee, listening attentively to the speeches of the council members. Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi, Minister of Interior Ando, and Minister of Agriculture Yamazaki also attended the various committees to listen to and respond to the speeches of the council members. At that time, Tokyo and the surrounding areas were conducting air defense drills, and the National Service Association's protection units were deployed inside and outside the venue in case of emergency. The atmosphere at the venue was extremely tense. The proceedings of the various committees on the second day are excerpted below:

First Committee: The main proposals in the first part included plans to mobilize scholars to conduct academic discussions and research with an emphasis on practical application, to launch a great spiritual movement to destroy the enemy, to revive the spirit of the Genko invasions, to restore ancestral traditions, and to popularize the spirit of Ninomiya Sontoku. Director-General Fujino of the Ministry of Education, Vice President Iinami of the Shrine Affairs Agency of the Ministry of Interior, and others explained the government's policies. In future policies, they will adopt as many of the recommendations in the above proposals as possible. Lieutenant Colonel Miyamoto of the Army Ministry then delivered a speech, expressing hope for cooperation in promoting decisive battle living. Ishiguro, Director of the Training Bureau of the National Service Association Headquarters, explained the Headquarters' policies regarding each proposal. Machida, Director of the Practice Bureau of the Industrial Patriotic Association, gave a concrete explanation of the industrial patriotic movement. The chairman then asked people other than the proposers to speak. Saburo Yotsukado spoke about the importance of cultivating officials in enhancing production. Rokuichi Koizumi emphasized that making clear the true state of the war to both superiors and subordinates is the fundamental issue in promoting decisive battle ideology. Takao Yamada argued that the phenomenon of joy and sorrow due to local victories and defeats on the wartime stage should be decisively rejected, and that the 100 million citizens should firmly maintain the determination for final victory. Miyazaki and Aoki proposed creating songs to destroy the British and Americans, sweeping the country to raise the spirit of decisive battle. In response, Director of the First Department of the Information Bureau, Muto, replied to the grievances about the government secretly concealing the true state of the war due to the nature of the war. At this point, the discussion of the first part of the proposals concluded.

The main proposals in the second part, regarding cooperation between the government and the people and matters of national guidance, included plans to establish independent youth schools and strengthen youth school education, to implement a compulsory system for girls' youth schools, to focus on vocational education to improve skills, to strive to cultivate excellent teachers, to establish full-time female instructors in various regions, for the state to manage the education of working youth and adolescents, to implement military education in girls' youth schools, to unify secondary schools and youth schools, and to strengthen national school education. Asa -- Ta-e (Vice-Chairman of the Japan Youth League) hoped that women would voluntarily serve the nation and hoped that society would improve its respect for working women. In response, Vice-Minister of Health and Welfare Takei replied: In the current state, the mobilization of male students should be further strengthened, and the same should be done for female workers. What should be noted here is the issue of conscription. Conscription is certainly the easiest method in terms of labor, but its impact on the spiritual aspect is extremely significant. Therefore, the authorities are doing everything possible to avoid conscription methods, so that the people will automatically reveal the spirit of labor and service to the country. Fujino, Director-General of the Ministry of Education, stated: The outline of the student mobilization plan has already been implemented, and regarding the mobilization of female students, he hopes that everyone's opinions will be fully considered and incorporated into future policies.

The opinions on this issue in this meeting will be fully considered and adopted. Following this, Sato, Chief of the War Preparations Section of the Army Ministry, explained the army's active cooperation in enterprise consolidation and the military's specific policies for the heavy industry sector. Hirai, Investigator of the Planning Board, stated: 1. As a result of this enterprise consolidation, the remaining workers in non-essential sectors will be able to make maximum use of minimal equipment to maintain national life and produce the minimum necessary supplies. 2. Regarding enterprise consolidation, the location of responsibility should be clearly identified.

In the afternoon's second committee, regarding the labor issue, Director of the Planning Board, Yamaguchi, replied: 1. I support the establishment of a national industrial reserve force. 2. I support the issue of conscripting students, but the types of schools should be differentiated. 3. The most appropriate form of wage payment is currently being closely studied with the relevant ministries. 4. The material distribution system for workers will be realized soon. 5. The problem of setting standard efficiency will be determined according to the actual situation.

Regarding the issue of national mobilization, Kujū Kodama (Principal of Meisei Middle School) hoped that the student mobilization outline would be implemented as soon as possible.

The mobilization of women has become increasingly important as the situation intensifies and is one of the most pressing issues at present. Sakuko Hani (Professor at Tokyo Free School) proposed an educational plan for women's mobilization. Hanako Muraoka (Director of the Tokyo Japan Women's Association) proposed paying attention to the physical and mental aspects of motherhood. Kiribuchi (Central Committee Member of the National Friendship Association) proposed mobilizing neighborhood housewives. Yamataka (Director of the Japan Women's Association) proposed regarding the conscription of women. Valuable opinions were put forward on the solution of this major problem.

Third Committee: The government's various emergency and permanent countermeasures for increasing food production during the decisive battle period can only be effective after the rural community is united and stable. This point concerns the strengthening of the rural leadership and guidance methods. The Third Committee had many valuable opinions regarding the food issue, arguing from the perspective of the leadership and mission of the landlord class, from the perspective of establishing rural education policies, from the perspective of comprehensive promotion strategies for rural guidance, from the perspective of combining rural spirit and agricultural technology, and from the perspective of the rural village system. Regarding the policy of increasing agricultural production, each council member stated the importance of adjusting the supply and demand policies from a specialized standpoint, and the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry's timely and focused guidance is essential.

In the afternoon, the meeting continued, discussing agricultural technology, fertilizer, labor shortages, and other issues that are the most direct obstacles to increasing food production. First, regarding technology, the number of part-time farming households has increased with the development of heavy industry, and their yields are extremely low. What methods should be used to ensure the rural structure? This is an urgent matter for agricultural technology guidance. Regarding the establishment of a very urgent labor mobilization problem in the busy farming season, the village and town heads are the chairmen, and the domestic food self-sufficiency increase production committee is set up to adjust the relationship between labor supply and demand. The chairman is given labor conscription -- and implements the planning and allocation. In addition, from the perspective of comprehensive food -- policies, raising prices for sweet potatoes, which are deeply related to increased production, and delegating distribution of exports to local officials, Ishiguro, Director of the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, replied to these issues:

1. The gradual increase in part-time farming households is an unavoidable state of affairs from today's reality. The government is working hard to implement policies such as establishing self-cultivating farmers.

2. Fertilizer was treated as one of the five major important industries in the previous meeting, and the government is working to ensure it. The composting movement is currently being implemented, and the two complement each other to break the current situation.

3. The importance of sweet potatoes is under consideration, and the establishment of storage facilities will proceed at the same time as the relaunch of this year's sweet potato and potato companies. Regarding transportation, close contact has been made with the Railway Ministry.

Finally, Kono, Director of the National Service Association Headquarters, said that the committee had been earnestly discussing the issue throughout with sincere and constructive opinions: The results of the committee, the association is also actively preparing for immediate implementation, not limited to rural areas, but also in the promotion of national movement, we should overcome all kinds of adverse conditions, in order to complete the food production increase, the meeting was held at half past five in the afternoon.

### Shanghai's First Orphanage: The Tushanwan Orphanage Inspection Tour (4)

In order to -- expand the Catholic cultural cause, in addition to the printing house, they also set up a "distribution center," divided into binding and sales departments, connected to the printing house factory. Equipped with electric ink absorption, paper handling, paper cutting, -- thread, binding, sizing, mounting, gold stamping and other -- type machines, undertaking all kinds of entrusted document binding, whether it is newspapers, magazines, classics, books, manuscripts, whether it is Chinese-style thread binding, Western-style cloth-covered spine, -- color can be chosen at --, the display counter of the distribution center is full of neatly decorated books, with the charm of making people attached. The sales department side, all the products of the hospital, such as statues, scriptures, Chinese and Western books, all kinds of records, have -- have -- have, and also sell books and magazines from Catholic churches in various provinces, etc., although they do not aim at profit, but the warm hospitality for the guests is already difficult to meet in Shanghai today.

Equally important contribution to religious culture is the hospital's attached photography and plate making department, including photography, photocopying, customized copper zinc plates each part, although the mechanical equipment is not the latest style, but still called complete management, the products piled up like mountains on the wall rack, can be said to represent the past achievements of the department, however, due to the position, the main service object of photography and plate making seems to be several churches and church members, as well as printing companies related to religion.

Palace of Art

The -- village of various paintings is mainly based on portraits—especially saints --, landscapes, still lifes, and religious history paintings, and also works to repair and enlarge photos, etc., lead paintings and oil are not few. Seeing their achievements, who would have expected that they were made by orphans of small age? If the scope of material selection is expanded to general historical paintings, and if they can jump out of the scope of tracing and enlarging, etc., with their usual religious cultivation spirit, and then draw drawing materials from the real society, then the future achievements must be unlimited. The paintings of the hospital have been repeatedly praised by the Nanyang Industrial Promotion Association, and in the midst of hard work, there must be better achievements in the future, -- which is especially --. One is the manufacture of hand-painted films, and the hospital technician is carefully dyeing the points of the film, almost stopping his breathing. The second is stained glass, in addition to being exquisite and beautiful, there are also bold and generous works, which are used for churches and luxurious buildings, and are the first production place for Chinese stained glass. It has always been sold at home and abroad. I am confused by the war and inconvenient to transport, there are many valuable orders still in the hospital, so that visitors can open their eyes.

### Huang Xuanping's Views: Steps to Stabilize Prices - Any Mild Strategy is Ineffective - Establishing a Standard Price for Essential Goods

Mr. Huang Xuanping, a member of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Materials Control Committee, recently made some remarks on the control of commodity prices. The full text is as follows:

Regarding the principles of commodity price control, I outlined the essentials in early 1942. Given the current situation, unless drastic action is taken, the commodity price control work in this city will be ineffective. Have we considered the social and economic repercussions if commodity prices continue to soar in the coming months or year? The salaries of tens of thousands of citizens are now being outstripped by higher living costs every month.

In my previous article, I pointed out that the prices of essential goods produced in Central China, which are sufficient for self-sufficiency, such as rice, flour, and cotton, can be stabilized. These essential goods should be distinguished from non-essential goods, which include luxury goods, imported goods, and irreplaceable items. Due to their scarcity, these items are sold at particularly high prices.

To stabilize commodity prices, a fixed commodity exchange ratio must be established. For example, six years ago, the transaction value of one dan of rice was equivalent to one bolt of cloth. The same exchange value ratio should be established now to stabilize prices and facilitate production.

It has now been proven that any mild strategy is ineffective in achieving the goal of stabilizing prices. Therefore, the following strict strategies are the only successful way to stabilize prices and are absolutely necessary to stabilize people's livelihoods. These strategies should be implemented simultaneously, on the one hand, to increase supply or production, and on the other hand, to reduce demand or consumption.

(A) Increase the supply or production of available essential goods:

(1) Purchase all essential goods from current owners at fair prices and allocate them to the public at cost prices.

(2) Determine a standard price for essential goods so that consumers can enjoy the benefits of fair prices. At the same time, producers will not have to worry about prices being too low, thereby encouraging them to continue production.

(3) Use funds and manpower only for businesses engaged in the manufacture of essential goods.
(B) Reduce demand or consumption:

(1) All loans should be limited to businesses that manufacture essential goods.

(2) Restrict food consumption.

(3) Implement full rationing, so that essential goods can only be purchased with tickets, with the tickets indicating the points representing various goods.

In fact, if banks, money shops, and trust companies could strictly limit loans for essential businesses and refuse to lend to speculative businesses, the price level would only reach a fraction of what it is today. The loan lists of banks, money shops, and trust companies should be immediately monitored. At the same time, all non-essential and non-industrial organizations and individual loans must be immediately recovered. The activities of silver companies should be inspected immediately. If these companies are not dedicated to production but are engaged in speculation, they should be ordered to close.

The rapid effect of implementing these measures often causes prices to fall. As a result, the fictitious value created not by seeking legitimate supply channels but solely by impressions and inflated demand is also eliminated.

At the same time, it is hoped that the food supply management authorities can understand the extreme importance of a continuous food supply and can supply on schedule according to the rationing plan, otherwise any stagnation or interruption will cause a serious reaction in prices.

### Notice on How to Display the National Flag - Issued by the Shanghai New Life Movement Branch

It is also learned that the branch will send personnel to correct the situation on the spot from August 1st to 3rd. The original text of the notice is as follows:

(A) Method of Hanging the National Flag

(1) Full Flag - The full flag means celebration. If there is a national celebration and the national flag is hung in various places on weekdays, it is called the full flag. There are two methods of hanging the flag: (1) If there is an upright flagpole, when raising the flag, first tie the upper and lower left corners of the national flag to the flagpole rope, or insert the flag rope into the flag tube and tie the two ends firmly, slowly raise it to the top of the pole, and slowly lower it when lowering the flag. (2) If there is no upright flagpole, first hang the national flag on the flagpole. If it is a single flag, it must be hung on the upper left of the door at an upward angle of 45 degrees, but the entire flag must be exposed outside the door. If it is a double flag, it should be hung crosswise in the center of the door.

(2) Half-Mast - In the event of a national humiliation memorial or the funeral of revolutionary martyrs and national heroes, the flag should be flown at half-mast to show mourning. There are two methods of hanging the flag: (1) If there is an upright flagpole, first raise the national flag to the top of the pole, then lower it to one-third of the entire pole (the short flagpole can be lowered to one-quarter). When lowering the flag, also first raise the national flag to the top of the pole, and then slowly lower it. (2) If there is no upright flagpole, first hang the national flag at one-third of the flagpole (one-quarter of the short flagpole), and then hang it on the upper left of the door, with the flagpole still at an upward angle of 45 degrees.

(B) Respect and Protection

(1) Be very solemn when saluting the national flag. (2) When raising and lowering the flag, stand at attention and salute, focusing on the national flag. When proceeding, if you encounter raising and lowering the flag, you must also stand at attention and salute. After the national flag is raised and lowered, you can continue to proceed. (3) In the event of damage or insult to the national flag, you should try your best to protect it and severely punish those who damage or insult the national flag. (4) When friendly countries raise and lower their flags, you should also salute to show friendship. (5) If the national flag is damaged, it cannot be patched, and it cannot be discarded or used for other purposes at will. It should be folded into cloth strips or burned with fire. (6) No matter where you are, if you see a discarded national flag, you should pick it up immediately. (7) The knots for tying the flag when raising the flag must be firm and not fall off midway. (8) The flag should be raised after sunrise in the morning and lowered after sunset in the afternoon. In case of windy, rainy, snowy, or foggy days, unless otherwise specified, the national flag should not be flown in the sky.

### The Last Scene of the China General Motors Cup Charity Football Match - United Association to Decide the Final Against Portuguese Jews Today - Held at Xuhui Middle School at 6:00 PM - Portuguese Jews Gather the Best of Three Teams to Wipe Out Previous Humiliation

The final scene of the China General Motors Cup Charity Football Match, the decisive battle between the United Association and the Portuguese Jews, is scheduled to be held at Xuhui Middle School Stadium in Xujiahui at 6:00 PM today.

Small Ball Performance

Before the match, a small football performance interlude will be added. It is a match between Hua Ying and Zhong Hua. The former is a strong team composed of directors and stars from the China Film United Company, with Gao Zhanfei, Shu Shi, Mei Xi, Yue Feng, Huang Shaofen, Li Pingqian, and Liu Qiong also determined to participate. It will definitely be a wonderful performance when they meet with the Zhong Hua team for the first time.

Main Force Battle

The main match is between the United Association and the Portuguese Jews. The United Association is the representative team of all Chinese in Shanghai, and the Portuguese Jews are a collection of the best of the St. Francis, Portuguese, and Jewish teams, and almost all the outstanding talents in Shanghai have been collected. It is no less than a disguised form of the Western United team. The team wants to wipe out its previous humiliation and has specially challenged the United Association, determined to avenge its previous defeat. Yesterday, the three giants of St. Francis, Portuguese, and Jewish teams, Fu En, Victor, and Maya, were convened at the Jewish General Assembly for a small group meeting to review and pay for the response policy, which took up to four hours. In addition to the original personnel, the lineup has been strengthened with the addition of three Jewish generals, Maya, Favan, and Cohen. The United Association is also waiting in full force. Liu Xianhan's skills have recently reached their peak. Li Tiansheng is still able to maintain his peak form. Together with Zhang Lin's sweeping style, they can be called a perfect match. Song Ling's illness has recovered. Qu Yongfu's skills have improved rapidly, and he assists the front line with Zheng Yingquan. On the front line, Li Yichen has vowed to change his ways and work hard. Sun Jinshun is getting stronger as he gets older and is jointly charging into battle with the vigorous Gao Baozheng. Wu Qixiang and Fei Chunhua are used on the wings, which is a planned deployment. Observing the strength of the Chinese and Western teams, the Western team is slightly inferior.

Economic Commentary

### Celebrating the Thrift Movement

Recently, the Shanghai News Association launched a week-long thrift movement, hoping to awaken the attention of millions of citizens in Shanghai, automatically implement wartime thrift life, conserve material consumption, help stabilize commodity prices, and promote people's livelihood. This can be regarded as a grand event.

However, the thrift movement can be divided into two types: the first is the thrift movement in terms of materials, and the second is the thrift movement in terms of spirit. The former is thrift in a narrow sense, and the latter is thrift in a broad sense. Thrift in the narrow sense of materials is certainly important, but thrift in the broad sense of spirit is very important.

For example, Gu Tinglin, a gentleman of the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, lived a life of shame, seeking truth from facts, not doing superfluous things, not saying superficial words, going to bed early and getting up early every day. Anyone who invited him to dinner would return home before sunset, believing that "among the people in the world, except for those who elope and steal, how can there be righteous gentlemen who travel at night." This is Mr. Tinglin's further spiritual frugal life, so he lived to the age of sixty-nine (born in 1613 AD and died in 1681 AD).

Longevity is hoped for by everyone, and the most important prerequisite for longevity is to save energy at all times, especially the frugal spirit in youth to reduce material desires. If the residents of Shanghai can promote the meaning of frugal movements, and everyone can go out early and return early, get up early and go to bed early, clear their minds and calculate their sorrows like Mr. Tinglin, then the material consequences of thrift will inevitably achieve a more incredible and perfect degree.

### Investigation of Materials in Warehouses in the French Concession Began Yesterday in Nine Groups

The Materials Investigation Committee is strengthening the investigation of materials, such as adding investigators, setting up review agencies, and strictly reviewing the qualifications of investigators. The formulation of measures to reward whistleblowing and the seizure of illegal hoarding of essential materials is being actively discussed and implemented. It is learned that the Chinese and Japanese investigators of the committee led 30 groups of investigators to investigate the hoarding of materials in more than 180 warehouses in the Public Concession area, and the investigation results have been submitted for review. Yesterday (27th), the investigation of warehouses in the French Concession area began. The two investigators, Deputy Superintendent of the French Concession Police and Chief of the Price Management Office, Chen Du Yang and Du Cha Mai Lefan, who were hired by the committee, led more than 40 investigators and divided them into nine groups to investigate. It is reported that there are a total of 50 warehouses in the French Concession area, and the investigation can be completed within a week.

### Oil and Grain Special Committee Drafts Unified Purchase Plan

The professional committees under the General Association of Commercial Control have been established one after another. Recently, it has been learned that the organization of the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, such as the selection of committee members and internal institutions, has been finalized recently.

### Cotton Cloth Industry Association Plans to Establish Cotton Cloth Joint Venture

The Cotton Cloth Industry Association of this city, in view of the fact that cotton cloth is one of the important materials and is closely related to people's livelihood, deems it necessary to organize a cotton cloth joint venture. It is learned that the joint venture is currently being drafted and prepared. It is found that the Cotton Industry Association has more than 2,000 members, all of whom will be members in the future joint venture.

### Warehouses Not in the Association - Hope to Register as Soon as Possible

The Materials Investigation Committee recently notified the Warehouse Industry Association that in order to implement the control of materials, warehouses and private storage places that have not joined the association should be reported as much as possible for verification. Therefore, warehouses in this city (whether exclusively operated or concurrently managed) that have not joined the association should register with the association before July 31st. According to their scale, they are divided into five grades: A, B, C, D, and E. The funds of the joint venture are also distributed according to the grade: 20,000 yuan for Grade A, 15,000 yuan for Grade B, 10,000 yuan for Grade C, 5,000 yuan for Grade D, and 2,500 yuan for Grade E.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose sharply, reaching new peaks. All stocks unanimously created unprecedented new highs. There were profit-taking sellers along the way, but with new and old investors actively participating, each stock quickly recovered after a slight dip, rising easily and sharply. Trading volume was quite robust.

The textile industry continued its upward momentum from the previous day. Wing On Textile, in particular, facilitated convenient transfer procedures and offered free exchanges of small-denomination new shares, making investment increasingly widespread, breaking through the major 300 level. Sincere broke through the Shanhaiguan (关外), accelerating its rise. Fan Feng also approached the 100 level. Chen Fong Dyeing & Weaving, Dahua Weaving, and Hong Sheng Weaving all showed strong performance. New China, Kuo Hsin, and Five Harmony made significant progress. Yan Feng Dyeing & Weaving, in a situation of low supply and high demand, broke through another level.

In the department store sector, Wing On Company initially soared above 100, but later retreated slightly. However, it still saw substantial gains along with Sun Sun and China Emporium. The bid prices for Lilian Department Store rose daily, but sellers were scarce.

In the cultural industry, World Book Company's rise accelerated, breaking through another level, with a high price as the final transaction price. There were many buyers for Yongxiang Printing. Commercial Press and Chung Hwa rose more slowly. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company retreated after exceeding a high level. Great China Match unexpectedly rose by more than 50%.

In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French and New Asia repeatedly broke through two levels. Min Yi, Five Continents, and China-West also rose strongly. Sincere jumped by several hundred.

In the public utility sector, Zhabei Water & Electricity and China General Edison Company saw gradual increases amidst thin trading. Ching Fu Shirt & Hosiery, with strong buying interest and limited supply, suddenly reached the 50 level. Ching Lun Shirt & Hosiery followed suit. Kiu An Industrial, bucking the trend, rose independently, increasing by more than 20% compared to the previous day. New high prices were repeatedly seen for China and Kuo Hua. New Asia Construction saw aggressive bidding from buyers. The capital increase plan for the Union Realty Company was decided, with a one-for-one bonus issue and old shareholders entitled to subscribe for one new share for every three old shares. New China Land Co. also rose substantially. Fumin Dairy and Chung Hing Woodworks saw demand exceeding supply. Hong Yuan Can Manufacturing broke through another level. Bidding for Kit Mei Food became increasingly enthusiastic. China Shipbuilding's new shares were well-received by buyers. China Film continued its upward trend from the previous day.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the gold shops in the city posted jewelry gold prices according to the limited price, and the handling fee was also the same as before, but there was no exchange. The off-market price rose again outside the barrier, and the silver price remained unchanged.

Government Bonds: The rise of unified government bonds was very sharp, among which the C type rose the most strongly, the D type was flat, and the other types also increased a lot.

Call Loan Interest Rate: The call loan interest rate of the Money Trade Association remained at two dimes and five cents.

Cotton Cloth: The market was soft due to continued nervousness. The market was very weak at the beginning of the morning, but it recovered slightly due to a slight increase in appetite from the customers. However, the result was still low. Fine cloth fell, and it has entered the ninth level. The Four Gentlemen broadcloth was flat. Peach Lady Lin spot goods, and Three Sheep broadcloth were slightly higher.

Yarn: The market situation was still very quiet, and because the mobile certificate was temporarily suspended, there was almost no transaction. The market was sluggish, and only 20 counts of Double Horse yarn had a bidding price.

Miscellaneous Grains: Miscellaneous grains were scarce, but the inventory was still available, so there was no shortage of goods. The sales market was minimal. Pudong wheat was within the sixth level, and Chongming soybeans were above the ninth level.

Daily Necessities: Matches continued to rise, such as the Phoenix brand has jumped out of two major levels, and other Rose Shanghai is also approaching the level. Soap and candles followed suit slightly higher. The trend of cigarettes is getting tighter, and the sales are getting stronger. The bidding price is unprecedentedly high, but there are no big deals.

### Lustrous Woolen Cloth - Short Supply and High Demand

Lustrous woolen cloth, those not woven from coarse wool yarn, various types of thick and thin woolen fabrics, have been exceptionally scarce in spot goods recently. The trend is unusually strong, and the selling price is expensive, to the point that it is difficult to purchase even with money. It is indeed evident that lustrous woolen cloth made of fine wool yarn is valuable due to the lack of spot goods.

### Red Tea Cores – New Pharmaceutical Factories Engaged in Procurement –

Red tea cores (also known as "flower fragrance"), due to continuous procurement by new pharmaceutical and chemical factories in recent days, have seen their inventory dwindle to depletion. Consequently, holders have become more reluctant to sell, while buyers, recognizing the difficulty in acquiring them quickly, have adopted a wait-and-see approach. As a result, trading has become quiet, and market prices have remained stable. The entire city has seen the pharmaceutical industry acquire only about 30 loads of the aforementioned type, with a reported transaction price of eight levels per load, sold by Wah On Tea Company. As for local stores, they are only making selective purchases as needed, acquiring eight loads of stir-fried green tea and over ten loads of common eyebrow tea, all sold by Mau Kee Tea Factory. The market situation is stable.

Activities of Various Trade Associations:

Seafood Wholesalers: The Shanghai Seafood and Sundries Trade Association has completed its preparations and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 30th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Fishermen's Association: The Shanghai Special City Fishermen's Association has also completed preparations and is scheduled to hold its inaugural meeting at 2:00 PM on the 28th of this month in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Bakery and Pastry Industry: The Shanghai Bakery, Steamed Bread, and Fried Dough Trade Association has extended the deadline for member registration to the 30th of this month due to the fact that some members have not yet registered. No further extensions will be granted.

Translation: The Price Problem and the Controlling Authorities

Why are prices in Central China so high now? What is the root cause? Regarding this point, there are indeed many reasons, and the fact that the controlling authorities have not yet unified is also a major one. Consider just Shanghai, in addition to China's controlling agencies, there are also the Shanghai Municipal Council, the Shanghai Municipal Government, and the Japanese side, forming a total of four systems, and there is no sufficient communication between each system. Therefore, even if there are reasonable methods, the expected results cannot be obtained. The price situation has come to this, and the failure of the controlling authorities to unify is indeed a cause.

Now that the Public Concession and the French Concession are about to be recovered, this is indeed of great significance. In the future, the Shanghai local controlling authorities will only be China and Japan. Moreover, the abolition of extraterritoriality has become a fait accompli, so there is no doubt that China will be the sole controlling authority in substance. In addition to expressing our great joy about this situation, we also sincerely hope that the Chinese authorities will recognize the importance of their responsibilities and take appropriate and sound measures.

In the future, for the Shanghai controlling administration, we hope that all measures will be based on the best performing past practices. In order to be reasonable and effective, we advocate that this more efficient administrative mechanism should be used as a model, and at the same time, the staff of each agency should receive equal treatment. And the treatment should at least be able to maintain a minimum standard of living. If this is not taken into account, and we talk about incorruptible politics, it will not be effective.

Blameless White Reeds By Ye Kewen

A few days ago, the temperature suddenly rose to over eighty degrees Fahrenheit, which seemed uncommon for such a warm season. As a result, people felt overwhelmed by the heat; our classroom, usually perched on the fifth floor, was deserted, but these past few days, it had become a popular spot for people to cool off. Especially the female students, they stood shoulder to shoulder, arm in arm, chatting, whispering, and joking in groups of two or three at the corner of the corridor... A gentle breeze carried the fragrance of lotus flowers from the campus, occasionally mixed with their playful, chasing laughter.

Our "Blue-Clad Poet"—this was the respectful title we gave to a classmate who loved poetry and always wore blue—seemed to have caught a lucky streak of merriment these past two days. Every time we saw him walking up from downstairs, he was always smiling happily. When asked what he was smiling about, he would invariably shake his large head and shrug his thin shoulders with a smile, replying: "I'm not smiling at anything, I'm saying 'Man is an emotional animal', which is certainly true!"

According to A-Q the Second, the poet had recently taken a liking to a first-year female student, the one who skipped and bounced up to the fifth floor every day—high-nosed, bespectacled, and a very mischievous girl.

The poet had asked his classmates for her name several times, but no one knew. So he often lingered near the roll call list, repeatedly looking at the names of the first-year students, but always scratched his head, sighed, and retreated. After that, the poet had no choice but to stoop and chat with the school workers, starting from every trivial matter in the school, but always ending up with her. "Hey, Lao Er, who is that long-haired girl in the first grade wearing a crimson short coat these past two days? Is she new? Why didn't I see her last semester?"

"That's Wang Qian, she's new." Lao Er squinted his eyes slyly and smiled: "She's quite diligent, be careful not to corrupt her."

The poet had lost weight, and shyness had made him suffer fruitlessly for a week.

Misfortune finally befell our poet. It was a bright morning, the sun warmly caressing the earth, a cool morning breeze gently blowing on people, birds chirping sweetly on the branches; the campus sent forth bursts of floral fragrance. A person in green approached the school gate and handed over a letter. It was addressed to:

No. 6473 E Road

Miss Wang Qian, First Year, Qiren University

Details Inside

Under her perusal of this letter, she was soon consumed by shame and hatred. Thus, she resentfully handed over this "mushy" love letter to the class leader.

This was an ordinary love letter, but what was peculiar was that the signature inside the letter was "Blue-Clad Man", and the mailing address written on the letter was precisely our poet's residence.

The poet began to fall into a state of suffering, but he could not stop these absurd rumors and unreasonable attacks.

The next day, our poet, who never missed a class, suddenly did not come to school. Around ten o'clock, a school worker handed me a letter, which I knew without being told was from the poet. I quickly opened it and read:

Yi Jun: Please forward this letter to all classmates.

Dear classmates: Because of frivolous jokes, it has finally brought about a tragic consequence. I am not good at words, so when innocent slanders came upon me, I was at a loss with a flushed face. Moreover, this matter has inflicted a greater shock on me. I know that even the most skilled debater in the world would find it difficult to make this matter not involve me, let alone someone as uneloquent as I am!

I can guarantee my character—I would never do such a despicable thing! Perhaps it is the students' prank! But this prank seems to be too much.

The Destruction of A-Long By Dongfang

A-Long was a junior employee in the fashion department of a certain company. He had worked diligently as a trainee for five years before finally securing this job. He was a very amiable person and was well-trusted by the director. If he could continue to work hard, his future would be very promising. With a monthly salary of over five hundred yuan, he supported a family of three. Although it was not spacious, he could manage to get by. This time, when he received his salary, he wanted to buy a straw hat, but after calculating, he really could not afford the extra cost of several tens of yuan. However, couldn't he think of another way? He thought of gambling, hoping to win some money to buy a hat, and take his wife to a movie, and buy some food to nourish his empty stomach.

With a hopeful and optimistic heart, he entered the gambling arena. At first, he placed his bets cautiously. Seeing the money in his pocket gradually decrease, he felt disappointed and became anxious. Gradually, he became somewhat dazed, only knowing to throw rolls of banknotes onto the table, losing all his money.

"This is terrible, what should I do? Alas!" It was a sigh of regret and frustration. "Should I seek death? No, there's no need! I can only think of a way to get some money, and then go back to win back my losses, and try my luck."

He returned home, not even eating dinner, and sat on the bed in a daze, thinking about how to get the money. He couldn't borrow it. His colleagues and friends were all suffering from financial "anemia," and, like himself, were often strapped for cash. To ask them for money would be harder than leading a camel across a ravine. He could only pawn some clothes. As long as he could win back his losses, he could immediately redeem them, or maybe even win some extra! So, without consulting his wife, he took his own leather robe and his wife's camel hair cheongsam and pawned them for four hundred yuan. Stepping into the gambling arena, he immediately broke out in a cold sweat.

Once, twice, the lessons could not make A-Long give up. He believed that his luck wouldn't be this bad, and he wouldn't keep losing. He gradually became addicted to the gambling arena. He didn't listen to his wife's bitter advice, or the persuasion of relatives and friends. He disregarded the livelihood of his family, and he pawned all his and his wife's clothes and all the slightly valuable items at home. Sometimes, he did win some, but he didn't redeem his clothes and belongings, but instead kept the money for his next bet. At times, he would redeem them, only to send them back to the pawnshop a few days later. He also lost focus at work, often arriving late and leaving early. Relatives avoided him because he often borrowed money from them. Gradually, the director of the fashion department became suspicious of him.

One day, A-Long lost all his money, and there was nothing left at home that he could pawn. This time, he had no money for the rent, rice, and coal, and he also had to repay the debts he owed to relatives. The clothes and belongings that he had pawned were also a considerable sum. He felt that his future was bleak and uncertain. He felt that life was boring. He thought of committing suicide, but he felt sorry for his family, for his wife and child. He racked his brains but couldn't come up with a solution. Suddenly, an idea struck him: "Let me borrow some clothes from the company for a while! As long as I win a little, I can quickly redeem them and return them. It will only be for a little while, and no one will know," But he didn't think about what would happen if he lost them.

The next day, he secretly took two pieces of clothing that customers had ordered but not yet picked up. Just as he was wrapping them in paper, preparing to take them away, the director discovered his theft.

His job was gone! He was lucky to have avoided a lawsuit!

Leaving the company, A-Long was like a wounded beast, dragging his heavy feet. All the past flooded into his mind: his wife's bitter advice, the persuasion of relatives and friends, the harmonious family and stable life before he gambled... Regret, hatred, sorrow, and anger gathered in A-Long's heart. He felt a strong pang of conscience. He had no face to go home to see his wife's sad face, to hear his child's innocent calls. He felt that everything was over. Gambling had broken his job and ruined his reputation!

The next morning, A-Long's body was found in the Huangpu River. Gambling had ended A-Long's young life.

In the Dark Night By Rong Xichun

I grope forward alone,

The night wind sweeps through the leaves,

Making a shrill sound.

It is just like the mourning of an owl,

There is no moon in the sky,

Nor are there any stars,

Boundless darkness

Envelops the long journey,

In the darkness,

I still grope forward,

The surroundings are so dim,

And so eerie,

Although I know,

The biting night wind,

Will congeal my hot blood;

The terrifying darkness,

Will frustrate my ambition,

But,

Like a crazy man with numb nerves,

Knowing nothing of the biting cold,

Knowing nothing of the terror,

Yet forever groping in this way,

Incessantly,

Wanting to seek

In this dark and long night,

A glimmer of light at dawn!

Dream By Zhang Xinjuan

Last night, I had a dream, a beautiful dream.

I dreamt that wings grew on my shoulders, and I flapped them, soaring in the azure sky. Flying, I flew to a majestic palace, gently knocking on the door of happiness. Later, I met a beautiful angel, her body draped in thin silk, like cicada wings, emitting the light of the evening glow.

Everything was beautiful, fantastical, I was joyful, delighted; intoxicated in that solemn yet sweet atmosphere.

Suddenly, in the haze, a green-faced, fanged giant was extending its demonic claws to snatch me away. Ah, how terrifying!...I mounted a snow-white steed, holding a gleaming sword. On both sides of the sword were engraved the words "Reason" and "Emotion". I wielded it, aiming it at the demonic claws. The sword light was as dazzling as lightning, startling and terrifying....

I heard celestial music playing in the clouds....

This was a dream, a beautiful and fantastical dream.

Thoughts on Loving Birds By Kami Roji Tadao

By making a small hole in a small box and hanging it on a suitable tree, you can make a nest inside. This is called a nest box.

Not only in Central China, but also in China, the number of trees is so small that it can be seen in the garden. The reason for studying the reproduction of birds is that the first thing to consider is the forest. In places where trees are scarce, the provision of nest box facilities will greatly help the reproduction of birds. Most Chinese people love birds, but the birds they love are often locked in cages, or tied their feet. I want people who love birds to understand the true meaning of loving birds.

The most important thing in loving birds is the birdcage. Our birdcage is as high as the sky and as wide as the earth. The birds in the world are the birds we love. People who love nature must be loved by nature. When people show kindness to birds, birds will also repay people with kindness. This point should be seen deeply by human beings.

Many birds breed in forests and grasslands, but due to the transition of spring, summer, autumn and winter, and the reasons for cutting grass and trees, birds breeding in grasslands will have no way to survive. People enjoy the autumn harvest, and when cutting weeds, they should consider that birds are also born by nature. It is the same as treating the birds flying in the air as the birds raised in your own cage. It is a great blessing for both people and birds, and the idea of making nest boxes will arise spontaneously. If the nest box movement spreads throughout Central China, the harvest of rural benefits can be imagined. We only need to use an empty box as a nest box and hang it on a nearby tree. From the bird born in its nest to its death, it will never forget the kindness of people.

Those who love people's virtue are birds, those who repay people's kindness are birds. For the benefit of the people, the implementation of the nest box plan should not be ignored. Ah!
