### Hope for Children's Day

Since 1931, when the China Children's Welfare Association initiated Children's Day on April 4th, grand gatherings have been held annually across various regions to commemorate it. Today marks the twelfth such Children's Day. We revisit the memorial presented by the Children's Welfare Association, which stated: "The rise and fall of a nation depend on its people; the strength or weakness of a people depends on its children. Children are the future masters of the nation and the central point for cultural transmission... to ensure everyone has compassionate thoughts towards children and assumes the responsibility of caring for them, while also enabling children to recognize their own position... to lay the foundation for a strong nation and a strong race." These words carry profound meaning. Although there's Children's Day every year and we annually offer perfunctory commemorations, after twelve years of promotion, how much active work has been done in practice to benefit children? Therefore, today, we do not wish to make timely articles of celebration or elaborate theories, but rather offer some minimal suggestions with a critical attitude.

Firstly, taking Shanghai as an example, children wandering the streets, reduced to being little beggars, are seen everywhere, covered in dirt, riddled with sores, with feeble pleas and emaciated, begging hands. Who doesn't have children? How can we bear to let them wander? Who says they are the masters of the future while they are aimlessly wandering the streets? The responsibility of raising these wandering children, who already lack protection, should be borne by society. When necessary, they should be forcibly taken in, and they cannot be allowed to continue wandering.

Secondly, there are also children who originally have parents or guardians who are raising them, but due to extreme poverty and lack of land, they simply cannot afford to raise them. These are children from extremely impoverished and hidden poverty families. Although they don't go so far as to wander, they live in constant hunger, let alone receive education. The number of these poor children must far exceed the number of wandering children, and society should show compassion to help raise them.

Currently, there are many charitable organizations in Shanghai that specialize in children's welfare, and their enthusiasm is commendable. However, to thoroughly achieve the above two objectives, there is no doubt that it is necessary to expand the scope. The most important thing is to hope that those with money and power in society will deeply sympathize with this significant work of nurturing the nation, jointly exert their efforts, replenish the funds of children's welfare organizations, and assign them to undertake the above-mentioned work.

What has been said above leans towards the aspect of "nurturing," which we believe is a prerequisite. As for the aspect of "education," it is, of course, equally important. Many plans already exist, so we will not elaborate on them here for now.

We further hope that next year, on this day, we will no longer see wandering children on the streets. In that case, today's verbal celebration will have achieved practical results, and only then will it be worth celebrating greatly.

### Prospects for German Submarine Warfare

In the half-month period from March 1st to 15th, the German Navy sank a total of 500,000 tons of enemy ships. Furthermore, in the four days following that, in a raid in the North Atlantic, they annihilated 32 British and American escort convoys, totaling 204,000 tons, setting a record unprecedented in the history of commercial warfare. In November of last year, the German submarine fleet sank 1,035,000 tons of British and American ships in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, the highest record since the start of the war. However, the results achieved in the entire month of March are expected to be no less than the aforementioned figures. Admiral Karl Dönitz, the highest authority on German submarine warfare, has only been in command of the navy for a month since succeeding Grand Admiral Raeder, yet he has already achieved such results. The improvement of the German naval lineup has instilled new terror in the British and Americans.

Since the beginning of the war, Germany has used submarine warfare to disrupt commerce as its primary means of operation against Britain. It has devoted its full efforts to building a large number of submarines and training crews. Therefore, the results of submarine warfare have increased month by month, with an average of 800,000 tons sunk per month since May of last year. Except for January, when the weather was unfavorable for submarine operations, the number of sinkings has increased each month. The British and Americans are deeply troubled by the threat of these German submarines. At the end of last year, Britain established an anti-submarine warfare committee, with Prime Minister Churchill as the chairman and the Minister of Military Affairs, the Chief of the Air Staff, the Secretary of the Navy Alexander, and the Secretary of the Air Sinclair as members, to vigorously study countermeasures to curb the submarines. As a result, the reduction in the number of sinkings in January of this year made Churchill proudly claim the success of the countermeasures committee, even declaring that the crisis of submarine warfare was a thing of the past. The new tactics of Marshal Dönitz's submarines, which were newly tested, instantly overturned Churchill's optimism from the root. The British naval authority Winster was killed in mid-February, and the ships on the anti-axis side are now on the verge of complete annihilation. In the previous great war, German submarines sailed around the North Sea to launch attacks in the Atlantic. This time, the situation is completely reversed. Separated from the British mainland by only a narrow strip of water, strong bases have been built on the south coast of Belgium and France, ensuring freedom to attack the Atlantic and Mediterranean. The threat faced by Britain and the United States is even greater compared to the previous war.

Under these circumstances, submarine countermeasures proposed by British and American experts include stepping up the construction of submarines and increasing the current escort method, that is, the ratio of one destroyer for every fifteen ships in a convoy, to three ships for every one. In order to make the speed of the ships counteract the surface speed of German submarines, the speed of the ships should be increased to over 23 knots. These countermeasures are now the central topic of discussion. Assuming these proposals are reasonable, it is impossible to implement them immediately given the British and American shipbuilding plans and shipbuilding techniques. On the contrary, the rapid increase in German submarines, according to the estimate of the Daily Herald, has increased eightfold from 70 at the start of the war. Moreover, Germany is building ships at a rate of one per day in secret locations, in factories that are absolutely safe from air raids. The implementation of British and American countermeasures seems impossible, while the number of German submarines is increasing dramatically. In contrast, what will be the state of commercial warfare in the future? The spring season, which is suitable for submarine activity, has arrived. On the Eastern Front, we are eagerly awaiting the German army's comeback. At the same time, we also have great expectations for the future of the commercial warfare implemented by Dönitz.

Tokyo, 3rd (Central News Agency): The air battles between Japan and the United States on the South Pacific front have become increasingly fierce. The elite Japanese naval aircraft have repeatedly repelled the counterattacks of the US Air Force.

As a result, the Japanese aircraft shot down 47 enemy fighters. On the morning of the same day, the Japanese naval aircraft first attacked Russell Island, encircling and attacking about 30 enemy "Dauntless" dive bombers trying to challenge the Japanese aircraft in the sky over the island, and shot down 24 of them. The Japanese aircraft suffered very few losses, with only three self-destructing or not returning. Subsequently, the Japanese aircraft also encircled and attacked 40 enemy "F4F Wildcat" fighters and 30 to 40 "Dauntless" dive bombers that came to reinforce.

The Congress closed at noon on the 3rd, with Speaker Chu Minyi leading the closing ceremony and giving a closing speech. He first expressed his gratification that the Congress had successfully concluded, and then pointed out that the focus of each case was on implementation, and that there should be no resolutions without action, or decisions without implementation. Finally, he expressed his gratitude to the representatives attending the Congress. Afterwards, Vice Speaker Jiang Kanghu approved the Congress Declaration and read it out. Then, Speaker Chu read out the congratulatory telegram to Chairman Wang, and all the attending representatives bowed to Speaker Chu to express their respect. The closing ceremony was then announced at the sound of music. That evening (3rd) at 7:00 PM, the Chairman hosted a banquet at the association's Xingya Hall to commend the attending representatives. After the banquet, there were entertainment programs, including domestically produced films, which were very exciting. The declaration of the Congress and the congratulatory telegram to the Chairman are recorded separately below.

Congress Declaration

This time, the Second National Congress of this association gathered representatives from China and Japan, as well as leaders from the cultural world, which is a great honor. This Congress has made significant progress compared to the previous Congress. At the time of the previous Congress, there were only five branches in Shanghai, Zhejiang, Jiangsu, Wuhan. This time, there are four more branches in Anhui, Anqing, Suhuai, and Subei, as well as branches in various places. The development of members has been quite significant. This is the first thing to be gratified about. The previous Congress was held in Hankou. Although there were many representatives from various places, there were only three from North China. This time, there are five from Beijing, two from Tianjin, one from Qingdao, two from Hebei, and two from Shandong. It can be seen that the cultural unity is becoming stronger and stronger, and the Republic of China is becoming more and more unified. This is the second thing to be gratified about. At the previous Congress, although there were many Japanese people in Wuhan, there were no specially sent representatives. This time, there are as many as fourteen well-known figures in the Japanese cultural world who have come to China. This is enough to show that the future of cooperation between China and Japan is becoming closer and closer. This is the third thing to be gratified about. At the time of the previous Congress, the National Government declared that it would share weal and woe with friendly nation Japan at the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. After a lapse of one year, one month, and one day, that is, January 9th of this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, and has moved from sharing weal and woe to sharing life and death. Therefore, friendly nation Japan abolished the unequal treaties, returned the Japanese exclusive concessions in various places, as well as the embassy area, and the Gulangyu Public Concession, creating the most glorious page in history, and forming a great era of modernity. At this association, we feel the infinite prospects of the future even more. This is the fourth thing to be gratified about. Although the era is greater, the responsibility is also greater. We must uphold the spirit of Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism and the purpose of Chairman Wang's New National Movement, and strive forward with one heart and one mind. The Book of Changes says, "A scholar cannot but be resolute and persevering, for his burden is heavy and his road is long. He takes benevolence as his own task. Is it not heavy? He will die and then it will be over. Is it not far?" Today, it is even more appropriate to encourage ourselves and others with this purpose, so that everyone can be like this, as a spiritual and material general mobilization of Greater East Asia, in order to live up to Dr. Sun Yat-sen's instructions and Chairman Wang's Mingjiao. Lying down, I believe that China and Japan have always been brotherly countries, countries as close as lips and teeth. However, in the past few decades, they have been alienated and provoked by Britain and the United States, so they have inevitably had friction, to the point of going to war in the same room, and boiling beans with their stalks. Speaking of this, it is heartbreaking. Fortunately, the wise men of the two countries have suddenly realized that in the future, to coexist and prosper together, we must first seek the communication of Sino-Japanese culture and the creation of East Asian culture, and use each other's strengths to make up for each other's weaknesses. This is the main point of Chairman's Wang instruction at this Congress. I hope that all our comrades across the country will work hard to promote it, so that all ethnic groups in East Asia will know and discuss it together, and work together to achieve it, so that they can jointly shoulder the responsibility of this great era and then they can live up to the mission of this great era. Sincerely speaking.

Congratulatory Telegram to the Chairman

Chairman, This time, the Second Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association was held in Beijing, and we were deeply moved by your instructions. Now that the task of the Congress has been completed, the colleagues have returned to their respective locations, and they will convey your instructions to comrades in various places, and strive to grasp their beliefs, be selfless, in order to live up to the expectations of restoring China and defending East Asia. Before leaving, I respectfully implore you to consider this. The Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association.

### Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō Visits Manchukuo; Premier Zhang Issues Statement: Sino-Japanese-Manchukuo Relations Become Closer

Xinjing, 3rd (Central News Agency): Zhang, the Premier of Manchukuo, met with a group of reporters today and issued a statement, the general idea being that Japanese Prime Minister Tōjō's decision to visit Manchukuo has been approved by our Emperor, who granted him an audience to pay his respects, and to celebrate our country's development over the past decade and to express gratitude for our country's cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Prime Minister Tōjō is very busy with political affairs, but his visit to our country is truly appreciated. Previously, Prime Minister Tōjō had visited Nanjing to meet with the Chairman of the Chinese National Government, and now he has come to our country again, which makes the relations between China, Japan, and Manchukuo closer and closer, and his contribution to the construction of the new order in Greater East Asia is great. The relations between Japan and Manchukuo have always been extremely close. Now that China has also joined this axis, China, Japan, and Manchukuo should work together to advance and complete the Greater East Asia War. Moreover, China, Japan, and Manchukuo are united by morality, so there is nothing to fear from Chongqing and the United States. We are confident that the final victory will belong to us. Since the National Government returned to the capital, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, it has been proceeding step by step on the road of restoration and construction. Recently, Japan returned the concessions in China, which has given a great shock to the Chinese people. Now the Chinese people have recognized Japan's true intentions, and more and more people are breaking away from Chongqing. Therefore, the anti-Japanese and national salvation promoted by Chongqing is meaningless. Fortunately, China, under the guidance of Chairman Wang, has embarked on the road of restoration. We are friends with this new China, and we will cooperate to build a new order in Greater East Asia. We are confident that we will be able to complete it.

On the one hand, if the treaty grants Switzerland the same privileges as other countries based on the most-favored-nation clause, then on the other hand, it was solemnly declared at that time that Switzerland was prepared to renounce extraterritorial rights at the same time as other countries. This declaration still retains its full value and applicability. The time for this declaration appears to be approaching."

### On the Road from Gafsa to Gabès: German Tank Units Counterattack; Denying Claims of Anglo-American Forces Meeting There; British Forces Suffer Setbacks in the Mountainous Regions of Northern Tunisia

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a German official news agency report last night, the German and Italian tank corps under General Rommel, after a long period of prepared planning, have achieved the final convergence with the troops of Lieutenant General Arnim. The British Eighth Army and the British and American forces fighting in Tunisia have repeatedly prevented the realization of this convergence. The major objective of the Allied large-scale offensive over the past nine days was precisely this, as the Allies deeply feared that the collaboration of these two parts of the Axis forces would greatly enhance their defenses in Tunisia.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters war correspondent with the American forces in Tunisia, early yesterday morning, the German forces launched a counterattack against the American forces with tank units along the road from Gafsa to Gabès. German artillery was very active, utilizing several concealed and observation posts, making it difficult for the British forces to detect. On Wednesday evening, American forces attacked northwest of Maknassy with tanks and infantry, met with fierce artillery fire and aerial attacks from the German forces. On the same evening, German aircraft were also very active in the El Guettar area, bombing for several hours. Yesterday morning, more than thirty German bombers and fighters attacked the vanguard of American tank units and supporting artillery units. At the same time, the Allied headquarters denied reports that the American forces under General Patton and the British Eighth Army under General Montgomery had met on the road from Gabès to Gafsa. According to the German side, the situation in northern Tunisia has improved, and German positions have been consolidated. Furthermore, according to the German News Agency, the British forces continued their attempts to encircle the right flank of the German and Italian forces on Thursday, but were ultimately defeated by the mobile strategy of the Axis forces. In the mountainous regions of northern Tunisia, German mechanized units, as the British forces began their encirclement, suddenly penetrated the flanks of the advancing British tank columns. This extraordinary offensive threw the British forces into disarray, causing them to retreat westward in a panic, suffering heavy losses in manpower and materials. The British forces changed their strategy and switched to attacking individually with small units, but the results were equally ineffective. Between Sened and Téboursouk, German and Italian ground forces, under effective air cover, attacked British anti-aircraft positions and artillery positions. German assault troops attacked British positions in the southeast of Testour and El Bardo, destroying two Wiltshire artillery positions. After a fierce close-quarters battle, the British forces left over three hundred corpses behind, and many were taken prisoner.

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Berlin report, German air force units fiercely attacked anti-Axis tanks and vehicle units artillery positions in the Tunisian theater day and night on Wednesday. Ten anti-Axis aircraft were shot down on the Tunisian front and in the area, and one German aircraft failed to return to base. Yesterday, anti-Axis intelligence stated that all fronts in Tunisia were very quiet on Thursday, but there was active reconnaissance activity in all areas. Medium bombers and light bomber squadrons also attacked the port of Sfax, but air force activity was hampered by poor weather on the front lines.

### South of Lake Ladoga on the Eastern Front: Soviet Offensive Repulsed; Major Battles Also Expected in the Kuban Bridgehead Area; Moscow Announces End of Winter Counteroffensive

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – Military sources announced last night that Soviet forces, who launched a local attack on the German bridgehead in Kuban, were repulsed by German forces yesterday and suffered heavy casualties. It is understood that the Soviet forces launched their main attack on the German positions east and north of the bridgehead. German artillery and air force dispersed the attacking Soviet forces. The Soviet supply base of Bataisk, south of Rostov, also suffered an effective attack.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to official sources last night, German forces, who were fiercely fighting south of Lake Ladoga, again repulsed repeated Soviet attacks on Thursday. The only major combat on the Eastern Front at present is in that area. The Soviet forces initially launched a fierce attack with artillery, followed by infantry assaults on the German lines several times, but the front of their attack was smaller than in the previous few days. All attacks were repulsed, and the Soviet forces failed to cross the positions in front of the German lines. German infantry units north of Lake Ilmen on the Volkhov front were particularly successful in operations against Soviet tank units. One infantry unit destroyed 68 Soviet tanks in the past few days, while another infantry unit destroyed 79 Soviet tanks in the past nine days. Further south, German forces launched local attacks in the areas west of Kursk and east of Sevsk, reoccupying many villages. Soviet forces in the central region are no longer using the tactic of separate attacks to test the strength of the shortened German lines. According to the military correspondent of the Havas News Agency, after the ground in the Kuban bridgehead area dries up, there may be large-scale war developments here in the near future. Although there are only local battles at present, even in the spring of last year, after a more severe winter, the climate of the Crimean Peninsula (where the climate is the same as that of the Kuban region) had allowed German forces to begin a large-scale offensive by mid-April and reassess the Kerch Peninsula. At the same time, the Soviet high command apparently also recognizes the German bridgehead around Novorossiysk as a dangerous German offensive base, so they are eager to eliminate this danger as soon as possible. The Soviet forces have concentrated around and north of Krasnodar in the past few days, seemingly preparing to launch a major attack in the near future, but the German high command is of course prepared for this. The orderly shortening of the lines by the German forces in the Kuban region has strengthened the German positions, and the undaunted fighting spirit of the German forces can be fully demonstrated by the heavy losses suffered by the Soviet forces in recent local attacks.

Moscow, 3rd (Central News Agency) – The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communiqué on the 2nd, stating that the winter counteroffensive ended on March 31st.

### Fire at Iranian Oil Refinery

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Havas News Agency report from Sofia, a fire broke out at the oil refinery in Abadan, Iran, causing severe damage. Details are not yet known, but it is said that this is the second major fire at the refinery in six months.

### Talks Concluded in Canada: Eden Returns to England by Plane; Gives Speech at Canadian Parliament Before Departure; Acknowledges Axis Submarines as the Greatest Threat

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a report from Ottawa, British Foreign Secretary Eden left Ottawa by plane on the 2nd. For security reasons, the destination is kept secret, but it is believed to be a return to England.

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Ottawa, British Foreign Secretary Eden, after meeting with President Roosevelt in the United States, arrived in Ottawa on the 30th to exchange views with Canadian Prime Minister King on the issue of defending against Axis submarines. On the 2nd, Eden also gave a speech in the Canadian Parliament, pointing out the threat posed by Axis submarines to the anti-Axis powers, saying in essence that Axis submarines are indeed the greatest threat we currently face. We must not indulge in wishful thinking about this, and we must organize and actively research submarine defense technologies in the future. If there is any negligence, it will inevitably lead to great danger. We must not underestimate the strength of the Axis forces. Eden also mentioned his visit to the United States, saying that his previous talks with Soviet leaders, and this visit to the United States, can be said to be a continuation of the previous visit to the Soviet Union. The impressions given to him in these two meetings were extremely profound. After giving his speech, Eden continued to hold talks with Canadian government leaders. It is reported that the focus of the talks was on maritime transport and future political and economic issues.

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a Daily Mail correspondent in New York, British Foreign Secretary Eden and Ambassador to the United States Halifax declared that Britain regards its colonies as its own internal affairs, not as affairs of the Allied nations. Therefore, their administration is not subject to outside interference. However, Eden also said that Britain may be willing to have its territories agree to be jointly managed internationally, but this management does not involve the internal affairs of the colonies.

### Swedish Foreign Ministry Denies Severing Relations with France

### European Atlantic Coast Defenses Extremely Strong; German Side Says Sufficient to Resist External Attacks

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) – According to a German announcement yesterday, the defensive wall along the European Atlantic coast is 2,700 kilometers long, 200 kilometers longer than the world-famous Great Wall of China. This figure only includes the defensive works along the English Channel and the Atlantic coast, and does not include the defensive works along the coasts of Denmark and Norway. Moreover, the Great Wall of China is only a single-line brick and earthwork, while the Atlantic Wall is winding and intricate, and is truly the latest modern defensive and offensive mechanism. During construction, careful calculations were made regarding the range of the artillery and the length of the transportation lines. All submarine bases, airplane landing fields, and roads, etc., are all in good order. According to experts, this is the world's greatest defense project, and it is sufficient to resist any external attack. One can be even more confident in view of the British attempt to land at Dieppe, which ultimately failed. It is recalled that at least 500,000 workers were employed in the construction of this project (not including workers in the industries supplying building materials and facilities), as well as thousands of huge construction machines, tens of thousands of various vehicles, 1,500 kilometers of narrow-gauge railways, and thousands of stations, all of which were temporarily installed. In one area, transportation vehicles traveled as many as 30,000 kilometers per day, while in another area, up to 3,000 tons of materials were unloaded per day. Each soldier stationed there is protected by 50 to 100 cubic meters of reinforced concrete. During construction, all forests were leveled, and the entire area was washed with water to complete it. The scale of the project is evident.

### Internal Strife in the Anti-Axis Front and Prospects for the German Summer Offensive

Imai – President Hitler's recent speech emphasized the upcoming spring offensive and also stated that the German army's mission in this war is to curb the expansion of communism and prevent it from invading Europe. So, what are the observations on the German-Soviet war?

Mogi – Both Germany and Britain see the German-Soviet war as the key to deciding this war. There are various opinions on whether Germany will launch a major offensive this year. Some believe that Germany is currently focusing on consolidating the so-called "Fortress Europe," so it is expected to take a defensive offensive and will not launch an offensive as large-scale as before. But even if its goal is really to establish "Fortress Europe," it will still have to launch a new offensive. After the total mobilization that is currently underway is completed, a large number of fresh troops can be obtained, so this is the final decisive battle against the Soviet Union. But this operation will be extremely cautious to prevent the British and Americans from taking advantage of the situation. President Hitler once again emphasized that Germany is the only dam against communism, which is a rather thorny argument from the perspective of Anglo-American dominance.

Imai – Yes, the Soviet Union, which aims to overthrow capitalism, forming a joint war front with the most capitalist countries, such a foolish political compromise does not exist on the Axis side.

Mogi – Now let's look at the situation on the German side?

Imai – President Hitler announced that the total number of German soldiers killed in action since the start of the war is 542,000. It is surprising that so few have been sacrificed in such fierce battles. Germany and the Soviet Union will both lay their lives on the line this year, meeting for the third time on the battlefield. What is the general assessment of the Soviet Union's war-fighting capabilities?

Mogi – Details are of course unknown, but the numbers generally reported are as follows:

In terms of food, last year's harvest, excluding feed, was 23 million tons, while the annual demand is 30 million tons. However, there is a considerable amount of storage, so food does not seem to be a problem in the next two years. In terms of oil, the Baku production is 24 million tons, transported by boat on the Volga River, but what the current situation is is a question. Areas outside the Caucasus produce 10 million tons, and there is also 10 million tons in storage, while the annual demand is 20 million tons, so it seems that supply can also meet demand. In terms of weapons production capacity, the monthly production is 1,300 aircraft and 1,200 tanks. The strength of the forces on the European front line is 6 million, 800,000 in the Far East, plus the border guards, totaling about 9 million. So the current mobilization capacity is 4 million to 5 million. From this perspective, the Soviet Union Germany can similarly lay their lives on the line this year. In this year's attack, regardless of whether the Soviet Union is subdued or not, in order to directly oppose Britain and the United States, the war against the Soviet Union cannot but seek an end. Therefore, this summer will be the peak of the German-Soviet war.

Imai – When the Soviet offensive continued, it prompted Britain and the United States to quickly open the first war front, but they ultimately lost this good opportunity. From a military point of view, if the Tunisian front cannot be consolidated, a second front is impossible. This situation remains unchanged to this day. Although the Eighth Army has already begun a general attack, it is reported that the British and Americans have a total of thirty divisions and forty aircraft in North Africa. While Rommel and Arnim's two Axis armies only have about ten divisions. The Axis armies have successfully prevented Britain and the United States from opening a second war front. But in these two or three months, Britain and the United States have been stepping up rear transport, sending some to the Tunisian front and others to the West Asian region. They seem to be eager to end the Tunisian front as soon as possible and start a second front from the eastern Mediterranean. The Axis forces are not willing to lag behind, and are preparing in a timely manner. (Xiang: Translated from the March 27th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun) (End)

### Sino-Japanese Economic Symposium (2) Convened by *Continental News* and This Newspaper

Date: 32nd year, 32nd day of March

Location: Sino-Japanese Club

Mr. Kurimoto: There is a saying in China, "No rain without clouds." Merchants are likened to clouds, and materials are likened to rain. Now, within the hope for material exchange, there is a belief that merchants who exploit China are unnecessary and should be eliminated; however, if merchants are eliminated, materials will likely not move. This point seems to need consideration. What does Mr. Li think? The status of merchants needs to be confirmed. It's like cause, condition, and effect – all three are indispensable. Just like a grain of rice placed on a carpet will never sprout into rice, it needs soil, water, and sunlight to bear fruit in autumn. Similarly, for the exchange of materials, merchants are indeed an indispensable and important component.

Mr. Li Quanshi: That's correct, but in this era of control, seeking exorbitant profits is not allowed; if one is satisfied with appropriate profits, then merchants naturally have a need to exist.

Mr. Yao Qingsan: I have continuously advocated for measures to ease the movement of materials and for the establishment of a national commercial control association since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. I am extremely pleased to see these measures being implemented now, beyond words. First, regarding the national commercial control association, the Japanese authorities' transfer of material control rights to China is a wise move, and it is indeed only when managed by the Chinese themselves that the cooperation of the people can be obtained. The most important point here is the spirit of mutual understanding, and the foundation of mutual understanding is equality and fairness. In the future, all control measures should be implemented comprehensively, regardless of nationality. There should be no favoritism towards Chinese merchants, nor favoritism towards Japanese merchants; moreover, impartiality is needed to win sympathy. Secondly, regarding the measures to ease the movement of materials, I believe that unnecessary controls should be removed. For commodities where the government can control the source of supply and implement rationing on the consumption side, control should be imposed. As for other commodities, it would be better to allow free buying and selling, because having only price controls without rationing will only reduce the effective supply in the market, making it difficult to meet consumer needs. The flow of currency will inevitably encourage hoarding and fuel the black market. Past experience should serve as a guide for us in the future.

Mr. Takeuchi: The price problem is best regarded as the ultimate crystallization of economic problems. If we conduct a comprehensive review of this price problem, we will naturally understand the direction of future economic policies. Moreover, the fundamental problem of people's livelihood and future economic operations is also a very important issue. Regarding this problem, I would like to ask Mr. Kiuchi to express his overall opinion.

Mr. Kiuchi: The price problem is indeed the most difficult. As Mr. Takeuchi suggested, it is a combination of political and economic phenomena. Currently, prices are rising at a very rapid pace, and people believe that this rise has almost no hope of stopping. However, I am not so pessimistic about this point. Why? Because the main reason for the rise in prices is the restriction on the exchange of materials. As a result of this new policy, if the restriction on the exchange of materials can be lifted – it goes without saying that it cannot be completely lifted, but even if it is mostly lifted – then the biggest cause of price increases will be eliminated. In this sense, this time, the lifting of the existing movement restrictions depends on the success of the Chinese side's autonomous control organization – the success of the activities of the autonomous control organization in the private sector. In this sense, if the private, autonomous commercial organization to be established this time is successful, then under this condition, the price problem will be largely resolved.

Furthermore, regarding the current rise in prices, there are very different opinions. Some believe that it is due to the difficulty in maintaining the value of reserve certificates. For example, the recent rise in prices is attributed to very unfavorable rumors about the Axis powers' situation in the German-Soviet war and the North African war. Regarding this point, it is absolutely certain that the Axis powers can achieve final victory; the view that the Axis powers are at a disadvantage is clearly a mistaken understanding. Moreover, the public's speculation about the amount of reserve certificates issued is far greater than the actual figures. This is also an extremely wrong perception, poisoned by rumors and gossip.

The above are the reasons why I believe there is no need to be pessimistic about the future of prices. Now, let me briefly express my humble opinion on how the future control policies should be implemented.

In what direction should future price policies proceed? As Mr. Yao mentioned earlier, control should only be exercised over the materials that the controllers have in their grasp, and for the rest, they should be largely allowed to be free. This is the general direction. The materials that the controllers have in their grasp are, needless to say, rice imported from the south, cotton yarn and cotton cloth from Shanghai, as well as cigarettes and matches, etc., which can be used as so-called materials for granting certificates. These can be regarded as materials in the grasp of the controllers. The prices of these materials in the grasp of the controllers should be maintained at a low level and, as Mr. Li initially said, exchanged for production materials in the interior. If these two things can be done in this direction, it will largely be enough to establish the economic foundation of Shanghai. As for other materials, it is generally okay to allow them to be free. This so-called allowing them to be free, according to the current understanding, seems to make prices rise even further; but if we recognize that freedom means exchange, then in reality, we can expect the result of maintaining price levels. This is a very ordinary view and no different from what you all often say.

Mr. Takeuchi: Mr. Pan, please—

Mr. Pan Yangyao: (1) After the transformation of Japan's new policy towards China, it is hoped that the Japanese side will respect the convenience of Chinese merchants having free trade within the framework. The mutual exchange of agricultural products from the interior and manufactured goods from Shanghai should be facilitated to achieve free and smooth material exchange. Unnecessary restrictions and extremely cumbersome procedures in the past should be eliminated from now on, so that the difficulties faced by merchants can be avoided from now on. All monopolistic, encroaching, and profiteering behaviors of intermediaries will also not arise. If this can be done, then manufacturers can safely manufacture and step up production, and trading merchants can also assess the needs and supplies of the local area and various provinces and cities, and move goods from where there is surplus to where there is a shortage, in order to balance prices and stabilize the market. This is what we deeply hope the authorities will pay close attention to and realize. At the same time, we hope that Chinese and Japanese merchants will each strive for the balanced development of each other's businesses on an equal trading footing, so that Shanghai, the economic center, can easily change its past situation and gradually move towards prosperity.

(2) The biggest problem with current prices is that those who have goods are unwilling to sell them, while those who have no goods are desperately buying them. Factories, with the cost of raw materials they have stored increasing daily, would rather hoard raw materials to wait for a good price. Even if they manufacture finished products, considering the price limits set by the authorities, there is a loss without profit, so they would rather hoard finished products to wait for a good price. As a result, those seeking goods have no way to buy them and have no choice but to secretly pay high prices in the black market to seek goods, thus creating black market prices. Therefore, if we want to eliminate the black market today, the first thing to do is to seek a sufficient source of raw materials. At the same time, for foreign raw materials, we should seek the invention of substitutes. Secondly, price limits should be relaxed to give those who have goods a chance to sell them. For example, 20-count cotton yarn has an official price of 5,500 yuan, but many cloth factories have no way to buy it. Seeking it in the black market is even more afraid of breaking the law, so they have no choice but to stop or reduce work, and cloth becomes less and less, and cloth merchants naturally become more speculative. As a result, it is said that "the more prices are limited, the higher the black market prices become." How painful these words are! Therefore, in the current era of stepping up wartime production, smoothing the source and increasing production is a fundamental solution, but relaxing price limits to make those who have goods willing to sell them is a way to eliminate the black market. Some say that if price limits are relaxed, black market prices will be even higher. In fact, if the official price is already relaxed, who would be willing to be speculative again? It is an unnecessary worry. However, when setting official prices, it is necessary to make precise calculations using scientific methods based on the cost of raw materials, workers' food and wages, and all actual expenses, and do so in a completely fair and impartial manner, then all problems will naturally be solved easily.

(3) Reviving Shanghai factories is impossible at present. Maintaining the remaining factories already feels extremely difficult. Why? Because transportation is difficult, procedures are cumbersome, the source of raw materials in the interior is already felt to be not easy, and the outlet for finished products, in addition to being absorbed by hoarders, is also felt to be very difficult. This is one reason. Electricity is subject to restrictions, this is another reason. Workers' food is not easy to obtain, this is yet another reason. The difference between the cost of finished products and the price limits is too great, this is yet one more reason. The survival of a factory depends on raw materials and finished products. In other words, the way in and the way out. Now that both the way in and the way out are exhausted, how can we expect to revive it? There is no other way but to seek to increase production within the minimum limit. We hope that the agricultural and sideline product raw materials that we rely on from the interior can be transported in steadily in the future through the sound transportation system and the simple transportation methods, so that the finished products produced can also be gradually transported to the interior to realize the purpose of material exchange between inside and outside. At the same time, we should improve machinery and equipment, recruit technical personnel, and adopt factory rationalization to achieve the greatest efficiency with the least amount of time, manpower, and economy. Then, with lower costs and more products, Shanghai, the industrial center of China, may be able to take the first step in increasing production before talking about reviving industry, so that it will not be just empty talk.

(4) Although Chinese factories have not yet escaped the stage of immaturity, after years of hard work, their machinery and equipment, technical improvements, and excellent products have been unanimously recognized by people at home and abroad. In particular, many old factories, with their rich reserves of raw materials, good reputation, and huge assets, at a time of soaring prices, it is only natural that their stocks are being snapped up. Moreover, Chinese stock trading is also the foundation for promoting the Chinese capital market. Since the trading is legitimate, it is not without its benefits in increasing the amount of funds for production and promoting the development of Chinese industry. This kind of normal trading is naturally beyond reproach. However, with too many stock companies being established, there may inevitably be competitive trading. If it is purely spot trading, based on fixed assets, and considering future trends, determining a compromise and appropriate stock price is also beyond reproach. Recalling the past Chinese Stock Exchange, it only traded public bonds, which has long been suspended, and it does not trade Chinese stocks at ordinary times, so there is no direct relationship with Chinese factories and there is a lot of estrangement. The foreign merchants' General Chamber of Commerce has also been suspended for a long time. In the future, if we want to create a formal market for legitimate trading, we should start with reviving the Chinese Stock Exchange, consult sincerely with the original personnel and the leaders of the Chinese stock industry, and organize its establishment as soon as possible to specialize in the trading of Chinese stocks. With a legal organization and legitimate trading, the long-standing problem of the Chinese stock industry will naturally be completely solved. (5) This time, the Japanese government and the public resolutely implemented the relaxation of material movement restrictions and trusted Chinese merchants to automatically organize the National Commercial Control Association, which has been unanimously admired by all parties, who believe that this policy change has indeed given Chinese industry and commerce a glimmer of hope for a turnaround. However, the success of this association carries a great responsibility and a arduous mission. It must strive to do its work with a fair and frank attitude, without selfishness and without considering personal relationships. All cadres and personnel in various departments must be honest and self-disciplined, work wholeheartedly and earnestly to serve the legitimate industrial and commercial circles, and make this arduous task proceed smoothly to live up to the expectations of all parties. Regarding the procedures for material movement, we should not only seek to be strict, but also seek to be simple and efficient. Regarding the results of the review, we should not only seek to be detailed, but also seek to be fair. We hope that for the movement of materials inside and outside the urban area, we should not only entrust the trade association to be responsible for reporting, but also add multi-faceted spot checks and secret investigations, so that those who take advantage of opportunities to cheat or violate laws and regulations to apply their tricks will be deterred. Then, after a year and a half, we may be able to see some results. It depends on whether those in charge can work hard and whether they have the perseverance and determination.

Mr. Kurimoto: Then, regarding the general price problem, the gentlemen have already spoken very thoroughly. This is a very difficult problem, and we can always say more. Now, I want to move away from theory and talk about practical issues. In the past, when silver existed – when there was so-called safe existence of hard currency – the view of goods was that as long as there was money, anything could be bought. Now, it has changed in the opposite direction, with the psychological state of thinking that as long as there are goods, any amount of money can be exchanged for them. Is it not necessary to restore this general view to the original psychological state of thinking that as long as there is money, anything can be bought? Then, what method should be used? It goes without saying that it is to put goods in a state of sufficient circulation so that what is needed can generally be bought. However, the current state is not such that anything needed can be bought. The idea that stabilizing the faith in currency requires making goods abundant to stabilize prices is difficult to implement.

Therefore, even though there are not many goods here, what is still enough to reassure the general public is the relaxation of material movement restrictions that has been announced this time. At the same time, the fact that the restricted affairs, which were previously executed by the government, are now being managed by the private organization National Commercial Control Association, is it not giving a huge sense of reassurance to the general public? Therefore, the responsibility of this so-called National Commercial Control Association is very heavy. If the exercise of its powers is flawed, the drawbacks will also be great. It may be a bit laughable (laughs) to say that this association can make the few goods more abundant, but it must be understood that saying that is simply a propaganda method to stabilize people's hearts. Finally, I want to reiterate that if we want the control to be carried out very smoothly, we must use the agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors in a very proper and impartial manner.

### After Reducing Tram Stops, the Number of Trips Has Increased, Passengers Are Still Extremely Crowded, Authorities Try to Prevent Accidents

According to a report from the *Datong News Agency* to the Shanghai Tram Company, the Tram Company has implemented measures to reduce stops and designate express trams to increase the speed of the vehicles and the number of round trips in order to reduce crowding.

Increased Number of Tickets Sold

The situation in recent days has proven that this measure is indeed effective. According to accurate statistics, the number of trips made by each tram per day has increased by two to four times. Although the crowding phenomenon has not decreased significantly in reality, the number of tickets sold each day has increased.

Preventing Fraudulent Ticket Sales

At the same time, the company has recently implemented the following measures to prevent ticket vendors from committing fraud: (1) Adding plainclothes ticket inspectors to detect fraudulent behavior that is not easy to prevent when selling tickets; (2) Rewarding ticket inspectors for reporting fraud; (3) Encouraging passengers to purchase monthly and seasonal passes and providing various conveniences to those who purchase tickets as much as possible.

Continued Cooperation to Eliminate Pickpockets

The tram authorities are deeply concerned about the danger of accidents due to the current crowding situation, so they have dispatched a large number of route inspectors to each major station to guide passengers at any time. Finally, it is learned that the tram company authorities will continue to cooperate fully with the police department's planned second campaign to eliminate pickpockets, which will begin on the 12th.

Signs Posted at Stops Not Served

Since the operation of express trams began, ten unnecessary stops have been eliminated. In recent days, some passengers have not been aware of this and have felt inconvenience. It is learned that the tram company has added signs to the abolished stops on the utility poles of the eliminated stops and posted slogans at the stops not served by express trams since yesterday (the 3rd) to draw the attention of the general public.

### Loving Our Own Children and Extending That Love to the Children of Others: A Quick Sketch of the Children's Welfare Symposium

Today is the 12th annual Children's Day. Before this day, shops in Shanghai generally adorned their display windows with colorful children's toys, allowing fortunate people to bring their fortunate children to purchase them. Various elementary schools are also preparing programs to celebrate Children's Day. However, we can also see countless children wandering the streets, unable to get two meals a day and unable to find a place to sleep at night.

They also have Children's Day, but Children's Day does not bring them happiness, joy, or education. Of course, there is no question of making them understand their responsibilities as children. All they enjoy is hunger, cold, suffering, and the relentless oppression of a harsh environment.

Prices are rising day by day. The more than thirty relief organizations that originally existed in Shanghai not only lack the capacity to take in new child refugees but are also on the verge of being unable to maintain their existing educational facilities!

This newspaper has long recognized that the problem of child refugees is a serious social issue looming before us. Therefore, two months ago, we appealed for schools for child refugees and suggested sending them to the countryside. On April 3rd—the day before Children's Day—from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM, we held a Children's Welfare Symposium at the academic lecture hall of the Majestic Hotel, inviting well-known figures who have always been enthusiastic about the problem of child refugees and practitioners from child refugee education organizations. The issues discussed included: (1) fundraising for child refugees, (2) procurement of food for child refugees, (3) nutrition and hygiene for child refugees, (4) teaching materials and textbooks for child refugees, (5) labor and production for child refugees, (6) character training for child refugees, (7) improvement of education for child refugees, (8) self-reliance and future prospects for child refugees, (9) child refugee education work, (10) rural life for child refugees, (11) cooperation among child refugee education organizations, and (12) emergency relief for street children to commemorate this year's Children's Day. At 4:00 PM sharp, people from all walks of life who were attending the symposium arrived one after another. There were more than 30 people, including Dr. Zu Yin, Director of the Shanghai Children's Library, Ms. Qiu Liying, General Secretary of the Young Women's Christian Association, and Dr. Chen Qingshi, Chairman of the Board of the Youyou Educational Institute. First, Mr. Huang Jingwan of the Social Service Department of this newspaper reported on the significance of convening the symposium. The general idea was: Today is the day before Children's Day, and this newspaper is holding a special Children's Welfare Symposium in commemoration. Currently, prices are high, and child refugees are living in misery. This newspaper has always been very concerned about child refugee education, so we have specially invited you gentlemen to express your opinions on the discussion topics. We also hope that from now on, child refugee education organizations will help and unite with each other to benefit the child refugees who have already been taken in and educated and the street child refugees who are waiting to be taken in. Then, Dr. Hu Zuyin expressed his views on the issue of cooperation among child refugee education institutions, dividing it into negative and positive aspects. Next, Chen Qingshi, Chairman of Youyou Institute, Ding Bingnan, General Secretary of the China Children's Welfare Association, Chen Yisheng, Chairman of the Juvenile Affairs Committee of the Youth Association, Ding Fulao, Director of Fuyou Institute and child nutrition expert, Wang Hefeng, Director of Tushanwan Orphanage, Li Ruihua, Director of the Children's Care Institute, Chen Zhengfan, Director of the Child Refugee Education Center, Zhong Zhigang, Director of the Shanghai Poor Children's Home, Ruan Bin, Director of the Youyou Educational Institute, Yang, Section Chief of the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau, and others, either academically or based on practical experience, contributed their opinions on the mutual assistance and cooperation of Shanghai's charitable organizations and the promotion of child refugee education in the future. These were all extremely valuable materials, sufficient for reference for those who care about and are engaged in child refugee education. The meeting was adjourned at 7:30 PM. Detailed records of this symposium will be published separately once they have been compiled. (Jiamu)

The date of implementation of the new fares will be determined after approval from the authorities.

### Dr. Tanaka and Professor Suzuki Arrive in China: Leaders from the Cultural and Business Sectors Hold a Grand Welcome Reception Yesterday, Hoping for Mutual Understanding and Recognition

Dr. Kotaro Tanaka, a renowned Japanese scholar, and Professor Takeo Suzuki arrived in Shanghai a few days ago. Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, held a tea party at the Carlton Hotel yesterday afternoon to welcome them. Attendees included Consul Tanaka and Consul Iwai from friendly nations, as well as Chinese figures such as Wen Xiongbai, Liu Yusheng, Xia Jiancheng, Gao Chuiwan, Tao Kangde, Guo Zongxian, Yang Guangzheng, and business leaders such as Li Quanshi, Jin Zongcheng, Yao Qingsan, Xu Xiaochu, Zhao Jinqing, and Wen Zhating (listed in order of stroke count of their surnames).

Chen Binhe Delivered a Speech

Briefly stating: "The significance of today's tea party is to welcome Dr. Tanaka and Professor Suzuki to China. Dr. Tanaka is not only a legal authority in Japan but also a world-renowned scholar. The purpose of his visit to China is to study Chinese commercial customs and to promote Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. Today, I am introducing him to all of you. I am very grateful for your participation despite your busy schedules. The oldest person present is Mr. Wen Lanting, who is 74 years old this year, and the youngest is Mr. Liu Yusheng, who is 26 years old this year. People like Mr. Xia Jiancheng, a senior figure in education, and Mr. Gao Chuiwan, a poet, rarely attend any gatherings, so it is even more gratifying that they have come today to meet Dr. Tanaka."

"We are deeply honored that Mr. Chen Binhe, the president of Shen Bao, with his glorious history, and his brilliant experience in the cultural and political fields, has kindly invited us to this gathering, introducing us to distinguished figures in the cultural and economic circles of your country, and showering us with sincere and generous words of introduction. We are sincerely grateful to Mr. Chen for his kindness. We also express our deep gratitude to Consul Iwai for his great care. Recently, many of our compatriots have visited your country, but it is rare for us to be able to interact so intimately with distinguished figures in your country. We will never forget the hospitality we have received from all of you today, and we are eager to convey this kindness to the enlightened classes in Japan.

The so-called Sino-Japanese friendship has always been advocated by our compatriots, but to ensure that this advocacy does not remain a mere empty slogan, we believe that the people of both countries must exert all their political, economic, and cultural efforts. Therefore, love between the people of both countries is necessary. And for the sake of love, respect is necessary. And for the sake of respect, knowledge is necessary. Knowledge breeds respect, and respect further develops into love. Only in this way can true friendship be achieved. Therefore, knowledge is fundamental. However, knowledge is not easy. Dr. Sun Yat-sen once said that knowing is difficult, and doing is easy. Indeed, it is easy to act without knowing, but nothing is more disastrous than this.

But does such 'knowledge' truly exist sufficiently between our two peoples now? Regarding this point, we do not blame each other for ignorance but believe that we must reflect on our own ignorance. The so-called 'to know when you do not know is wisdom' means this. The enlightened leaders of your country must be reflecting with humility, believing that they must understand Japan even better. We Japanese believe that you, with the numerous students who have studied in Japan since the Meiji era, and with books, must know Japan fairly well—at least about modern Japan. We Japanese, although we have been quite close to your country's classical culture since ancient times, must generally humbly admit that our understanding of modern China is very insufficient. Like myself, I am undoubtedly one of them. However, in this regard, it is necessary to consider that Japan's understanding of your country, generally speaking, is several times more difficult than your understanding of Japan—Japan's inherent national polity aside. Your country has a long history of more than four thousand years, and its territory is dozens of times larger than Japan, and each region has its own local characteristics, with different languages, customs, and economies. Moreover, in the social strata, the range is very wide, and the separation between the upper and lower classes is great. Therefore, even if we pride ourselves on knowing your country, we often cannot avoid the feeling of 'blind men touching an elephant.' Therefore, the efforts of us Japanese to understand your country must be far greater than the efforts of you to understand Japan. Fortunately, in the past ten years, in Japan, there has been a surge of enthusiasm for the study of your country's politics, economy, history, and culture, and that is entirely detached from political intentions, purely out of a passion for seeking truth. Such concern and interest in your country's culture has gradually become beneficial research and has yielded results, and it is about to contribute to the strengthening of ties between the two countries. Now, the situation in the world and East Asia is demanding that the union between our two countries be consolidated, especially the maintenance of order in East Asia is placed on the shoulders of our two countries. However, the political cooperation between the two countries must have material and spiritual elements as necessary conditions, that is, economy and culture. The economy is the body, and the idealism that regards it as insignificant must be rejected; culture is the spirit, and the materialism that regards it as insignificant cannot be sided with. We must guarantee political cooperation through economic and cultural cooperation; otherwise, political cooperation cannot be strengthened. Fortunately, the relationship between our Japan and your country, economic and cultural, or mutual, exchanging their unique products, and thereby collaborating for the same purpose, the material and spiritual foundation, also exists in a natural and historical sense. Even from our decades of research on your country's commercial legal system, we can know this. In particular, the study of your country's commercial customs for the past four years, such as trade associations, the training of commercial personnel, partnerships, brokerage firms, and other systems, as well as the merchant morality that attaches great importance to credit, has shown that it is dominated by a familial order that is different from modern European and Westernized Japanese commercial systems, and by an economic ethics of cooperative systems, and that it is by no means an unreasonable retreat but a very reasonable advance, indicating the strong and vibrant life of your country's nation. As a result, we have gained many inspirations in scholarship, and from this, we have developed a deep respect and love for your country. That is indeed a powerful attempt to introduce national society into the individualism of capitalism, which endangers division.

I am embarrassed to say much more; however, every people in the world has its strengths and weaknesses. We should, like individual self-cultivation, honestly see our own shortcomings for the nation; at the same time, we must acknowledge and praise the strengths of others; otherwise, the various nations cannot merge and cannot improve. We believe that we should adopt such an attitude toward others: we must acknowledge the strengths of others as their essence and not remember their shortcomings. In any era, in any country, it is not determined by a rogue or a lazy person. We must be true to others and judge them in their ideal state. We are focusing on how only the highest ideals and true goals of your country can correctly understand your country and evaluate your country.

We are very pleased to become acquainted with you today, who stand at the peak of the economic and cultural circles of your country, and from this opportunity, to deeply experience knowing, respecting, and loving your country. I have taken up much of your time, and I apologize for troubling you with my words. I also thank you for today's hospitality."

Liu Yusheng Spoke

"I deeply agree with Dr. Tanaka's great remarks just now. The Doctor said: The Japanese people's understanding of China cannot be regarded as fixed by what is currently understood, and there is more to be studied further. I deeply believe that this is the case, and the Chinese people's lack of understanding of Japan is also the same. We must also conduct further research on the situation in Japan in order to achieve true friendship. Sino-Japanese friendship did not begin today; since ancient times, we have been called 'brotherly countries.' Although there are those who study Japanese issues recently, it is still not enough. The ancient saying goes, 'Do not worry that others do not know me; worry that I do not know others.' I hope that the people of China and Japan will share this meaning, intensify their research, and live up to the great expectations of Dr. Tanaka and Professor Suzuki."

Yao Qingsan Spoke

"I am deeply moved by Dr. Tanaka's frank understanding and recognition of the Sino-Japanese situation. The unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident would not have occurred if this principle had been followed. At the time, the Chinese people's opinion was that Japan's economy would collapse after three years of war. If the Chongqing government had understood that Japan could support six years of war and could fight and win against Britain and the United States, it might not have dragged on the war. And in Japan, some people initially lacked understanding of China, which led to mutual miscalculations and contributed to the incident. This is deeply regrettable. To correct and remedy this, we can only rely on sincere cooperation between the two sides. After the Sino-Japanese Incident and before the establishment of the Nanjing government, I felt that China and Japan were brotherly countries and should advocate two types of cooperation as soon as possible: (1) friendship with Japan and (2) skepticism about peace with Japan. Regarding the latter, it is not possible to change their attitude by force. I hope that there will be facts of friendship to combine China's independence and revival so that the general concept of suspicion of peace can be corrected. Recently, after Japan changed its policy toward China, the Chinese people have had a good response. If we can do what Dr. Tanaka said, I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be able to achieve true cooperation."

### Economic Sector

The Nanjing Branch of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank has been actively carrying out inspection work since its establishment. It is understood that in order to understand the business situation of various financial institutions, the branch has sent letters to various banks, silver shops, and money exchanges, requesting them to prepare a classified combined table of various deposit items, together with the monthly accounting table for March, and submit them to the branch before April 5. Subsequently, within five days after the end of each month, the above two tables will be submitted on schedule for assessment purposes.

### Commentary: Conditions for a Controlled Economy

China's economy is now moving towards a controlled economy. We sincerely hope that China's construction of a controlled economy will be successful and used successfully. Holding this hope, we cannot but point out some problems and expect that appropriate measures will be taken.

The first condition for the success of economic control is to rectify the national institutions. Economic control requires the establishment of a certain plan, distributing this plan to the economic sector for compliance, and at the same time monitoring its implementation. In order for the country to achieve this, it must first have a strong force in investigating the economic situation and setting plans. In order to supervise the economic sector, monitor whether there are any violations, and deal with those who violate the regulations, there must first be sound administrative institutions and incorruptible officials. As long as we recall the economic control situations in Japan and Germany, we will understand this. But what is the current situation in China? Using the standards of Japan and Germany to measure it, it is too far apart! There are many places that should be improved, and this is undeniable.

The construction and operation of a controlled economy is not enough to rely on government guidance; the people must automatically rise up and cooperate. This can be said to be the second condition. The way to realize this second condition is to promote patriotism and reorganize the people. Speaking of this, we must again bring up the examples of Japan and Germany. Leaving Japan aside for the moment, let's talk about Germany. The Nazi Party, as the nervous system of the national organization, made such a great contribution to maintaining the work between the government and the people. It is not necessary to say it clearly, and everyone knows it. Promoting war consciousness and strengthening party organization are urgent priorities for China after the war, and also necessary requirements for promoting a controlled economy.

In the case of implementing a controlled economy, a country's economy must be developed to the highest degree. This can be said to be the third condition. In this stage of development, the main sectors of industry often have already monopolized enterprises or a few large enterprises. In other words, this is the result of the development of the economic sector itself, which has already been organized, so economic control with this as the target is extremely easy. Japan, Germany, Britain, and the United States all have good examples of this. Looking back at the current situation in China, we have to admit that it is too far apart.

The character of China's controlled economy is not yet clearly expressed, but private autonomous control has a great effect. This is the reality of China, and it is also the only possible method. To achieve the desired goal by such a difficult method, both the government and the private sector need to make redoubled efforts. Regardless of how much effort is made, in short, it is more important than anything else to deeply reflect on the above conditions. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Dalu Xinbao on April 1)

### Minister of Food Gu Discusses: Managing Rice Joint Operations, Establishing a Central Grain Storage Bureau, Unifying Production and Sales to Maintain a Fair Market, and Urgently Rectifying Public Associations in the Coarse Grain and Other Industries

Shanghai News Agency: The Shanghai public associations for rice, coarse grains, livestock, edible oil, alcohol, sugar, and tea held a joint public banquet at the Jinmen Hotel yesterday at noon. Guests included Gu Baoheng, Minister of Food; Zhang Xianzheng, Director of the Shanghai Food Bureau; Yin Yixuan, Director of the Management Department of the Ministry of Food; Sun Mingqi, Director of the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau; Dong Zhikai and Wang Suliang, assistants to the Ministry of Food; Ji Zhongshi of the Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration; and Jiang Kesheng, Director of the Aquatic Products Bureau. On the industry side, there were approximately 80 people, including Lu Wenshao, Jiang Shizhi, Chen Ziyi, Fu Qiangeng, Xie Meisheng, Zhang Dalian, Xue Meiting, Jiang Yachen, and Huang Yantang. During the banquet, Minister Gu gave a speech, the original words of which are as follows:

Food Control Managed by the Chinese

Before the incident, food management had no organization, no control, and was entirely a free economic situation. After the incident, the Japanese side began to control food for military needs. After weighing the options, the food control matters were handed over to the Chinese side to manage, and the Food Committee was established. At that time, rice prices increased, and various controls were difficult to develop. Moreover, the rice category was divided into military rice and civilian rice. In the rice-producing areas of Central China, a part was designated as a military rice area, and another part was designated as a civilian rice area. Within the civilian rice area, rice transfers were limited, and a purchase permit was required within a certain section. If it was moved outside the designated area, a passport was required. The purpose was to suppress rice prices, but in fact, the rice price in one place often changed with the rise and fall of rice prices elsewhere, so the authorities' goal could not be fully achieved. In the military rice area, a part of the rice produced was used locally, and the remainder was used as military rice.

Establishing Joint Operations to Protect the Market

After taking over as Chairman of the Food Committee last year, I immediately began to organize joint operations so that merchants in various related industries could be fully active, and at the same time, it would also benefit the national economy and the people's livelihood. This system was first promoted in Danyang, Jintan, and Nanjing, with good results, and it will be carried out according to this policy in the future. Joint rice and grain operations are established in various places to purchase rice and grain and then sell it to the Central Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration. This office will be changed to the "Central Grain Storage Bureau" within one or two months. However, transactions can be made between joint operations. This will protect the legitimate interests of rice and grain merchants and will definitely make a contribution. However, hoarding and manipulation can be eliminated. The Ministry of Food will assess the business connections of the rice and grain joint operations in various cities and counties, divide them into several districts, and the Ministry will appoint district supervisors to manage them. That is, in the area of each rice and grain joint operation, no merchant may independently engage in business of the same nature as the joint operation.

Separate Public Associations for Coarse Grains and Other Industries

After the Food Committee was changed to the Ministry of Food, the food under its jurisdiction included rice, wheat, coarse grains, cotton, livestock, condiments (sugar, oil, alcohol, vinegar, sauce, etc.), canned foods, and beverages (soda, tea, etc.). However, recently the National Government promulgated the Provisional Regulations on Public Associations for Industry and Commerce. Except for rice, which is not subject to the control of the Council for Unified Commerce, the other items under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Food must be established as public associations separately. Therefore, in the future, the rice category will be regulated by the Rice and Grain Production and Sales General Administration through rice joint operations. Other categories such as coarse grains, oil, sugar, alcohol, and tea will be organized into public associations separately. Public associations of the same nature in various places will then be gathered in Shanghai to become joint associations of various industries, which will be managed by the National Council for Unified Commerce. Generally speaking, in terms of the system, except for rice and grain in the food industry, one county or several counties in one district will set up a public association, and the personnel allocation will be jointly decided by the Ministry of Food, the Food Bureau, and the related industries. Those who do not participate in the public association may not engage in the buying and selling of the public association's items. The public association will be divided into groups to handle matters, and shops may participate in one or several groups depending on their business category, participate in one public association or several public associations. There will also be supervisors in the public association, whose job is to liaise.

Everything Must Focus on the National Economy and People's Livelihood

Since the establishment of the National Council for Unified Commerce, various industries can completely freely transport materials. In fact, this is not the case. The transfer of materials will not be as complicated as in the past, but there are still many steps that must be paid attention to. If a shop needs to transfer materials from location A to location B, it must first submit it to the related industry public association, the public association must submit it to the joint association, and the joint association must apply to the National Council for Unified Commerce. Above the Council for Unified Commerce, there is another related coordinating body. If this process can be followed through, the transfer will be no problem. Otherwise, acting rashly will definitely encounter difficulties. I am straightforward by nature, and I will say everything I know without holding back. I hope that the food industries can understand the current control system, the rice and grain industry will follow the legal requirements to form joint operations, and the coarse grain and other industries will quickly rectify the organization of the trade association. Then, based on the public associations in various places, form a joint association of various industries in Shanghai from the three provinces and two cities. In this way, the wartime food policy can be realized, the efficiency of control can be strengthened, and the threat to the people's food can be eliminated. In these difficult times, everything must focus on the national economy and the people's livelihood. I am willing to encourage this with you all.
