### Strengthening the National Government

To shoulder a greater mission of the times after participating in the war, and to further cooperate with Japan to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War, strengthening the National Government is one of the most important tasks in East Asian politics today. However, how to strengthen the National Government? This is a very important question. Therefore, we respectfully offer sincere suggestions to the Chinese and Japanese authorities and our compatriots:

"Strengthening the National Government" has been Japan's consistent policy for the past few years, not a new slogan. Through years of effort, the status of the National Government has naturally greatly increased. However, since we have reached today, several years later, and we still need to further promote the policy of "Strengthening the National Government," then, in any case, it is undeniable that the efforts of the past have not yet fully achieved the most ideal state. If we want to achieve greater results in the future, we must review the past efforts and see what has been left undone? Obviously, Japan's efforts to "Strengthen the National Government" in the past were sincere and consistent, but the results have not satisfied everyone's ideals. Why is this? Here, we cannot help but hope that the Japanese authorities will pay attention: an ideal government cannot rely solely on the efforts of a few people at the top. It must have many conditions. If one only knows how to strengthen the power of a part of the people, simply strengthening the power of a certain political party or a certain regime, while ignoring the will of the vast majority of people and not paying attention to cultivating and strengthening the power of the people at the same time, then the result will certainly not be satisfactory. Therefore, we respectfully offer sincere advice to the Japanese authorities here that they must recognize this point, and when carrying out the work of "Strengthening the National Government," at the same time, at least with equal strength, assist in cultivating and strengthening the power of the Chinese people. Only when the power of the people is strengthened can there be a good government, and then a truly powerful government.

The National Government itself has made considerable achievements in its efforts over the past few years. Moreover, it has been carried out in the most difficult and precarious and most uneasy environment, and its painstaking efforts are worthy of admiration. However, the country is still in a state of dismemberment, and the people are still struggling in the midst of storms and waves. To be honest, one has a feeling of rivers and mountains everywhere, and the suffering of the people is everywhere. Shi Dakai said: "My ambition has not been fulfilled, and the people are suffering. There are tears everywhere in the southeast." This is probably the common feeling of everyone who aspires to revolutionary will. Especially in this new era, we not only need to solve all the problems of our own country, but also shoulder the responsibility of cooperating in the Greater East Asia War and building a new order in East Asia. Then, no one can be satisfied with the small achievements of the past, and everyone feels the urgent need to "Strengthen the National Government." However, if it is not manifested in practical work, in other words, if the current difficult problems of the people are not solved, then the future of the "Strengthening" policy may still not be optimistic. Because the people's will and support is a reflection of the true strength or weakness of a country's regime. Any government that is loved and supported by the people is a truly powerful government. This is not the talk of scholars, nor is it armchair strategy. This is the law of Chinese history and politics. Therefore, to demand "Strengthening the National Government," we must first make the vast majority of people understand, love, and sincerely support the National Government in order to concentrate all the power of the country. And to demand that the people of the whole country understand, love, and support the National Government, we must first solve difficult problems for the people, relieve the suffering of the people, and strengthen the power of the people. "When the common people are sufficient, what is lacking in the ruler?" The strengthening of the National Government will be realized invisibly!

Finally, on the part of the people of the whole country, we must pay attention to reality and not indulge in empty talk. Paying attention to reality, we can clearly see that if we have a weak government, then we will only suffer more and endure more difficulties. Conversely, if we have a powerful government, our suffering can be relieved, and our future will certainly be brighter. Therefore, at present, we should assist in strengthening the National Government. However, the most important thing is to hope that the government will promptly establish a civil organization so that the people can participate in politics and supervise politics. This is the most powerful way to assist the government. Only in this way can we truly assist the government. If the people are like deer, pigs, dogs, horses, or a heap of loose sand, then it is useless to hope that the people will "cooperate with the government" every day.

### German Troops in Stalingrad Repel Extensive Soviet Offensive German Air Force Deployed to Defend Front Lines and Assist in Anti-Soviet Encirclement Strategy

Headquarters of the German Leader, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The German High Command announced at noon today that the fighting on the southern front in the east is extremely fierce due to the severe winter. German troops repelled enemy attacks yesterday, inflicting heavy losses on the Soviet side. No less than sixty enemy tanks were destroyed between January 15 and 16. German air force units displayed their power to protect our front lines and assist in the encirclement strategy against the enemy. Our troops are once again engaged in defensive battles in Stalingrad, and all Soviet attacks have been repelled. The German forces in the central sector of the front are still firmly holding their positions and are active at all times. German forces in the Luki area have made contact with reinforcements and broken through the Soviet vehicle front. German air force units have been bombing the Volga River and the upper reaches of the Loire River day and night, attacking the Soviet military supply. The German air force and high-level artillery units shot down 41 Soviet aircraft. The enemy offensive in the Ilmen Lake area has been repelled. In the Lake Ladoga area, repeated enemy incursions have been repelled with heavy losses to the enemy. The port of Murmansk continues to be bombed by German forces, causing appalling losses to the enemy.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) According to sources from the authorities in charge this afternoon, the result of yesterday's battle of Stalingrad was that German troops repelled a wide-ranging offensive by Soviet forces. In the central sector of the eastern front, German infantry and artillery launched a two-pronged attack on the Soviet defense line, seizing thirty artillery pieces and capturing countless Soviet soldiers and spoils. In the southern sector of the eastern front, the adventurous attacks of the enemy have been contained after fierce fighting in freezing conditions, and the enemy has been routed, suffering heavy losses. A total of sixty Soviet tanks have been destroyed in the past two days.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) Yesterday's German war report stated that the German forces in Stalingrad have been resisting attacks from all sides by Soviet forces for several weeks. This shows that there has been direct contact between the two armies in the Stalingrad area and the Don River bend for some time. Since the Soviet army broke through the German positions between the Volga River and the Don River, the German forces in that area were ordered to withdraw to the west. However, strong forces were left in Stalingrad to control the north-south traffic route of the enemy, even if the German forces in that area were temporarily isolated. This German strategy has now achieved its purpose. Soviet traffic on the Volga River has not been opened up by the Soviet side, and the railway along the Volga River has not yet been repaired. The presence of German troops in Stalingrad remains a major obstacle for the Soviet army. The Soviet side is aware of this, so it has launched a full-scale attack day and night, but has not been able to overcome it. The supplies of the German troops in that area are constantly transported by air, and there is no danger of interruption.

The Center of Gravity of the Don River Battle Shifts

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) According to news from the eastern front, the center of gravity of the offensive and defensive battle between the German and Soviet armies on the lower reaches of the Don River has now shifted to the Donets River area. The German forces under Manstein encountered the Soviet forces under Vatutin, who were advancing southwest, at Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, north of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and the village of Livinov on the coast of the Kalitva River, southeast of Kamensk-Shakhtinsky, and immediately launched a hand-to-hand battle. The 80-kilometer area between the Donets River and the Kalitva River has now become the arena for the two armies. In addition, the Soviet forces under Rokossovsky have recently gathered at the intersection of the Donets River and the Don River, attempting to cross the river when the opportunity arises. However, the main force of the German army has also arrived on the east bank of the river and immediately launched a fierce battle. The German air force also dispatched to assist, and bombed the Soviet forces in that area with dive bombers and strafed them with machine guns. The Soviet forces were unable to resist and retreated eastward. According to a dispatch from Moscow on the 16th, the German counter-offensive has become increasingly fierce, and the speed of the Soviet offensive has become increasingly slow.

### North China Japanese Expeditionary Force Discloses Last Year's Battle Results Japanese Troops Suddenly Launched Fierce Offensive Against Chongqing-affiliated Troops on Shandong Peninsula Yesterday

Beijing, 16th (Allied News Agency) In addition to the 9,500 captured and 140,000 killed in action by the Chongqing and Communist troops who fought against Japan in the broad plains and mountainous areas of North China last year, another 7,000 surrendered to the Japanese army. This was disclosed by the North China Japanese Expeditionary Force when it reviewed the battle results of last year tonight. Therefore, as a result of the North China Japanese Army's operations in 1942, the Chongqing and Communist troops suffered a total loss of 305,000. According to the communique, the North China Japanese Army engaged in 17,419 battles by the end of December last year, killing 142,006 enemy soldiers, capturing 94,563, and receiving the surrender of 69,522. The Japanese army seized one mountain gun, 680 mortars, 192 heavy machine guns, 1,543 light machine guns, and 84,999 rifles. In December alone, there were 1,459 battles, 8,563 enemy soldiers killed in action, and 7,183 captured. At the beginning of last year, the Japanese army launched a mopping-up operation against the troops of General Fu Zuoyi in the grasslands of the Eighth War Zone of the Chongqing Clique. In early February, the Japanese army attacked the main force of the Communist army and the 18th Group Army of Chongqing, and the war spread to Shanxi Province. At the same time, the Japanese army also attacked the Red Army guerrillas in the suburbs of Beijing and eastern Hebei. The war is still continuing. The Communist army in Hebei Province repeatedly advanced towards Manchuria and was repelled by the Japanese army. The grain-producing areas in the central and eastern parts of Hebei Province were able to restore order. The Japanese army in Shandong Province also launched a mopping-up operation against the Communist army. In late May, the Dabie Mountain battle broke out in the border area of Hebei, Henan, and Shanxi, continuing for three months. The Japanese army entered the Dabie Mountains for thousands of kilometers, eliminating the combat power of the Chongqing and Communist troops. Battles on the banks of Hongze Lake have continued to occur. The Japanese army in that area continued to mop up the 98th Army of the Chongqing Clique and the New Fourth Army of the Communist Party.

Qingdao, 17th (Central News Agency) Last night, various Japanese troops separately launched a sudden attack on the 4,000 bandits of the Chongqing Guerrilla Fourth Column, led by Di Shangzhi and Yu Pinshan, who were entrenched in the Pingdu, Gaomi, and Changyi counties of the Shandong Peninsula. The encirclement line was gradually narrowed in an encirclement. By dawn on the 17th, the puppet troops had been completely surrounded and subjected to a fierce attack. Fierce fighting is still continuing, and the complete collapse is imminent.

### Political Situation in Hubei Province Gradually Returns to Normal Yang Kuiyi Issues Statement

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Yang Kuiyi, Chairman of Hubei Province, was recently summoned to Nanjing by the Central Government to attend important central meetings. Yesterday, Mr. Yang made a brief statement at Qiu, saying: "Since the incident, Hubei Province has been in a special situation due to being on the front line of the war, and it has been difficult to promote government orders. Since I was ordered to preside over Hubei, I have made great efforts to rectify it. The first priority is to adjust the officialdom. Then, in mid-October of last year, I convened the first provincial county administration meeting to discuss the implementation of county administration. Therefore, the civil affairs of Hubei Province today have returned to normal. In terms of finance, of course, we focus on the reorganization of the land tax and the increase in tax revenue. We have organized a land tax committee, which is organized by the heads of various departments and offices, to discuss the current policy of reorganizing the land tax and future collection. In order to save the treasury and promote administrative efficiency, I have successively abolished or merged institutions with similar natures and unnecessary superfluous institutions. Personnel who are not effective in handling affairs have also been eliminated. Therefore, the revenue and expenditure in terms of finance are also suitable for offsetting each other. In terms of construction, Hubei Province has always been known as a disaster area, and water conservancy and dike projects are extremely important. Therefore, I attach great importance to the construction of dikes, increasing production, and other projects in Hubei Province. Various projects are being actively planned. In terms of transportation, except for special cases, most have been restored, improved, and strengthened. In terms of education, due to funding and talent, in addition to primary schools, there are also provincial normal schools and provincial middle schools. In the future, we plan to add more middle schools. As for military and public security, the original 11th and 12th Divisions have been reorganized and completed. Two other parts of the army have also been incorporated. After I return to Hubei, I plan to personally inspect the counties and show the central government's intention to love the people, and to determine the meaning of participating in the war, so that the people in the peaceful area can strengthen their confidence and strengthen public security in order to complete the Greater East Asia War. In addition, with regard to promoting the New Movement, Hubei Province plans to change the original New Movement Association into a branch in the future in order to follow the general association's policy and promote the New Movement. In short, all administrative affairs in Hubei Province depend on the cooperation of inside and outside, and all have returned to normal."

### Fierce Fighting Resumes in Libya British Attack Unsuccessful Allied Forces in Tunisia Reorganized Supply Lines Bombed by German Aircraft

Berlin, 17th (Allied News Agency) This official source claimed last night that British General Montgomery launched a new offensive with the Eighth Army in Libya on Friday and was badly beaten by German General Rommel's forces and retreated after being wounded. On Saturday morning, he attacked the Axis forces again. At the same time, land activities in Tunisia were hampered by bad weather, but the German Air Force attacked on Friday and was exceptionally successful, destroying 42 Allied aircraft. A German news agency described the situation in Libya last week, saying that the British army launched an offensive and suddenly attacked the southern side of the Axis forces' positions, attempting to encircle the German army. However, they were met with resolute resistance from the German and Italian forces, so they attacked repeatedly without success. By nightfall, the British army stopped attacking. Of the 150 tanks, 35 were destroyed and left in front of the Axis forces' lines. On Saturday morning, the British army used artillery to bombard, attempting to shake the German and Italian forces' positions. Details are unknown. The British army's rear was also heavily bombed by the Axis air force, losing 18 tanks. In Tunisia, the Allied forces, after repeated setbacks in recent weeks, are now transferring reinforcements and reorganizing. On Friday, a German team suddenly launched an attack, destroying a fortress occupied by French rebels more than 100 kilometers behind the front lines. In addition, there were no land activities. The German Air Force was active in the skies over Tunisia and Algeria, attacking the Allied forces' supply lines and bombing the port of Bohn on the Algerian coast, causing a fire. German bombers swept through Allied airfields, bombing and destroying 23 enemy aircraft. German fighter planes also shot down 20 enemy aircraft in aerial combat.

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The government here announced that the enemy army in North Africa launched a full-scale offensive, which was repelled by the German-Italian Allied forces after a fierce battle.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Shanghai Haitong News Agency) Cairo announced last night that British aircraft were very active in the skies over Tripoli and Tunisia. The port of Tripoli was bombed. London officials refused to confirm the news that an Allied offensive was imminent, but warned the public not to expect too much, as the British army's advance must be gradual.

Italian Ships Attack Algiers at Night Destroying Several Ships in the Port

Rome, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The Italian General Command announced in its war report this afternoon that on the night of January 11-12, an Italian Royal Navy assault ship broke into the port of Algiers and destroyed several enemy ships. A total of one cruiser and three merchant ships were hit by torpedoes, two merchant ships were sunk, and one escaped. Another cruiser was also hit and damaged. Although the port's defenses are known to be tight, our ships were still able to invade its base and return safely. There has only been artillery fire on the Saudi front, and the enemy has not launched a new offensive. In the southern front campaign, the enemy army was defeated and abandoned 120 corpses.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency) According to German military sources, a German submarine, operating in the waters northeast of Benghazi, North Africa, attacked an anti-Axis convoy heavily guarded by numerous ships and immediately sank two enemy ships, totaling 7,000 tons. It then attacked another convoy and sank two more enemy ships, totaling 12,000 tons.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) According to news from the North African front received here, there was no fighting on land on the northern front of Tunisia on the 15th due to bad weather and muddy battlefields.

### Giraud and Darlan are Negotiating, Seeking to Resolve the North African Dispute as Soon as Possible, Otherwise French Territories Will Be Jointly Administered

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency) The Gothenburg Business Navigation News Correspondent in London said that the negotiations between Giraud and Darlan are progressing smoothly, and the North African dispute may be resolved soon. If the negotiations fail, the United Kingdom and the United States have decided to have the French territories jointly administered by the Allied countries. It is said that the obstacle to the negotiations is the extreme cooperation between senior members of Darlan's staff and Giraud, while Washington has not abandoned its distrust of Darlan.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency) The conflict of opinion between the United Kingdom and the United States over the French North African regime has suddenly become more obvious since Darlan's assassination. Recently, the conflict of opinion between the two countries has become more obvious due to the reinstatement of former Interior Minister Bertain. According to dispatches from London, in order to resolve the dispute between the United Kingdom and the United States and clarify the rights of North Africa, the British and Americans have decided to establish another institution in addition to the existing puppet regime, called the French Colonial Administrative Ministry.

Paris, 17th (Central News Agency) Due to the establishment of the French North African puppet regime, disputes have repeatedly arisen among the anti-Axis countries. It is reported that Churchill secretly ceded part of the French mainland to the United Kingdom. The news caused great shock among the French people. Although a part of the French people had previously inclined towards Darlan due to momentary enthusiasm, after learning about Darlan's act of treason, they all hated him to the bone. Therefore, Maude Baugh, who broke away from the United Kingdom on the 16th, met with a French press corps and explained Darlan's act of treason and Churchill's ambitions as follows: "The British government spends about one million pounds a day on subsidies to the Darlan faction. Darlan is in league with Jewish organizations, and his financial resources rely entirely on the British government and the Jews. The price is the transfer of France's Douvres Strait to the United Kingdom. In order to implement this secret agreement, he has exhausted all means to recruit French people in the United Kingdom to join his camp. Those who refuse his demands have their property confiscated or seized. Thousands of French allies are now groaning in the prisons of Mingdao."

### Analysis of the Situation in North Africa

Rome, 16th (Havas) - Stefani News Agency published a telegram from its correspondent in Tangier this month, analyzing the political situation after the British and American Allied forces occupied North Africa. The gist of it is as follows: North African newspapers attach great importance to General Giraud's visit to West Africa as an administrative commissioner. However, semi-official sources issued a statement stating that the factions in French West Africa are incompatible and the situation is tense. General Giraud recently visited West Africa and repeatedly warned local military and political figures that, while hoping for victory, the various difficulties currently encountered by the Allies should not be ignored. Even the situation in Tunisia should not be taken for granted, as the Axis soldiers are well-trained and good at fighting, well-equipped, and have four years of combat experience. Later, General Giraud delivered a speech in Makhanga, appealing to the French people not to kill each other, but to participate in the war launched by other countries for France. Judging from General Giraud's remarks, it can be seen that the people of West Africa are not satisfied with the development of the war in Africa, and some other factions are trying to seize leadership, condemning the British and Americans for not interfering, resulting in no improvement in the overall situation. In addition, a key figure of the Tegol faction stayed in French Morocco for two months, observing the political situation, and has now returned to Tangier. He said that it is useless for the French to fight for the gold-loving Americans at the cost of their lives and honor. The Americans do not know that the Tegol faction is not an enemy of the Axis powers. So far, the Americans have only bankrupted the African people, caused internal disagreements, and incited anti-French sentiment among the Arabs, making the Jews and Arabs stand against each other. In short, since the North African French have severed communication with their motherland, there have been Tegol, Darlan, and Giraud factions. The changes are all due to American dollars. In the past, at the end of each month, devalued francs were received from Vichy, but now they have been changed to American dollars. In short, the North African French seem to be gradually regretting it.

### Economic Strategy of the Greater East Asia War by Yoji Minobe, Chief of the General Affairs Section, Ministry of Commerce and Industry, Japan: Establishing an Individual Responsibility System and Completing a System for Gathering Total Strength

— Translator: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, January 4th

The Greater East Asia War is a war that gambles on the life and death of the nation, so the total power of the country must be concentrated and mobilized for the war, in order to obtain the highest efficiency and effect. How to allocate and operate the country's total power in order to exert its highest efficiency, this question has become the most urgent question and has been raised.

When implementing a war, what is more important than anything else is to mobilize all the country's forces for the war. However, the so-called total mobilization here refers to "the need to control and utilize human and material resources in wartime to achieve national defense purposes, so that the country's combat power can be most effectively exerted" (Article 1 of the National General Mobilization Law). In view of the expansion and thoroughness of modern warfare, it is not enough to mobilize the existing human and material elements as they are. It is time to exert national power after reorganization, as is well known to all. Furthermore, the highest degree of exertion of national power for a certain purpose is essentially different from the sum of the highest degree of exertion of individual forces. This is just like the modern war with organized forces under a certain command and the battles of the feudal era with individual forces as the center are essentially different. To put it more thoroughly, it is just like the total power of organized forces and the power of a disorganized crowd are different. Therefore, the more highly mechanized and expanded the modern military war, the more comprehensive, organic, and planned the war. Economic warfare is no different in this regard. However, the current stage of the economy is the so-called liberal capitalist economy, and it is operated by an organization centered on "one," which is no longer necessary to say. Therefore, in such an economic organization, it is impossible to exert the total power of the country as a comprehensive force to the highest degree in order to achieve a certain purpose. Therefore, Germany, which had bitter experience in the First European War and clearly understood the essence of future battles, has devoted its full efforts to domestic reorganization. Japan has also been gradually moving towards domestic reorganization since the Manchurian Incident. However, Japan, which has not yet established a self-sufficient system and is operated mainly by light industry, has to seek the source of war supplies from the international economy, so it cannot get rid of the essence of the liberal economy. This is indeed the reason for the unavoidable delay in the domestic economic reorganization.

However, the war, which has been gradually expanding since the Issei Incident, has been strongly demanding the concentrated mobilization of national power in all aspects. Therefore, today the so-called "authoritarian unified control system" has inevitably emerged.

However, it is inevitable that various contradictions and even frictions will arise between the liberal capitalist system centered on individual operation and the authoritarian control aimed at concentrated mobilization of total power, as is well known to all. Therefore, various obstacles have occurred in many economic operations. Moreover, wartime economy inevitably requires that the first hand of control be extended to the price aspect, which has become the center of the liberal economy. However, the essence of the liberal economy has not been reorganized in any way, which further expands its gaps. In other words, the defects of the liberal economy and the defects of the control economy are revealed at the same time, which is their state of expression. However, at the same time as the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War on December 7th last year, Japan's economic ties with the international economy were completely severed, breaking away from the category of the liberal economy, and at the same time rushing into the stage of completing the true concentrated mobilization of national power. In particular, in order to compete for the survival of the country with the United States and Britain, which are known for their economic power, it is indeed urgent to gather Japan's economic power. The mission now entrusted to us is to complete the economic power gathering system as soon as possible, to establish a winning and invincible situation in the economic war or production war, and to make a desperate breakthrough. Recently, the demand for increased production has been increasing, and various countermeasures have been constantly advocated, as is well known to all. Among these countermeasures, the specific problems of each will not be mentioned for the time being, but their general trend can be roughly divided into the following two directions.

First, to focus on inspiring individual creativity and invention. Second, to advocate the strengthening of the national character of the economy. The former believes that with the strengthening of control, the restriction on individual freedom gradually extends to trivial parts, individual creativity and invention are completely destroyed, and even the goal of efforts is being eliminated. This situation will naturally weaken the individual's sense of responsibility and consume their enthusiasm for production. Therefore, this point is indeed a defect in the current control and must be improved. However, changing the operation of the economy centered on "individual" to an operation centered on "the whole" is by no means to eliminate individual creativity and invention, which goes without saying. It is only advocated that the direction and scope of exerting individual power, in other words, the tasks and responsibilities that individuals should share in the whole, must be clearly stipulated so that the total power of the country can be exerted to the highest degree. Within that scope, in order to accomplish the task, of course, its creativity and invention should be fully utilized. Not only that, it is absolutely necessary. However, its creativity and invention must be necessary for the fulfillment of its national task in the conduct of the war. Creativity and invention for other purposes are naturally impossible, which goes without saying. Therefore, it cannot but be said that there are errors in the conclusion of emphasizing individual creativity and invention and excessively negating control as described above. Moreover, the national economy is a comprehensive organic body, and the policies applied to one part will eventually affect its overall function. Since the Issei Incident, one control has led to another, and its control has had to be expanded comprehensively. This fact can be thoroughly understood.

Therefore, the partial lifting of control cannot be said to effectively realize this seeker. We must recognize the advantages of the liberal economy. Only under the comprehensive liberal economy can there be the most effective exertion, and individuals can always recognize the whole. Therefore, no matter how skillfully and faithfully it is in its own field, if it is not under the control of comprehensive overall constraints, it will not fail to weaken the comprehensive power. However, the current state of affairs does indeed have the risk of causing individuals to lose their goals and thus eroding their enthusiasm and responsibility. This point, of course, must be improved as soon as possible. However, for this reason, first of all, the tasks of each person must be made concrete and clear. If the tasks assigned, that is, the responsibilities, are not clarified and only efforts are sought, it will inevitably lead to exhaustion, otherwise, it will only make them run towards their own goals. Secondly, in terms of performing tasks, we must pay attention to the strategy of rewarding and punishing, and at the same time, we should clearly stipulate what kind of rewards and punishments should be given. In the liberal economy, there is a clear goal called "profit," and its result directly becomes a situation that affects the individual himself. Therefore, individual creativity and invention can be exerted on it and make its activities lively. Therefore, if you want to deny those who only aim at profit, you must replace it with a clear goal task, and the goal must be as concrete as profit. And finally, in order to carry out the assigned task, the power that should be given - materials, labor, funds, etc. - must be clearly stipulated, and we must pay attention to the strategy to ensure it. Without understanding this, not only is any creativity and invention impossible, but even the goal of efforts cannot be established. In the liberal economy, the acquisition of these is completely free and entrusted to one's own responsibility. However, when the whole is operated under a comprehensive plan, the acquisition of these cannot be completely free. Then we must understand the way to ensure these, and at the same time we must clearly stipulate the amount that should be given.

After the above policies are established, the defects of the status quo can be eliminated. If these key points are not established, it cannot but be said that it is a futile start and end to trivial peripheral controls, and the increase in production cannot be expected. Then, what kind of guidelines should there be for establishing these key points? When discussing this issue, as a result, we will feel that what the latter discusses and what the former advocates are naturally consistent. That is, the organization of the entire economic power is a necessary thing. With its organization, it is natural that the allocation of various economic powers necessary for the implementation of the war, that is, the reorganization of national power, is also necessary. In addition, the establishment of a comprehensive operating plan for these economic powers, with the goal of the highest degree of exertion of total power, has become the premise for assigning specific tasks to each economic power and has been requested first. However, when each economic power is operated with its assigned task as the center, its character cannot but be said to have a completely national character. If the strategy of rewarding and punishing is established according to whether it is appropriate to perform the task, then the national character of each economic power will be completed. Therefore, what both parties want to achieve is only a different methodology. In other words, it is just a separate judgment of the two sides of the defects currently presented, that is, the defects from the mountain free economy and the defects from the controlled economy. Therefore, the conclusion that it is heading can be considered to converge on one. In short, it can be considered that it lies in establishing a system for the comprehensive operation of national total power and establishing a responsibility system for each individual force of its part.

Indian Correspondence

### The Indian-Tibetan Border (5)

— Jia Yuan

－Received from Macau on January 5th－

In the afternoon, the reporter circled the city for a week, until the mountains, overlooking the Himalayas, but unfortunately they were covered by clouds. Darjeeling ends here, and the distance is a deep valley, about a hundred miles. Further up, there are layers of ridges, leading to the high peaks of the Himalayas. The scenery is excellent. After a while, the dense clouds rose, filled the mountains and fields, but all I saw was a sea of clouds. The book says that Darjeeling is the gateway to Tibet. In fact, you cannot directly enter Tibet from Darjeeling. You still need to take the road to Kalimpong.

At the highest point of this mountain range, there is a Tibetan Lama Temple, built a long time ago. The area was originally Tibetan territory, so many Tibetans live here. After being managed by the British, it has been completely Europeanized. Tibetan traces are rarely seen except for this.

A park is built on the side of the mountain range. Asphalt roads are paved along the mountain range. There are roads everywhere, leading to the market at the foot of the mountain. There is an endless stream of tourists on the way. Because the climate is cooler, people wear large coats every morning and evening and stroll in the clouds, with a sense of immortality.

There are better movie theaters in the city, and ticket sales are similar to those in Calcutta. Newspapers are still lacking here. They rely entirely on the Calcutta newspapers of the day before to be sold on the market. There is also a bookstore in the city, which is very large. There are no less than dozens of books about Tibet alone, but the price is always more than twenty or thirty shields.

There are less than a thousand overseas Chinese here, most of whom are engaged in commerce. There is a Chinese Association, which serves as a gathering place for overseas Chinese. Every day after noon, they gather in groups at the association to play mahjong. In addition, the association has founded a Chinese elementary school with 40 students. The person in charge of education is Mr. Ba Zhou, who was sent by Mr. Tan Yunshan from the China College. The school expenses are covered by the association by taking a cut from the gamblers, which is laughable.

Return to Kalimpong

On October 1st, I returned to Kalimpong, because Darjeeling and Kalimpong are only separated by a mountain. There is also a convenient road that is thirty miles away. The car fare is forty rupees one way. By the afternoon, there were no fellow passengers, so I took a small car alone for thirty-five yuan. At that time, I was afraid that the police in Kalimpong would recognize me, so I changed into casual clothes, cut my long hair, put on a hard hat, and put on a pair of glasses on my face. I thought I had changed my appearance, but unexpectedly, when the car left the city and was on the way, I was saluted by a British soldier. So it was even worse!

On this day, the clouds were light and the wind was clear. The high peak of the Himalayas, Kado Kjang, appeared completely from morning to night. It was even more obvious than what I saw in Kalimpong. According to the overseas Chinese, it takes ten days to go up and down from here. British officials must visit once every summer, but they cannot reach the peak. Every time they go halfway up the mountain, they are injured by ice. The severe cold on the top of the mountain can be seen from this.

Bamboo forests crisscross along the way, and the trees are mixed. Occasionally, I see bamboo fences and thatched cottages, and the Sikkimese natives who live there. The scenery is picturesque. Suddenly, the clouds obscure the road, and suddenly, the wind is clear and the air is refreshing. Looking at the snow-capped mountains from a distance, they become farther and farther. Until you reach the foot of the mountain, you can no longer see the appearance of the snow-capped mountains. After going down the mountain, you pass through a large town, cross Dada, and merge into the main road. It only took three hours to reach Kalimpong.

Galloping towards Tibet

After returning to Kalimpong, I followed Mr. Ao Gan's instructions and stayed in seclusion. In the evening, I followed Principal Shen to Mr. Ao Gan's residence via a detour through the back mountain to discuss the entry into Tibet. It was said that a person had been hired, but he did not speak Chinese. However, he was very witty and could guarantee that there would be no problems on the way. But his asking price was very high. A few months ago, he sent a compatriot to Lhasa, including horses, for only two hundred shields. Now, he is asking for five hundred rupees to go forward. Therefore, it was canceled.

Mr. Ao then said that if there was no other way, he would send his servant. He was from the An Chong Ba tribe in Xikang and was very loyal, but very stupid. He could also serve as an interpreter and would only need to be paid one and a half shields a day. Since there was no other way, it was decided that his servant would accompany him to Tibet. At this point, in order to understand the recent situation in Tibet, I asked Mr. Ao, and he was willing to tell me everything. The Tibetan clothes needed were also made to order. Only the horses could not be hired for a while, because it was the time when India was busy celebrating the New Year. Therefore, after waiting for three days, three horses were hired. One horse carried luggage, and two horses were ridden, but they could only reach Padri. The total price was more than fifty yuan.

Due to the lack of food on the way, all rice and noodles had to be carried with you, and you needed to bring your own pots and stoves. Principal Shen was also a liaison officer of the Tibetan Affairs Office of the Tibetan Affairs Committee, so he helped me a lot. Since everything had been resolved, on the afternoon of the 4th, the hired follower brought an Indian barber to shave my head. I had the wish to shave my head. Because the six roots were not clean, it was difficult to reach the other shore. So I shaved my head in advance. The barber's knife was fast and his hands were quick. In an instant, I had become a bald head.

The hair was gone, but the wine and meat were still used. Because the Tibetan Lamas did not avoid meat, I was bothered too much by the love of the Li family, who gave me two meals and three snacks a day. So I formally said goodbye on the evening of the 5th and went to Mr. Ao Gan's place to say goodbye. That night, I changed clothes, walked several miles, walked out of the city, and then rode to Tibet the next morning. (End)

### Spain Occupies Tangier: Britain Does Not Recognize: Rumor Spreads that It Will Invade the Port

Lisbon, 16th (Havas) - According to semi-official sources in London, the British Consul-General in Tangier has been instructed to notify the Spanish authorities in the area that Britain does not intend to recognize any changes made by the Spanish government to the international status of the port of Tangier. It is investigated that the port of Tangier is located at the extreme northwest corner of the Atlantic coast of Africa, with a population of 60,000. In 1911-12, the Mediterranean countries temporarily agreed to change it into an international port, including 140 square miles of inland area outside the port, totaling 225 square miles. On December 18, 1923, a draft was signed. In July 1925, the UK, France and Spain signed an agreement stipulating the permanent neutrality, security and internationalization of Tangier. However, the following year, Spain raised the old matter again, demanding full control and incorporating Tangier into the Spanish Moroccan protectorate. Then, on July 25, 1928, a new agreement was signed, granting Spain police power, and the local government of Tangier was jointly composed of a committee organized by eight consuls and an international legislative assembly organized by 26 councilors. However, after the outbreak of the European War, the Spanish Franco government unilaterally announced its occupation, which is why the British government raised objections. However, according to political observers in this regard, the Spanish government announced that any changes made by the country to the administrative status of Tangier were aimed at enhancing the neutrality of the area, which was the case in the past and is still the case now.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - It is rumored in London that British or Allied forces will invade Tangier. The area is located on the south bank of the Strait of Gibraltar and is very important.

### The Japanese Government Will Submit a Bill to Increase Indirect Taxes to the Diet: After Approval, Travel Revenue Can Be Announced as Part of Additional Military Expenditures

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government is actively proceeding to submit various wartime urgent bills to the Diet. One of the important bills is a tax increase bill, which aims to thoroughly curb consumption by increasing liquor taxes and other indirect taxes. In addition, in order to promote the expansion of production and the reorganization of industries, it was decided to amend the "Temporary Tax Measures Plan." The outline of the above bill was passed by the cabinet on the 15th and announced on the 16th. After being submitted to the 81st Diet, which will reopen on the 21st, it can be announced and implemented. This increase in indirect taxes and tax revisions is divided into 13 categories, namely liquor tax, liquor brewing association law, soft drink tax, exchange tax, sugar consumption tax, commodity tax, food and entertainment tax, suspension or cancellation of export tax exemption and export subsidies, special behavior tax, temporary profit tax, temporary tax, local tax law, etc. It is expected that after the implementation of this tax increase bill, it will increase revenue by 1.07 billion yuan in the initial year, and then increase revenue by 1.145 billion yuan each year. The Japanese government intends to use all of the initially scheduled revenue as part of the additional budget for temporary military expenditures in the coming year. The purpose of this tax increase is not to increase national treasury revenue, but to take measures that should be taken in the national economy during wartime, so as to suppress national consumption and ensure the balance between civilian material needs and national purchasing power. Therefore, this tax increase does not take direct tax as the principle, but will increase indirect taxes. As for the main targets of the tax increase, they are luxury goods and luxury behaviors. The higher the luxury, the more the tax will be increased. Special consideration will be given to necessities of life and those related to increasing production. The Japanese government has already implemented price increases for various cigarettes that are regarded as luxury goods from the 17th, with an average increase of about one-sixth, which is expected to increase a total of 442 million yuan annually. Regarding liquor and cigarettes, the Minister of Finance, Mr. Kaga, announced on the 16th that the low-price distribution will be considered for workers engaged in agriculture and various important industries, saying that the revenue from the increase in indirect taxes and cigarette prices will definitely be fully used for war expenses. The purpose of the government's adoption of this measure is, on the one hand, to increase financial revenue, and on the other hand, to promote the enhancement of combat power through materials, labor, and funds. After the implementation of this tax increase, the national burden will inevitably increase, but it is still lighter compared with other belligerent countries, which is enough to prove the elasticity of the Japanese economy.

### Berlin Bombed: Bombs Fall in Residential Areas

Berlin, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - According to today's government bulletin, as a result of the British aircraft bombing of Berlin last night, a total of 31 people were killed and about 150 people were injured. On Saturday night, British aircraft bombed the German capital again after returning. Explosive bombs were dropped in the residential area. A hospital was also affected. The roof of a large German building was blown through, but fortunately no one was injured. The number of deaths and injuries may continue to increase due to the failure of the rescue. Two enemy aircraft were shot down.

### US Aircraft Border Crossing: Portugal Agitated: Will File Another Serious Protest

Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - A squadron of US aircraft flew over Portuguese territory on Friday, causing agitation here. Although the local newspapers did not mention that 11 US aircraft landed at the Lisbon airfield due to lack of fuel, the news spread very quickly. Political circles believe that the government will file another serious protest against the US aircraft's destruction of Portugal's neutrality. The Portuguese military is now discussing the background behind this incident, and believes that the German victory in North Africa has forced the Allied Air Force to take the fastest route to obtain reinforcements. However, the hope that the British and American Air Forces will surpass the German Air Force is very slim. The fact that the young American pilots failed to fly directly from the UK to North Africa proves this. Portuguese newspapers also published news of US aircraft crashing in Spanish territory, which shows that the Iberian countries need to unite for common interests.

Lisbon, 17th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from New York today, on Saturday, New York newspapers published news that 11 US aircraft were forced to land in Portuguese territory. Newspapers published comments saying that the aircraft had to be forced to land due to strong winds. However, the comments did not mention that a large number of US aircraft flew over Portuguese territory and were not affected by the wind.

### Hong Kong British Prisoners of War - Treated Well

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from London, representatives of the World Red Cross Society inspected British prisoner-of-war camps in Hong Kong last December. A report of the inspection was recently sent to the British government. According to reliable sources, the report stated that the Japanese army treated the prisoners favorably, and the supply of food and other daily necessities was very adequate. Therefore, the slander of Japan by British Foreign Secretary Eden last spring regarding the treatment of prisoners in Hong Kong has now been proven entirely groundless.

### National Schools Teachers in Japan Form a Patriotic Association

### Rationed Oil Distribution - Can Be Realized at the Beginning of Next Month - Rationed to Households Based on House Tax Tickets

The Qian Industry Preparatory Bank Exchange Market, in addition to preparing to implement timed check exchange in accordance with the Silver Union's method, also cooperates with the Bank Preparatory Committee. Banks and money houses collect checks from each other, and take the Silver Union's method of Qianku Zhaizhen to settle accounts in order to offset the exchange difference. Now the entire check clearing organization has become sound and complete. From now on, the collection and settlement of checks between the silver line industry has been smooth and simple.

### Huxi "Tongren Village" Completed - Shantytown Residents Have a Place to Live - Buddhist Tongren Association Fully Constructed - Total Cost of Labor and Materials Over 200,000 Yuan

The area around Jinjia Lane on Huxi, Jessfield Road, is lined with thatched shacks, no less than 300 of them. The residents are all coolies. At around 10:00 PM on October 30th of last year, they were suddenly struck by a fire that destroyed almost everything. The disaster-stricken people were extremely miserable, wailing on the road, and had no way to appeal.

Distributing Congee and Building Houses - Uniquely Undertaking the Arduous Task

The Buddhist Tongren Association was saddened by this and first distributed congee as a temporary relief. At the same time, it sought a fundamental solution, pleaded for the victims of the alley, and raised huge sums of money. On December 1st of last year, it began to build 126 thatched houses to accommodate approximately 1,600 residents of the disaster-stricken shantytowns. Yesterday afternoon at 2:00 PM, the completion ceremony was held, which was extremely lively. According to Mr. Hu Songnian, the initiator, who spoke to reporters, the houses are built with seven rows on the west side, each with ten rooms, and five rows on the east side, each with eleven rooms, totaling 125 rooms. The bamboo fence is surrounded by walls and coated with mud, and the roof is covered with tiles, which is extremely strong and can withstand wind and rain.

Construction Costs and Debts - Need to Be Cleared Urgently

The total cost of construction and raw materials is about 218,000 yuan. In addition to donations from enthusiastic people from all walks of life, there is still a debt of more than 80,000 yuan. The debts will be handled by the Tongren Association. The construction of all the thatched shacks has now been completed, and they have been handed over to the 15th Lianbao of the First Fang of the Baojia in the area, He Guosheng, for inspection and acceptance and allocated to the disaster-stricken shantytown residents. In addition, six thatched shacks were originally planned to be used as a Buddhist hall, but because the Red Swastika Society and the Huxi Relief Society established a winter congee distribution factory and there was no suitable building at the time, the Tongren Association temporarily rented them out for office use, adopting a cooperative principle. There was no tap water equipment for drinking water, and now five artesian wells have been dug to meet the needs of all the shantytowns. The place is named "Tongren Village" to commemorate it. Those who arrived at the scene yesterday included Fan Gunong, Ban Letian, and dozens of others. On the spot, Mr. Li of the Red Swastika Society generously donated 1,000 yuan, hoping that the wealthy in Shanghai would not shirk their responsibility and would be happy to donate to help so that the association's debt of more than 80,000 yuan could be quickly cleared.

### Increased Baojia Fees in Nanshi District

Regarding the increase in Baojia expenses in the entire Nanshi District, it has been approved by the Municipal Police Department and submitted to the Municipal Government. The bureau officially announced yesterday that, starting this month, the Baojia expenses and the Lianbao office expenses will be collected together (estimated at one yuan per month for households and two yuan per month for shops) to facilitate defense. The Shanghai Youyou Nursery is striving to save on all expenses. Recently, in order to store the supplies of the nursery students, it is specifically requesting 20 wooden boxes. If you are willing to donate, please send a letter to No. 9 Zhengxiuli, Lane 210, Kaifeng Road, or call 43276.

### Business Community Readers Act Righteously - Generously Donate Scholarships - Mr. Ma First Filled Out and Sent the Donation Notification Form - Hoping That All Sectors Will Continue to Promote It So That the Work Can Be Completed

Since the fourth session of the newspaper reader scholarship fund began accepting applications, it has only been three days and more than 3,000 people have already applied. Although it is still necessary to go through the procedures of investigation, screening, and review to meet the purpose of subsidizing poor and outstanding students, given the limited amount of scholarships currently available, it is inevitable that there will be a regret of not being able to provide widespread assistance. Yesterday, this newspaper specifically issued a special issue for the scholarship fund, revealing the eagerness of students waiting for assistance, in order to gather the power of generous donations from all sectors and cultivate an outstanding talent for society, which is to add a bit of vitality to the country. Mr. Ma Jiwen, a reader, was the first to automatically fill out the donation notification form, generously donating 1,000 yuan. Mr. Ma serves in the business community. After reading the newspaper, he sympathized with the pain of out-of-school youth and made this grand wish, which is a model for the business community. It is deeply hoped that people of all strengths in the business community will continue to donate to benefit the youth who are about to drop out of school.

### First Case of Smallpox Discovered This Year

The Japanese-language Continental New News reported that the Japanese resident Kamain Yasumasa (2 years old) at No. 28 Demingli, Huishan Road, Yangshupu, fell ill at 2:00 PM on the 15th. After being sent to the Civil Corps Clinic for examination, it was determined that it was smallpox. The Bazhiqiao Hospital was immediately used to accommodate him, and the patient's residence was disinfected. According to the doctor, this is the first case of smallpox this year.

### Hoping the Central China Railway Company Improves Order at the North Station Entrance　Bai Hong

Passengers on the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou lines all grimace at the thought of boarding trains at the North Station. However, how difficult it is can only be fully understood by experiencing it firsthand. Earlier this month, I had the chance to go to Beijing for business and finally understood the reasons behind the chaos.

Currently, passengers are not allowed to enter the station directly through the main gate. Whether empty-handed or carrying luggage, they must enter through the wooden shed on the north side. The shed is narrow, and people and luggage are squeezed together. Furthermore, people must stop inside the shed to wait for inspection, resulting in extreme congestion, profuse sweating, and difficulty in moving one's arms. Often, one has to stand for half a day before entering the station, hearing only the cries of women, children, and the elderly. Outside the shed, the lines stretch almost to Baoshan Road. The strong push ahead, while those who maintain order are forever left behind, their anxiety simply unimaginable. At the same time, pickpockets and illegal elements are rampant. Losing belongings near the wooden shed has become commonplace, especially at night when the lighting is dim. Those who prioritize comfort over money can negotiate a price with the "open-air guides," paying twenty or thirty yuan to be smuggled inside. I am sure the people in charge are unaware of all these situations.

We earnestly hope that the railway authorities will prioritize passengers and consider their needs more. We would like to offer some suggestions for improvement in the hopes that they will be considered:

(1) Efforts should be made to increase the number of trains, and each train should have more cars to accommodate passengers.

(2) Several entrances should be set up, separating those with large luggage from those with small, scattered items, and those with no luggage at all. This would reduce congestion.

(3) The main gate should be opened with the consent of the police and constabulary, allowing passengers with no luggage to enter through the main gate. This would disperse the crowds and facilitate traffic flow.

(4) The inspection process should begin earlier. This can also reduce congestion and make it easier to maintain order.

### Further Discussion on the Women's Movement

— Ye Minhe

After reading Mr. Ji Xin's article on the women's movement, I also have some opinions to discuss. Indeed, the women's liberation movement has not yet become universal. Social interaction between men and women is still not widely open. Women are equally human beings, differing only slightly in physiology. They have hands and agile minds to handle various tasks. The tasks they handle are no less advanced or slower than those of men. They are equally swift and handle things in an orderly manner. Why can't they enjoy the same rights as men?

Furthermore, some people ultimately see women as useless. They believe that women are only fit to be housewives, taking care of children, cooking and preparing meals, but not serving society. Women, no matter what organizations they serve in, easily encounter contempt or gossip, even hearing insulting words that are hard to bear. They are labeled as vases, active toys, or talking advertisements. This makes them forever timid and unable to boldly advance, preventing them from achieving equality.

Who says women are useless? In the Soviet Union, aren't women participating in politics and serving in the military just like men? Many organizations are led by women. This shows that their liberation movement is very effective. Why hasn't China's women's liberation movement made progress? It can be said that half of the reason is that a group of leaders hold selfish prejudices, discriminating against women and believing that women are not fit to be active in society, always placing women in a passive position. This is especially true for women who have given birth, who are even more discriminated against, because it is believed that having children distracts them and makes them less agile and focused. They have never thought of establishing nurseries. With such prejudices, how can the women's liberation movement develop? May I ask, where in the world are there so many knowledgeable women who have never given birth to expect? They are eliminated as soon as they give birth. How can this not discourage working women? For the sake of their careers and future, they often have the idea of never marrying. This is a frustration for women and a major shortcoming in the Chinese women's liberation movement.

Let's talk about another group of women, such as dancers, female guides, and prostitutes. They should also be qualified to participate in the women's liberation movement. Driven by life's pressures and adverse environments, they have gone astray and endure inhumane lives. Although many ignorant women are willing to fall, there are also many women with considerable education who have resorted to such measures due to the pressure of life. They cannot get social sympathy or even comfort. Some even attack them as troublemakers who hinder the future of young people and poisonous snakes that numb young people. Are they willing to fall? No, absolutely not. They also have aspirations and hope to contribute to society, but it can be said that very few in the vast society sympathize with them. Finally, I offer a sincere suggestion to the leaders of society: women are also rich in transcendental ideas. Establish more institutions that help the women's movement and jointly promote a true women's liberation movement.

### The Lunar New Year is Approaching, and the Commercial Market is Changing　Hoarders and Retailers are Eager to Sell Goods　Credit Loans are Difficult and Accounts are Difficult to Settle

As the Lunar New Year approaches, Chinese businesses in this city have begun their customary preparations. Most wholesalers are sorting out their inventory, while retailers have begun genuine price reductions to clear out old goods. However, other residents and those specifically engaged in the food trade have not forgotten the past practice of rising prices for food and gifts during the New Year holidays. However, they all hope that gift prices can remain the same as before this year.

Price Reduction Situation of Businesses in the Market

During this period approaching the New Year, the first to announce price reductions were leather shoes. However, it is impossible to reduce the price of a pair of leather shoes that was priced at six hundred yuan a week ago to five hundred yuan now. Nevertheless, some outdated or flawed leather shoes have indeed slightly reduced their prices. Therefore, those who do not want to be too particular about decoration often buy leather shoes during this period. In addition, small businesses in this city have recently held their routine winter sales again. Although the number of businesses reducing prices is less than last winter, some of them are shouting about reducing prices this winter. For some items, such as goods hoarded in the past, the prices have been reduced by 20% to 25%.

Although the New Year is Approaching, Debts are Difficult to Manage

According to the survey, New Year's gifts, such as embroidered handkerchiefs, sewing, and similar goods, do have a significant phenomenon of particularly cheap prices, with price reductions of 10% or even close to 20%. At the same time, according to wholesalers, in the past Lunar New Year, all debts could be cleared and all accounts could be clearly settled. However, this is no longer the case. Credit lending is now rare, so only a very small portion of accounts can be cleared. It is also known that due to the approach of the New Year, a large amount of food is needed to spend the New Year, but in reality, the food market only allows them to buy in small quantities gradually. It is difficult to buy a large amount of food at once.

### Winter Relief Charity Football Match Yesterday　China United Beat Western United Two to One

The Winter Relief Charity Football Match between China United and Western United was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday at 3:15 PM. More than ten thousand spectators attended, creating a lively atmosphere. Mayor Chen personally attended the opening ceremony and kicked off the game. Zhuang Youren and Dai Linjing of China United did not play. The center forward position was filled by Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng was adjusted to the right, and his original position was taken by Li Ning. There were no other changes. For Western United, except for center forward Gain, who was mistakenly replaced by Mao W. Pantoson, the rest were as reported in yesterday's newspaper. Referee Shen Huichun blew the whistle to start the game. Western United launched an attack first, with great momentum. In the ninth minute, Pantoson shot powerfully in front of the goal, but fortunately, Liu Xianhan was agile and saved the shot with both hands. China United counterattacked. In the twelfth minute, Xu Wenkui passed the ball to Jia Youliang. Youliang dribbled to the baseline and made a beautiful cross in front of the goal. Zhuo Shijin was waiting in the right spot and headed the ball into the net, opening the scoring. The audience erupted in cheers. By the thirtieth minute, Sun Jinshun launched an attack on the left, shooting low from 20 yards away. The ball shot out like an arrow and rolled into the corner of the net, doubling the enemy's loss. China United led by two to zero. Western United launched an all-out attack. Fu En took two corner kicks, but China United's defense was tight, and they could not achieve anything. Before long, the first half ended, with China United leading by two goals. After changing sides, China United swapped Song Lingsheng, who was injured, with Li Yichen to strengthen the defense. In the seventh minute, Western United's Dipanna lofted a high ball to the center, which fell in front of the goal. Pantoson was a step too late and missed a good opportunity. Four minutes later, Bao Jie took a hard shot from 20 yards away. Fortunately, Li Yichen headed the ball out in front of the goal, averting the danger. After that, Western United's attack remained strong. In the thirtieth minute, Dipanna shot from 20 yards away, and Liu Xianhan could not save it, announcing a goal. The score became two to one. At this time, Youliang left the field due to a foot injury, but soon rejoined the battle. Afterwards, neither side gained anything. When time ran out, China United defeated Western United by two to one. During the break, the charity football was auctioned off. As a result, Pan Sanxing bought it at a high price of 20,000 yuan. Mr. Pan volunteered to donate the charity football he had obtained for resale, and it was then bought by Wang Yongkang for 6,000 yuan.

### Japanese Domestic Opinion After China's Entry into the War　China's Entry into the War

— Translated from the January 10 Mainichi Shimbun Editorial

The National Government, which had been waiting for an opportunity since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, finally rose up and solemnly declared war on the United States and Britain at 10 AM on the 9th.

The reasons for the National Government's declaration of war are clearly stated in its declaration announcement, which states that it will "cooperate with friendly Japan to destroy the United States and Britain, which have been tyrannical in East Asia for a hundred years and are the common enemies of the East Asian people, in order to revive China, liberate East Asia, and build a new East Asian order based on morality," and that "after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, based on the spirit of the Japan-China Basic Treaty, it is determined to share weal and woe with Japan," which should be made clear to both Chinese and foreigners. However, due to the National Government's participation in the war, Japan, China, and Thailand have become a unified entity in East Asia, and their cooperation with Germany, Italy, and other countries in Europe has become closer and more active, to the point where they can use their combined power to deal with the United States and Britain. After participating in the war, there will inevitably be great difficulties, and sacrifices must be endured. The National Government is well aware of this and has boldly taken this step. We sincerely express our respect for its courage and determination.

Following the National Government's courageous and vigorous advance, the Japanese government has also made Japan-China relations as close as possible. At the same time, in order for the National Government to contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War for the common goal and the construction of the Greater East Asia New Order without regret, immediately after the issuance of the National Government's declaration of war announcement, it held the exchange of seals for the "Japan-China Joint Declaration on Cooperating to Complete the War" and the "Agreement on Returning Concessions and Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights." The former declares that the two countries, in order to complete the common war, will adhere to complete cooperation in military, political, and economic affairs with unshakable determination and belief; the latter clarifies that in accordance with the spirit of this common declaration, based on the principle of respecting China's sovereignty, Japan will return all of its exclusive concessions in various parts of China, recognize China's recovery of the public concessions and the Beijing Legation Area, and at the same time, it is promised to abolish extraterritorial rights, and further involves various matters, all out of goodwill measures, and strongly supports the construction of the new China, and various treaties will also be given new consideration. The two are indeed Japan's deepest friendship to its neighboring country, China, and at the same time, they have epoch-making significance in the history of Japan-China national relations, which goes without saying.

Regarding the abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, the United States and Britain have verbally promised the Chinese government several times over the years. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in order to please the Chongqing regime and prevent its secession, they concluded an agreement on this with the regime on October 10 of last year. However, at that time, the extraterritorial rights and concessions that the United States and Britain had promised to return were actually long gone. However, Japan currently has hundreds of thousands of expatriates in various parts of China who enjoy extraterritorial rights, and it retains eight concessions, so the abolition of extraterritorial rights and the return of concessions by Japan are completely different in meaning and value from the empty promises of the United States and Britain. Japan's actions for China's sovereignty integrity are substantial. The National Government authorities are naturally expressing their satisfaction with these assurances from the Japanese government, and we also believe that this decision, which respects morality and promises and enables China's long-cherished wish to be achieved in one day, is invaluable.

The Japanese government's decision is based on the fundamental spirit of Japan-China cooperation, expecting an epoch-making development in the relations between the two countries. At the same time, it hopes to quickly build a new China based on independence and autonomy, and to exert the political power of the National Government. Due to the Japanese government's measures, the Chongqing regime's anti-Japanese theory has completely disappeared.

The arrow has been shot, and the participation in the war that the National Government and the people under its leadership have been eagerly anticipating for a year has now become a reality. However, after the declaration of war announcement, the National Government has leaped from a peaceful regime to a combat regime, and the people have leaped from a peaceful people to a combat people. We cannot help but rejoice for the East Asian people at the resolute courage of the Chinese government and people to stand on the common front with Japan, and to advance bravely towards the path of destroying the United States and Britain!

### The Chinese Government's Declaration of War on Britain and the United States

— Translated from the January 10 Asahi Shimbun Editorial

The National Government of the Republic of China declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9. On the same day, it signed the "Japan-China Joint Declaration on Cooperating to Complete the War" and the "Agreement on Returning Concessions and Abolishing Extraterritorial Rights" in Nanjing. The Japanese government also issued a statement on the matter at the same time. This is a sign of an epoch-making development in the Greater East Asia War and the relations between Japan and China. We express our full respect for the unity of the new China under the leadership of Chairman Wang. At the same time, we are confident that this will establish a new Japan-China relationship that is adapted to this new situation. Moreover, the implementation of returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights is closely related to the construction of the new China, becoming an implementer of China's liberation. These facts should be welcomed by all Chinese citizens.

Following the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government, under the new slogan of sharing weal and woe, has risen up to cooperate with Japan in order to complete the war. However, on the one hand, the Chongqing regime, which has willingly accepted the manipulation of the United States and Britain, has rebelled against East Asia, declared war on Japan, and joined the US-British front. It has repeatedly disrupted China's internal and external affairs, but it has not yet developed a fully prepared confrontational posture. However, now, with the National Government's declaration of war on the United States and Britain and the publication of the Japan-China Joint Declaration, the new wartime situation has been prepared. At the same time, in order to complete the war against the United States and Britain, the military, political, economic, and all other fields will be more closely cooperated. That is, the National Government has actually entered a new relationship of living and dying together with Japan.

After the National Government participates in the war, it will undoubtedly concentrate its efforts on dealing with the Greater East Asia War. However, it is particularly important to establish security in order to control the schemes of the anti-Yu Party from Chongqing as well as Britain and the United States. At the same time, it must fulfill its task as the base of the Great Rear, strive to increase production, and this is also what we expect. As for the increase in production, Japan's new policies will undoubtedly provide great assistance, thereby increasing the welfare of the Chinese people, so that the hearts of the Chinese people will naturally dedicate their loyalty to the National Government. At the same time, understanding Japan's goodwill will inevitably lead to automatic cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and Japan's long-cherished wish to strengthen the political power of the National Government will also be gradually realized.

Now, due to the National Government's participation in the war, Japan's war power in the Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly be strengthened. However, in order to exert a more remarkable effect, we cannot but hope that the National Government will make greater efforts in the future. The National Government, as it stated in its declaration of war announcement, will not only devote its full efforts to cooperating with Japan in the future, but also strengthen cooperation with Manchukuo and Thailand, and will also respond to the Allied powers such as Germany and Italy, so as to contribute to the ultimate goal of building a Greater East Asia and realizing a just new world order.

This autumn, Japan will return all Japanese-administered concessions within the Republic of China, recognize the Republic of China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Area, and abolish extraterritorial rights. This is exactly what we expect. In the history of Japan-China relations, it will mark a new era. The National Government will undoubtedly accept Japan's goodwill with heartfelt gratitude: and all the people of China. will also be able to truly feel its profound significance. This result can finally deprive the Chongqing regime of its basis for resisting Japan.

Due to the National Government's participation in the Greater East Asia War and Japan's establishment of a new policy towards China, it is believed that China can move towards the realization of the Pan-Asianism, the lifelong ambition of the revered Father of the Nation, Sun Yat-sen. China's revival, the construction of a new China, will make great strides forward, and at the same time, the resolution of the China Incident will also be able to gain dawn from this. Moreover, it is not only China alone. This will encourage all the ethnic groups in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, who have been under the shackles of the United States and Britain for many years, to know Japan's sincerity towards China, which is also Japan's sincerity towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This will increase the faith of these ethnic groups in Japan, making it easier for Japan to complete the Greater East Asia War. This is something that can be deeply believed without a doubt.

### Returning from the Chinese Antiquities Exhibition

— Ma Jian

The antiquities exhibition was held at the Jinmen Restaurant's ninth-floor auditorium from the 16th to the 19th, daily from 10:00 AM to 6:00 PM. Those who went to see it came in droves, and I also had the honor of attending. Upon returning, I made this record.

The exhibits mainly consisted of ancient artifacts, with only a few dozen paintings and calligraphy pieces, but most of them were rare treasures. The ancient artifacts were divided into four categories: stone tools, pottery, bronze tools, and porcelain, and as I looked at them in order, I could see the traces of historical change. Before the jade stone scepters, there were stone scepters made as early as the Xia Dynasty, and there was one Xia stone scepter on display here. The Shang Dynasty was still an era where bronze and stone were used together, as can be seen from many stone tools from the Shang Dynasty. The stone bird zun was a stone wine vessel, the whole body in the shape of a bird, with very large feet. The bird yi in the Zhou Li's six yi was probably evolved from this. The Shang stone sacrifice was a stone carving of a reclining ox, with a simple posture. At that time, agriculture was probably valued, and carving this image was a sign of reverence for the plowing ox. Among the pottery, there were many li, which were typical of later bronzes, and were priced very cheaply, at around four or five hundred yuan each. By the Tang Dynasty, the simple style was completely lost. The craftsmanship tended to be delicate. There was a large Tang Dynasty three-color blue-glazed sacrifice on display at the exhibition, which was also an ox statue, but it was very different from the Shang stone sacrifice. Among the bronze tools, there was a Shang taotie you, with the lid's nose in the shape of a bird and the two ears in silent faces, still retaining the "totem" style, but the carving was extremely fine, making people reluctant to let go. There were also several Shang dings, with good patterns and colors; the patterns as fine as hair were particularly valuable. Han Dynasty antiquities were dominated by mirrors, engraved with figures, birds, and beasts, but they already emphasized well-dressed civilized people. By the Six Dynasties, Sui, and Tang Dynasties, the figures often emphasized Buddhist images, which was after contact with Indian culture. The carving became more and more rounded and beautified.

From the Jin Dynasty onwards, up to the Ming and Qing Dynasties, there were as many as seventy or eighty pieces of porcelain, with extremely exquisite firing and painting.

Among the paintings and calligraphy, there were Luo Se's "Old Man and Child Enjoying Themselves" painting, Yan Wengui's "Fisherman's Joy" painting, Wang Yangming's family letter from Shanghai, Wang Siren's cursive script, Chen Meigong's bamboo and rock painting... etc. I especially loved Yang Shengxian's "Mountain Pavilion and Pavilion" painting, Wu Wen's "Autumn Boudoir Night Thoughts" scroll, and Zuo Liangyu's "Unveiling Posts" album, among four or five pieces.

Several square seals among the miscellaneous items were also very elegant, priced at more than a thousand or two thousand yuan each, but it was a pity that they were damaged, which was somewhat of a flaw.

### Second Place in Essay Contest: My Plans for This Year

— Liu Guanye

Tonight, I lean alone against the window, using the light from the roadside lamp to gaze at the desolate fields beyond the wall. The withered willow branches and silent stone tablets seem long forgotten. In this cold and gloomy night, seeing them only makes me feel more lonely and melancholic. But I can rely on this solitude to slowly chew over the past and imagine the future...!

If it weren't for the noise from the nearby entertainment venue suddenly entering my eardrums, I would almost forget that this is a prosperous city, especially tonight, which is a "New Year's Eve" worth celebrating! Alas! I have wasted this night that everyone loves by indulging in aimless thoughts!

The clock hand has passed twelve o'clock. I suddenly realize that the New Year's Eve of 1942 has passed, and now we are entering the New Year's Day of 1943. In the past year, what is worth my recalling? So I cannot help but think of using this quiet New Year's morning to prepare some "My Plans for This Year"!

Of course, I cannot be as naive as children, simply planning to say: "I will study hard," "I will be filial to my parents and respect my elders,"... or paste the two big characters "Daily Renewal" in front of my desk. But I cannot plan like adults, planning how to engage in their careers, although I have gradually stepped into adulthood. Because I have not yet left the era of studying.

When my thoughts were in chaos, the books on my desk helped me a lot. I suddenly thought of "The Autobiography of Benjamin Franklin" that I had read. Franklin had planned thirteen kinds of courage and perseverance regarding moral perfection:

1. Temperance: Eat not to dullness; drink not to elevation.

2. Silence: Speak not but what may benefit others or yourself; avoid trifling conversation.

3. Order: Let all your things have their places; let each part of your business have its time.

4. Resolution: Resolve to perform what you ought; perform without fail what you resolve.

5. Frugality: Make no expense but to do good to others or yourself; i.e., waste nothing.

6. Industry: Lose no time; be always employed in something useful; cut off all unnecessary actions.

7. Sincerity: Use no hurtful deceit; think innocently and justly, and, if you speak, speak accordingly.

8. Justice: Wrong none by doing injuries, or omitting the benefits that are your duty.

9. Moderation: Avoid extremes; forbear resenting injuries so much as you think they deserve.

10. Cleanliness: Tolerate no uncleanness in body, clothes, or habitation.

11. Tranquility: Be not disturbed at trifles, or at accidents common or unavoidable.

12. Chastity.

13. Imitate Jesus and Socrates.

He planned to complete these conditions within a year. Of course, I dare not compare myself to him and say that I will complete those conditions within a year, and my environment is also different from his. However, I can firmly say: "I want to try my best to emulate him!"

In this year's plan, I want to pay more attention to "Resolution, Frugality, Diligence, and Sincerity." And "Diligence" is the most important, because in our reading era, we should not waste what our parents provide, so we should be "Frugal." And when we start learning to work, we should also have the power of "Resolution" so that we can work smoothly without difficulty. "Sincerity" is the most fundamental lesson that one understands from childhood. Children often hear their parents and elders issue the injunction "Do not deceive people" from an early age. But if we are not "Diligent," how can we be frugal? We will inevitably spend money to command others to do the work that we can do but are too lazy to do, is this not a waste? Also, because of laziness, we gradually lose our decisiveness, and when others inquire, we will unconsciously use false words to prevaricate, and thus we violate the ordinance of sincerity!

Therefore, Franklin's father, when teaching his children, often quoted a proverb from Solomon: "A man diligent in his business shall stand before kings; he shall not stand before mean men." Although we live in this progressive era and do not believe in these religious superstitions, we can at least see some truth in this sentence. And Franklin himself also believed that labor is the way to obtain wealth and fame.

### Record of Loyal Prince Li Xiucheng (Part 2)

— Fu

It has always been easier to appease good citizens than to pacify rebellious people. Xiucheng not only excelled at appeasing good citizens but also knew how to pacify rebellious people. When Xiucheng first captured Suzhou, the rebellious people of neighboring counties, under the pretext of resisting the Taiping Heavenly Kingdom, wantonly plundered. Some subordinates wanted Xiucheng to severely suppress them, but Xiucheng refused to listen. He issued a notice inviting them to surrender, but to no avail. Therefore, he went to the countryside to explain to them in person, but the rebellious people surrounded him several times, even pointing spears at Xiucheng's neck. Xiucheng calmly said, "I am Loyal Prince so-and-so. Today, I risk my life to appease you. Those who are willing to surrender, please discard your weapons. I will let you kill me." This scene is even more remarkable than Guo Ziyi's single ride to see the Uighurs. Xiucheng actually considered it calmly, which is truly touching. No wonder the rebellious people all discarded their weapons and surrendered. Within ten days, Yuanhe, Wuxian, Changzhou, Songjiang, Taicang, and other counties were all pacified one after another. Moving people with virtue and implementing policies with gentleness, Xiucheng embodied the essence of Confucianism and the art of Huang-Lao in one person. Even Zeng Guofan would probably have to bow his head in admiration.

Xiucheng was very strict with the soldiers under his command, forbidding them from disturbing the people, but at the same time, he shared weal and woe with them, being closely related. Several times he distributed the goods and silver rewarded to him by Hong Xiuquan to the soldiers, without taking a single cent for himself. Because Xiucheng's discipline was too strict and his official position was too high, he was not liked before and later was restrained by slanderers, resulting in accumulated military merits, and few of his subordinates received rewards from the imperial court. They inevitably had some resentment. Xiucheng often tearfully exhorted them, encouraging them to exert their efforts for the royal family. His subordinates were moved by his loyalty and were willing to die for Xiucheng. Therefore, in the Battle of Suzhou, all the armies were defeated, but Xiucheng's army alone survived. When Nanjing was besieged, Hong Rengan and others, fearing Xiucheng's success, closed the gates under the pretext of epidemic prevention and refused to admit reinforcements. The armies all clamored and were unwilling to fight, but Xiucheng's troops, regardless of day or night, vigorously attacked the enemy camp. Being able to gain such desperate support from his subordinates was definitely not accidental. Therefore, after Nanjing fell, more than 100,000 soldiers would rather die than surrender to the Qing army. Liang Qichao put it well: "More than 100,000 people in Jinling City, none of whom surrendered, compared with the five hundred guests of Tian Heng, their aspirations were the same, their deeds were the same, and their courage was a hundred times greater. This is something that has never happened in the history of warfare."

Xiucheng came from a peasant family. Due to poverty, he lost his opportunity to study at an early age and had little education. However, he was exceptionally intelligent and had a photographic memory. When he first joined the army, he almost suffered capital punishment for secretly reading classics and history. But he did not give up his desire to learn because of this. After becoming prominent, he still studied diligently in his spare time from managing the army. When the Taiping Army first rebelled, because they hated the Qing government, especially the imperial examination system, which was a tool for autocratic emperors to bind the people's minds and corrupt scholars, they opposed it even more. Therefore, they also forbade the reading of general classics, history, philosophy, and literature. But after they established their capital in Nanjing, in order to win over people's hearts and recruit talents, they instead opened the imperial examination and imitated the Manchu Qing. In fact, most of the generals who started the Taiping Rebellion were proficient in writing. Hong Xiuquan himself was an unsuccessful scholar. The King of Yan, who came from a Xiaolian family, was a famous all-rounder in both literature and martial arts. His beautiful sentences were widely circulated. Wei Changhui, Yang Xiuqing, and others had all read classics and history thoroughly and were not uneducated people. Only Xiucheng had less schooling, but because he worked hard, he later became an all-rounder in both literature and martial arts. (Remuneration for Poverty Relief Fund)

### The Greatest Teacher of All Time

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

He began to tell little jokes - jokes that students liked - that would cause laughter and at the same time leave some impression memory methods and variations in their hearts. There was one joke that never lost its charm, although it was just one of many other similar jokes. A certain Roman law allowed nobles (Patrician) to marry commoners (Plebeian). Whenever his Roman history class came to this point, he would always add, "So you can know that if Ms. Plebs wants Mr. Patrician to marry her, and he says he can't, she probably wants to answer like this: "Oh, no, you can, you liar!"" Roaring laughter.

Kathie (nickname for Katherine - translator) also expanded his observations and insights, giving him a view far beyond the roofs and spires of Brookfield, so that he could see his country, simply something vast and profound, Brookfield for this thing is just one of many converging streams. She had a more intelligent mind than him, and even when he disagreed with her views, he could not confuse her views; for example, in politics, no matter her all radical socialist remarks, he was always a conservative. However, even if he did not accept, he absorbed: her youthful idealism had an effect on his mature character, thus producing a very soft and intelligent mixture.

Sometimes she also tried her best to persuade him. For example, Brookfield was setting up a church in East London, and students and their parents were generously donating money to it, but there was rarely any personal contact. Gardlin suggested that the church could send a football team to Brookfield to compete with one of the school's football teams. This opinion was so revolutionary that everyone except Gardlin thought that the opinion would be severely rejected and would not be established. Bringing a group of street urchins to mingle and have fun with the young masters of the upper class, at first glance, it was simply better to make a mess of things than not to have this at all.

### Thoughts After Receiving a Scholarship

— Wu Gensheng, Sumin Middle School

The giant wheel of the times is moving forward non-stop. Calculating the time, it has been the fourth semester since I received the scholarship. In the past three semesters, I have been able to listen quietly in the classroom like others, and gain valuable knowledge, without suffering the pain of dropping out of school. This is of course due to the members of the scholarship committee of Shen Bao and the general enthusiastic people in society.

Recalling that since I was cultivated in the Disaster Children's Education Center until I graduated from elementary school, I was often anxious and sad for my future. I know that knowledge is the foundation of a career. Without profound knowledge, there is no bright future. Therefore, I feel that continuing my studies was the first problem to be solved at that time. So I bravely appealed to Shen Bao without any clue, and I was able to get the sympathy and sponsorship of enthusiastic people in society, and thanks to the efforts of the host committee, I was able to get the opportunity to study with financial assistance.

In addition to sincerely thanking, I should also understand the difficulty of studying, and work harder and strive hard! In order to repay the enthusiastic people in society. In the future, I hope to rescue more drop-out companions. I warmly hope that the scholarship will be promoted and make greater contributions!
