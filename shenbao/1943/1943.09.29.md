### The Trends of the Chongqing Regime (Part 2) â€” A Question and Answer Between Mr. A and Mr. B

B: So, the Chongqing regime has encountered extremely difficult situations in dealing with the Communist problem and the trend of public opinion. Now, please tell me about the economic situation.

A: Of course, the economic crisis is one of the fatal crises for Chongqing. On the one hand, it wants to prolong the war, and on the other hand, it has to beg from Britain and the United States. What kind of situation is this? Luo Guofu commented on the crisis in Chongqing in this respect, saying: "Chongqing has not completed its task of establishing its wartime economy. It possesses all the raw materials for military needs on its own territory, but it has not carried out large-scale construction because the industrial and financial circles would rather engage in 'national disaster profiteering' and are unwilling to invest capital in the armaments industry. Those who unscrupulously make 'national disaster profits' put forward such a theory: the people are tired of war! Therefore, the people's needs for goods must be satisfied first, etc. This situation has weakened the combat effectiveness of the army and made it more dependent on the supply of British and American military supplies. Since Japan's war with Britain and the United States, this aspect has encountered serious difficulties."

B: Luo Guofu's remarks are naturally made from the perspective of a communist, but...

A: That's right, we don't need to discuss Luo Guofu's position, but pay attention to the facts he listed. What he said at least gives us a glimpse into the economic crisis Chongqing is facing today. In fact, Chongqing itself admits it. It is said that during the "Third Session of the Second National Political Council" in Chongqing, there was an incident of criticizing economic policies. The main points are: The coordination of industrial construction is not appropriate, resulting in abnormal development, such as the stagnation of steel production, which is a major crisis for the future of industrial construction. The problem of lack of funds. The problem of complicated loan procedures. The problem of nominal profits and actual taxes. The problem of factories hoarding raw materials. The problem of social floating capital avoiding industrial investment. The problem of disputes between "state"-owned and private enterprises.

B: Indeed, some economic figures from the interior have various painful complaints. However, hasn't Chongqing recently been promoting the success of its commodity price and material policies as a prerequisite for the success of the entire wartime economy?

A: Yes, Chiang Kai-shek had a "proposal to strengthen the control of materials and prices" and promoted how complete its contents were. However, it is said that various criticisms were raised during this "National Political Council," stating that not only had the plan not been effective since its implementation, but also phenomena contrary to the expected results had occurred. The reasons are roughly: Local governments failed to conduct detailed investigations on the supply and demand of materials in various regions and coordinate them uniformly; There were insufficient preparations for the implementation of "price limits." The authorities' materials were insufficient, and the merchants' prices were inaccurate, resulting in disturbances everywhere. The control only extended to the control of "points" and neglected the control of "surfaces," so the basis established by the "points" could not be maintained. More importantly, Chongqing's financial policy did not match its economic policy, such as arbitrarily raising tax rates and increasing the prices of public utilities.

B: I heard that Chongqing has recently implemented the so-called "monopoly system." What is the result?

A: It is said that since the implementation of this monopoly system, the wide disparity between the purchase price and the selling price has aroused controversy from all sides. In fact, there are too many things that have caused a bad impression among the people. Let me give a few more prominent examples:

The price of cotton yarn is extremely chaotic. However, due to the unfairness of the control, the people are not convinced, and most cotton merchants in various places refuse to comply.

The purpose of raising public debt was originally to tighten currency circulation and increase financial resources. However, since last year, compulsory quotas have been implemented, and the principle of fairness and universality has not been followed. Wealthy households have mostly found ways to avoid it, and only the middle and lower classes have suffered.

The original purpose of the establishment of the "Trade Commission" was to adjust export trade and encourage production in the rear. However, in reality, overseas transportation routes have been shortened, exports have stagnated, and the agency's expenses are huge, wasting "national funds." Moreover, the purchase price is extremely unreasonable, which has suppressed the people's enthusiasm for production, resulting in a decrease in production.

B: But, wasn't the so-called "developing the Northwest, building the Northwest" widely promoted in Chongqing?

A: Because there was no way out for the entire economy, the so-called Northwest policy was put forward. However, the situation in the Northwest is special. First, there is the international problem, involving the opposition between the Soviet Union and the United States and Britain; second, there is the political problem, involving the relationship between Chongqing and the Communists; third, there are the ethnic and religious problems. The Northwest is a region where the Hui, Uygur, and Mongol ethnic groups predominate, and Muslims are absolutely dominant. Chongqing's management must first solve the above problems. However, in reality, there are many problems. The first is the problem of talent for border management, the second is the transportation problem, the third is the mechanical problem, and the fourth is the funding problem. These problems cannot be solved perfectly, so so far, in addition to investigations, studies, and planning proposals, there has been no significant progress. Even in terms of agricultural reclamation, the construction of water conservancy and transportation requires huge amounts of funds and a large number of talents. Moreover, the earliest harvest will have to wait five or ten years. It's really "a drop in the bucket."

B: Since Chongqing has no solutions for military, political, economic, and public sentiment trends, isn't that an opportunity to promote overall peace?

A: In theory, such a conclusion can be drawn, but as pointed out in the "On Overall Peace" article in the Shanghai News Weekly Review, due to Chongqing's international relations, due to the faction backed by Britain and the United States in control of the regime, due to the support of the Whampoa Clique with military control, and even more so because the forces of those who understand Japan have not yet risen, the Chongqing regime can still maintain its position by holding the "war of resistance" policy. Only after this situation changes, or only after this situation is changed by all means, can overall peace be achieved as a natural result. In short: the centrifugal force of the people under Chongqing's rule is developing, waiting only for changes in the international situation, waiting only for the political stabilization in the peaceful areas, waiting only for people's lives to be fully guaranteed, and waiting only for Japan's new policy towards China to be thoroughly implemented. At that time, overall peace will not be difficult to achieve, and the great cause of unified construction will be able to make great strides forward.

The Japanese side suffered 320 deaths and three planes were self-destructed or did not return. The main external affairs operations of China in August were as follows: Since July 10, the remaining Chongqing army in the southern Taihang Mountains has continued to be wiped out, led by the 27th Army of Jin. The commander of the Chongqing Reserve 8th Division, Lieutenant General Chen Xiaoqiang, was captured, and the army was completely defeated, frustrating its attempt to rebuild a guerrilla base in North China. Since July 27, an attack was launched on the troops of Yu Xuezhong in the Yingsu theater. Near Weishan Lake, they were surrounded, and their main force, the 111th Division and the 114th Division, were severely damaged and defeated. The communist army of Jin-Chahar-Hebei Province, led by Nie Rongzhen, recently attempted to move in the Mengjiang North China area. After the Japanese army launched a communist suppression campaign, its northern stronghold has been destroyed. In addition, the Japanese army was able to preemptively strike and severely damage the communist army's movements in North China, achieving great results. The characteristics of the August war results are as follows: The total number of engagements between the Japanese army and the enemy was 1,557, of which 826 were against the communist army, accounting for approximately 53%. The number of enemy troops engaged in combat was 173,363, of which 74,188 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 42%. The number of enemy troops killed was 7,510, of which 2,889 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 38.4%. Of the 6,729 captured and surrendered by the Japanese army, 1,545 were communist troops, accounting for approximately 24.4%. From this, it can be seen that the Japanese army's communist suppression campaign has been significantly strengthened, especially in the North China region. Of the 173,363 enemy troops deployed in combat, 14,239 were killed, captured, and surrendered by the Japanese army, accounting for approximately 61%. In particular, the increase in the number of prisoners and surrenders proves that the enemy's will to fight has declined and its combat power has weakened. In addition to attacking air force bases in Jianou, Hengyang, Guilin, etc., the Japanese air force has also engaged in active operations and intercepted attacking enemy aircraft, achieving great results. On the 23rd, a surprise attack was launched on the Chongqing base, which made the enemy tremble. In addition, the North China region closely cooperated with the southern Taihang Mountain operation, making it easier for the land forces to attack.

### Japan Decides to Convene Extraordinary Session of Diet in Late October; Cabinet Approves Establishment of Ministry of Munitions

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - In order to thoroughly implement measures to strengthen the domestic situation, the Japanese government decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and establish a Ministry of Munitions at a cabinet meeting held on the 28th. The reason for deciding to convene the Diet this time is that it intends to submit legal bills and budget bills required for implementing measures to strengthen the domestic situation. This extraordinary session of the Diet will be the sixth under the Greater East Asia War and the fifth under the Tojo Cabinet. The goal of establishing the Ministry of Munitions is to quickly increase munitions production and expand air force strength by mobilizing national power, and to unify the ordering of munitions production and the administration of munitions production management. Therefore, the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished, and the Ministry of Munitions will be added on November 1 to integrate production administrative organs. The Japanese government, regarding the importance of enhancing munitions production, has renewed the production administrative structure, and since last year, it has implemented administrative simplification, established a temporary production enhancement committee, and formulated wartime laws such as the special cases of wartime administrative powers, the cabinet advisory system, and the establishment of a wartime administrative consultation council, a local administrative consultation council, and the implementation of administrative inspections, and other necessary important measures have been gradually implemented. These measures are aimed at preventing delays in wartime production. Therefore, it mainly focuses on personnel renewal and strives to avoid reconstruction. However, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry has gradually become a Ministry of Munitions. At the same time, the production administration must establish a genuine decisive battle posture. Therefore, the Japanese government officially decided at the cabinet meeting on the 28th to establish the Ministry of Munitions as a fundamental measure to promote the current production administration.

Diet Session Scheduled for Three Days

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Japanese government decided to convene an extraordinary session of the Diet and establish a Ministry of Munitions, two important measures that the Japanese Emperor has already approved. The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 5 p.m. on the 28th as follows: It was decided at today's cabinet meeting to request the opening of an extraordinary session of the Diet. The date for convening the extraordinary session of the Diet was set for October 25, and the session is scheduled for three days. The purpose of the convocation is to submit legal bills and budgets to show the Japanese government's firm will to complete the war to the domestic and foreign fronts. The expected proposals are as follows: Budget bill. Legal bills: (A) Proposal on budget simplification; (B) Proposal on judicial simplification; (C) Proposal on munitions accounting; (D) Proposal on strengthening air defense; (E) Proposal on continuing the duties of re-elected members of the Diet; (F) Proposal on amending the Conscription Law.

Planning Board and Ministry of Commerce and Industry Abolished

The bureau announced a proposal regarding the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions. Based on the force of the situation, efforts will be made to actively increase munitions production, and at the same time, in order to expand air combat power, a Ministry of Munitions will be established to ensure munitions production. As a result, the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will be abolished. In order to thoroughly simplify munitions production management, it was decided to transfer necessary management services for the main munitions production of the army and navy to the Ministry of Munitions for management. After the establishment of the Ministry of Munitions, matters related to national mobilization and munitions production, and other matters under the jurisdiction of the Planning Board and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry, will be mostly transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. Of the matters related to munitions production that are under the jurisdiction of other provinces, the necessary ones will be transferred to the Ministry of Munitions. After the abolition of the Planning Board, comprehensive adjustment matters related to the national policy of both material and spiritual aspects will be operated simply and forcefully by the cabinet. Matters related to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce that have little to do with munitions production will be handled separately. Consider hiring current military officers (including civil servants) from the army and navy as officials of the Ministry of Munitions. The organization plan of the Ministry of Munitions is based on extreme simplification. The Ministry of Munitions is scheduled to close on November 1, and related parties are rapidly preparing.

### Summary of Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth; Secretary General Yuan Talks About Key Points

Nanjing, 28th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Materials Control Review Committee has carefully studied the allocation method of cotton yarn and cloth after it is purchased in the Shanghai area. The seventh committee meeting was held in Beijing on the 27th, and it was decided to submit the Outline for Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth to the council's superior office, which will be reviewed in the next review committee meeting and then promulgated and implemented by order of the Executive Yuan. Yuan, a member and secretary general of the council, explained the allocation policy to reporters after the meeting. The goal is to ensure that the purchase of yarn and cloth, the adjustment of commodity prices, the increase in production, and the stability of people's livelihood are consistent. The content of the Outline for Control and Allocation of Cotton Yarn and Cloth is roughly as follows: The purchase of cotton yarn and cloth by both China and Japan will be allocated entirely by the Shangtonghui [Trade Control Commission], therefore, the yarn and cloth purchased by Japan should immediately study the measures to transfer it to the Shangtonghui. The allocation is based on the principle of the Shangtonghui's subordinate agencies. This Shangtonghui should expedite the establishment and strengthening of local cotton yarn allocation organizations. The organization centered on the allocation of yarn and cloth is part of the Shangtonghui. Therefore, the profits and losses of the purchase price should be determined by the Shangtonghui. When it is necessary to export yarn and cloth, the Review Committee must be consulted and the Executive Yuan will make a decision. Regarding the removal of yarn and cloth to areas outside of Central China, North China, and South China, this year's project has already been decided and will be carried out according to the planned plan. The general allocation outside of Central China will be based on the principle of saving materials, determining the reasonable consumption of each person, and allocating according to the population of the peaceful area. However, special allocations are planned for military needs, important production, and patients. In order to consider the effective use of the main materials obtained, efforts will be made to reduce the above-mentioned allocations so that there will be no excessive allocations. A separate allocation plan will be made for those who use it to trade with the enemy. When formulating the allocation ticket system and determining the consumption of each person, the relevant administrative officials and the Shangtonghui will closely liaise to make a decision. The allocation price is based on the actual local price in principle, and a gradual commodity price allocation policy is adopted. After necessary procedures, the Shangtonghui will make a decision. When there is a surplus due to the above measures, in order to be fair, measures will be studied to announce its contents. Also, regarding the policy of its use, it will focus on rational use in order to adjust commodity prices, increase agricultural production, and stabilize people's livelihood. The control measures for the collection and allocation of cotton will be determined separately.

### Germany Determined to Fight to the End for National Survival, Ribbentrop Broadcasts a Speech

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop broadcast a speech at 7:30 PM yesterday, stating that the purpose of the Tripartite Pact is to restore the right to survival to the nations whose positions have deteriorated due to historical relations in the past, and to satisfy all the absolutely indispensable requirements of these nations. In the past few years, the impoverished nations have repeatedly endeavored to seek a peaceful resolution with the wealthy nations, but these negotiations have all failed. The countries that have consistently opposed these efforts are the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. What these countries are attempting is nothing more than to dominate and enslave the European nations, and the countries that want to conquer the world are the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, not the Axis countries. In particular, the communist country's intention to invade is the most obvious. Now, the communist ideology and military force are confronting the solid defensive lines built by the German army. If the German army does not completely eliminate the danger of communism, it will never lay down its arms. The United Kingdom and the United States are currently cooperating with the Soviet Union to attack Europe, but if the Soviets win, it will be a major disaster for the democratic countries. The people of the United Kingdom and the United States will one day realize that the country that can save Europe and rescue the democratic countries from this terrifying situation is the German nation and its allies. What kind of attitude the democratic countries will take towards Europe can be seen from their attitude towards the Italian people. The former Italian King and the Badoglio faction have accepted the Allied demand for unconditional surrender, and the Allies are openly demanding the confiscation of all Italian territories in Africa, and secretly plotting the complete disintegration of Italy. However, since Commander Mussolini was rescued, he has declared the continued existence of the Tripartite Pact in his capacity as Chairman of the new Fascist Republic government, and has stated that the Italian people will cooperate with their allies and continue to fight together. Mussolini convened the first cabinet meeting of the new Fascist Republic government on the anniversary of the signing of the three-nation alliance, but these facts are good omens for the future. The past year can be described as a year of fierce fighting, and the Axis forces have achieved several important victories, while also encountering some setbacks. The Allies, based on some of their successes, have mobilized all propaganda machinery to predict future victories, and even claim that the Allies have already won. However, I would like to say one more thing to the German people here, and I am confident that the people of all the Allies of the Tripartite Pact will not be swayed by this kind of stupid and arrogant propaganda. The people of the countries belonging to the Tripartite Pact number approximately 250 million, and they are still in Europe and East Asia making the greatest sacrifices for their countries and freedom at any time. Neither communism nor democracy can conquer Europe or cause Japan in East Asia to collapse. The courage and determination of the Axis's sea, land, and air forces will achieve even greater victories in future battles. The Axis forces will constantly attack the enemy, annihilate them, and make them realize that this is the punishment for launching the war without permission. When this arduous struggle comes to an end in the future, the countries of the Tripartite Pact will build a new order, which can compensate their people for the many sacrifices made on the battlefield or on the domestic front. The Allied countries will therefore be able to obtain the freedom and happiness of their own people in the future. The victory of the war is in our hands, which is our absolutely unwavering belief. On this day, we are happy to celebrate the third anniversary of the three-nation alliance. We express our gratitude for the achievements of the army, navy, and air force. We loyally unite and support the leader in order to strive for final victory.

### British Troops Gain Foothold on Leros Island in the Aegean Sea, German Troops Occupy Corfu Island

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ It was announced here last night that the British have gained a foothold on Leros Island in the northern Dodecanese. After the arrival of a British convoy, they established a base in the port of Portolago. However, the German heavy fighter squadron continued to attack the port, thwarting the British advance. One British destroyer was heavily damaged and unable to navigate, and another was directly hit and exploded. A fully loaded cargo ship of approximately 9,000 tons sank.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ German troops landed on Corfu Island near Greece on the 26th. Before the landing, the Badoglio rebels on the island refused to accept the German ultimatum. The German troops defeated the rebels and captured thousands of people, and occupied the island in a short time.

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ It was announced today that the port of Split (Shtli) in Dalmatia, occupied by the Badoglio army and rebel party, was captured by German troops yesterday.

### German Lines in Southern Italy

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ According to Reuters, German military sources described the current defensive line of the German troops in southern Italy as follows: South of Sorrento on the Sorrento-Otranto peninsula, through Salerno, along the Picentine Mountains, east along the southern foothills of the Picentine Mountains, and then along the Ofanto River to Barletta. The British troops advancing slowly along the east coast have reached an undefended area south of Barletta. There is fierce fighting in the area outside Salerno, where the German troops are defending from the mountains, while the Allies have only a narrow road and are in a more difficult situation.

### Yesterday's Confucian Birthday Commemoration, Confucius Temple Held Sacrificial Ceremony, Ceremony Solemn and Reverent

Central News Agency Report: Yesterday was the anniversary of the birth of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius. All sectors of the city, as customary, raised flags in commemoration. Government agencies, organizations, and schools took a day off. The City Government held a grand autumn sacrificial ceremony at the Confucius Temple on Confucius Temple Road in the southern city yesterday morning. The ceremony was solemn and reverent, even more elaborate than the spring ceremony. The Confucius Temple was heavily guarded from yesterday morning. The Second Police Bureau of the City dispatched a large number of police officers, personally supervised by Chief Inspector Guo Shaoyi, to be on guard. Banners with white characters on a red background saying "The Great Way Prevails When the World Is Shared by All" were hung high above the main roads. Red and green slogans were plastered on the walls inside and outside the Confucius Temple. On the Dacheng Hall, there was also a red silk gold-letter banner with the words "Confucius Birthday Commemoration Ceremony," creating a magnificent atmosphere. Red candles burned brightly on the hall, and the aroma of incense filled the air. Fresh flowers, sacrificial animals, and fine wines and fruits were arranged on the table, showing the grandeur and meticulousness of the arrangements.

Solemn Sacrificial Rite

The prelude to the grand ceremony began at ten o'clock with the sound of bells ringing three times and the opening of the gate. The officials in charge performed their duties. The chief officiant, Mayor's representative Zhao Zunyu, together with the assisting officiants and participating officiants, entered the Dacheng Hall in an orderly manner. After taking their places, the national anthem was sung, followed by the first rendition of the Zhaohua Chapter. Accompanied by music, the entire assembly stood and paid their highest respects to the national flag and the spirit tablet of Confucius. As the first offering began, the music and dance performers sang the He Chapter. They performed the Wu Gong dance. The chief officiant and the assisting officiants, led by the master of ceremonies, proceeded to the spirit tablets of the sages, presented silk and wine, and then returned to their places. At this point, the Wu Gong dance retreated, and the Wen De dance advanced, followed by the second offering, singing the Yi He Chapter, and performing the Wen De dance. The chief officiant, etc., again proceeded to the spirit tablets of the sages to perform the second offering. Finally, the final offering was performed, singing the Chang He Chapter, and performing the Wen De dance again. After the final offering of wine, the ritual of removing the offerings was performed. The music and dance performers played the music for removing the offerings and sang the Chang He Chapter. The entire assembly stood and paid their highest respects. The music then resumed, and the De He Chapter was sung again. Thereupon, the Master of Ceremonies burnt the prayer, the Silk Officer burnt the silk, and the Wine Officer burnt the wine. The chief officiant, etc., respectfully proceeded to the burning site to burn the prayer and silk. The door bell rang, all bells rang, and the sacrificial rite was completed. Then, Pan Yigao loudly recited the sacrificial prayer to Confucius. After the reading, Secretary-General Zhao Zunyu, representative of Mayor Chen, reported the significance of the commemoration in the Dacheng Hall.

Commemorative Significance

He briefly stated: "Today is the anniversary of the birth of the Most Sage Teacher Confucius, and the day of the Shanghai Special City Government's autumn sacrifice. Why do we hold a commemoration on Confucius's birthday? Of course, it is to admire our teacher Confucius, because each of us, from childhood to old age, has been deeply influenced by Confucius's teachings, and their true meaning lies in academics, which are used not only for problems in life, but also for problems in national politics. From daily life to national administration, everything is encompassed, using the Six Arts of Rites, Music, Archery, Charioteering, Writing, and Arithmetic as basic knowledge, and making them the foundation of education. Further, they are used in government and implemented in the country. Retreating, he deleted the Book of Poetry, revised the Book of Documents, and established Rites and Music to seek academic progress and research knowledge. Learning is for application, and application is in being a person. Academics and politics are united as one, complementing each other, so that an individual's life is enriched in school. From childhood, one starts with the small things of Music, Archery, Writing, and Arithmetic, cultivating talents and learning for application, cultivating a noble personality and using learned knowledge for the cause of the country and life. Confucius unified the knowledge that was not unified in the Zhou Dynasty, and then used the doctrine of the Mean to handle everything. Activating learning is Confucius's highest essence, and it is what we have been learning from for thousands of years. Not only does China regard Confucius's knowledge as indestructible, but the entire Eastern academics also regards him as the source. Because Confucius's knowledge is a model for the world, he is sacrificed to and prayed to every time his birthday comes. Briefly summarizing, I report on the commemoration of Confucius." Then, after Sun Deyu, a representative of the Confucius Sage Association and the Xuewu Association, gave a speech on the events of Confucius's life, the Confucius Commemoration Song was sung, and a photograph was taken to complete the ceremony.

### Hirota, Head of the Information Department, Discusses American Economic Strategies, Attempts to Seize Global Economic Domination

Central News Agency Report: Hirota, head of the Japanese embassy's information department, declared when hosting foreign journalists yesterday that if the Chongqing side remains unaware of America's obvious strategy to seize control of the global economy after the war, China will be subjected to economic bondage by Britain and the United States. While vehemently denouncing America's attempt to seize global economic domination, Hirota said that the generous lending of large sums of money to other countries in the Allied camp by the United States is merely a guise for expanding territory and economic power after the war. Currently, those who receive various forms of assistance from the United States, including the Chiang Kai-shek regime, will not be able to repay this debt, a point that the United States knows well from its experience in World War I. However, what the United States is doing now is precisely to take advantage of this inability to repay to carry out its "economic conspiracy," which is already evident from the large-scale reorganization of the US administrative side. Even Chongqing is suspicious of America's attitude towards Chinese investment under Chongqing's control. A recent editorial in the Chongqing newspaper "Central Daily News" warned the Chinese people to recognize that the motive behind the United States increasing investment funds in China is not for the benefit of the Chinese people, but for the benefit of the United States. Therefore, the Chinese must be cautious and not be deceived by the United States' economic policies in China. At the recently concluded "Eleventh Central Executive Committee" of the Kuomintang, a resolution was passed stating that Chongqing welcomes foreign loans and investments, but Chongqing also encourages close cooperation between Chinese and foreigners in private enterprises. This resolution is the result of Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen's activities in the United States; conversely, it may also indicate that Chongqing's true intention for foreign investment in China is still unclear. The recent reorganization of the US administrative side, with the merging of the four offices of the War Production Board into the Foreign Economic Administration led by Crowder, is sufficient to show America's extravagant hope to control the world's economy after the war. This extravagant hope is even more evident when coupled with the resignation of Deputy Secretary of State Welles and the succession of Stettinius, the former head of the Lend-Lease Administration, as Stettinius is more suitable for the position of Deputy Secretary of State at a time when current US foreign policy emphasizes the economic aspect.

### Education Personnel's Second Discussion Group Meeting Yesterday

The City Party Headquarters of this city hosted a discussion group meeting for all education workers in the city.

Over 130 principals and deans or teaching directors from 45 middle schools attended.

### Doctor Zhu Ziyun Subject to Suspension

Datong News Agency Report: A reporter went to ask Director Fang Jufan of the Health Department about the case of national doctor Zhu Ziyun causing death due to professional negligence and how it would be handled. It was answered that the criminal part of the case has been handled according to the law. As for the part that violated doctors' rules, the current authorities have sent personnel to investigate and have now decided to impose a suspension in accordance with the provisions of Articles 12, 19, and 21 of the Provisional Rules for the Management of Traditional Chinese Medicine, and ordered the doctor's license to be submitted to the bureau for temporary storage. The length of the suspension will be determined after the court's verdict.

### Silk and Silk Products Should Be Allowed to Be Moved Freely, Silk Mills and Other Industries Petition for Relief

The silk mill industry, silk shop industry, and silk fabric shop industry associations, regarding the movement of major commodities, have recently, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement and the Major Commodity Registration Rules, petitioned the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Industry and Commerce through the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for relief according to the law. Their reasons are as follows: Major commodities are the 18 types of goods stipulated in the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's notification of May 3 this year (silk and silk products are also included). According to the instructions of this city's Economic Bureau's Economic Affairs Fourth Department No. 36, those who should obtain a movement permit also include silk and silk products. Checking the provisions of Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement promulgated by the government on March 11 this year, silk and silk products are not included. Later, the Ministry of Industry and Commerce's May 3 notification of the list of major commodities included silk and silk products in item 7. However, reviewing the original text of Article 6 of the Wartime Materials Movement Control Regulations, those who must apply for permission to move materials into and out of the Shanghai area are still limited to the items stipulated in Article 6 of those regulations. Since silk and silk products are not listed in Article 6 of the aforementioned regulations, there is no reason to apply for or obtain a movement certificate when moving them in the three provinces and two cities, and this port. This is clearly demonstrated. Therefore, the National Commercial Control Council sent a letter to the Silk Industry Federation regarding silk and silk products and silk fabrics and satin moving in the three provinces and two cities, or this city. According to the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement, it is not necessary to obtain permission from this association. The case files are there and can easily be reviewed. Even checking the provisions of Article 6 of the Major Commodity Registration Rules promulgated by the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on May 11 this year, it only stipulates that when there are changes or cancellations in the registration items, the applicant should submit a monthly report to the local competent authority according to the procedures stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 1. There is no stipulation that the movement of major commodities must be reported to the local competent authority in advance to obtain a movement permit. It is believed that the government's laws and regulations on material control should be based on the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Materials Movement and the Major Commodity Registration Rules as the standard. The management of materials by local competent authorities can only be implemented in accordance with the methods stipulated in the aforementioned regulations and rules. Any behavior that exceeds the central government's promulgated regulations is a violation of the law. At this time when the wartime system is being promoted, it is hoped that local authorities can strictly abide by central government laws and implement central government policies in order to achieve policy unification. Based on the methods stipulated by laws and regulations, this association believes that the Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau's instructions to handle the movement permit for major commodities is a contradiction to central government laws and regulations and should be requested to be forwarded to the Executive Yuan for correction.

The company's representative introduced Miss Choi to various people.

### Grain Transportation in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Provinces - Water and Land Transportation in All Rice-Producing Areas

The transportation of rice and grain in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is crucial to the food supply and common price for the citizens of Shanghai. The following is an investigation record: Liangxi in Zhejiang province and Songjiang, Jinshan, and Qingpu in Jiangsu province are all well-known rice-producing areas. They have many waterways connecting to Shanghai, which are suitable for boat transportation. Japanese ships transporting rice have a system of "guaranteed capacity," ensuring that losses are minimized within a certain limit. If the warehouses in Shanghai are located along the Huangpu River or Suzhou Creek, the rice can be directly unloaded into the warehouses after being loaded onto boats in the inland areas, making the process more convenient and reducing losses compared to transporting rice by truck. In Jiangsu province, Wujiang, Taicang, Wuxian, Changzhou, Jintan, Yixing, and Changshu are also rice-producing areas with many waterways connecting to Suzhou Creek, which are suitable for boat transportation. However, Changzhou, Yixing, and Jintan are far away. If using civilian boats, it takes a long time. It would be more convenient to transport the rice by short-distance boats to Danyang and Changzhou, and then transport it by train. Changshu, on the other hand, is located far from the railway lines and can only be transported by civilian boats. Rice markets in Anhui province are mostly concentrated in Wuhu. Rice-producing areas include Nanling, Chaohu, Hefei, Sanhe, Dangtu, Qingshuihe, Wuwei, Fanchang, Digang, Wuhu, and the local county. The waterways in the famous counties north of the Yangtze River can be used to transport rice to Wuhu by civilian boats. The famous counties south of the Yangtze River use both trucks and civilian boats. After the rice is concentrated in the Wuhu warehouses, it can be directly transported to Shanghai via the Jingwu Road, or loaded onto boats and unloaded at the Bund, depending on the quantity of rice and the smoothness of transportation. The above is merely a general description of the recent transportation of rice between various places and Shanghai.

Once a decision is made, it will be announced publicly. As the aforementioned report is not in accordance with the facts, I hereby request that your newspaper make a correction. Respectfully, Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Rice Control Committee, September 28th.

Economic Commentary

### The Destination of Floating Capital

Looking ahead to Shanghai's price fluctuations, the fundamental reasons, other than reduced imports, industrial stagnation, currency depreciation, and hoarding of materials, are obviously known to any observer and the expansion of floating capital is one of the fundamental reasons.

Since the Reserve Certificate became the unified currency in Central and Southern China, the amount of Reserve Certificates issued has increased rapidly. From the late spring to early autumn of this year, a large number of Reserve Certificates flowed into the rural areas due to the successive purchases of agricultural products such as wheat, cotton, and rice. These certificates then flowed back to Shanghai, either remaining as current deposits in banks or being used as working capital for commercial and industrial enterprises. However, the Shanghai financial authorities did not fully implement controls until the past month or so, resulting in a state where floating capital had nowhere to go. The most adverse phenomenon was the inflow of floating capital into wrong paths, such as speculation, hoarding, and even into opium dens and gambling houses, causing great harm and suffering to the people, which is truly heartbreaking.

According to common sense during wartime, if production can be increased, the increase in the amount of currency is not a concern. Conversely, the lack of destination of floating capital is a cause for concern. In the past two months, due to the government's strengthening of controls and calls for increased production, as well as the voluntary savings campaigns by financial institutions, the wrong paths have all become "roads that do not pass". Even those who want to get on the right path are unable to do so.

Therefore, the Shanghai Chinese Merchant Securities Exchange, which has resumed operations today, should strive to increase the circulation of various productive securities in response to the changed environment, and make the normal destination of floating capital its greatest responsibility after resuming operations. In particular, it should ensure that social capital, which has a destination, is used appropriately in accordance with the wartime economy. Therefore, the securities listed on the exchange must be strictly examined.

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee Agrees on Wheat Movement Methods - Inspection Based on Permits and Invoices

After the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Bank of China Group and Japanese Banks established a 100,000,000 yuan wheat loan, they have implemented unified collection of wheat in three provinces and two cities. The flour mills have signed a wheat allocation agreement, and the commissioned merchants have signed a wheat purchase agreement and a discounting contract. Regarding the wheat movement procedures, the Flour and Wheat Special Committee has consulted with the local Food Bureau. To facilitate the gathering of sources, the movement of wheat from rural areas to the market should be completely free. However, to prevent leaks and facilitate inspection, the following methods have been established.

For wheat moved into Shanghai, a permit issued by the Commercial Control Committee is required, as well as a proof of registration stamp affixed by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee. For wheat moved within the province, an invoice from a merchant of the local trade association is required. The invoice must be from a member of the local Grain Trade Association in a specific province and district, and must state the member certificate number, wheat quantity, price, transportation method, and route. For wheat moved within the three provinces and two cities (excluding Shanghai), a permit issued by the local trade association and the local office of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee is required, and the permit must be approved by the food bureau of the province or city. Japanese merchants must obtain permission from the consulate and notify the food bureau.

### Oil Special Committee Completes Purchase Organization

As the new grain season is approaching, the Commercial Control Committee's Oil and Grain Special Committee has completed the various organizations that will be responsible for starting the purchase of grains. The reporter has obtained the following details:

Many Types of Grain to be Purchased

The oil and grain to be purchased by the Oil and Grain Committee include all types of grains (except rice and wheat). Grains include beans (soybeans, red beans, mung beans) and corn and sorghum. Oil and fertilizer raw materials include rapeseed, sesame, peanuts, linseed oil, tung oil, and cypress seeds. Miscellaneous bones include cow bones and pig bones.

Offices Established in Eleven Regions

To facilitate buying, selling, storing, transporting, and other necessities, the committee has established offices in eleven regions: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Northern Anhui (Bengbu), Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Anqing, Yixing, Taizhou and Tonghai (Nantong and Haimen). These offices will promote all necessary business matters in their respective regions, and additional branch offices will be established to increase the smoothness of purchases.

Purchasing System Divided into Three Stages

The purchasing is mainly divided into three systems: commissioned merchants, purchasing merchants, and oil and grain firms. Commissioned merchants are responsible for purchasing, and lend purchasing funds to purchasing merchants. Purchasing merchants then cooperate with local oil and grain firms to carry out the purchasing. Therefore, commissioned merchants must have sufficient funds to take on this responsibility. It is best if purchasing merchants themselves have cash so that they can cooperate with commissioned merchants and oil and grain firms.

Chinese and Japanese Establish Associations

According to a Japanese newspaper report, the Japanese side of the Oil and Grain Committee is organized by the China Japanese Oil and Grain Trade Association Joint Council, which has established Japanese Oil and Grain Trade Associations in fourteen regions: Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Yixing, Taixian, Nantong, Changzhou, Bengbu, Anqing, and Donghe. The Chinese side is organized by the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Grain Trade Association Joint Council and the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Edible Oil Trade Association Joint Council, which are further divided into lower-level organizations.

### Another Letter to the Industrial and Commercial Sectors

To the esteemed gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors: As the Shen Bao observes that there have been many changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years, and to facilitate inspection and reference, it plans to compile a "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory". We are grateful to the various trade associations for providing information. Recently, we sent an open letter to the gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors, requesting accurate survey data, and we have received letters from various companies and factories providing detailed information, for which we are very grateful. To further expand the investigation, we have created a form (see the second page of this newspaper on September 20th; forms can also be requested by mail). We hope that the gentlemen of the industrial and commercial sectors will take the time to complete the form in detail and send it to us so that we can make detailed corrections during compilation. Whether you are a member of a trade association or not, and regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all industrial and commercial operators in Shanghai are welcome.

Respectfully, the Shen Bao

### Chinese and Japanese Merchants in Central China Establish Joint Association Regulations - Implementing Increased Production, Purchasing, and Distribution

### The Life of a Clerical Trainee

â€” Chen Xue

I have been working at a silk shop for more than two years. I remember it was last December that I was transferred to the newly emerging industrial company, and my joy at that time was beyond description.

I am a trainee. I have been a trainee for almost three years, and I know that I have limited gains, but the ways of the world have made me understand a lot.

I practice clerical work. Clerical work belongs to the secretarial office and also to the general affairs section. Although our organization is commercialized, official documents such as "as instructed," "approved by the previous letter," "should be complied with immediately," and "should be investigated" are always visible. We handle clerical work in three steps: receiving and sending, proofreading, and signing and sealing, which is not much different from the government.

Because of the lessons taught by the heads of the secretarial section, I have been influenced and can also write "official documents." I can also adjust the balance between busy and idle, so I am interested in my work.

What about life? Our meals and accommodation are provided. We eat when the bell rings and sleep when it gets dark. The rise and fall of rice prices and whether coal balls can be bought are things we don't ask about.

In addition to meals and accommodation, I have more than one hundred yuan in allowance, which is enough for me to spend personally as I have no family burden.

The purpose of the company is to support the development of industry and commerce. I hope that the company can thoroughly do it.

### The School for the Unfortunate - A Record of the School for the Blind (Part 2)

The Wonders of a Blind Children's Classroom

The student organization in a school for the blind is similar to that of a regular school, ranging from the first grade of elementary school to the third grade of junior high school. Each grade has a homeroom teacher responsible for instruction. Most of the teachers are also blind. The first one or two grades have a non-blind caretaker who is responsible for the students' meals and daily life.

The elementary school section occupies an entire Western-style building, including classrooms for each grade and a covered play area for rainy days. Mr. Yang, who teaches grades one and two, is currently teaching writing. The teacher recites standard Mandarin Chinese clearly, and the students eagerly listen. What's surprising is that they don't use writing brushes, slate pencils, lead pencils, or fountain pens, but rather an awl-like iron stylus (similar in price to a pen for writing Braille, but with a very short handle). For the paper, there is a specially made tool, similar to a tailor's measuring tool, made of copper, about one foot long and one inch wide. It is divided into upper and lower plates. The upper plate has a frame, and the lower plate has indentations, similar to the "marking pins" used by tailors, but based on six indentations. When writing, the paper is placed between the two copper plates, and then the iron stylus is used to strike down and create symbols. One would imagine that writing phonetically would be very slow, but in reality, the children's hands move incessantly, quickly recording line after line what the teacher says.

The students in grades three and four are studying on their own, quietly feeling their way through books of various sizes, reading without much difficulty. Several students are feeling the Braille on the pages with one hand and copying it down with the other, looking no different from how sighted people copy books. Grades five and six are taught in separate classes because educating blind children is more difficult. Each class cannot exceed ten students at most, and the blind teachers explain the lessons diligently. One class is learning arithmetic. Blackboards and pens are not needed here; they use textbooks and paper for calculations. However, it is said that even complex and advanced teaching can be done just as well as with sighted students. In another class, a blind student is standing and reciting a long passage for a language lesson, with intonation and an understanding expression, almost like reciting a novel or poem.

The curriculum for the third grade of junior high school is the same as that of regular schools. In addition, starting from the third grade, a separate department for girls is established, specifically for female blind students. The organization is the same as that for boys, but they occupy a separate Western-style building and are cared for separately from the boys. A returned overseas Chinese woman from Canada, Ms. Ye Runhua, oversees them. She asks a female blind student to randomly select several books. The student's index fingers move like the antennae of an insect, or like a pair of shuttles on a loom, rapidly moving across the pages while reciting an English song and an ancient Chinese poem. Her clear and accurate tone ends emphatically on the line:

"If you don't work hard when you are young, you will only regret it when you are old!"

Arts and Printing Department

The students at the School for the Blind are studying hard, so there is really no need to feel regret.

In addition to the nine levels of academic subjects from elementary to junior high school, there are also departments for crafts, printing, and other vocational training.

In terms of vocational training, there are sewing, knitting, typing, and rattan and bamboo crafts, among others. The sewing course is taught by a specialist instructor, mainly targeting female students. After the patterns are cut, they sew them together, and the finished products are just as good as those made by sighted people. In the knitting course, the female students are currently busy working, knitting woolen sweaters, gloves, and patches, which look very exquisite. It's hard to believe that they are made by the hands of students. They also knit mesh bags, but this has been virtually suspended because the raw materials are difficult to obtain.

In the typing room, there are many typewriters on display. One type is a regular model, but the difference is that the typists do not use original manuscripts. They only use their own mental drafts, or listen to someone else's dictation, and immediately and quickly type it out in English. They are practically the most skilled reporters! All the school's English correspondence, accounts, and so on, are said to be mostly typed by blind students! In addition, there is a special typewriter for the blind, which is simpler in style and produces Braille.

Rattan and bamboo crafts were originally one of the school's productive activities. There has always been a crafts department, headed by Director Nei Song, with the employment of technicians such as Wu Damu and others, actively promoting industrial production. In 1931, for example, there were ten students employed in the work program, and sales of products reached more than 4,200 yuan. Later, it was further expanded, and a sales outlet was planned in the urban area. Sales markets were also opened up in Japan, Southeast Asia, and Europe and the Americas, receiving praise from all sides. However, since two years ago, due to transportation and raw material difficulties, it has been suspended. Now, only a few achievements of the blind workers remain. From suitcases and trunks to tables, chairs, and stools, each item shows the characteristics of blind people's art, attracting praise.

But the most praiseworthy thing is the printing department of the School for the Blind! It is headed by Mr. Yu Ziying. The main tasks are: 1. Compiling and printing publications for the blind. One is the "Lighthouse Monthly," the only regular publication for the blind in the country, which is distributed to schools for the blind and blind organizations in various provinces and counties. An average of 260 copies are printed per issue, with about twelve pages each. It has contributed to promoting and inspiring education for the blind throughout the country. The other is a weekly publication for blind Christians in Asia, which is even responsible for assisting international work. 2. Compiling and printing textbooks and reference books, such as "Elementary Braille," Braille dictionaries, musical scores, and maps, which are the only source of educational tools for schools for the blind throughout the country. Unfortunately, due to financial difficulties and paper shortages, most of the machines in the printing department that specialize in printing Braille are now covered with a thick layer of dust, and the machines also have a feeling of "é«€è‚‰å¾©ç”Ÿ" (the flesh on the thighs growing back, a metaphor for being idle for too long).

Literature, Music, and Blind Talents

In addition to national education, vocational education, and practical workshops, the School for the Blind has also established various specialized departments to cultivate specialized talents among the students, and many "blind talents" have emerged â€“ outstanding individuals among the blind.

In the literature department, in order to prepare students for higher education, the school has raised the standards of various courses since 1931, so that students can develop their intelligence as much as possible. The curriculum for elementary, high, and junior high school levels is not only consistent with and connected to regular schools, but also strives to surpass them. In addition, a special teacher training program is offered to provide those who are interested in education for the blind with opportunities for specialized study and practice. As for religious affairs, Vice Principal He Zihjian said that the school fully adopts the principle of freedom of religion, so the teachers and students are not necessarily limited to Christians. There are also Catholics, Buddhists, and those with no religious beliefs. However, most of them are Christians, so there are also Sunday schools, morning and evening prayer meetings, encouragement meetings, and other religious gatherings.

The music department of the School for the Blind is very famous. The school currently has a building that is a palace of music. In addition to the music equipment for gatherings, there are also specially built small music self-study rooms, each independent and equipped with organs, pianos, and other musical instruments. Perhaps music has the greatest calming and soothing power on education. Early in the morning, there are blind students who have a special love for music practicing. The head of the music department is Mr. Chang Lieqing, a blind scholar. It is said that there was originally a music team, with Mr. Hu Guangliao as the instructor. This band has been praised by all walks of life, and many geniuses have been discovered among the school's blind students. When the famous "Trinity College of Music" in the United Kingdom came to the East to select musical talents, some of the school's blind children, such as Shao Rongjun, were selected and received international praise. In addition, the school's blind students often perform at places such as the Great Light Cinema, receiving considerable praise. Unfortunately, all the musical instruments were lost in the Battle of Shanghai, and the music team is now unable to recover, leaving only the organ class, piano class, and singing class. However, the aftersound of a piano piece played by a dozen female blind students in the auditorium is still enough to demonstrate the depth of the students' achievements in the school's music department.

Blind talents are discovered in every department of the school.

Take Fan Fucheng, the current director of academic affairs at the school, for example. He is one of the graduates of the alma mater. Due to his own efforts and the school's effective education, he obtained the opportunity for further studies. After entering St. John's University, he was always at the top of his class and was the first Chinese blind person to obtain a university degree. For more than twenty years, he has devoted himself to education for the blind with all his heart, enduring hardship and tirelessly, which is even more admirable.

Vice Principal He Zihjian said that a total of sixty or seventy students have transferred from the school to high school and university. In addition to some who serve in the business community, most of them are developing education for the blind throughout the country. Nearby places such as Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Shaoxing, and distant places such as Guangdong, Sichuan, Yunnan, Qinghai, and Southeast Asia all have students from the Shanghai School for the Blind promoting the education of the blind. Jiang Shaocheng from Jiangyin, who went to Qinghai to start education for the blind among the "ethnic minorities," is also a graduate of the school.

About thirteen or fourteen blind students have graduated from the school and completed university education. Most of them are now working in the education field, all of whom are competent and happy, and have received praise from all sides. There are also many who are still studying at universities. In the autumn of 1937, the School for the Blind also assisted the student Xue Guobiao to study in the United States, specializing in education for the blind. He graduated last year, but has not been able to return to the country due to the wartime difficulties.

Now, who says there are no extraordinary talents among the blind? (To be continued)

### Developing Resources, Increasing Agricultural Production (Part 2)

Hokkaido

The strengthening of Hokkaido's war power includes Taiwan, Sakhalin, and Shikoku. Because of its large area, it is even more powerful. The Hokkaido Agency is increasing the production of five major industries such as iron and coal, while concentrating all its efforts on increasing food production. In order to achieve the goal of the "Five-Year Food Production Increase Plan," farmers are being mobilized. This plan, which began in the spring of this year, focuses on land improvement projects. The project funds are paid by the national treasury, totaling approximately 150 million yuan over five years. After the success of this plan, it is expected to increase by 1.5 million koku (çŸ³, a Japanese unit of volume).

Land improvement is one of the important national policies. In Hokkaido, it has moved from the planning stage to the stage of realization.

The "Temporary Hokkaido Land Improvement Headquarters" was established as a guiding organization for the implementation of the plan. The governor, Sakado, serves concurrently as the director-general, and the director of the Promotion Department, Ishihara, and the director of the Economic Department, Qian, serve as the deputy directors-general. Jian Iwakiri, a qualified engineer, serves as the chief engineer. Thirty-three advisors, sixteen councilors, and thirty-nine executive secretaries were hired. Among the executive secretaries, those who serve as the heads of the General Affairs, Construction, Guidance, Labor, Materials, and On-site departments all work at the agency. The fourteen sub-prefectures are concurrently headed by the sub-prefectural governors as the sub-prefectural directors. In the towns and villages, the village chiefs serve concurrently as the directors of the implementation departments, and the heads of agricultural organizations serve concurrently as the deputy directors, each responsible for directing land improvement.

The Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Tang Ze, also expressed full support for the measures taken by the Hokkaido Agency, stating:

Increasing food production lies in improving the land. For this reason, the government has also decided to pay additional reserve funds for land improvement, in order to increase food production. This is not only the case for Hokkaido, but also for other prefectures and counties. Considering the labor, materials, and area, Hokkaido is the easiest to implement. Since the funding belongs to the Hokkaido Colonization Fund, it is included in the internal affairs budget. This province will naturally work together with Hokkaido to make efforts to advance.

Preventing the Abandonment of Rice Fields

What should be mentioned here is the issue of organizing land improvement associations. Land improvement associations are the only organizations that maintain roads, bridges, dikes, and other infrastructure that are the foundation of rural construction. They were established in 1902 based on the Hokkaido Land Improvement Association Law, and are responsible for managing rice fields. These associations have been continuously established over the years. At most, there were over 250. Recently, due to poor harvests and increased maintenance costs, they have declined. Of the 195 associations that exist today, 180 are still in debt, with a total debt of 29 million yuan. The state of their depression can be said to be tragic. The Ministry of Finance has invested 10 million yuan in the associations. The Hokkaido Agency is now carrying out the reorganization of land improvement associations at the same time as land improvement. This time, the Ministry of Finance has specially sent the Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, Po Shui, and Vice Minister Tang Ze to accompany them, to examine the current situation of land improvement associations at close range.

The Vice Minister of Internal Affairs, Tang Ze, and his party personally and carefully inspected the situation of land improvement associations, and witnessed the reality of various depressions. They all agreed that the solution to rescuing these associations is to have them managed by the state, with interest-free loans and the development of wasteland. The Director-General of the General Affairs Bureau, Po Shui, summarized his conclusions after the inspection, stating:

Even if it is barren land, now is the time to find ways to increase food production. Then, the matter of the associations should be reconsidered. There are various reasons for the abandonment, but I think the main reasons are the weather, geography, and the sincerity of the operators. Agriculture requires cooperative means. The associations should not be allowed to be in debt. Proper plans should be made to help them succeed, so that land improvement can be successful.

Reading the above remarks shows the concern of the authorities for the reorganization of land improvement associations.

The Effect of the Administrative Council

There is already a glimmer of hope for the reorganization of the associations. The vast Hokkaido is now advancing towards the completion of the five-year food production increase plan. Officials and civilians are united and have begun to advance. Hokkaido and the Aleutian Islands are within easy reach. This tense situation of "increasing production in front of the enemy" is not seen in other prefectures and counties. The young rural leaders who are trained at the Hachinohe Academy and the Nopporo Machinery School are particularly enthusiastic, and the future is absolutely certain.

Secondly, what is most deeply felt by inspecting Hokkaido and Sakhalin is the Hokkaido Regional Administrative Council, which provides research materials for the application of local administration. The councils in the nine regions of the country have been in operation for two and a half months since they began to operate. Although they have transitioned from the experimental stage to the active stage, there are still constant "unharmonious discussions." However, the situation in the Hokkaido region is different. The effectiveness is amazing. They can be used 100%, exerting great power on the revitalization and strengthening of administration, and providing a standard for other councils. The reason is that Hokkaido, Sakhalin, and the jurisdictional boundaries of various special local agencies are consistent, and the comprehensive administrative authority of the South Commander is broader and more powerful than that of other prefectures and counties. The exchange of materials between Hokkaido and Sakhalin is large in quantity and closely related. Geographically, they share the commonality of being a northern base. In particular, at the two-hall joint liaison council on August 11 and 12, Hokkaido proposed: "To establish a food self-sufficiency zone that integrates Hokkaido and Sakhalin. Originally, Sakhalin's shortage was about 600,000 koku, and Hokkaido's was about 600,000 koku. In the future, instead of relying on Honshu, Hokkaido will find a way to achieve self-sufficiency." The local administrative council also approved this proposal and has begun to transport it. The exchange of labor and the exchange of agricultural technology are gradually achieving results.

Enriching the Population of Hokkaido and Sakhalin

In short, Hokkaido and Sakhalin are now doing their utmost to increase food production and war materials. However, in order for it to become a major arsenal and to fulfill the country's mission, it is urgent to realize the following policies.

To ensure a population of 5 million in Hokkaido and 1 million in Sakhalin â€“ a shortage of human resources is the biggest problem for northern war power.

Strengthening transportation â€“ maritime transport is the path to developing the north, and it is hoped that the government will value it as a national issue and work hard to shorten the connection between Hokkaido and Sakhalin.

Localizing life â€“ the people who move from Honshu, not to mention Hokkaido, even in Sakhalin, still have the same clothing, food, and housing. This point needs to be reconsidered, and a lifestyle that adapts to the local area must be realized.

The reporter saw the guidance of Hokkaido Governor Sakado and Sakhalin Governor Otsu, and also witnessed the current situation in the north, so he wrote this article to provide the central government with a mountain of stones from other mountains for promoting administration. At the same time, I hope that the development of Hokkaido and Sakhalin will always be based on a military position, the self-sufficiency of food, maritime transport, and the uniqueness of labor adjustment. Hokkaido's food plan is already in place, and Sakhalin's development plan is also awaiting the on-site investigation of the members of the Sakhalin Investigation Committee, and is expected to produce a huge amount of resources worth 2 billion yuan by the end of this year.

### Reflections on Handling Official Documents

â€” Fang Zhengyi

Official documents are the documents used by government agencies to administer affairs. The completion of documents is archiving. Therefore, whether it is about all political facilities or various applications from the public, there must be documents on file based on relevant laws and regulations. Because government agencies must use the transmission of documents as the basis for administering affairs and auditing, the speed and simplicity of handling official documents will directly or indirectly affect the welfare of the people. Here, I will briefly describe my practical understanding of handling official documents, for reference.

We know that government agencies serve the people, so they can also be called public service agencies. Public service agencies have various laws and regulations to rely on for all political facilities. General administrative agencies that directly serve the people should promptly respond to various applications from the public based on the provisions of laws and regulations and the needs of the situation. They should not be put on the desk and delayed indefinitely. Even if there are some questions about the applications from the public under the law, they should first submit a detailed explanation to the higher-level agency, and then promptly respond to the applicant based on the explanatory document from the higher-level agency. Only in this way can they be called public service agencies in the true sense of the word. But what is the actual manifestation? Here, I really find it difficult to explain this answer, because the complex issues inside make it even more difficult for me to talk about. However, I still hope that public servants will be self-disciplined and self-respecting, and not leave a bad impression on the people. As the saying goes: "High is based on low, and grand is started from small." If we want to hope that the government can improve politics, it starts with the self-discipline and self-respect of each public servant. At the same time, I also deeply hope that the government authorities will urgently improve the procedures for handling official documents and strictly stipulate the dates of receipt and dispatch of each document, so as to avoid unexpected pain and increase unexpected losses to the people.

Secondly, there is the issue of unified authority. We know that public service agencies often have a common drawback, which is the inability to clearly divide authority, resulting in a situation where they tend to converge when there is a benefit and avoid each other when there is a problem. Even more, some administrative agencies, because of the inability to unify authority, issue mutually contradictory or identical duplicate government orders in the same case. Double taxation is often heard of, which causes great doubts among the public who lack common knowledge of official documents, and even suffer from not knowing what to do. Therefore, they have to ask for help from others, which causes them to waste their energy and money. The disadvantages are obvious, and directly affect the welfare of the people. This situation is really a kind of morbidity in politics. We trace the source and investigate the cause, and it is nothing more than the struggle for interests, but we cannot allow this struggle to cause the people to suffer great spiritual and material harm and suffering. Therefore, I deeply hope that the government authorities will improve this unreasonable morbidity and strictly define and clarify the functions of each administrative agency, so as to unify authority and have its own responsibility. In this way, the disadvantages of contention and avoidance can be prevented, and the people can comply with the government's orders without doubt.

Again, I want to talk about the official documents themselves. Everyone knows that the official document format in our country is circuitous and tortuous. Although there has been a reform, it is still not perfect. We can see that each official document has undergone several transformations of "etc. based on this," "etc. approved based on this," or "etc. according to this," which makes readers feel like they are lost in a fog. The original text inside is due to what was issued. Even those who are experienced in writing must carefully review it before they can know the source. Then, it is difficult for people who do not have a sound knowledge of official documents to distinguish the original situation. There is also a shortcoming, that is, the wording in the official documents is rounded and empty, without any boundaries, making it impossible for people to grasp after reading it. For example, regarding a document in which a person petitions for a case, the competent authority must solicit the opinions of other agencies before it can approve the petitioner. Then, in addition to describing the original text of other agencies, the competent authority should also clearly state its own approval intention, so that the petitioner can follow it. It cannot simply record the original text of external agencies and then use a set of stereotyped articles that are boundless, such as "...etc. approved based on this, it is hereby approved as previously stated, and it is hereby ordered to be notified and complied with." Even more, some lazy drafters, for the original text of external agencies, can obviously adopt the concise description method, but because they are economical in their mental energy, they must reiterate the original text of the external agencies from beginning to end, and then add a rigid head and foot, and then it is over. However, official documents like that must make people have unclear and incomprehensible places. The secretaries and section chiefs who approve the draft are also just signing a word or stamping a seal, and then they consider the task to be completed. This phenomenon should also be reformed. "One word is simple and concise" is the main thing in handling official documents. Use more pre-narrative methods and less irrigation of thick water. Only this is the right way. We also hope that the government authorities will proceed with the simplification of official documents as soon as possible. If the procedures for handling official duties can be simplified as much as possible, then administrative efficiency can definitely be improved.

### Establishing a Nighttime Self-Defense Corps

â€” Zhang Huinan

Since our city began organizing the Baojia Self-Defense Corps, their guard duty times have mostly been during the daytime and before midnight. Moreover, the posts are all along the streets, which seems inappropriate. Now, based on my limited observations, I will briefly note a few points below:

During the daytime, most men are out working, and sometimes this inevitably conflicts with guard duty hours.

During the daytime, there are many eyes watching, and theft is certainly less frequent than late at night. Therefore, it might be advisable to add a nighttime self-defense corps. The greatest goal of this measure is to prevent theft, avoid conflict with work in terms of time, and also to curb the bad habit of citizens gambling during their nighttime leisure. Regarding the points to be noted when establishing a nighttime self-defense corps:

Members must be young and strong.

Posts should be set up at alley entrances (their quantity should be determined according to the size of the alley). Members must constantly patrol the vicinity of their posts, especially the dark corners at the alleyâ€™s end.

Each post must have at least two members, in order to be prepared for emergencies and so they will not feel lonely late at night.

Members are strictly forbidden from talking loudly or singing, so as not to wake residents and alert thieves to prepare themselves.

If citizens are gambling, members are authorized to order them to stop immediately. If there is resistance, a report can be made to the nearest police station. This point can help maintain peace and quiet in the city at night.

Members must absolutely not be replaced, in order to emphasize a sense of responsibility. Otherwise, if there is a theft and it is clearly investigated, the corps should bear considerable responsibility. If this proposal can be implemented, the daytime self-defense corps members could be appointed from those who are older and have free time, in order to make up for the lack of personnel.

### Street Scams

â€” Han Hongyu

In Shanghai, where people from all walks of life gather, scams are everywhere. Now, in the depths of autumn, swindlers appear on the streets and in the alleys with seasonal items. For example, there are some woolen sweaters with very low prices. For about twenty yuan, you can buy one in various colors, and they look beautiful on the surface. The stalls even have signs saying "Burned by Fire," indicating that the sweater factory was burned down, and they are selling them cheaply. This is also the cunning trick of the swindlers. Those who don't know the goods, because of the cheap price and listening to their sweet talk, buy them. When you get home and examine them carefully, you can see that the sweaters are woven with paper thread. After wearing it once, the paper thread will break, and the result is nothing gained! I hope people from all walks of life in society pay attention and don't be fooled!

### Strictly Guard Against Thieves

â€” Rong Xicun

Last month, a gang of thieves specializing in stealing travelers' luggage was discovered at the North Station, but after being noticed by the police, they have now disappeared. Yesterday, when I was going to school, I passed the intersection of Daxin Street on Route 30 and saw a child (about ten years old, neatly dressed) running away in front, followed by a person shouting "Catch him!" When the child was caught, he pulled out a roll of banknotes from his sleeve, knelt on the ground, and begged bitterly. Later, after passers-by informed the owner, he took pity on the child's youth and did not pursue the matter further.

It is said that the thief's method is very clever: he wears nice clothes and deliberately runs into people, and the money is out of the pocket before you know it. Often people don't pay attention. Unexpectedly, this time, the person's pocket was very small. When he was bumped, he felt something moving in his pocket. He looked and did not see his money, so he suspected that the child had taken it. Therefore, people have heard about this kind of thing beforehand and should be strictly on guard against it.

After the fact, it was revealed that many people have seen this incident. Therefore, it is important to pay attention to such children. If readers encounter such a thing in the future, do not be lenient because the person is young. You should hand him over to the police station to help break up the gang. This will not only benefit individuals, but also prevent these children from falling into a life of crime!
