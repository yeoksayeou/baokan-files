### The Greater East Asia War and China's Rise and Fall

— Chen Binhe

The Shanghai Broadcasting and Television Association held a special broadcast to commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. It specially invited Binhe to give his first broadcast, and he briefly contributed his views on this topic at 9:30 last night. The recording is hereby published.

England colonized the coast of Bengal, India, three hundred years ago, and began its invasion of India. The Netherlands also wantonly invaded various islands such as Java and Celebes. Although these invaders initially made excuses for trade, they often secretly oppressed the various peoples of East Asia. The tragedy of Asia actually began here. Since the discovery of gold mines in California a hundred years ago, the United States has focused its attention on the Pacific coast, and its ambition has crossed the sea to Asia, trying its best to divide Asia, which has been transformed into the market of European countries. It deliberately launched the Spanish-American War, seizing the Philippines from Spain as a base for extracting resources from East Asia. The raising of British and American flags in various parts of Asia by Britain and the United States through inhumane actions and wars was certainly not what the people of various Asian countries were willing to accept. Our Asian people all long for the day when we Asians will tear down the national flags of the invaders and replace them with Asian flags.

The British and American invaders were most afraid of the awakening of the East Asian nations, and especially jealous of Japan's strength. They tried every means to incite China and Japan to fight and kill each other.

Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, they attempted to subdue Japan without resorting to force. On the one hand, they adopted economic blockade measures to exert pressure. On the other hand, they strengthened the fortresses of Chao Nan and Hong Kong under the name of the so-called ABCD encirclement, strengthened the U.S. air force stationed in the Philippines, and dispatched the Prince of Wales to challenge Japan. Their actions not only endangered Japan's survival, but also sought to forever consign Asia to the status of a colony. Therefore, Japan was forced to rise up resolutely for the sake of self-defense and to expel the invaders from Asia, resulting in the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

Once the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese army annihilated the enemy at Pearl Harbor, then landed in Malaya, sank the so-called unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales, captured Manila, occupied Java, and attacked Burma, driving straight into the Southwest Pacific. In just half a year, it had driven the invaders out of East Asia. Most recently, on the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, there was the great victory on Bougainville Island.

In the two years since the Greater East Asia War, the peoples of East Asia have become increasingly united. The cooperation between Japan and Thailand and Japan and Manchuria has become closer. China and Japan have also concluded an alliance treaty. Burma and the Philippines have declared independence. The people of East India have also gained the right to participate in politics. The Provisional Government of Free India has also been established. On November 5th, there was even the Greater East Asia Conference, which formulated the five principles of the Greater East Asia Construction Program, namely, coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promotion of culture, economic prosperity, and contribution to world progress. This is the common highest ideal of the various nations of Greater East Asia, and it further proves that the various nations of Greater East Asia have now become one, united as one, and are fighting for the rise and fall of the entire Greater East Asia. In the future, we should work harder to strive for the final victory.

What we Chinese compatriots must recognize at present is that the realization of the five major principles (i.e., the construction of Greater East Asia) is inextricably linked to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. That is, how to win the war is the first condition, and all goals must be focused on this. We should also recognize that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are in fact one and two, and two and one. The rise and fall of East Asia is in this one battle, and the rise and fall of China is also in this one battle.

I recently went to Japan and saw with my own eyes that the entire country of Japan is trending towards militarization, devoting all its efforts to fully militarizing human elements and material resources. Whether old or young, male or female, they all hold a firm belief in "absolute victory in the war of force." Although the enemy's counterattack is becoming more and more fierce, their strength can reap greater battle results when the scale of the enemy's counterattack is greater.

Other Greater East Asian countries, such as Burma, are currently fulfilling their sacred responsibilities on the western front of the Greater East Asia War. Burma is like a sentry standing in front of the gate of Greater East Asia. The nationalities in various places in the South Seas, for example, are fighting bravely against the allied British troops on the front lines of the South Pacific, crushing the enemy's counterattacks. And countries such as Manchuria, Thailand, and the Philippines are all determined to complete the war, mobilizing all their manpower, sacrificing themselves for the public good, and developing abundant resources to contribute to the just war of liberating the various nations of Greater East Asia.

Looking back at our China, what contributions have we made to the Greater East Asia War in the past two years, especially since we joined the war nearly a year ago? To what extent have we cooperated with our allied Japan? We cannot deny that we are very ashamed. We have not fulfilled our due responsibilities in the past two years, and we have not yet implemented a wartime system or lived a wartime life in the nearly one year since we joined the war.

Today, I would like to offer our current wartime issues to the government authorities and compatriots for joint study.

First of all, we must reform politics and increase production to relieve the people's suffering and cooperate in the war.

We must make the political facilities and economic construction of the peaceful areas surpass the Chongqing regime to win the hearts of the people across the country. At the same time, we must eliminate the Communist Party's conspiracy.

We should establish a civil opinion organ as soon as possible so that the people can participate in politics, so that the government and the people can become one.

Shanghai should be used as a political model area and a model area for Sino-Japanese political and economic cooperation to set an example for reforming the politics of the entire country.

Make the people understand that the rise and fall of East Asia and the rise and fall of China are one and two, and two and one, and recognize their responsibilities.

, and then spontaneously cooperate in the Greater East Asia War and strive for the final victory alongside the various nations of Greater East Asia.

### Large-Scale Battles Unfold in the Central and Southern Sections of the Eastern Front, Soviet Troops West of Smolensk Suffer Heavy Losses

Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th

The German Supreme Headquarters recently issued the following report on the Eastern Front: In the southern region of the Soviet Union, large-scale battles are unfolding southwest of Krimandol and near Zyrkasse. The Soviet troops have suffered losses everywhere except for some local gains, and have been repelled by German forces. Furthermore, the Soviet troops had once broken through the German defense line in one location, and fierce battles are still continuing. Soviet troops broke into German positions in the area between the Prebet River and the Belerkina River, but were immediately counterattacked and repulsed by German forces. German troops are currently engaged in fierce battles with Soviet units guarded by tanks west of Krychev. German and Soviet troops are currently engaged in a large-scale defensive war in the area west of Smolensk. Soviet troops repeatedly attacked German positions in heavy snow, but were heavily damaged and repulsed by German forces. Furthermore, a Soviet detachment that had broken into the German positions north of the highway has now been annihilated by German forces. German troops attacked Soviet positions west of Nevel, expanding a portion of the area. However, strong Soviet units counterattacked German positions, and the German troops repulsed them. In this battle, 24 Soviet tanks were destroyed, and another four were rendered unusable.

Situation on the Italian Front

Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th A military correspondent for the Overseas Communications Association, Sytoris, claims that the British Eighth Army's attack on German positions initially achieved some local gains, but its overall breakthrough attempt has failed. The American Fifth Army has now rushed to assist in the battle. The war is now taking place along a 250-kilometer battle line between the Tyrrhenian Sea and the Adriatic coast. The objective of the American offensive seems to be the coastal area of Gaeta Bay. General Clark also wants to advance his artillery positions in order to destroy the strong positions on the German right flank. The American troops first bombarded the area with intensive artillery fire, followed by a charge under the cover of the air force. However, they were repulsed by German machine gun fire. Clark now seems to want to seize Monte Camino at all costs. A bloody battle took place there two weeks ago when the British vanguard attacked. The entire British vanguard was annihilated, and the position is still in German hands. American recruits now also want to seize this German mountain position, but were met with a head-on blow from German forces and suffered heavy losses. Clark seems willing to continue regardless of sacrifices in order to avoid repeating the failure of Monte Maggiore in achieving a decisive victory. However, the German troops currently hold important high ground positions that can be controlled.

### North China Communist Suppression Headquarters Ready for Reform

Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th After the North China Political Affairs Commission reformed its structure, the personnel of its relevant agencies have been reformed one after another in order to comply with the central government's intentions and smoothly promote administrative efficiency. The North China Communist Suppression Committee Headquarters is the central promotion agency for North China's construction work. This time, it has also reorganized its organization in accordance with the principle of concentrating manpower. The newly appointed Standing Committee member, Mr. Rong Zhen, took office yesterday morning and convened all staff members to explain the significance of reforming the organization, urging them to work diligently for the public good, in order to live up to the central government's expectations.

### New Sections of North China Automobile Highway Open to Traffic

Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th The North China Automobile Highway Line, which has been diligently developed by the North China Transportation Company over the years, has now reached more than 170 kilometers, making great contributions to the increased production of materials in various places and the security of governance. Recently, six new lines have been built, totaling about 100 to 200 kilometers, and they were all opened to traffic on the 5th of this month. The newly completed routes include (1) the Cangbao Line (between Suqinghe) under the jurisdiction of the Beijing Railway Bureau, about 86 kilometers, (2) the Gaoyang Line (between Gaoyanghe) 41 kilometers, (3) the Xiongxian Line (between Zhaobeikou Zhengzhou Town) 8 kilometers, (4) Yangwu County (between Yangwu Yuanwu) under the jurisdiction of the Kaifeng Railway Bureau, 21 kilometers, (5) the Ji Line (between Luoyiyuan Sucun) 50 kilometers, (6) the Xinyi Line (between Xin'anzhen Matouzhen) 45 kilometers. After the opening of the above routes, the increased production in the Jizhong and northern Henan areas can be expected, especially after the opening of the Cangbao Line between Suqinghe, which is related to the horizontal connection between the Jinpu and Jinghan railway lines. In the future, the transportation of miscellaneous grains and rations and materials produced annually in various places will be more smooth.

### Sixth Naval Air Battle South of Bougainville Island, Ten Enemy Ships Sunk and Destroyed

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:00 p.m. on the 5th: On the evening of the 3rd, Japanese naval air units attacked the enemy's mobile unit on the sea south of Bougainville Island, and the battle results were as follows: Three enemy aircraft carriers were sunk (two of which were sunk by bombing), one battleship or large cruiser, three large cruisers, one battleship destroyed (heavily damaged and burned), one large cruiser (probably sunk), one destroyer (probably sunk). The Japanese side's losses totaled ten aircraft that did not return. (Note) This air battle is called the Sixth Naval Air Battle of Bougainville Island.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced on the 5th that the great battle on Bougainville Island was due to the fact that Japanese naval aircraft had been patrolling the sea near Bougainville Island on the 3rd. In the waters west of Moro Island, an enemy fleet was discovered heading north in an incomplete circular formation. The naval reconnaissance aircraft immediately telegraphed the defense. When Japanese naval bombers and torpedo planes were dispatched after receiving the report and flew to the enemy fleet, the sea was already shrouded in twilight. The enemy ships discovered the Japanese aircraft bombing and opened fire into the air. At this time, Japanese naval aircraft successively aimed at the enemy ships. A certain aircraft approached the enemy ship over the sea and launched a torpedo, while the remaining Japanese aircraft bombed the enemy ship fiercely. In a short while, the sea was surrounded by fierce fire, and the situation was extremely tragic. Two enemy aircraft carriers sank immediately after being attacked by Japanese aircraft. In addition, one aircraft carrier and one battleship (or large cruiser) and one large cruiser were also sunk one after another. Another battleship caught fire and burned, the flames soaring into the sky, and it also capsized on the sea. The hulls of one large cruiser and one destroyer were all tilted.

### Examination Papers for Physician Qualification Reviewed, Unsealed Yesterday

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th The former Ministry of Interior's Health Department organized a Physician Qualification Review Committee in April of this year to review the qualifications of physicians nationwide. However, after this review, the Health Department was ordered to be abolished. Subsequently, after the establishment of the Health Administration, it hired health and medical experts from Beijing and Shanghai to reorganize the Physician Qualification Review Committee to actively continue to handle the review matters. It is learned that the committee resolved at a meeting a few days ago to unseal the aforementioned examination papers at the administration at 10:00 a.m. yesterday (5th). The Executive Yuan also sent Councilor Deng Zanhua and the Ministry of Interior sent Councilor Guo Zengchen to jointly unseal the papers. All the examination papers are being carefully evaluated by the review committee members, and the results will be announced in a few days. Those who pass will be notified to come to Beijing for a re-examination.

### British Aircraft Attack Germany

### Commander of U.S. Mobile Unit, General Narikes, Killed in Action —Captain of Welte Shared His Fate—

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 5th The death of U.S. Mobile Unit Commander Major General Narikes has already been announced. According to a Washington dispatch, he died on the 24th when the aircraft carrier "Liscombe Bay" was sunk by a new submarine in the sea off the Gilbert Islands, along with Captain Welte. According to a Navy Department announcement, the U.S. aircraft carrier "Liscombe Bay" was sunk by the Japanese army in the Gilbert Sea at dawn on the 24th (U.S. time, i.e., Japanese time on the 25th). According to foreign dispatches, the aircraft carrier was also sunk by a Japanese submarine. In the first announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on November 29, it was said that a Japanese submarine attacked an enemy aircraft carrier in the sea west of Makin Island at dawn on the 25th and inflicted heavy damage on it. This is actually the same as what the U.S. authorities announced. Although the enemy aircraft carrier was sunk, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters, for the sake of caution, only said that it was heavily damaged. The enemy U.S. side has now admitted that the aircraft carrier was sunk by the Japanese army, which proves the accuracy of the announcement by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters.

### Head of the North China Public Security Administration Replaced

Central News Agency, Beiping, 5th The North China Political Affairs Commission Information Bureau announced that there have been changes in the heads of the Public Security and Agricultural Affairs Administrations and other personnel.

### Turkish President Goes to Cairo to Meet Roosevelt, Papen Says German-Turkish Cooperation is Going Smoothly

Central News Agency, Ankara, 5th German News Agency: It is reported in Ankara political and diplomatic circles that Turkish President Ismet has gone to Cairo to meet with President Roosevelt, but no official statement has been issued. To protect the Turkish president, all domestic and foreign news communications were completely suspended on Friday morning and only resumed at noon on Saturday. When British Foreign Secretary Eden returned from the Moscow Conference in early November, the Turkish Foreign Minister also went to Cairo to meet with him. Turkish political circles believe that the meeting between the Turkish President and the U.S. President will not affect Turkey's foreign policy.

Central News Agency, Istanbul, 5th Haitong News Agency: Istanbul newspapers report that there has been a slight earthquake in Anatolian, with wind and clouds. The telephone lines between Istanbul, Ankara and Izmir have been interrupted. Rumors say that the interruption of domestic telephones in Turkey is due to administrative measures caused by President Ismet's meeting with Roosevelt and Churchill.

Central News Agency, Istanbul, 5th Haitong News Agency: After arriving here, German Ambassador to Turkey Papen said: The enemy's rumors about his trip have been denied by the German Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The German people's will to work for the future, and the cooperation between Germany and Turkey to prevent the war from spreading to the Balkans, are proceeding very smoothly.

### Regarding the Protest Against Sweden, German Foreign Minister Declares Hope That It Will Not Interfere in German-Norwegian Affairs

Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th Haitong News Agency: It is officially announced here that German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, regarding the arrest of Oslo University students for engaging in conspiracy activities, and the Swedish Foreign Minister's protest to the German envoy to Sweden, specifically received the Danish Chargé d'affaires to Germany, Buschde, and informed him that the German government hopes that the Danish government will not interfere in German-Norwegian affairs in the future. At the same time, representing the German government, he expressed deep surprise at the Swedish government's diplomatic protest against the measures taken by German troops stationed in Norway to ensure local security. Moreover, the British, American and Soviet countries constantly take actions that harm the interests of the Scandinavian Group, such as the British attack on Norway and the Soviet deportation of large numbers of men, women and children from Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania and other countries, but Sweden has never expressed a protest. Now, it is even more surprising to negotiate with Germany this time. Furthermore, Sweden and Finland were originally neighboring countries, but Sweden did not express the slightest sympathy for Finland's heroic resistance, which is also somewhat inhumane. Now, the war has long been approaching Sweden's borders. Its national security is fortunately relying on the German army to protect it, but the Swedish government is now taking such an attitude. It is really puzzling.

### Bulgarian Foreign Minister Explains Diplomatic Policy

Central News Agency, Copenhagen, 5th According to a Sofia dispatch, Bulgarian Foreign Minister Kirov explained the diplomatic policy at a parliamentary session on the 3rd as follows: The anti-Axis air force does not want the Bulgarian people's right to exist. The recent two indiscriminate bombings of Sofia were extremely illegal. Bulgaria has been treated unfairly since the war. Bulgaria has made various efforts to protect its right to exist. The Bulgarian people are deeply grateful for the past German assistance. Bulgaria has already recognized the new government led by Commander Mussolini and continues to maintain external cultural relations. The Bulgarian people deeply admire the recent great victories of the Japanese navy in the Pacific. In the future, in addition to cooperating with Hungary, Romania, Croatia, Slovakia and other neighboring countries, it is also willing to cooperate with Turkey and other neutral countries.

### After the Price of Gauze is Determined, Rationing Can Be Implemented, The Business Administration Committee Announces That Free Trading Will Not Be Restored

Central News Agency According to a report in the newspaper on the 2nd of this month, the city's Economic Bureau responded to a question about the private sale of cotton cloth at the fourth regular meeting of the City Propaganda Office, saying: "The various stores that are openly selling cotton cloth now have not been approved by the competent authorities and should be ordered to be banned by the police bureau. However, the free trading of cotton cloth in the city will be restored in the shortest period of time." A reporter asked the Business Administration Committee yesterday to inquire whether this was true. According to the person in charge of the committee, it is not true that the free trading of cotton cloth will be restored. The committee has sent personnel to consult with the city's Economic Bureau, and the bureau said at the fourth meeting: "Cotton yarn and cotton cloth will be rationed," and so on. The above news is obviously a mistake in the record. The bureau has been asked to send a letter to correct it. As for the rationing of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it can be implemented after the rationing price is determined.

If any merchants in various districts collect under the pretext of collection, they can directly report to the city's Finance Bureau or the collection office in each district, and they will be severely punished. However, it has been found that in the Nanshi District, a small number of stores have recently been charging customers separately for this retail donation. Yesterday, a reporter specifically inquired about this matter from Mr. Jiang Bingquan, the director of the collection office in the district. He said that the district's retail donation has not yet been ordered to be collected. If there is unauthorized collection of donations, it is illegal. The office has now sent personnel to strictly investigate illegal merchants.

An explicit order for their eradication was issued. Subsequently, as the area was incorporated into the First District, all such establishments were ordered to close down. However, the numerous opium dens lining Xinmin Road and Taian Lane were not immediately addressed. It is now learned that the relevant police authorities, in order to thoroughly implement the law, have dispatched detectives to inform and instruct them to cease operations. It is reported that over ten establishments, including Zhiqiang Smoking Lounge, are preparing to close down upon receiving orders.

The banquet was filled with mutual toasts and lively conversation, lasting until after 9 PM, when everyone parted happily.

### News United Association Celebrates the Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Scheduled to Hold Film Lectures for Three Days

Since Japan declared war on Britain and the United States on December 8th two years ago, time has flown by.

This great achievement cannot be ignored by the East Asian peoples. To commemorate this historic festival, the Shanghai News United Association has specifically scheduled lectures on the 9th, 10th, and 11th of this month to elucidate the significance of commemorating the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and will also screen films to add to the entertainment.

### Household Coal Briquettes - Issuance of Purchase Certificates

According to Shanghai News reporters, the authorities in charge of purchasing household coal briquettes have now distributed "purchase certificates" along with rice flour purchase certificates to each household. The format is the same as the rice flour purchase certificate. At that time, residents can hold this "coal briquette purchase certificate" to purchase the stipulated amount of coal briquettes from the designated retailers. It is possible to start implementing the allocation of coal briquettes per capita from January. The relevant authorities are actively preparing to implement it as soon as possible, but at the latest, it will be seen in facts in the lunar New Year.

### Soccer Upsets - Portuguese Merchants Beat One Police, Overseas Chinese United Lose to Jews

Yesterday's two甲組 soccer league games both resulted in upsets, which can be said to be a coincidence. In the game between Portuguese Merchants and One Police, which took place at Yiyuan Wensui at 10:30 AM, the Portuguese team defeated One Police 2-0. In the other game, which was held at Jiaozhou Park at 3:30 PM, Overseas Chinese United surprisingly lost to the Jews 1-3 despite having an absolute advantage. The收 of One Police indirectly benefits the Eastern China team. From now on, the only undefeated team in甲組 is the Eastern China team.

Portuguese Merchants Defeat One Police: In the game between Portuguese Merchants and One Police, veteran players such as Gaien and Su Ruo were not present yesterday. However, with the assistance of Remidi, who had just arrived in Shanghai from Tianjin, their strength was greatly increased. One Police was suppressed by Aulierweila, which resulted in a one-sided match. Bao Xituo scored a header, taking the lead in the first half. The Portuguese team maintained the lead with this one goal. In the second half, Bola Da scored another goal, and the Portuguese Merchants defeated One Police with a score of 2-0.

Overseas Chinese United Lost to Jews: The match was held at Liaozhou Public Park. Overseas Chinese United had previously defeated Portuguese Merchants, and everyone expected that the Jews would not be their opponents. However, the players played poorly and performed abnormally. The Jews were unusually brave. Wenduo scored the first goal, and Overseas Chinese United fell behind by one goal in the first half. In the second half, the Jewish Wenduo scored twice again, creating a score of 3-0. At this time, the Jewish player Shouya was injured and left the field. Shaman Bawa was anxious and touched the ball with his hand, which resulted in a penalty kick. Overseas Chinese United's Weiketai took the penalty kick and scored a goal. In the end, Overseas Chinese United lost 1-3.

### To the American People

— Nomura Kichisaburo

So, was it impossible to negotiate between Japan and the United States from the beginning? — Before answering this question, it is necessary to briefly describe the position of the United States, even the views of President Roosevelt and those around him. A recent document published by the US State Department contains the following statement: "Looking back over the past ten years, most of the opinion in this country did not think that the European war had a great impact on the security of the United States." The past ten years refers to the ten years before the start of the war. During the ten years before the war, American public opinion! Regarding the European war threatening the security of the United States, to the point that the Axis powers might soon attack the United States, they have always taken an indifferent attitude. "Regarding this point, the President and the Secretary of State were truly far-sighted. They believed early on that the policies of the Axis powers would inevitably lead to an attack on the United States."

All of this sounds as if Roosevelt and Hull had known ten years ago that Japan would attack Pearl Harbor. On the one hand, they say that the attack on Pearl Harbor was driven by a desire to deceive the people and incite national sentiment; but on the other hand, they publish such statements, revealing their hypocrisy. They boast of their foresight, perhaps to say to the people: "Didn't Japan and Germany turn out exactly as we expected?" But we should not listen to such short-sightedness, such quibbling. I also do not believe that the American people will continue to listen to such nonsensical arguments that turn things upside down.

The Tradition of Imperialists

In reality, did Japan ever want to cross the Pacific Ocean and attack the American continent? Did Germany ever want to cross the Atlantic Ocean and threaten the American continent? What Japan wanted was a new order in Greater East Asia. What Germany wanted was a new order in Europe. No matter how many times you look back at the pre-war policies of Japan and Germany, there was no intention to go beyond this scope. If you are talking about what happened after the war started, then who is it that has crossed the Pacific Ocean and flown over the Atlantic Ocean, and is now intervening in Asia and Europe? Isn't it the United States itself?

The basis of American aid to Britain, in reality, stems from the following idea: If German labor were to traverse Europe and threaten the American continent, then the Monroe Doctrine would be in danger, and Pan-Americanism would be on the verge of collapse. This idea has existed since the days when German naval power was second only to that of Britain. At that time, in order to uphold the Monroe Doctrine, the United States strove to build the "second-largest navy in the world." Germany was a dangerous enemy of the Monroe Doctrine. The policy taken by the Roosevelt administration from the beginning was not something that Roosevelt created, but rather the traditional policy of American imperialists. During World War I, the German navy was destroyed, and this idea naturally went into temporary storage. But after Germany rose up again under the leadership of Hitler, the notion that Germany was threatening the American continent was revived. Anyone in America who is old enough knows this. If this argument is extended, then Britain's resistance to Germany is also the defense of the United States of America. Britain's war is also its own war. The fundamental policy of aiding Britain was decided early on during neutrality, leading to the situation today.

The United States transferred this policy toward Europe to Asia without changing it. They treated Japan as Germany, and 电庆 as Britain. Their evaluation of 重庆 was certainly intentional, but it was much higher than the Japanese imagined. Perhaps the US Navy, because the German Navy was negligible, mostly remained in the Pacific. Speaking of the defense of the Pacific, it goes without saying that the most important thing is to defend against Japan, the strongest country in the Pacific. Regarding the China issue, their opinions were fundamentally different from Japan's. In order to promote the Open Door Policy that they advocate, they must have a strong navy in the Pacific to suppress Japan. Starting from this point, aiding Chiang Kai-shek was naturally carried out in the same spirit as aiding Britain. While arguing that it was for self-defense, Japan and China were fighting each other and shedding blood. Britain used a strategy of pitting the enemy against themselves, so that France would fight against France, allowing itself to act freely in Europe and control the colonies, but the United States was even more cunning, using Britain and Chongqing, and even pulling in the Soviet Union, to cause them to shed blood on the continent, and then creating problems in Central and South America and Canada to bring them to heel. The opportunity to invade the golden world had arrived, and the United States wanted to openly take advantage of the fire. (Xiang: Review of the Yomiuri Hochi from November 19 to 21)

### Oil and Grain Special Committee Actively Collects Raw Materials, Oil Mills in Various Regions Have Now Resumed Operations

Since the Shanghai edible oil collection and transportation matters are fully handled by the Oil and Grain Professional Committee, the committee is making unremitting efforts to carry out the collection and transportation work. According to the established oil and grain collection plan, in addition to ordering a large amount of edible oil from North China to be transported to Shanghai, it is also actively buying raw materials for oil extraction. It is learned that the committee has collected a large number of raw materials from various production areas in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces. Therefore, there is no need to worry about the shortage of edible oil supply in Shanghai in the future. The scope of raw materials for oil extraction is very wide, including three categories: (1) beans, including soybeans, beans, etc.; (2) miscellaneous grains, including sorghum, peanuts, gun seeds, rapeseed, etc.; and (3) various bones. The funds for collecting raw materials are provided by Chinese and Japanese banks in equal shares. If it is still insufficient, the Central Reserve Bank will supplement it. It is also learned that the raw materials collected by the committee are partly allocated to oil mills locally, and partly transported to Shanghai and allocated to Chinese and Japanese oil mills. After the factories in Shanghai were allocated raw materials, they have been very busy with oil extraction work in recent days. The oil mills in various regions have been forced to suspend operations due to a shortage of raw materials, but now they have all resumed operations. The committee's purchasing areas in the three provinces include Nanjing, Wuhu, Hangzhou, Wuxi, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Jiaxing, Nantong, and other places, and more than a dozen branch offices have been established in various important cities and counties, and the committee has sent staff to preside over them, so that the purchasing work can be carried out smoothly.

### Diary of Naval Battles off Bougainville

Beginning with the Bougainville Island operation, the air and naval forces of both sides concentrated in the South Pacific region and engaged in an unprecedented large-scale battle. Since the enemy landed on Mono Island on the 27th, there have been three successive engagements: the naval battle off Bougainville Island, and the first and second air battles off Bougainville Island. These created a record of annihilation unparalleled in the history of warfare. After these battles, the enemy seemed to be very afraid of the might of the Japanese air and naval forces. The following is a daily record of the period from November 5th onwards, up to the second air battle off Bougainville:

5th: From around 9:00 AM, Rabaul was subjected to two air raids, similar to the 4th. The enemy aircraft numbered about 150. Following the air raids, a reconnaissance operation on the same day discovered two enemy aircraft carriers with escorts in the sea south of Bougainville Island. Each was arranged in two groups, forming a circular formation and maintaining a high state of alert while navigating. Torpedo bomber squadrons, upon receiving attack orders, immediately departed. A successful surprise attack at dusk resulted in the torpedoing and sinking of two enemy aircraft carriers, two large cruisers, and two cruisers or destroyers. This marked the first naval battle off Bougainville Island, in which the enemy fleet was destroyed.

The enemy seemed to believe that the Japanese forces were determined to completely destroy the forces landing on Bougainville Island, and had concentrated a strong air and naval force in the area of 〇〇. The appearance of the enemy aircraft carrier group near the front line north of Guadalcanal Island in the central Solomon Islands is sufficient to 足 demonstrate the enemy's level of preparedness and the large scale of their naval forces. After the failure of the first naval battle off Bougainville Island, the enemy panicked greatly, and attempted to reinforce the Bougainville Island garrison by dispatching a fleet of warships and transport ships. The reconnaissance planes, although struggling with the weather, finally encountered a portion of the enemy warships north of Mono Island on the 7th. On the morning of the 8th, they discovered a portion of the enemy convoy off Cape Torokina, and in the afternoon, they learned of the whereabouts of the enemy's large convoy south of Torokina, including a main force of three battleships leading cruisers, destroyers, and other vessels, heading towards Cape Torokina. Subsequently, a large follow-up force centered on battleships was also discovered. Upon receiving the reports, a large formation of Japanese fighter-bombers conducted a daylight raid, departing to attack the enemy convoy, thus beginning the second air battle off Bougainville Island. Japanese fighter squadrons engaged about sixty to seventy enemy aircraft in the skies above the anchorage, shooting down fifteen. At the same time, Japanese dive bomber squadrons sank three destroyers and four transport ships, and set two cruisers and one transport ship on fire. This constituted a great victory achieved through a difficult daylight raid.

Following this attack, the enemy convoy fled in disarray, and the follow-up convoy and battleship force, which were advancing northward, turned back midway, using the rain showers at the time to cover their retreat. However, the Japanese torpedo bomber squadrons relentlessly pursued them, finally catching up at dusk and launching a fierce attack. The detailed account of this battle has already been reported, so it will be omitted here. In short, the devastating power of the proud Japanese naval air force's 　 torpedo attacks was fully demonstrated in this battle, sinking four battleships in one fell swoop early that morning.

On the battlefield where the great air battle had unfolded, the remains of sunken large ships such as battleships, cruisers, and destroyers were still fresh, and the sea surface was covered with black heavy oil, indicating the fierce battle of the previous night and the Japanese victory. Not a single ship could be seen nearby. Further south, in the sea south of Vella Lavella Island, remnants of the convoy could be seen, with cruisers, destroyers, and other vessels fleeing towards 食島.

The Enemy's Intentions

Having suffered heavy losses in the first and second naval battles off Bougainville, the enemy still seemed determined to deploy aircraft carriers and battleships in an attempt to secure air and sea supremacy and to bolster the supply to Bougainville Island. The enemy is throwing the full might of its air force into the decisive battle in the South Pacific. The Japanese forces, of course, cannot afford to be complacent merely because of the victories in the naval battle and two air battles off Bougainville. They must realize that the enemy will continue to send successive fleets and mobile forces. From the overall strategic perspective, it is natural to expect the enemy to exert all their strength in the battle for Bougainville Island. To counter this, Japan must continue to send strong air forces to the front lines, so that each sortie results in the destruction of enemy forces. The battle for Bougainville Island is truly a matter of "a long time to come," and the decisive battles in the South Pacific will become even more intense in the future.

### Breaking Through the Dark Natural Barrier: A True Account of the Bloody Battles in the South Pacific

Approaching the Enemy

The unit approached the front line without a single gunshot being fired. The only sound echoing through the mountains was that of aircraft being serviced. As soon as they came out of the ridgeline, the enemy began firing with automatic rifles. The distance from the enemy was only five meters. "Tat-tat-tat," the flowing muzzles roared before their eyes. This was the most effective automatic rifle fire in the dense jungle. In the darkness, the pale faces of the Australian soldiers lined up like white melons in Tanaka's fields. "Kill!" With a shout, they jumped forward, hand grenades flew, and automatic rifles roared. "Damn it!" The soldiers frantically stabbed with their bayonets. A hand grenade was thrown at the base of a large tree, and the enemy soldier's limbs flew into the air. This hand-to-hand combat was truly satisfying! And the results were considerable. Before dawn, this plateau was ours. The planes had already fled overnight. The bright red morning sun rose in the sky.

"One, a soldier should value valor..."

The majestic voices of the soldiers reciting the Military Code echoed through the mountains, as if pursuing the defeated enemy.

The battlefield was as cool as autumn. The gentle morning breeze brushed against the battle-stained uniforms, refreshing the soul. Many enemy corpses, stabbed last night, were left on the battlefield. Presumably, they had desperately carried back as many as they could during their retreat.

"From this, it seems that the enemy's unity is also quite strong!" Lieutenant Nakamura said, inspecting the remains of the fierce battle.

The few remaining enemy corpses were all young. They wore short-sleeved shirts, shorts, long socks, and wide-brimmed hats, fastened under their chins with thin straps. Under the roots of the large tree where the hand grenades had been thrown last night, there was a trench about a foot deep. Two boxes of twenty-round hand grenades were scattered, broken and discarded. The areas near the tree roots were devastated by the hand grenade explosions.

"We threw them haphazardly in the dark, I didn't expect it to turn out like this!" The soldiers themselves couldn't help but exclaim in surprise.

"Sergeant, what about the 'Camel' cans?"

"Good stuff! Bring them here."

A private brought two or three cans of "Camel" meat.

"They're lighter than canned corned beef!"

"This kid, isn't this cigarettes? Don't you know?"

The private didn't smoke. As soon as he saw the 　 head, he thought they were all 愈.

As for Camel cigarettes, these were gifts received since 〇〇. The sergeant sent them unopened to a certain captain.

"'Camel' cans."

"Think of a witty remark!" The captain laughed. He distributed one cigarette to each of his men. Among the scattered enemy belongings were shirts, shorts, half-filled meat cans, corned beef, dry bread, 火願, cheese, razors, 云花 ointment, 子, cosmetics, and many photographs of women in each 昔.

That night, the enemy launched four counterattacks, attempting to retake the position, but they were all defeated by our fierce fire. The few survivors had no choice but to retreat towards Isurava.

Ascending the Kokoda high ground, a kilometer-wide grassland stretched out, with dense jungle extending in the distance. Looking south, the Owen Stanley Range stood coldly in the clouds. Peaks such as Mount Bellamy, Mount Bubi, Mount Nisbet, and Mount Alexander, ranging from 3,800 to 4,000 meters high, lined up like a folding screen. The black cliffs, with ancient trees that even beasts could not inhabit, the deep valleys filled with thick layers of fallen leaves and withered branches, reeked with a nauseating odor, like encountering 　 gas. "It looks a bit like the Japanese Alps covered in jungle!" the soldiers expressed their impressions. However, this description still fell short. Although New Guinea is said to be the last dark area left in the world, the Japanese army is now质地的 opening its doors. In the dense jungle where even the scorching sun could not dry the ground, the Japanese army opened roads, advancing by clearing mountains and valleys. The long lines of troops, carrying cannons, bullets, and food on their shoulders, snaked through the dense jungle. When climbing steep cliffs, the iron nails on their army boots struck the rocks, emitting dazzling sparks. Step by step, foot by foot, the marching troops drew lines on the dark map. Following these footprints were the groups of 高砂义勇队 who 組 provided supplies with blood and sweat on their backs.

Flanking Battles

〇臼 occupied Mount Bellamy and continued to attack the enemy position at Isurava. The 〇〇 unit, emerging from 　 at 　, immediately joined the flanking battle. In this battle, the enemy initially bombarded fiercely with mortars. The 関 machine gun fire of both sides swirled around like a whirlwind. Whirr, crash, crackle, the dense jungle exploded, and tree branches and soil 　 flew 　 into the air. Fire crows soared high, and Han smoke rose straight up, the dense jungle burned. Although we repeatedly charged and engaged in hand-to-hand combat, the enemy position remained unmoved. This was because if this line were breached, they would have nowhere else to 　 retreat. Before them was a fire pit, behind them a cauldron of boiling oil; there was no way out of hell! The enemy must have been holding onto this mentality. So, as long as they had ammunition left, they continued their stubborn resistance. Dawn broke. The dense jungle that had shielded the positions of both sides had been stripped bare, revealing the broken trunks. Cannon smoke swirled like rising mist. Enemy soldiers appeared and disappeared in the trenches, their white faces twisted with terror. The storm of bullets continued to rake the ground. Day passed. Night turned to day. After fighting to the death day and night, a corner of the enemy's fortified position finally began to collapse. The 〇 team blocked their retreat, and we charged up in one go. From around 白尽 before and after, the enemy soldiers, caught in a pincer movement, were stabbed one after another, emitting their final cries as they fell from the cliffs. The bottomless valley opened its mouth wide and swallowed them. Next, when we stormed into the enemy position at Isurava from the high ground, the enemy soldiers were having lunch. They didn't have time to grab their weapons and fled helter-skelter, covering their heads.

Raising the Flag on the Summit

After a arduous battle of 〇 days, the Japanese flag was finally raised on this vital peak. Precious blood flowed, shimmering with purple light in the morning sun. Countless fragments of maps floated in the ruins of the enemy position.

This happened at night during the advance on 挨奧里比華: The unit was preparing to camp for the night in the mountains. From the forest opposite, two tall figures approached. A certain captain suspected that they were enemy soldiers and planned to capture them alive if they were indeed stragglers. They gradually approached.

"Hello?" he asked.

"Hello," the other side replied.

"Where did the 68th Battalion go?" they asked.

"To heaven."

"Heaven?"

"Yeah!" The teaching soldier clearly saw the captain's face, was greatly shocked, and hurriedly raised his automatic rifle, but the captain's treasured sword had already struck. "Bury the two 　." The corpses were buried. At daybreak, a small branch was stuck in the mound, with a piece of paper on it that read: "Grave of enemy 　 soldiers."

At the time of the occupation of 挨奧里比華, because the supply line was long and transportation was difficult, the rice they carried was almost exhausted. The captain and everyone else chewed on grass roots and ate the buds of 樂 　 trees every day, and fought against hunger and lack of struggle.

In the battles up to this point, although strategic bases were established in the rear, the soldiers were sincerely grateful for the desperate efforts of the 高砂义勇队 during the many battles across this great mountain range. Although they starved as much as the soldiers, they tried their best to save their own food, transporting rice, one grain at a time, to the front lines. The 高砂义勇队 members, grateful for the glory of being Japanese subjects, dedicated themselves to the supply battle. After transporting ammunition and provisions to the front lines, they cooked rice in the midst of gunfire and served food to the wounded soldiers. They also fetched water from a valley two and a half 里 (about ten 余 里) away and filled the soldiers' water bottles. On the return trip, they also transported the wounded soldiers back to the rear. Their hardship was no less than that of the soldiers fighting on the front lines. The 高砂义勇队, who are currently engaged in supplying and caring for the troops on the New Guinea front and at the South Pacific bases, shedding blood and sweat day and night, deserve our utmost gratitude.

### A Tragedy of Life (One-Act Play)

— Chen Ming

Setting: Adapted from Yu Ruowen's short story "A Tragedy of Life" in Bai Mao, Issue 20. Location: Shanghai. Time: 1943. Characters: A Ming — A craftsman in his thirties. Wife — A woman of about twenty-seven or twenty-eight, with a slightly haggard face. Child — A baby who was abandoned from its mother's arms after being born for only a month. The Eastern Housewife! Voluble, fierce and evil, only concerned with her own comfort, lacking any human compassion.

The curtain rises on a stage that reflects the time of about 7 p.m. It is just as the sun has set below the horizon, and the twilight is becoming increasingly intense. A Ming, holding his child, is pacing back and forth at the entrance of an alley, as if waiting for something.

A Ming (hereafter referred to as Ming) (The child emits a hoarse cry; he seems anxious and cannot bear it) Child, don't cry, your mother will be here soon to 　give you milk. Don't cry, just stay quiet for a while. (The crying diminishes a little) Be a good boy, and when Papa has money, he'll ask your Mama to stay with you every day and stop helping other people. When you grow up, Papa will buy you a schoolbag and send you to school, and you'll study hard and become a useful person, not like your Papa, who's illiterate and can only be someone else's苦銄 craftsman, and can't even feed his family. (But the child's hoarse cry becomes even more forceful) Ah! Child! (Just then, Little A Ming's mother hurries in)

Wife Child! What's wrong? (She instinctively takes the child from A Ming's arms and holds it close, preparing to breastfeed) The child cries every day. Look, he's become 　 so thin, like a stake. 　What can Mama give him to eat? Ah, 媽糕 is so expensive again; poor child!

Ming The water porridge has been given, but he hasn't wanted to eat much of it these past few days.

Wife (Seeing that the child won't suckle, she doesn't 　go down but feels even more though it seems 　over) Doesn't want to eat much? (Tears are already flowing down) A Ming, I think the child is not well. He should be taken to see a doctor.

Ming The child is a little sick. I already took him to the doctor's a few days ago.

Wife What did the doctor say?

Ming The doctor said that for such a small child, plus insufficient milk and poor nutrition, — that's very troublesome.

Wife Gaa! (She cries loudly and hugs the child tightly)

Ming So, today I wanted to ask you about going back home, because it doesn't make much sense to help others here.

Wife How will we survive if we go back?

Ming It's hard whether we go back or not, and besides, the child's illness requires attention, so let's go back and think of another way! Wife I don't have a way to see what 　for now, I still have to stay here, slowly accumulating some money to buy some milk cake for the child, find a doctor to see a good 　 sickness! The child can't 　 take care of the 　 for some more 　 to help us answer that!

Wife I don't have a way for now, I still have to stay here, slowly 　 accumulating some money to buy some milk cake for the child, vote on some 　 doctors to see a good 　 sickness! The child can't 　 take care of the 　 for some more 　 to help us answer that.

Ming Well, you've been here for more than two weeks. How has the lady of the house treated you? Does she know about you stealing milk for the child? Wife Ah, working for others means suffering losses, and I can only swallow my anger. Especially the mistress here, she's so difficult to deal with. Always calling you to do this and that, never letting you rest. Apart from 　taking care of the child, she wants you to do all kinds of chores: emptying the chamber pot, washing cloths, washing clothes, going to the market to buy groceries, coming home to cook. I'm exhausted every day, and can only catch a breath when I've put the child and the mistress to sleep. If she finds some small mistake, the mistress's face is like a man-eating beast, her eyes glare at you, scolding you and gesticulating. Sometimes, I really can't bear it. (She pauses, in pain) When I see other people's children eating milk in my arms, my heart feels like it's breaking. I think about why my own child can't even get his mother's milk, and is getting thinner and thinner, sicker and sicker. Is it our destiny as poor people to suffer so much?......

Ming Xiaoming's mother, I really feel sorry for you. I've never given you and our child a good life. I'm a husband who can't support his child and wife. When I think about this, I feel like a fire is burning in my heart, like I want to fight something, to let off steam. But when I see you and the child...

Wife What do you think about?

Ming Never mind. I advise you to go back home.

Wife Let's talk about going back in a couple of days. It's getting late now. It's a bit inconvenient if it gets too late, and besides, autumn is 凉 cool in the morning and evening; the child can't 　 stand the 凉 cool. You should take him back early. (She hands the child to A Ming, and touches the money in her pocket) This is a little reward money that I've saved up. Take it and take the child to the doctor first, and then use the remaining money to buy some milk cake 　 for him to eat.

Ming (He wants to say something, but seems unable to, and eventually prepares to leave with the child.)

Wife (Just as A Ming takes a few steps, she runs over to look at her child again. At that moment, the Eastern Housewife rushes out. She sees her and cries out in alarm) Ah!

Eastern Housewife (hereafter referred to as Wife) Good for you, you have such a big courage, came to the outside 　your own children, I can give you free access to go in and out of the 　and it is to look up to you, I want to believe in you, I can not imagine you that kind of cruel heart.

Wife Madam!

Wife Hmph! No wonder my child has been crying these past few days. So you want to starve him to death and use the milk you save to fatten your own child. Fine!

Wife (Hugging her child tightly from her husband's arms, 　 lower her head with infinite sadness, and slowly walks towards the 　 center of 里. A Ming sadly follows closely behind) Child, our child! On stage (Curtain falls)

### Ode to the Night

— Chunxin

Daylight vanishes with the passing of the sun, and night takes its place across the earth. Those busy, wriggling people driven by life mostly quiet down at the arrival of night, letting out the stuffy air accumulated during the day and relieved of the burdens of life, breathing easily under the heavy exhaustion, and spending the night at ease.

Night, what a leisurely and moving rhythm. Although I curse all darkness, I love this still night surrounded by darkness. Here, there is no sight of haste, no sight of people wearing masks and acting. All that can be seen is an endless expanse of darkness, but there are stars and a moon in the sky. People are asleep. The only feeling the night gives me is an indescribable tenderness, a still atmosphere that compels me not to leave it, like an infant nestled in the arms of a loving mother.

During the day, I toil and bustle for life. The time when I can rest at night is the freest and most unfettered moment for me. I silently ponder in this darkness the trivial matters for which I have no time to think. In reality, the darkness's attack is not fearful to me. The stars are smiling at me, and the moonlight is occasionally swaying. This is enough to encourage me to fight hard against the darkness and struggle against the exhaustion. Moreover, there is also the even more lovely tomorrow—with new hope. Only those who have strongly encouraged themselves in the darkness and wrestled it, will urgently need tomorrow's 　 work.

In the still night, asking myself sincerely, during the day, while traveling among companions who are scheming against each other for worldly gain, has it made you lose the courage to advance? Has it added a little darkness to your heart, which was born pure and clear? Will the rough and tragic life make you surrender? People who silently ponder in the darkness—night is ultimately what you love, and light is ultimately what you pursue. After you have weathered your moment of still reflection, throw the things that disturb your heart out of your mind, cast them into the boundless sky, and lie down with a smile to greet tomorrow!

### Stop Hesitating — To Hui Jun —

— Jie Ya

Don't always hide in the darkness;

To obliterate your youth,

Time,

Life.

You should come out and see the sunlight,

Breathe the air—.

Don't be timid;

Timidity will turn you into a mud pit

Even destruction.

Stop hesitating,

Stop being so passive;

Passivity makes you fall, unable to extricate yourself.

×××

Don't be attached to your past,

Don't cherish your dreams...

Don't expect your future——

Unfold your sorrow; strengthen your fiery and pure will,

Hold down the wounds,

Stick out your chest,

Seize reality.

Don't be afraid of the storm's invasion,

Don't be afraid of tigers chasing,

Break out of the perilous situation!

With persistent and hardworking spirit!

Exert yourself!

Advance——Advance!

Don't be reckless and clueless,

Anxious,

Irritable, heady, you should use your calm head

To guide the direction,

The route!

The light.

I love the sea,

When it roars!

It attacks,

It becomes calm.

When rage is confined, it makes me surge with excitement!

The surge washes away all the blemishes around, all the blemishes,

When calm, it makes me more calm and determined.

(End of Poem)

>Sports [P Football Group Situation Confused Donghua Team Exclusively Occupies the Top Spot One Police Team Suffers Miserable Defeat Yesterday Against the Portuguese Dark Horse, Resulting in an Unexpected Victory Over the Overseas Chinese Team

The football league's Group A had important matches the day before yesterday and yesterday. On Saturday, the two major Chinese teams, Donghua and Lianyi, met, and Donghua won 1-0. Yesterday at Yiyuan, the Portuguese team won 1-0, a satisfying result. In the afternoon, the Jewish team surprisingly defeated the Overseas Chinese team 3-1, which can be considered an upset. Although the situation in Group A is chaotic, Donghua is exclusively occupying the top spot and has become the dominant force. The following is a record of the events and an assessment of the strategies employed.

Donghua Wins Over Lianyi

This battle was not only about the future of the championship but also a battle for the new leader of the Chinese teams. Due to the reputation of both teams, from noon until 6 PM on Jiaozhou Road, fans were coming and going. At 1:30 PM, the gate was closed tightly, and even those who had pre-purchased tickets could not enter. The crowd was densely packed, forcing them to break the gate and surge in. As a result, fences and stands collapsed, and there was no room for order inside the stadium. People climbed everywhere, chairs fell over, fences collapsed, and the crowd was in an uproar. The fans' excitement was unprecedented and beyond expectation. The match began at 4 PM. Donghua, taking advantage of its strong offense, immediately launched a total attack, advancing from the right and attacking from the left, creating a powerful momentum. However, Lianyi's defense was solid. Liu Xianhan kept the goal intact. Lianyi also launched counterattacks from time to time, but because the forwards lacked practice, they were not in sync, resulting in a stalemate. Neither side scored in the first half. The situation remained the same after the start of the second half. The atmosphere in the stadium remained tense. However, both sides managed to maintain their previous status.

At 25 minutes into the second half, Zhang Lin'gen got the ball and passed it to Wang Xisheng. You Liang gestured in the crowd, and Xiao Wang passed accurately. You Liang swayed at the top, with the iron hoof in an excellent position. Liu Lang was defeated—this crucial goal sealed the victory! Donghua, the darling of the heavens, did not disappoint the crowd!

Analyzing the game, the players on both sides were too nervous, resulting in a lack of brilliant moments. Lianyi focused on defense, with Song Lingsheng employing a third defensive line; while defense was solid, the attack was inevitably disorganized. Donghua's offensive was frequent, but due to being trapped, there were few excellent plays. Song employed a man-to-man strategy, extremely tight. Zheng Fuzhen deserves the most credit, covering all aspects, and Sun Jinshun's goal should also be considered a major contribution. Li Ning's experience and You Liang's bravery were undeniable facts, and although Bang Lun lacked performance opportunities, he was exceptionally calm. I say, the young man can enter the hall of fame. Looking back at Lianyi, Wu Qi and Song Lingsheng raced to save the situation, and their efforts were not small. However, Tian Sheng seemed to have limited strength, and A Kui frequently missed opportunities. Yi Chen had been away from the field for a long time and made significant oversights. The 1-0 defeat the other day was, in my opinion, just as I expected.

If Donghua can defeat the police team, capture the Portuguese team, and celebrate the victory, it is worth waiting for. Encourage each other!

Portuguese Team Defeats One Police Team

One police team won against the Overseas Chinese team 5-1, and the Overseas Chinese team won against the Portuguese team 5-3. Logically, one would think that the police team would have the upper hand, but the Portuguese team's performance was unexpected. They easily defeated the police team 2-0. In the first half, the veteran, Xiao Ti, broke through and scored. In the second half, the newcomer, Bo Lada, also scored, both goals being clear and beautiful. The Portuguese team's defense was excellent. Mai Di, like a magnet, was difficult to overcome. Roberts Stoff was trapped and unable to use his skills, which led to the result. The Portuguese team's offense and defense were well-organized, and they seemed capable of challenging Donghua. However, the Portuguese team does not always live up to expectations and sometimes performs abnormally. Whether they can deliver a crucial blow depends on their usual performance.

Dark Horse Defeats Overseas Chinese Team

When the Jewish team and the Overseas Chinese team met, everyone thought the Overseas Chinese team would win without hesitation. It is truly unpredictable, and upsets happen in matches. The Jewish team, with its old, weak, and depleted forces, used its remaining strength. Wen Tu scored three goals while sick, and the Overseas Chinese team missed a penalty kick. With a score of 3-1, the Jewish team won for the first time.

The Overseas Chinese team's defeat was due to its incomplete lineup and poor adjustments. The central defense line could not advance or defend effectively. The forwards, Fa Fan and his old partner, Shi Qinglu, were unable to move effectively due to his light movements. How could they score? The Jewish team's advantage was that they became braver as they fought, never losing courage. This is why they can maintain their "dark horse" spirit.

Thoughts After Watching the Match

Currently, the situation in Group A is that each team has a chance, but Donghua exclusively occupies the top spot! We sincerely wish them a smooth journey in the future!

It is also heard that Lianyi will protest because many people entered the venue in the last ten minutes, which was against the rules. How will the authorities handle this? As a reporter, I have to say that victory and defeat are common in military affairs. Moreover, the fans' entry into the venue was not excessively disruptive. If they meet again in the future, they can win back a goal. Encourage them! Encourage them! (Mei Jie)

Renyu Wins Over Huaying (51-45) Huaying's main player, Shu Shi, was absent, and the lineup was incomplete. However, losing by only three points is enough to be proud of. Renyu has many well-known players in the sports world, while Huaying is still a new team. With this result, Qian Junxu Cang's guidance has made a significant contribution!

Dongfang Easily Takes Yiyu (51-34) Both teams belong to the same category. Why must they be so eager to fight each other? The match was polite and normal, just as expected. The older brother easily defeated the younger brother.

Juren Breaks Huaying (48-25) Originally, the match was scheduled for Hualian, but Hualian requested a change of date. As a result, Huaying was forced to play two matches. Although they were tired, their spirit was commendable. However, a tired army facing an ambitious home team will naturally be at a disadvantage and submit to a subordinate position. (Must Win)

### Jianqing Cup Basketball Tournament Concludes Longhua Wins Overall Championship

The Jianqing Cup Youth Basketball Tournament, co-organized by the Chinese Youth Association and the Jianqing Group, started at the beginning of last month and has now concluded. Longhua won the overall championship. The tournament was not only intense but also emphasized sportsmanship and morality. Therefore, there were no absences, forfeits, or unpleasant incidents, which is commendable. Promoting basketball should start in this way, so we are happy to acknowledge it and record the full results: A total of fifteen teams participated, divided into three groups: Jian, Qing, and . The results of each group are as follows:

In the final, Longhua narrowly defeated Bai by 17-16. In another match, Qingyan narrowly defeated by 14-11. In the match against Qing, the time ended with a score of 11-11. In overtime, Longhua fortunately won by three points with a free throw, winning the overall championship.

Attached is the list of Longhua team members: Chen Zhengsen, Lin Junqian, Shu Jia, Wang Ji, Chen Guo, Li Jinggen, Ye Yunshan, Jia, Long, Wang Liyan. The director of the association, Liang Zhaoan, reported that the referees hired for the tournament were all volunteers and arrived on time, providing fair service, which is admirable. He also expressed his gratitude on behalf of the association! (Reporter)

### Xiqing Group A Basketball Second Week Juren Splits Two Barriers Huaying's Spirit is Excellent

Although there were no special confrontations in the second week of the Xiqing Basketball Tournament, each game was intense, indicating that the strength of each team was balanced, and the situation was not too disparate. Interest has therefore increased, and it is no wonder that on the evenings of the Group A matches, there were always many attendees. The battle situation is described as follows:

Amateur Defeats Dahua (34-32) Although the amateur team was slightly affected by Jia Youliang's absence, they were careful and worked hard, eventually defeating the strong enemy by one point. Dahua's biggest problem is that they are too hot-tempered. The reporter mentioned this before, but the team still failed to correct their mistakes, resulting in many missed free throws. Failure was inevitable!

Juren Defeats Shantou Team (44-25) This was expected. However, the Shantou team, with the momentum of defeating Renyu, was quite promising. Their offense relied on long-range shots, which were risky. However, Juren's defense was tight, with deep trenches and high barriers, making it difficult to cross the thunder pool, so they had no choice. Their defense adopted a zone defense tactic. When the enemy's ball was released, they tried to maneuver to avoid being intercepted. They were meticulous, posing a considerable threat to Juren. Unfortunately, their endurance was insufficient, and they collapsed. Most of their points were lost in the last seven minutes. It can be imagined that the players of the An team are young and energetic. If they can encourage themselves and have no distractions, it will not be difficult to go further. They can become a strong team. A message to the Shantou team: encourage each other!

Huayu Defeats Tongren (42-27) Both teams were known for their teamwork. Tongren recently got the help of the famous football player Zhang Banglun, adding beauty to perfection and strengthening their momentum. However, their physiques were relatively short, and they lacked practice due to work commitments, which was inevitably neglected. It was almost impossible for them to defeat the rising Huayu team.

### What I Saw at the Xiqing Basketball Venue

The official withdrawal of Zhongbei from Xiqing has inevitably reduced interest, and Juren has lost a strong opponent. Will our full enthusiasm for Xiqing basketball now be entirely focused on Dongfang? ▽ The audience's boos were very loud in every game, especially in the game between Juren and Shantou team. Although the referees tried their best to explain, they were overwhelmed by the noise. Although some spectators may have misunderstood, the intensity of the boos was due to the referees' slow decisions. The rules published in this magazine can be used as a motto by the fans!

There are many spectators at Huaying's games, as fans and movie fans gather in one room, creating a grand scene!

The famous women's volleyball player, Miss Zhu Shifang, has not been seen on the court for a long time, but she has appeared in Xiqing!

The Yiqin Baolian team seems to have immature skills, but according to the team's coach, Jin Bo, the team will win with spirit. Although they know they may not escape the bottom spot, they will strive to improve. This spirit is worth mentioning. (De)

### Differences Between International and Xiqing Basketball Rules Players and Spectators in the Xiqing League Should Pay Attention

— Liu Hesheng

The All-Shanghai Basketball Tournament organized by the Xiqiao Youth Association this year has 54 participating teams composed of Chinese, Japanese, Soviet, French, Filipino, Russian, and Jewish players. This is the largest basketball league in Shanghai since the "incident." Chinese teams account for more than two-thirds of the participants. Due to environmental constraints, the rules used in previous Xiqing basketball tournaments have often differed from those commonly used by Chinese teams. This year, Xiqing will continue to use the 1941 American rules (which have been adopted by Japanese, North Chinese, and Japanese residents in Shanghai). However, the rules used by Chinese players in Shanghai are the 1936 international rules. Therefore, Chinese players may suffer losses due to unfamiliarity with the rules or have misunderstandings with the referees. At the beginning of the league, the differences between the international and Xiqing rules are outlined below to inform Chinese players and spectators.

(1) Backboard

International: 1.20 meters high, 1.80 meters wide, rectangular or fan-shaped, made of glass, steel, or hardwood (Chapter 2, Article 1)

(2) Center Jump

International: The center player must not tap the ball before it reaches its highest point, must not leave the center circle before the ball is tapped out, and must tap the ball no more than twice. After the ball is tapped out, the center player must not touch the ball again until it has been touched by another player or has touched the ground or the backboard. According to the above, the ball can be tapped a total of four times during the jump ball, meaning each center player can tap it twice. Other players should stand within the court in any location that does not interfere with the movement of the jumping players and the referee (no restriction on the 6.5-foot radius outer circle) (Chapter 6, Article 6)

Xiqing: The first half of the article is the same as the international rules, but the second half states that when jumping for the ball in the center circle or on the free throw line, except for the two jumping players, other players are not allowed to enter the circle with a 6.5-foot radius before the ball is tapped out. Violators will have the ball thrown inbounds by the opposing team from outside the nearest sideline (Chapter 8, Article 6)

(3) Division Line

International: If a player passes the ball from their own backcourt to a teammate standing on the division line, it will be considered a pass over the division line. If that player receives the ball and then passes it to another teammate standing on the division line, the ball will be considered a pass back to the backcourt. That is, the division line can be considered the frontcourt or the backcourt, depending on the position of the pass (Chapter 6, Article 8, Note)

Xiqing: The division line belongs to the backcourt. If a player dribbles the ball from the backcourt to the division line and passes the ball to a teammate standing on the division line, it will not be considered a pass back to the backcourt because both players are in the backcourt (the division line is the backcourt) and have not retreated from the frontcourt. However, in this case, the 10-second time limit will continue to be counted (Chapter 8, Article 8, Note)

(4) Resuming Play After a Goal, Free Throw, or Last Free Throw is Made

International: After a goal or free throw is made, the referee should announce the number of points and the number of the scoring player to the scorekeeper. Then, the referee should hold the ball and hand it over to the player of the losing team. The player should wait for the referee to signal to resume play with the whistle and then resume play by throwing the ball inbounds from any location behind the backcourt end line (Chapter 6, Article 9)

Xiqing: After a goal is made, the player of the losing team stands in any location on the backcourt end line and throws the ball inbounds within five seconds, without the need for the referee's whistle or "ball" (Chapter 8, Article 9)

(5) Time-Out Period in the Final Stage (Intermediate School Rules Briefly)

International: If the total scores of the two teams are equal at the end of the second half, an overtime period should be added. Each overtime period is five minutes. If the score is still tied at the end of the first period, another period should be added. This continues until one team is ahead at the end of a period. There should be a one-minute break at the end of each period. The overtime period is extra time from the start, but the start of each period should be a jump ball in the center circle, and the teams should switch baskets (Chapter 10, Article 3)

Xiqing: If the total scores of the two teams are equal at the end of the second half, an overtime period should be added, and the teams should not switch baskets. Each overtime period is five minutes. If the score is still tied at the end of the first period, another period should be added. This continues until one team is ahead at the end of a period. There should be a two-minute break before each overtime period. The start of each period should be a jump ball in the center circle, and the teams should not switch baskets (Chapter 9, Article 3)

(6) Time-Outs

International: Each team can request a time-out three times during the entire game (only the captain can request). However, in the event of injury or other accidents, staff members can still make extra requests for time-outs. However, each additional request will be considered a technical foul (Chapter 9, Article 2)

Xiqing: Each team can request a time-out five times during the entire game (not limited to the captain). Extra requests for time-outs beyond the allowed number of times will be considered a technical foul (Chapter 11, Article 4)

(7) Three-Second Rule

International: There is no three-second rule during the game.

Xiqing: The player with the ball cannot wait for more than three seconds in any part of the free throw area under the basket. In the area between the free throw line and the middle of the end line, even if a teammate does not have the ball, they cannot wait for more than three seconds while the ball is under the control of a teammate (Chapter 14, Article 12)

(8) Fouls and Penalties During Free Throws

International: If the ball touches the basket or backboard before the ball touches the free throw line or is delayed for more than ten seconds during a free throw (Chapter 12, Article 2)

Ruling: The free throw is invalid. If it is a free throw with one attempt, the ball should be jumped in the center circle regardless of whether it is made or not. If the violation occurs during the last free throw of multiple attempts, the ball should also be jumped in the center circle regardless of whether it is made or not.

Xiqing: If the ball touches the basket or backboard before the ball touches the free throw line or is delayed for more than ten seconds during a free throw (Chapter 14, Article 2)

Penalty: The free throw is invalid. Regardless of whether it is made or not, a player from the opposing team will throw the ball inbounds from behind the end line. This kind of throw-in should only be used in the last free throw. If it is a free throw for a technical foul, the ball should be thrown inbounds from the center line.

(9) Technical Fouls by Substitute Players

International: A substitute player exchanges words with other players before the game continues (except for words passed by the referee).

Penalty: One free throw is awarded, and a technical foul is recorded against the team captain.

Xiqing: Players can exchange words at any time without restriction.

International: When the game is a dead ball, the substitute player can immediately enter the court and notify the referee after the scorekeeper blows the whistle.

Xiqing: When the game is a dead ball, the substitute player can only enter the court and substitute after the scorekeeper blows the whistle and the referee approves it; otherwise, it will be considered a technical foul, and substitution is not allowed when the team makes a goal, unless a time-out is requested (Chapter 5, Article 3) and (Chapter 15, Article 4)

(10) Request to Re-Establish Positions After a Substitute Player

International: No matter how many substitute players there are (limited to five substitute players), they can all ask the referee to have the opposing team re-establish positions.

Xiqing: Only when there are three or more substitute players entering the court at the same time in a team can they ask the referee to have the opposing team re-establish positions (Chapter 5, Article 3, Q&A)

(11) Continuing Play After a Technical Foul Free Throw

International: Whether the last free throw for mutual fouls and technical foul free throws are made or not, the ball should be jumped in the center circle in all cases except for the following: If a team receives consecutive fouls, and at least one of them is a free throw for a personal foul, then the game should continue if the last free throw is missed.

Xiqing: Other aspects are the same as the international rules, but regardless of whether the technical foul free throw is made or not, the player of the free-throwing team will throw the ball inbounds from the center line to continue the game.

(12) Throwing Free Throws

International: All free throws must be thrown according to the rules.

Xiqing: For a single free throw or the last free throw of multiple attempts for a technical or personal foul, the captain of the free-throwing team can request to give up the free throw and instead throw the ball inbounds from the center line.

(13) Fouls During Throwing the Ball into the Basket

International: If the opposing party commits a personal foul while a player is throwing the ball into the basket, two free throws should be awarded if the ball fails to enter the basket as a result. If the ball still enters the basket and is valid, only one free throw should be awarded (Chapter 13, Article 13, Penalty 1)

Xiqing: If the opposing party commits a personal foul while a player is throwing the ball into the basket, two free throws should be awarded if the ball fails to enter the basket as a result. If the ball still enters the basket and is valid, only one free throw should be awarded. However, if the actions of the fouling party are rude and intentionally personal, two free throws can also be awarded even if the ball enters the basket.

(14) Technical Foul for "Touching the Ball"

International: After Team A throws the ball into the basket, the losing team, Team B, throws the ball inbounds after the referee holds the ball and blows the whistle.

Xiqing: If the ball is touched before Team B, the losing team, throws the ball inbounds after Team A throws the ball into the basket, it is considered a technical foul (because Team B can immediately throw the ball inbounds to attack without waiting for the referee to blow the whistle after losing a point.) (End)

This does not mean that each small muscle should be paid attention to every day, but refers to all the muscles of the whole body; no matter which group of muscles, it should not be practiced too much, so as not to hinder the development of other groups.

Everyone wants their arms, legs, neck, chest, and shoulders to have a perfectly developed shape. As long as they have the will, they can achieve this goal, but those who have this will must also have this work.

If you can practice faithfully for fifteen minutes every day according to the following methods, nothing is impossible. You must know that fifteen minutes every day is far more beneficial than a casual hour. Scholars should remember this.
