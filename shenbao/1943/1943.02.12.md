### A Respectful Admonition to Japan's "China Hands" and China's "Japan Hands"

To navigate complex international relations, a nation must, in times of peace, cultivate experts in the affairs of other countries to serve as the brains trust and advisors for governmental authorities in deciding international policy; in reality, a nation's international policy is entrusted to their hands. For decades, Japan has diligently cultivated "China Hands." As for China's "Japan Hands," they are truly far behind Japan in comparison. The evolution of Sino-Japanese relations in the past has been significantly influenced, directly or indirectly, by these "Japan Hands" and "China Hands." In particular, among these Japanese "China Hands," there are, of course, many who are worthy of the title, possessing a deep understanding and insightful views on China's national conditions and popular sentiment, along with fervent sympathy and the magnanimity of great statesmen embodying "bright breeze and clear moon" and "treating all people as their own."

However, the gradual deterioration of Sino-Japanese relations in the past decade or so, while primarily due to the instigation of discord by Britain and the United States, should also be attributed in considerable measure to both Japan's "China Hands" and China's "Japan Hands."

Looking back at past events, it is said that during the "China Incident," Chiang Kai-shek sought the opinion of the then-ambassador to Japan regarding Japan's national conditions. The embassy's conclusion was that Japan's national strength could not sustain a protracted war, and that as long as Britain and the United States intervened, Japan would surely retreat in the face of difficulties. Of course, the embassy cannot bear the responsibility for the incident, but the fact remains that "Japan Hands" of this kind, with a superficial understanding of Japan, served as consultants to the government, directly or indirectly leading the government's policy toward Japan down a wrong path.

In the past four or five years, there have been many in the Chongqing regime who, relying on a few Japanese books, or a few Japanese newspapers, or Anglo-American propaganda about Japan, have styled themselves as experts on Japan and participated in confidential matters. What good policies could possibly come out of this? Therefore, a year and a half ago, the Chongqing regime estimated that the ABC powers would be able to soften Japan, and estimated that Japan would never take action against Britain and the United States. These were all the results of Chongqing's insufficient understanding and erroneous assessment of Japan.

We cannot say that the same situation absolutely does not exist in Tokyo or Nanjing.

We hope that China and Japan will not only cooperate at present but also forever, so we offer the following suggestions to the governments in Tokyo and Nanjing, and to all those who aspire to study the national conditions of both countries and become true "China Hands" in Japan and true "Japan Hands" in China:

In the future, neither government should heavily rely on those who have only a superficial understanding of the other country's national conditions and popular sentiment. Relying on only a superficial understanding will be more harmful than not understanding at all, because those who do not understand at all will not make seemingly correct but actually wrong decisions that plunge both China and Japan into suffering, while those with a superficial understanding will be deeply mired in error without realizing it. Instead, they must cultivate and trust those with true knowledge and foresight, and those "true Hands" with the political magnanimity of "bright breeze and clear moon" and "treating all people as their own," as well as passionate commitment.

How can one become a "true Hand?"

The first principle is to have a correct understanding, belief, and determination to strive for the eternal cooperation of the two great nations of China and Japan. One must have ample love, enthusiasm, and sympathy for the other's nation and people, and have the sincerity and perseverance to sacrifice oneself for the sake of increasing understanding and cooperation between the two great nations and their peoples.

Secondly, one must conduct thorough and comprehensive investigations and research into the other's history, geography, national character, customs, habits, economy, politics, and culture. In particular, one must fully understand what is currently hated by the people and what is loved by the people, grasp the core of the path to eternal cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese nations, and find the fundamental principles and methods for eternal harmony between the two great nations. Only then can one be worthy of the title of "true Hand."

Furthermore, one should also recognize the other comprehensively and from an active perspective, and understand the other. One must recognize that both countries are progressing and keeping up with the times, and one must observe, recognize, and understand this progress from all aspects. It is especially necessary to be in contact with the majority of ordinary people. We must know that Japan in the Meiji Restoration and the Greater East Asia War has made progress with the passage of time. We should also know that the Chinese national movement, folk organizations, folk power, and current national consciousness since the Boxer Rebellion and the Triads have made great progress. If one still rigidly seeks the corpse of the Boxer Rebellion and the Triads, and tries to contact the outdated minority of bureaucrats and politicians, then the result will only be to get stuck in a dead end.

For the sake of promoting the cooperation of China and Japan and the two great nations, not only at present but also forever, we urgently need the efforts of all "Japan Hands" and "China Hands" to enhance the future happiness of both countries.

### The Japanese Army Stationed in China Announces Comprehensive War Results for the Past Year; Interacting Forces of the Chongqing Army Decreased; Sophisticated Weapons Have Seen a Reduction

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The press department of the Japanese Army stationed in China yesterday (11th) announced a summary of the comprehensive war results of the Japanese Army stationed in China for the Greater East Asia War, Showa 17th year (Republic of China 31st year), as follows: 3,867,000 personnel of the Chongqing side engaged in combat; 260,805 bodies of Chongqing soldiers left behind; 124,408 prisoners captured; 109 Chongqing aircraft shot down or destroyed, of which 16 have not yet been confirmed; captured items include 28 field mountain guns, 7,599 boxes of ammunition, 535 heavy machine guns, 753,206 rounds of ammunition, 2,776 light machine guns, 513,571 rounds of ammunition, 810 mortars, 42,207 rounds of ammunition, 126,357 rifles, 109,630,116 rounds of ammunition, 22,201 pistols, 139,208 rounds of ammunition, 712,674 hand grenades. Japanese army losses include 8,400 killed in action.

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The comprehensive war results on the China front for the past year, announced by the press department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army on the 11th, provide a detailed explanation of the decline in the combat power of the Chongqing army and serve as an excellent resource for estimating the combat power of the Chongqing army this year. According to this, the number of major operations by the Japanese army on the China front last year was approximately 50, and the number of engagements was approximately 2,500. Compared with the war results of the previous year, the interacting forces of the Chongqing army have decreased by 1,343,300, and the number of bodies left behind has also decreased by 84,000. However, the increase of 20,210 in the number of prisoners indicates that the Chongqing army has largely lost its will to fight. Furthermore, regarding the items captured, sophisticated weapons such as field mountain guns, heavy machine guns, and light machine guns have seen a reduction, while relatively simple weapons such as mortars, rifles, pistols, and hand grenades have seen a considerable increase. This proves that, due to the Japanese army cutting off the Chongqing side's transportation routes, foreign aid weapons have become extremely difficult to obtain, and they have had to rely solely on self-made weapons. Conversely, the Japanese army's losses have seen a sharp decrease compared to the previous year, which can be said to show that the Japanese army's morale is becoming increasingly high and is in stark contrast to the Chongqing army's loss of will to fight. The average daily interacting forces of the Chongqing army was 10,595, among whom 715 were killed in action and 341 were captured. Even excluding the loss of sick soldiers last year, the daily loss of troops reached as many as 1,056. The total number of bodies left behind and prisoners captured by the Chongqing army during this year is approximately 43 divisions, rifles approximately equivalent to 53 divisions, light machine guns approximately equivalent to 185 divisions, and heavy machine guns approximately equivalent to 11 divisions. Considering the Chongqing army's large losses in personnel and weapons, one should also know how distressed they are. The comprehensive war results for last year and the previous year are compared as follows: (1) Interacting forces decreased by 1,343,300; (1) Bodies left behind decreased by 84,000; (1) Prisoners increased by 20,210; (1) Captured items: field mountain guns decreased by 29, ammunition decreased by 6,850, heavy machine guns decreased by 435, ammunition decreased by 19,000, light machine guns decreased by 780, mortars increased by 260, rifles increased by 6,881, pistols increased by 8,858, hand grenades increased by 94,000.

The specialized committee will solicit opinions from the public, but the system of civilian participation is not yet under consideration. (2) Regarding the transfer of enemy property in China, from the perspective of completing the Greater East Asia War, there are also cases where it is more appropriate for us to handle it. It is planned to transfer it to the management of the National Government. (3) Regarding economic cooperation, it is natural to purchase Chinese goods and fully utilize the National Government's institutions for mutual cooperation. In particular, the food issue is of utmost importance to people's livelihoods, so this intention should be fully understood before proceeding. As for the production, distribution, and consumption of cotton, etc., which are closely related, the opinions of officials and civilians on the Chinese side should be respected in order to realize cooperation.

### Minister Lin Returned to the Capital Yesterday and Gave a Speech to Reporters in Hankou

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency) After Minister of Propaganda Lin arrived in Wuhan, he attended the mass demonstrations held by the provincial and municipal governments to support the war and destroy the British and Americans. He was also invited to give speeches to cadres of various organizations and Japanese residents in Wuhan. Minister Lin explained in detail the significance of the National Government's participation in the war and the responsibilities that the people should bear in wartime. This (11th) morning at 8:00 AM, he again flew to Ying'an County in Hubei Province to attend a mass meeting of the county's people and delivered a speech. He did not complete his public duties until 12:10 PM, and immediately boarded a plane at 12:25 PM to return to Nanjing. Provincial and municipal government officials and heads of various organizations all went to the airport to see him off.

Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) After Minister of Propaganda Lin arrived in Wuhan, he hosted a reception for Chinese and foreign journalists at the Wuhua Hotel in the city yesterday (10th) at 5:00 PM. More than 30 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers, telegraph agencies, as well as the German Huitong News Agency and the Italian Stefani Agency attended. A record of the various questions and answers is as follows:

Q: Minister Lin, what are your impressions of this visit to Wuhan?

A: This time I came to Wuhan and saw that there has been significant progress in all aspects. I attended the mass meeting in Wuchang yesterday and was very impressed. Especially today, I attended the mass meeting in Hankou, which had more than 60,000 people, the most seen since the Wuhan Incident. From this, it can be seen that China's future is bright and worthy of expectation. Wuhan is the cradle of the revolution, and the people's patriotic ideas are very strong. In the future, they will be able to advance more bravely in shouldering the responsibility of reviving China and protecting East Asia.

Q: What preparations will China make in terms of administrative measures for the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality in the future?

A: China is currently studying the improvement of the judicial system and strengthening police training, so that after the abolition of extraterritoriality, the safety of all friendly residents will be more reliably guaranteed.

Q: How will the National Government manage and dispose of enemy property in the future?

A: Regarding the issue of enemy property reception, the National Government has organized an Enemy Property Management Committee, with the Minister of Finance concurrently serving as the Chairman. A bureau or office may be established under it. The general structure is like this. As for the disposal of enemy property, it can be divided into two major departments: (1) In the industrial field, the factories received will be planned and utilized by the Ministry of Industry, and developed as much as possible within the scope of possibility, so as to increase production. (2) In the cultural field, the tools of Anglo-American cultural aggression in the past will be reorganized to promote Eastern culture and Chinese culture.

Q: How will the youth movement be promoted and developed in the future?

A: The promotion of the New National Movement and the work of the Youth League after the war has made the need for more intensive training even more apparent. Our original plan for promoting the youth movement, which was mainly based on students, now needs to be adapted to the wartime system. In addition to young students, there is also a need for unification for working youth. Therefore, in the near future, we will merge the two systems into one, that is, organize the Chinese Youth League, which will be further divided into youth and scout troops.

Q: What are the reasons for the recent reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Committee and how will it be improved in the future?

A: The reorganization of the North China Political Affairs Committee is the same as the reorganization of the provincial and municipal government agencies in various places. The reason is entirely to implement the wartime system and strengthen its administrative agencies. Furthermore, because Chairman Wang Yitang had long intended to resign, he submitted a request to resign this time, and his intention was very firm. Therefore, the National Government appointed Mr. Zhu Shen to succeed him as the Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee.

Q: What are the missions of the New National Movement, the Kuomintang, and the East Asia League?

A: On the surface, the New National Movement, the Kuomintang, and the East Asia League are several organizations, each with its own nature. This is actually a misunderstanding. Let me explain it simply. First of all, the New National Movement and the East Asia League are like the Japanese Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the Asia Development League, one is internal and the other is external, with different goals but the same substance. Furthermore, regarding the issue of the party, the general public still views the party as an administrative agency as it was during Chiang Kai-shek's era, and some people still think so now. It must be known that the Kuomintang leads the people, so that every party member is in the inner layer of the people, doing the work of leading the people, not using the party headquarters to interfere in administration. Therefore, the party members led by Chairman Wang must go deep among the people, use the party's doctrine as the central idea, create a common belief, and the nation can develop first, and the New National Movement can also develop. At the same time, in addition to the party, there are other parties and non-partisan people. In order to enable them to understand the spirit of the East Asia League and receive the training of the New National Movement, the Kuomintang has a major responsibility.

### North China Political Affairs Committee Convenes Standing Committee Meeting

### Ministry of Social Welfare Organized and Established

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) Since the Supreme National Defense Council resolved to establish the Ministry of Social Welfare, the ministry has been organized and established in accordance with the organizational law. Now, in order to manage social welfare, promote charity, and provide political guidance to the people, the ministry has specially established the People's Political Guidance Department, Public Welfare Department, Disaster Relief Bureau, Social Simple Insurance Bureau, General Affairs Department, Physical Fitness Department, Labor Department, and Vocational Department.

### Chinese Youth League and Boy Scouts Merged and Renamed the Chinese Youth and Children's League

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency) The New National Movement Promotion Committee recently determined that the organization and training of youth and children in various places, which is divided into two systems, the Chinese Youth League and the Chinese Boy Scouts, is inappropriate. In order to adapt to the unified command of youth and children nationwide after the National Government's participation in the war, it was decided on February 9th to merge the two systems of the Chinese Youth League and the Chinese Boy Scouts into one, renamed the Chinese Youth and Children's League, which is divided into youth teams and children's teams. Schools with only youth teams or only children's teams still establish the Chinese Youth and Children's League's school branch. The previously promulgated General Regulations of the Youth League and the General Regulations of the Boy Scouts are being merged and revised into the General Regulations of the Chinese Youth and Children's League, which will be promulgated soon.

### Postal Remittances Restored in the Ning-Shao Area

### Chiang Song Meiling's Actions in the United States; Will Attend Congress and Deliver a Speech

### Chongqing Stabilization Fund Halts Work

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) According to authoritative sources in London political circles, the so-called Stabilization Fund measures taken by Britain and the United States towards Chongqing in the past now exist only in name. The disastrous consequences of Chongqing's over-issuance of banknotes have forced the work of the Stabilization Fund Committee to be suspended due to difficulties.

### Chongqing to Compulsorily Recruit Rickshaw Pullers and Sedan Chair Carriers

Guangzhou, 11th (Central News Agency) According to reports from Chongqing, the Chongqing authorities recently decided to limit the number of rickshaw pullers and sedan chair carriers in the city in March, and to compulsorily recruit the remaining sedan chair carriers, about 10,000, into the army, or send them to work in mines and agriculture. In addition, they will also compulsorily transfer traditional Chinese medicine practitioners and servants in hotels and inns to other occupations. It is said that this compulsory recruitment method will be gradually implemented in various places under the rule of the Chongqing side.

### Japan's Future Policies in Zhao Nan Island; Seeking Stability of People's Livelihood

Zhao Nan Island, 11th (Central News Agency) As Singapore's fall approaches its first anniversary, the head of the military administration of Zhao Nan Island met with a group of reporters on the eve of the anniversary and made a statement on the future policies of the military administration of Malaya and Sumatra, as follows: The residents here are living happily under our military administration, and the local situation is excellent. Various administrative measures have been extended to remote villages, and the people's main livelihoods have gradually become stable. Residents are actively working hard to increase food production. In the future, the military administration will not only ensure that residents fully understand the purpose of the holy war, but will also ensure the minimum necessary living necessities to seek stability in the lives of residents. In order to promote the exchange of materials and develop the region's light industry, it is planned to import necessary materials from Japan and seek various necessary measures. Therefore, it is believed that Malaya's people's livelihood and public security can be further improved.

### Japanese Authorities in the Philippines Implement Benevolent Governance, Promulgate Military Sentence Reduction Order

Manila, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The highest commander of the Japanese Army in the Philippines has decided to announce a military sentence reduction order on the 11th, the Japanese Empire Day, to reduce or commute the sentences of those convicted by Japanese military tribunals. The authorities issued a statement on the 10th, stating that the Japanese commander, with deep benevolence and leniency, has reduced or commuted military sentences because many rebellious elements in the Philippines have been sentenced by military tribunals in the past year. According to the amnesty order, those sentenced to death will be commuted to 15 years of imprisonment, long-term imprisonment will be commuted to 10 years of imprisonment, and fixed-term imprisonment will be reduced by two-thirds. Moreover, elderly offenders, those deemed pitiful, and those willing to reform will be released. This sentence reduction order is promulgated on the first anniversary of the fall of the Philippines, which further demonstrates the significance of the Greater East Asia War. It is truly worthy of celebration. Those who are pardoned will surely be deeply grateful for the warmth of the Japanese army. We sincerely hope that the general public will deeply understand the intention of the Japanese commander, recognize the current new situation, and strive to build a new Philippines.

### German Forces Strong, Launch Counter-Offensive Along Entire Front, Soviet Army Increases Pressure on Kharkov, Donets Basin Becomes Center of Major Battle

Headquarters of the Führer, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - According to today's announcement by the German military, fierce battles continue on the southern sector of the Eastern Front. The German defensive battles have been very effective. The German forces in the Caucasus are making progress in their counter-offensive against the newly landed Soviet forces southwest of Novorossiysk. Soviet attacks upstream of the Donets River have been repelled.

Berlin, 11th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - German authorities explained the situation on the Eastern Front on the 10th, saying that the most intense fighting is currently taking place in the central region of the Donets Basin. The Soviet offensive in that area is even larger in scale than last winter's counter-offensive. The German forces are engaging the Soviet forces along the front line, preventing their advance, and using mobility to penetrate deep into the Soviet positions, achieving great results. Soviet reinforcements landed northwest of Novorossiysk on the 9th and are already engaged in fierce fighting with the German forces in that area.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Heavy snow continues to fall in the area between the Donets Basin and the Kursk-Orel line, making it difficult to detect the movements of enemy forces. The German side does not have a straight defensive line in that area, only uneven, jagged strongholds. The Soviet army uses the heavy snow to occasionally break into the German front lines, but the German positions have not moved as a result. Often, just as the enemy is preparing to encircle a certain place, the German forces launch a sudden counter-offensive and inflict heavy damage. A column of Soviet mechanized units several kilometers long was trapped in the heavy snow between the Donets and Oskol rivers. It was completely defeated by a sudden German attack.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The situation on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has generally not changed. However, the pressure exerted by the enemy on Kharkov has increased. The German army is using flexible tactics to prevent the Soviet army from encircling the city. When the German front lines are occasionally breached, they carry out counter-offensives. They once advanced to Belgorod and are still engaged in fierce fighting there. The area around Izium and Slavyansk is relatively quiet. The German forces have counter-attacked and recaptured several villages to prevent the enemy from advancing from north to south. However, the Soviet army has concentrated heavy troops in that area, and fierce battles are expected to break out soon.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Military figures in Berlin recently declared that the situation on the Eastern Front is gradually improving, and the German resistance has been strengthened, especially on the southern sector. Therefore, the Soviet army made no progress yesterday. The German army has launched a counter-offensive along the entire front, with strong forces. Although the Soviet army broke through our main front line, they were immediately repelled by the defending forces. The German defensive battles in the areas northwest of the lower Don River and the Donets Bay have been most effective. The Soviet army has launched several attacks, suffering heavy losses in manpower and materials. The German defense of Novorossiysk and the Kupiansk area is also proceeding smoothly.

German Heavy Artillery Bombards Leningrad

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - German artillery heavily bombarded military facilities in Leningrad yesterday, hitting ammunition factories, shipyards, warehouses, etc. A telegraph office and a Baltic shipyard caught fire. Several enemy artillery positions were also destroyed. Soviet aircraft took off to try to prevent the German forces from continuing to fire, but were driven back by anti-aircraft fire.

Berlin, 10th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - German authorities announced on the 9th that German heavy artillery units had heavily bombarded Leningrad's military facilities and harbor area, achieving great results. It is now learned that as a result of the bombardment, in addition to the destruction of various ammunition factories, warehouses, and transportation facilities, electrical wire factories and shipyards also caught fire. Furthermore, the Soviet artillery positions were silenced by the German attack. Soviet air force dispatched a large number of aircraft to prevent the artillery from continuing their operations but were driven back by anti-aircraft artillery units and infantry units.

Fate of German Soldiers Encircled in Stalingrad

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Authoritative authorities here revealed today that there are currently no official reports regarding the fate and whereabouts of every soldier fighting in Stalingrad. Regarding this matter, German newspapers reported that the army and air force in each military district have been ordered to investigate and collect information about the whereabouts of the soldiers besieged in Stalingrad. The information obtained from the wounded soldiers who withdrew from Stalingrad is currently being reviewed, which will take some time. Therefore, no information can currently be released about the fate of each soldier.

### North African Situation Stalled, Allied Forces Concentrate and Await Opportunity to Attack, Fierce Air Battle Over Kairouan

Bern, Switzerland, 10th (Havas News Agency dispatch) - According to the latest news from both the Axis and Allied sides, the situation in North Africa remains stalled. The fighting in Tunisia is limited to reconnaissance activities and mutual artillery bombardment. According to a Rome communique, reconnaissance units are very active at the border between Tunisia and Tripolitania. However, according to London news, General Rommel has completed the withdrawal of his troops from Tripolitania into Tunisia and has concentrated German and Italian forces under his command. The front lines are currently quiet, but both sides' air forces are very active. Anglo-American squadrons attacked Kairouan, causing many civilian casualties. Later, they bombed Calabria and Trapani, suffering minor damage. Several civilians were killed or wounded. Four enemy aircraft were shot down over Trapani. In Algiers, German aircraft bombed the port of Bona, hitting a merchant ship, and the port facilities were also bombed. British aircraft again attacked the port of Palermo in Sicily and Axis bases in Crete today, including the port of Heraklion. In the past forty-eight hours, the Anglo-Americans lost forty-four aircraft.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - This week, enemy forces in North Africa have become active again. The British Eighth Army first engaged in reconnaissance with motorcycle units on February 7, but were defeated as soon as they crossed the Tunisian-Libyan border. The next day, a larger number of British troops attacked again and were also repelled. The German army launched a counter-offensive and drove the British back to Tripoli. General Montgomery has not yet deployed his entire force. It is believed that he will launch a major offensive after receiving a large number of reinforcements, or he may launch an offensive simultaneously with the British First Army in western Tunisia, it is unknown. American forces in the area north of Gafsa and Mateur are still continuing to concentrate. American forces in the area of Kasserine and Sbeitla are also engaged in similar activities. On February 9, the American forces in that area attempted to recapture the Faïd Pass but failed. Whether this action is a prelude to a major offensive by the American Fifth Army remains to be seen.

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - Responsible sources say that a fierce air battle occurred over Kairouan, Tunisia on Tuesday. As six German bombers were patrolling the German front lines, they suddenly encountered a large formation of British bombers and fighters, about fifty in number. The German aircraft disregarded everything and immediately charged at them. After a fierce battle lasting fifty minutes, fifteen enemy aircraft were shot down. All of the German aircraft safely returned to base afterward. It is also reported that from the time the enemy invaded French North Africa on November 6, 1942, until February 9 of this year, the Anglo-American air forces have lost 703 aircraft.

### President Wang Answers Questions from Japanese Reporters on the Government's Policies After Entering the War

(Asahi Shimbun special correspondent Matsudaira, Nanjing dispatch) - I, the reporter, with the introduction of the News Department, along with a group of Osaka Army reporters, went to President Wang's residence and had the opportunity to pay our respects to him. President Wang, in the midst of his busy political affairs, personally received us and spoke freely about the government's policies after entering the war, including increasing production and building the army. The following is the question and answer session between the reporter and President Wang:

Q: What are the fundamental policies of the government after entering the war?

A: The most important thing is to clearly identify who are the comrades of East Asia and who are the traitors of East Asia. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the government still hoped that the Chongqing side would take this opportunity to reflect and return to the camp of peaceful China. However, they brazenly risked infamy and followed the path of traitors of East Asia. Their old habits remained unchanged, and they continued to fight alongside Britain and the United States, or concluded treaties of non-separate peace, which greatly disappointed us. But we still harbored appeasement and, for the past year, have been vigorously urging the Chongqing side to reflect. However, they were stubborn and unrepentant, and betrayed this good intention, and our efforts were in vain.

In order to clearly demonstrate our position and unite East Asian comrades, the government decided to enter the war. Although our strength is small, we are willing to do our utmost to stand on the side of participating in the war. The aim of future governance is to achieve the great unity of the Chinese people, to complete the Greater East Asia War, and to clearly recognize that this is the way to save China. Guide the people to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. The above is the fundamental policy of the government. I believe that there is no other way to liberate China. Fortunately, the Government of the Japanese Empire has accepted our sincerity and provided various assistance, enabling us to automatically rise up and participate in the war.

The Government of the Japanese Empire, in order to make China a modern nation, is willing to provide even more powerful assistance by returning concessions and abolishing extraterritoriality. The government expresses its deep gratitude for this. Promoting the New Movement is one of the fundamental policies, so that we can first guide the people spiritually.

Q: How will the increase in production and the reform of political institutions be implemented?

A: This matter stems from the above fundamental policy and is as important as strengthening public security. Developing important resources and assisting the Greater East Asia War is a matter of utmost urgency. It is not only required by the current situation, but also can establish East Asia's self-sufficient economy and solve the common economic problems of China and Japan. From this point of view, it should be highly valued. At the third National Defense Conference this morning, we prepared to discuss specific economic policies. However, because they are still under discussion, I cannot describe them in detail.

Regarding the reform of political institutions, as announced last time, we will first strengthen the centralization of central political institutions, and then strengthen the centralization of local political institutions, changing the provincial committee system to the provincial governor system.

Q: What are the goals for building the army after entering the war?

A: To revive China and defend East Asia are the fundamental policies for building the army. Regarding its specific points, I will explain a few points:

First, the current quality of the government's army. Eight or nine out of ten of the government's troops were drawn from the Chongqing army or Chongqing guerrilla forces. Therefore, because of past relationships, the environment of these troops is different. Future army building will focus on how to reorganize and organize these troops, striving to implement elite soldierism. Last year, we transferred officers and soldiers from all over the country to the Central Army Officers Training Corps to instill the "meaning of the nation" and build the "meaning of the Greater East Asia Construction". In just one month, all officers and soldiers will be trained. This year, we will further reorganize the army and train it. It would be a great mistake to think that the meaning of reorganization is eliminationism. We will never disappoint anyone who comes to join the Peace Army, not even a single soldier. Otherwise, the Chongqing army, which hopes to participate in the peace movement, will be held back. The so-called reorganization is implemented according to three standards. We select the best soldiers among the soldiers, reorganize them, and organize them into regular troops, giving them preferential treatment. The second group is given a lighter task and incorporated into the security team. Third, those who have no soldier qualities are guaranteed their livelihood so that they can live a peaceful civilian life. In the short term, we will reorganize the army according to these three standards. Although we cannot obtain a large number of elite soldiers for the time being, we believe that we will be able to obtain a portion of elite soldiers in the future. For the time being, we must first devote ourselves to training elite soldiers.

The second goal before achieving this ideal is that at least the government's army must secure the peaceful areas in order to reduce the burden on the rear of the Japanese army. Third, when the Peace Army can completely secure the peaceful areas, the officers and soldiers of the Chongqing side may be willing to return. This is the third goal.

The above are all interrelated issues and cannot be considered separately. For example, increasing production, developing resources, and strengthening economic strength will enable the army to be built smoothly. From this example, we can see that the promotion of politics, military affairs, and economy follows this path completely. Do not misunderstand this point.

The war plan discussed by me and Roosevelt was to fight the enemy simultaneously on land, sea, and air as much as time and material resources allowed. The greatest threat we currently face is from submarines. Churchill continued that I have repeatedly provided Roosevelt with solemn assurances that Britain will do its utmost to conduct operations against Japan and is willing to establish a special treaty with the United States on this matter, but Roosevelt has expressed satisfaction with this verbal assurance.

### US Secretary of the Navy Knox's Proposal Harshly Criticized by German Side

Berlin, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - A spokesperson for the German Foreign Ministry said yesterday that if US Secretary of the Navy Knox's proposal to supply the people of the occupied territories with military weapons is implemented, it will inevitably lead to serious consequences. According to international law, the occupying authorities have the obligation to maintain order in the occupied territories. If the local people obtain weapons, they will inevitably fall into a position of extreme suffering. Knox's proposal is deliberately harming others.

### African Indigenous Troops Mutiny, Suppressed by US Forces Before Peace Returns

### German Long-Range Guns Roar Across the English Channel, London Suburbs Bombed by German Aircraft

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (D盟 News Agency dispatch) - According to reports from Washington, German long-range guns across the Strait of Dover suddenly began firing on the southern coast of England at the same time at noon on the 10th. The bombardment was quite fierce. It seemed that there were six giant cannons participating in the bombardment, firing more than a hundred shells. This was one of the most intense bombardments since the start of the war. For example, department stores and restaurants in a certain city were hit, and the casualties were quite high because it was lunchtime. That evening, an air raid alarm was issued in London, and anti-aircraft guns also fired fiercely into the air, but no German aircraft were seen. The alarm was lifted soon afterward.

Finnish newspapers have all written articles to refute it. One major newspaper stated that Finland will fight as long as it holds weapons. We Finns would rather die in battle than submit to the Communist Party. We will never allow our country to be reduced to a Soviet province.

### Croatia Joins the Geneva Convention

Belgrade, 11th (Haitong News Agency dispatch) - The Croatian government has joined the Geneva Convention through the introduction of the country's Red Cross Society.

### Splinters of the Japanese Parliament

Regarding the issue of excessively high compensation for lower-level executives of control associations, corporations, and national policy associations, Mr. Suehiro Nishio, at the general budget meeting of the House of Representatives on the 5th, requested that, in the current situation, "it is not the time to discuss the balance of compensation from a financial perspective." It is a noteworthy viewpoint that, under the harsh wartime system, the thoughts of all citizens should be focused on striving for victory. The process of advancing towards victory relies on the increasing tension in the lives of the people. In this era, we should unreservedly realize that "capable people should not consider compensation," which is what all citizens should strive to practice. To strive for victory, all citizens should be frank and selfless, and serve the public with integrity.

Of course, the current urgent task is to fully understand the importance of the current situation, so as to guide the people to practice the above-mentioned way of life, and promote the proper integration of their strengths.

At the House of Representatives' Special Wartime Administrative Law Bill Committee, Prime Minister Tojo thanked the parliament for its trust, explained his position of bearing heavy responsibility, and explained the difference from Western-style dictatorship. He and President Suzuki of the Planning Board solemnly emphasized the purpose of utilizing the current forms in industrial management, which is of course necessary for the expansion of current military strength. As President Suzuki supplemented: "Due to the urgency of the war and other circumstances, when the environment changes, it cannot but be taken into consideration."

At the budget general meeting, Mr. Tadataka Ikezaki's opinion of "grasping the idea of unifying China in thought" is noteworthy. Mr. Ikezaki said: "The lack of grasping this idea is one of the reasons for the delay in resolving the China Incident." Not to mention the past, even considering the future of the Greater East Asia construction, it cannot be ignored. We advocate the spirit of Hakkō ichiu for the ideal of Greater East Asia construction. This ideal of Hakkō ichiu is by no means like the propaganda of the United Kingdom and the United States, but an absolute ideal that is inseparable from our reality. After fully grasping the thought of China, and restoring it to its original Oriental spirit, and feeling empathy for this great ideal, then can we jointly move towards the construction of East Asia.

Mr. Ikezaki does not agree with the method of preserving the international nature of Shanghai, not because the problem is too small to pay attention to. Mr. Ikezaki's opinion is whether or not the concession should be returned with conditions. As a result of exchanging opinions with Aoki of the Greater East Asia Ministry, the interpretation of the so-called internationality is that the inner meaning of this internationality should completely eliminate the remnants of British and American aggression in East Asia, and be built by us.

### Gandhi Starts Fasting - Nationwide Strike for One Day

Lisbon, 10th (Domei News Agency) - Mahatma Gandhi began fasting yesterday morning. It will continue for a certain period of time, which will be determined by the actions of the Indian government. Gandhi wrote to the Viceroy of India, Lord Linlithgow, stating that he did not hope to fast to death, but only to allow the "judgment of God" to continue to exist. If God wills, this fast can be ended by the Indian government providing the necessary relief. Gandhi's fast is a protest against the Indian National Congress Party not being responsible for the Indian riots and his continued detention by the British as inappropriate. After the news of Gandhi's fast spread, there was a one-day strike in India. At the same time, the Indian government is unwilling to study the Congress's "demand to expel India," and Gandhi is not responsible. Gandhi will not eat unless he is unconditionally released.

Istanbul, Turkey, 10th (Havas News Agency) - After Indian Mahatma Gandhi started fasting today, all city markets went on strike to express sympathy, but no unexpected incidents occurred. Gandhi is confined in the Aga Khan Palace, and the authorities have dispatched additional police protection. In addition, according to the British authorities, Gandhi will be allowed to meet with foreigners and freely choose doctors for treatment. Gandhi's party members are extremely worried about his fasting, as he is old and ill. However, Gandhi himself said, "I do not want to die, and I hope I can survive so that I can continue to fight."

Lisbon, 11th (Central News Agency) - Since India launched another anti-British movement last August demanding independence, the elder Gandhi of the National Congress Party was arrested by British officials. After half a year of silence, he suddenly demanded unconditional release from the authorities on the 10th and began fasting. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, the news of Gandhi's fast has spread throughout India, and all Indian people are deeply moved. However, because Gandhi is 75 years old, they are quite worried about his health. It is said that when Gandhi started fasting, he said that he had considered his physical strength and would only drink thin fruit juice.

### Thailand's Construction - New Capital City Plan

The new capital will cover an area of about 200 square kilometers, and will gradually expand to 406 square kilometers.

### Greater East Asia - Buddhist Youth Conference - Scheduled to be Convened in Tokyo in May

Tokyo, 11th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Buddhist Youth League Federation, in order to unite the overall will and strength of young Buddhists in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere to cooperate in completing the war, is organizing the Greater East Asia Buddhist Youth Conference, with the support of the Japanese Army, Navy, Greater East Asia, and Ministry of Education's Information Bureaus, the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, the Tokyo Metropolitan Government, and the Great Japan Buddhist Association. It is scheduled to be held grandly in Tokyo in May of this year. At that time, about a thousand representatives from Buddhist schools and groups in Japan, the Republic of China, Thailand, Vietnam, Burma, India, Malaysia, Java, the Philippines, and Manchuria will attend and participate. The main agenda includes 14 items related to the construction of Greater East Asia culture. The general meeting and four sub-committees will hold earnest discussions separately. After the conference closes, they will also visit the Ise Grand Shrine and Buddhist holy sites such as Kyoto and Nara. In addition, taking advantage of the opportunity of this conference, in addition to forming the Greater East Asia Buddhist Youth Association, three commemorative projects will also launch large-scale movements. Recently, the Ministry of Greater East Asia will issue invitations to formally invite representatives.

### O Province's Mass Rally in Support of the War - Speech by Minister Lin Xuan (Continued and Completed)

Perhaps some people think, "It is already clear that Britain is not good to China. Isn't the United States better?" It is true that the United States has established schools and hospitals in China, which seems to be good to us on the surface, but it is actually a conspiracy of cultural aggression. Not to mention anything else, the United States has recently made two statements. The first sentence is "Blood is thicker than water. Britain and the United States are of the same blood. Although there is the Atlantic Ocean between them, the blood is fused." This is the so-called "blood is thicker than water." They themselves are like this, but for East Asia, they will never allow China and Japan to be together. China and Japan are also of the same blood. If their blood is the same, they will cooperate. Why can't we, China and Japan, who have the same writing system and the same race, get along well? Everyone, think about it, what is the reason for this? The second sentence is "Strength is more important than land." That is to say, strength is more important than land. This is what Roosevelt said to Chiang Kai-shek. Between the lines, he hopes that as long as strength is preserved, the loss of land does not matter. Last time, the "Third War Zone" in Zhejiang claimed to have 200,000 troops, but they were vulnerable to a single blow. They lost the land, lost the people, and fled. Some people said that Gu Zhutong should be shot because he was derelict in his duty. However, Chiang Kai-shek said that this was his policy, to maintain strength, and he was willing to give up land. Since the Lugouqiao Incident, Chongqing has been defeated in every battle, without exception. They lost the land, lost their compatriots, and saw these as not Chinese land, and everyone as not Chinese compatriots. This is also this policy. Fellow compatriots, aren't you all compatriots abandoned by Chiang Kai-shek? This is so heartbreaking. Therefore, the cunning of Britain and the United States is the same. Britain and the United States are all schemers who harbor the ambition to invade China. Following Britain and the United States will only lead to national extinction. To save the country, we must live and die together with our friendly neighbor Japan and defend East Asia. If East Asia can be defended, China can be saved. Since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been three years. During this period, it has gone through countless hardships. Naturally, many things have not been done. However, during this period, we have already seen progress bit by bit. The year before last, after the National Government returned to the capital, it signed the Basic Relations Treaty with our friendly neighbor Japan. Not to mention anything else, just take Article 7, which concerns the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. At that time, some people inevitably thought that this was an empty promise. But now, it has progressed from the agreement in the articles to the stage of realization. What was suspected three years ago has now been proven to be true. Some people say that after Japan returns the concessions, doesn't Britain and the United States also sing loudly about returning the concessions to Chongqing? I will not talk about whether Britain and the United States are sincere for the time being. Just looking at the facts, where are the British and American concessions? Tianjin, Guangzhou, Xiamen, and Hankou's concessions, is there any place in the hands of Britain and the United States? What are they going to return? Some people say that it is best to return Hong Kong, but Hong Kong has been snatched from under the hooves of Britain and the United States by Japan. What are they going to return? It is better to generously say that they will also return Nanyang than to return other people's land. Fortunately, it is not their own East Asia. Britain and the United States are using Chongqing as a tool to... to plunder China's territory and sacrifice the Chinese people, single-mindedly seeking benefits for themselves. Japan is strengthening the National Government's strength with a warm heart, returning concessions, abolishing extraterritorial rights, and sincerely returning all... properties and factories in China to us. These are all facts, and they are all... obtained through many difficulties and hardships, and through the sincere cooperation of the two countries. Finally, there are still many compatriots who say, "I already understand that I should participate in the war, but how do I participate in the war?" It is useless to have the will but not the ability. Fellow compatriots, do not think like this. We have strength. Everyone must know that modern warfare is total warfare. In total warfare, there is no distinction between the front and the rear. The front defends East Asia and resists the enemy in the midst of gunfire, while the rear works diligently day and night, engaging in labor, increasing production, and ensuring security. They are all using their strength to contribute to the war and support the victory of the war. As long as we are determined and willing to work hard, we can exert our strength to assist Japan in politics, economics, and even culture. We have material resources, we have manpower, and we have the conscience of 40,000 compatriots who have not died, the conscience to revive China and defend East Asia. We have strength. We should not boast or give up on ourselves. A grain of rice on the ground, our hands and feet, and the blood in our hearts are all the strength to participate in the war. I hope that all compatriots will contribute their blood, their conscience, and their strength to the country, to East Asia. Under the guidance of our highest leader, we will vigorously implement the New National Movement, participate in the war with all our strength, and... rise up to revive China and defend East Asia, this great mission.

### Production and Sales of Salt in Fujian - Nanping Correspondence - Transshipped from Macau - Difficult Transportation and Poor Sales

Salt is a daily necessity, second in importance only to grain, and is an important raw material for industry, which can influence the development of industry. Therefore, although its quantity is large and its acquisition is easy, its importance cannot be ignored. The largest source of salt in our country is sea salt. Fujian was originally a salt-producing area. Before the war, the salt production was not only sufficient for self-sufficiency, but a portion of its tax salt could also be transported and sold to the Chaoshan area. After the outbreak of the war, it further increased the burden on neighboring provinces. Therefore, the salt affairs of Fujian are not only related to the province, but also to Jiangxi and Hunan provinces, becoming an important economic issue.

In Fujian Province, there were 13 salt fields at the end of the Qing Dynasty, and there are now 10 salt fields, namely the Qianxia salt field in Putian County, the Putian salt field, the Shanyao salt field in Hui'an County, the Xunshan salt field in Jinjiang County, the Lianhe salt field in Tong'an County, the Zhaopu salt field in Dongshan County, the Fuqing salt field in Fuqing County, as well as the Nanjin salt field, Wenjiang salt field, and Zhaopu salt field established in recent years. Among these 10 salt fields, we can clearly see that the production areas are all located in the southern part of Fujian Province, which is due to the climate being more conducive to salt drying. According to the statistics of the past year, all the salt fields have a total of 5,491 salt households and 229,924 salt drying sites. The number of people engaged in salt drying is about 50,000, and the number of people involved in transporting salt is more than 200,000. According to official statistics, the highest salt production in the province was more than 3 million piculs in 1929, and the statistics for the three years after the War of Resistance Against Japan were 1.27 million piculs in 1937, 2.04 million piculs in 1938, and 2.31 million piculs in 1939. The production in 1941 fell to 1.4 million piculs. These figures seem to indicate a decrease in salt production. However, salt is a daily necessity. If there is not enough salt, it will inevitably cause turmoil. And we only see the decline in salt production, but we have not heard of the phenomenon of insufficient salt. Therefore, there are two true explanations for the decline in salt production:

First, due to inconvenient transportation and the inability of the Salt Affairs Bureau to provide sufficient salt, the use of private salt has expanded daily. As it stands, the price of official salt is 2.4 yuan per catty, while private salt is more than 8 yuan. The increased price of private salt due to demand has further increased the profits of salt smugglers. Therefore, in official reports, we see a decrease in salt production. Since the implementation of salt distribution based on population, the former quota system in the province has been abolished. The salt in the province is transported by various land and water transportation routes in the province, and sold by the county salt affairs offices to the salt shops in various townships and towns, and then sold to the people according to the population. However, due to transportation difficulties, the price in southern Fujian is different from that in northern Fujian. Although the allocation is the same on the surface, the actual difference is very large. Because half a catty of salt per person can be replaced by soy sauce and shrimp paste in cities, it is not difficult. However, in rural areas, it relies solely on this half a catty of salt to maintain, and the amount of shortage must be considerable. The price of private salt is lower in the southern Fujian area, which is close to the salt fields. In northern Fujian, the price of salt is often more than 10 yuan. The people feel very difficult to maintain a non-bland diet. Currently, the provincial salt affairs authorities are aware of this and plan to increase the monthly salt sales to one catty per person on the Yong'an to Nanping line first. This is of course what the people hope for, and the people of the whole province hope that it can be spread to every corner of the province. Serious problems have arisen in domestic sales due to transportation. As for foreign sales, they are also often trapped in difficulties for the same reason. According to the statistics of 1941, more than 60,000 piculs of salt were sold abroad every month, supplying Jiangxi and Hunan provinces. There are three transportation routes, all of which are transported from Fujian Province to Jiangxi, and then transferred from Jiangxi to Hunan. The routes are from Yunxiao in southern Fujian via Guangdong to Jiangxi, from Changting in western Fujian to Ruijin in Jiangxi, and from Shaowu in northern Fujian to Guangze in Jiangxi. More than half of the route depends on land transportation. This situation not only increases the price of salt, but also reduces the amount of salt. After replacing automobile transportation with post transportation, although it is not subject to the restrictions of gasoline pressure cars, the time and effectiveness of transportation are more difficult. The production of salt has peak and off seasons, which makes the salt have a situation of not connecting the new with the old. These are all worth noting and studying. Due to environmental needs, the Fujian Provincial Salt Administration convened a production increase meeting in southern Fujian in September to discuss various issues related to increasing salt production. It is planned to increase the production to 6 million piculs next year, with more than half of it supplied to neighboring provinces. After the production increase meeting, a meeting was also held in Quanzhou to discuss issues such as transportation and smuggling prevention. The resolutions have been carried out in order. For the convenience of management and supervision, the Provincial Salt Affairs Bureau and the Audit Office have been moved from Gongchuan in Yong'an to Fuzhou. These all indicate that the provincial salt affairs authorities have started to rectify, which is worth the attention of the people. Of course, we cannot deny that there are still places in today's salt administration that need to be improved urgently. The salt quality is impure, and the auditors should bear the full responsibility. In terms of cities and villages, the need for salt between the two is very different, and its allocation should also be noted by us. As for the reduction of supply to neighboring provinces due to traffic problems, it seems that the refining of salt crystals to reduce weight is also worth studying and paying attention to. Fujian is a salt-producing province, and the people will not have to worry about eating bland food. However, the panic caused by insufficient salt has been widespread in rural areas. This is really worthy of the attention of those who manage salt affairs. (Sent on December 20, 1942)

### Military and Political Situation in French North Africa - British and American Personnel Are Quite Concerned

Stockholm, Sweden, 11th (Haitong News Agency) - London News, British Foreign Secretary Eden stated in the House of Commons yesterday when asked to report on the situation in North Africa that the Ministry of Foreign Affairs is currently working with the Intelligence Department to consider appropriate ways to inform the people of the political, economic, and social situation in North Africa. After the release of this information, the people can be given a clear understanding of the situation in North Africa.

Vichy, 10th (Havas News Agency) - The French official news agency recently issued a message stating that the military and political situation in French North Africa has aroused serious concern in British and American public opinion circles. The United States representative to North Africa, Murphy, and the United Kingdom representative to North Africa, Macmillan, recently held talks, resulting in the appointment of Peruton as the Governor-General of the separatist faction of French Algeria. Regarding this matter, according to various American newspapers, the United States State Department and the United Kingdom Foreign Office did not recommend it. The New York Forum Daily recounted that Secretary of State Hull had acknowledged that the State Department initially opposed Peruton's appointment to this position, but this proposal received strong support from Roosevelt, and thus became a reality. As for the situation in Tunisia, the number of Axis troops is large, and they also have the convenience of shortened transportation lines. The situation of the Allied forces is naturally difficult. The London newspapers commented on the intricate news of the new government's political steps from Morocco and Algiers, saying, "The measures taken in Morocco to oppose the French national revival movement seem to be much looser than the measures taken by the new government in Algiers." The London Observer published an editorial saying that since Churchill and Roosevelt met in Casablanca, and Tegor and Gilow shook hands, there have been no changes in the political situation in North Africa. Some political prisoners in North Africa have been released, but the number is less than a quarter of the political prisoners who are still in concentration camps. The United Kingdom's policy towards French North Africa follows the following four principles: (1) Military affairs take precedence over politics, (2) The United Kingdom does not want to interfere in any country's internal affairs, (3) It is necessary to cooperate with local officials anytime, anywhere, (4) Maintain the spirit of Anglo-American unity. These four points are just four of the most reasonable points, but even for this point, there is not much achievement, which is regrettable.

### North China Water Conservancy

Mobilizing 800,000 Workers to Dredge Waterways Along the Yellow River Bank

"Special Telegram from Tianjin" Due to the breach of the Yellow River during the Chongqing Army Incident, a new Yellow River emerged. In the North China region, especially the old Yellow River basin area, the reduction of underground water sources is gradually leading to desertification, making it necessary to divert the river northward. As an emergency measure in the North China agricultural production increase plan for the 32nd year of the Republic (1943), a waterway will be dredged from the Yellow River railway bridge on the old Beijing-Hankou Railway line to Xinxiang in the lower reaches, merging into the Wei River. This waterway will pass through the Nanyun Canal and be introduced into the Tianjin area, utilizing it for irrigation water for the downstream rice paddies of Tianjin. The outline has already been decided and is part of the recently announced agricultural production increase plan. The waterway should reach the Tianjin area no later than the beginning of June to provide irrigation for the downstream areas of Tianjin. Therefore, it is scheduled to start construction quickly in early February. The project extends 50 kilometers from the Yellow River bank to Xinxiang, is 17 meters wide and 1.80 meters deep. It will mobilize 10,000 workers daily, totaling 800,000 people. Currently, it is temporarily used for irrigation water for the rice paddies in the Tianjin area. A larger-scale water diversion project is under study, aiming to expand the water diversion route from the Yellow River in the future to provide irrigation for areas along the route.

### Spot and Futures Coal Black Market: Absolutely Prohibited, Relying on Connections to Disrupt Control Measures, Contacting All Parties to Thoroughly Eradicate

A letter from the Coal Association to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association states: "Regarding the control of non-controlled coal and the eradication of the black market, with the gradual completion of the control mechanism, and your cooperation in various aspects, the coordination of coal is gradually becoming smoother, and a clear and bright future is in sight. However, from a partial perspective, the

Black Market for Non-Controlled Coal Has Not Yet Disappeared

And there is a tendency to promote it. For example, recently, some of your fellow traders have been severely punished by the Shanghai Municipal Council for violating control measures, which is extremely worrying. The authorities specifically value this and have repeatedly discussed it with our association, seeking effective measures to achieve real improvement. However, the so-called non-controlled coal and the emergence of the black market each have their backers, and relying solely on the power of our association to eradicate them thoroughly is truly difficult. It is essential to mobilize the full power of your association and your fellow traders to make an all-out effort. The only simple and easy method is that your association and your fellow traders, regardless of the circumstances,

Are Not Allowed to Operate Without Permission

In non-controlled coal, or stop operating immediately. In short, (1) those belonging to the allocation mechanism who lack a sense of morality will not be allowed. (2) Those who lack a sense of morality will not be treated with leniency or care, and their allocation will be stopped immediately. Despite repeated orders, our association will contact the Shanghai Municipal Council police and other relevant parties to meet the authorities' expectations. We hope you will strictly supervise all your fellow traders and promptly stop operating non-controlled coal and all illegal transactions (except those specially permitted by the authorities). This is our sincere plea."

### Miscellaneous Grains Group Joint Office Modifies Soybean Allocation Rules

The Joint Office of the Miscellaneous Grains Group in this city has been ordered to handle the allocation of soybeans. The changes to the soybean allocation regulations have now been submitted to the authorities for approval as follows: Grocery stores and small retailers can only sell raw soybeans to the public and cannot process raw soybeans into cooked products for direct sale. In addition to the officially prescribed price in military scrip, 48 yuan and 50 cents per dan (unit of weight), retailers with storefronts are allowed to add one yuan of soybean price in military scrip per dan to compensate for the cost of returning empty bags. (2) Cooked food retailers, including soy sauce shops, distilleries, tofu shops, roasted goods shops, soy product shops, soy milk stalls, and bean sprout businesses, are processed foods that already have a profit margin and should not be treated the same as raw food merchants. They are not entitled to the one-yuan subsidy on the official price. They can only process raw soybeans into cooked food to sell to the public and cannot sell raw soybeans directly. If violations are found upon investigation, their allocation will be suspended and they will be appropriately punished. In addition to the gunny sacks made by the designated manufacturer, they are all printed with the designated logo, which has been requisitioned by the authorities. All sacks sold must be returned to the designated location unconditionally within one week for submission to the authorities for cancellation.

### Joint Fire Insurance Committee Formed, Premium Rates Agreed Upon, Operated by Insurance Associations

After the establishment of the Joint Fire Insurance Committee, the most difficult problem to solve, the "Agreed Insurance Rate," will be brought up for discussion.

### Second Batch of Affordable Flour in the Nanshi District Will Be Sold Soon

### Several Life Problems

— Yin Liang

Draft of a New Year's Group Gathering Discussion

Outline: (1) Great Capacity, Great Fortune. (2) The Lesser Self and the Greater Self. (3) Preserving Wealth is Not as Good as Not Being Wealthy: Enriching the Masses is the Only Way to Enrich Oneself. (4) A Steady Stream of Water Flows Forever; Abundance is Never Exhausted.

Because I oppose extravagant customs, my family has been celebrating New Year's and other festivals for over a decade just like any other day, without adding dishes or hosting guests. I don't visit people to offer New Year's greetings, and they don't come to my house to return the visits. I often say that every day is New Year's Eve for me, and also New Year's Day; because every day I cautiously settle the accounts of my spiritual and material gains and losses, and also happily chat and laugh with friends. When I first implemented this idea, some relatives and friends still found it "hard to avoid convention," but I stuck to my principle of no reciprocation, and eventually they stopped coming altogether. I understand that "not reciprocating" is "impolite." However, because I don't have gifts, I've saved my relatives and friends a lot of waste, and I myself have reduced a lot of financial and time expenses. This year, relatives and friends initiated a group gathering, taking advantage of the holiday to get together, drink a cup of tea, and talk about each other's insights. I wholeheartedly approve of this approach and think it's worth promoting, so I'm very happy to be asked to say a few words.

Today's topic was suggested by my mother. She thought that I have been considering the meaning of life a lot in recent years, and she believed that I must have some insights. However, to be honest, regarding research on the meaning of life, I am still just a primary school student. How easy it is for me to have any insights. Today, in front of all of you relatives and friends, I will simply report what I have learned, heard, and experienced, and I hope everyone will correct me.

(1) Great Capacity, Great Fortune

During the New Year, one should say auspicious words. I wish you all more fortune in the New Year. However, I would like to tell you a secret to having more fortune: If you want fortune, you must have great capacity.

The explanation of the word "fortune" is very abstract and general. The "Book of Rites: Sacrificial Rituals" says, "Fortune is completeness, and completeness is the name for preparedness. Being unimpeded in everything is called fortune." But in reality, where in the world is there a situation where everything goes smoothly without a single setback, and where in human society is there a life where everything goes as desired? Therefore, according to my understanding, the explanation of fortune is more focused on the spiritual aspect and less focused on the material aspect. People with great fortune naturally feel very happy in favorable circumstances, and they feel just as happy in adverse circumstances. In other words, spiritual joy is fortune, and fortune is spiritual joy.

The meaning of "capacity" is very clear. As the saying goes, "A prime minister's belly can hold a boat." It also says, "To be tolerant is to be human." It would be very good to use the word "tolerance" to explain the word "capacity". The character "容" (rong) means "to contain," and the character "量" (liang) means "quantity." A house can contain things, which is great. Air can contain everything, which is a large amount. As the saying goes, "A pot of water can hold a liter," which is the same idea.

Why can tolerant people have great fortune? Because tolerant people can contain everything, they can remain calm in both favorable and adverse circumstances. As the saying goes, "The sage's heart is like still water," and "One must be able to hold one's breath." Only those with "a heart like still water" can "hold their breath"; only those who "hold their breath" can obtain lasting spiritual joy. Those who cannot hold their breath will definitely blame heaven and others when faced with adversity, and those who blame heaven and others will definitely not feel happy spiritually. Therefore, capacity is the basis for great fortune.

A person's capacity is not something they are born with, and great capacity cannot be achieved overnight. It is achieved through many experiences, many insights, and accumulated over time. Therefore, even a wise man like Guan Zhong, Confucius still said, "Guan Zhong's capacity is small." However, there are two key points that can transform small capacity into great capacity, which I want to specifically discuss.

First, open up your horizons. We all know that those who are trapped in a small village are ignorant, have shallow knowledge, and have narrow minds. They consider themselves extraordinary and cannot be offended; when they encounter setbacks, they will beat their children and scold others. Why? Because their vision is limited to their small village. They are frogs in a well and do not know that outside the village there are towns, outside the towns there are cities, and beyond that there are countries, the world, and the entire universe. If their horizons could be expanded to be as large as the universe, they would know how insignificant they are, and they would naturally have the capacity to tolerate everything; they would naturally not take offense at anything that goes against their wishes; their knowledge would naturally be enlightened, and their minds would naturally be broad.

Second, focus on objectivity. Mencius said, "Arrow makers fear they will not injure people, while armor makers fear injuring people." He also said, "In years of plenty, the children of the rich are often lazy; in years of famine, the children of the poor are often violent." Both arrow makers and armor makers are artisans, but their purposes are different. The children of the rich and the children of the poor are both children, but their characters are different. Why? It is entirely due to the relationship with the objective environment. It turns out that human affairs in the world are all influenced by the objective environment, so we don't need to be happy or resentful; we should be tolerant. Lao Tzu said, "The sage is always good at saving people, so there are no abandoned people; he is always good at saving things, so there are no abandoned things." These are truly insightful words.

Third, understand the nature of things. Throughout history, from top to bottom and in all directions, countless people and countless things, on the surface, seem chaotic and complicated, but in fact, they all have a certain cyclical pattern. This pattern is what scientists and philosophers want to study. Those who study wireless electricity understand the relationship between electricity and magnetism; those who study sound films understand the relationship between light and sound; those who study physics understand the relationship between light and electricity; those who study life understand the principles of the cycle of change in human affairs. Buddhists say: birth, dwelling, change, and extinction. Just like plants, they sprout in spring, blossom and leaf in summer, and wither in autumn. If we understand this law, we can know that the changes in the whole world are all "inevitable and certain." There is no need to be angry, joyful, or hateful. Lao Tzu said, "The superior man is calm and at ease; the inferior man is always anxious." Only those who know the constant can be tolerant, and only those who are calm and at ease can be called superior men.

(2) The Lesser Self and the Greater Self

Those who study the philosophy of life mostly oppose this "self." Confucianism emphasizes self-restraint, Taoism emphasizes the absence of self, Buddhism emphasizes the removal of self, and Christianity emphasizes universal love. The basic concept is to eliminate this private "self."

Why oppose "self"? Why eliminate this private "self"? Because "self" is fundamentally sinful, and the disasters that arise from this sin can affect the entire world and all of humanity. Those who read European history know that the 18th century was the pivotal point of modern thought. The starting point of modern thought lies in the self-awareness of "self." From this time on, individualism raised its head, politics slowly transitioned to democracy, and economics used the banner of this democratic politics to transition to free capitalism. But what was the result? For one or two hundred years, we have only seen the struggle between "me" and "you," the oppression of "me" and "you," and the exploitation of "me" and "you."

You must know that when a person is born into this world, they do not know they have a self. By the time they know they have a self, there are already many "yous" and many "others" nurturing, protecting, and educating them. And they know they have a self, and at the same time, they know there is you and him. If a person is confined to a desolate island with no one else, no you, no him, then "I" cannot exist at all. I call this individual "self" the "lesser self"; I call the "you" and "him" outside of this "self" the "greater self." The greater self is part of the lesser self. There is the greater self first, then there is the lesser self. Without the greater self, the lesser self will also be fundamentally eliminated.

The scope of the greater self can be broad or narrow. In terms of a family, an individual is the lesser self, and the family is the greater self. In terms of a people, an individual is the lesser self, and the people are the greater self. In terms of a country, the ethnic groups and families are the lesser self, and the country is the greater self. In terms of the world, countries are the lesser self, and the world is the greater self. The more knowledgeable a person is, the larger the scope of the greater self. The farther a person's vision extends, the wider the scope of the greater self.

From the relationship between the greater self and the lesser self, we can discover the highest standard of morality. We can say that all behaviors that benefit the greater self are good and moral; all behaviors that harm the greater self are bad and immoral. Some things are beneficial to the greater self and also beneficial to the lesser self; of course, we should do them. Some things are beneficial to the greater self but harmful to the lesser self; we should also do them based on the standpoint of the greater self. At the same time, the wider the scope of the greater self, the higher the level of morality. Therefore, Buddhism's universal salvation of all living beings, Jesus's universal love, Confucianism's all under heaven are one family, the great harmony of the world, and Japan's "covering the eight corners and making them one roof" are all the highest standards of morality and ideals that everyone should have.

I just said that some things are beneficial to the greater self but harmful to the lesser self, and we should do them. Although that's what I said, the reality is not like that. Because things that are beneficial to the greater self will never harm the lesser self. Originally, the greater self is the lesser self, and the interests of the greater self are the interests of the lesser self. So, although on the surface it may seem harmful to the lesser self, in reality, if the greater self benefits, the lesser self will not be harmed. Lao Tzu said, "The more he does for others, the more he has; the more he gives to others, the more he possesses." As the saying goes, "Give others convenience, and you will have convenience yourself," which is the same idea.

(3) Preserving Wealth is Not as Good as Not Being Wealthy; Enriching the Masses is the Only Way to Enrich Oneself

Recently, I read Mr. Nie Yuntai's method of preserving wealth, and I felt a lot. Mr. Nie advised people not to be wealthy, and even further advised people to shift their thoughts from preserving wealth to enriching the masses. I think there are only two points to Mr. Nie's true meaning: first, preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy; second, enriching the masses is the only way to enrich oneself.

Wealth cannot be guarded forever. Lao Tzu said, "When gold and jade fill the hall, none can protect them." He also said, "Great hoards invite great loss." This is the theory, stated clearly and plainly. As for the facts, Mr. Nie said it even more clearly. The final conclusion is: "The wealthy people I have seen in recent decades have all declined in later generations; the prominent families of civil and military officials for the past sixty years have all declined, and their descendants have not prospered." Because private wealth is a kind of sin. Mr. Nie said, "Whether you are greedy for money or not is greatly related to a person's interests and happiness. Getting rich can create sin, while not being greedy for money can create blessings." Therefore, wealthy families are bound to become poor, just as the most wicked criminals cannot escape the law. Wealth does not have an absolute standard, and it is difficult to define wealth; however, wealth at least contains two meanings: first, having; and second, having more than enough. However, because you have, others will not have; because you have more than enough, others will not have enough. Furthermore, because a few people "have," many people "do not have"; because a few people "have more than enough," many people "do not have enough." This is a clear fact, so heaven must use the excess to make up for the deficiencies, so that there is a kind of invisible restriction in the world. Only those who are not wealthy will not be subject to this restriction. Therefore, Mr. Nie said, "Only those who are unwilling to get rich and advance can avoid disaster." Lin Zexu's ban on opium is the best example. He did not want to harm the people of the whole country for the sake of his personal wealth. After his death, his family had no savings, but his descendants continued to be scholars for generations, which shows that preserving wealth is not as good as not being wealthy.

But everyone is born with desires. Everyone wants to be permanently fed and clothed, live in a good house, and have good entertainment. How can we achieve this goal? I say, it's very simple. Only when everyone can be fed and clothed will you be able to be permanently fed and clothed; only when everyone can live in a good house and have good entertainment will you be able to permanently live in a good house and have good entertainment. Only the interests of the greater self are the permanent interests of the lesser self; the individual interests of the lesser self are not permanent. The Huayan Sutra says: "If you make all beings happy, you will make all Tathagatas happy." Mr. Nie said, "If you want to gain blessings, you must create more blessings for others." He also said, "Those who have extremely high positions and many opportunities to get rich, but are unwilling to get rich and are always thinking of helping others, will have the most prosperous and long-lasting descendants." Fan Zhongyan was unwilling to use the Southern Garden of Suzhou as his private garden, but donated it to become the school of Suzhou, so that the children of Suzhou could all study, and at the same time, his children could also study forever. This is the principle that Confucianism says, "It is better to enjoy happiness with others than to enjoy it alone. If the people are sufficient, with whom will the ruler be insufficient?" Looking at it in the current environment, it feels even more intimate and meaningful. It can be seen that we must first make everyone rich, so that individuals can enjoy the pleasure of wealth, so it is said: "Enriching the masses is the only way to enrich oneself."

(4) Finally, I would like to offer everyone a way to be a person. Zeng Guofan said, "In this chaotic world, even great wealth and high status cannot be maintained. Only diligence and frugality can last." What I mean by a steady stream of water is diligence; what I mean by abundance is never exhausted is frugality.

Those who have been to Tiantai and Yandang and seen the waterfalls can appreciate their greatness. Those who have been to Haining and seen the autumn tides can appreciate their magnificence. Those who have been to Hangzhou and seen the Eighteen Streams of Nine Creeks can appreciate their charm. However, the water of the waterfalls sometimes dries up. When the water dries up, the waterfalls can no longer be great; the autumn tides of Haining are the largest on the eighteenth day of the eighth lunar month, and are not magnificent at other times; only the small streams of the Eighteen Streams of Nine Creeks permanently retain their charm, day and night.

When I was a child, I recited the two lines, "When the mountains and rivers are heavy, one doubts there is no road; the willows are dark, and the flowers are bright, and another village appears," but I couldn't imagine what kind of joy it would bring. Later, whenever I climbed mountains, I often encountered such a scene, and I felt an indescribable joy in my heart, and I finally understood the meaning of the poem. Therefore, I don't linger over the mountain scenery that is clear at a glance; I wander back and forth among the looming mountain peaks, unable to leave. Why? Because one is exhaustible, and one is inexhaustible.

The loveliness of a steady stream of water lies in its long flow; the reason why it can flow long is because its water is fine. Everyone knows that being a person requires diligence, not just a burst of diligence, but permanent diligence. For example, when climbing a mountain, if you walk very fast at once, then you will definitely be exhausted halfway up the mountain and unable to move; those who know how to climb a mountain always walk up step by step, slowly, and they will not feel tired when they reach the top of the mountain. The same is true for climbing a mountain, the same is true for reading, and the same is true for being a person. Zhuge Liang said, "Tranquility leads to far," only those who are tranquil can reach far, so the effort of the word diligence lies in the steady stream of water.

Everyone knows that being a person requires frugality, and most people refer to money, but in fact, we must be frugal in spirit, body, and money. For example, when playing football, those who don't know how will run around on the field, and before the first half is over, they will be panting like a cow and unable to continue. Those who know how to play football will never overexert themselves. They will just quietly guard their feet and kick until the end of the game, still looking calm and collected, with energy to spare. For example, when singing opera, the preciousness of Tan Xinpei is not that he sings "into the clouds" as soon as he comes on stage. He just cherishes his voice and sings slowly and with more energy, so that the audience, until the end of the performance, still has the impression of "lingering sound lingering" and leaving an impression of "abundance is never exhausted." Taoists say "If the spirit is too tired, it will be exhausted, and if the body is too tired, it will be exhausted." In fact. No matter what the matter is, the result of being too tired is always not lasting; only those who have "abundance is never exhausted" can avoid being exhausted and can last for a long time, so the effort of the word frugality lies in "abundance is never exhausted."

I have said many rambling words, so I will stop here. I hope everyone will give me advice and wish everyone a happy New Year!

### Smuggling Suppression Work Effective; Smuggling Gradually Declines; Two Cases Seized in the Tenth Batch

In order to resolutely prevent the evil trend of smuggling and increase tax revenue, the Jianghai Customs has been working hard to suppress smuggling. In addition to ordering all of its tax police to strictly suppress smuggling, it is also rewarding all circles for reporting tips and dividing the proceeds from punishments as rewards. The progress has been very smooth. Yesterday, it was learned from the General Affairs Section of the Customs that since the Customs has been cracking down on smuggling, unscrupulous merchants have become wary and have no intention of continuing to smuggle goods. This situation is related to national tax revenue and is truly commendable. Here are the details of the tenth batch of smuggled goods seized and punished by the Customs: (1) 21 pieces of peanuts belonging to Fu Tingxiang, 11 bicycles. The goods were fined 5,976 yuan, and the transit tax was paid. The bicycles were confiscated. (2) 5 rolls of cotton cloth belonging to Tang Sanhe, all of which were confiscated.

### New Regulations for Bicycle Licenses in the Two Concessions

Starting today, the two concessions will implement new regulations for bicycle licenses. Henceforth, residents of both concessions who own bicycles must adhere to the newly established procedures when obtaining their licenses for this quarter.

Police to Handle Licensing Matters

To reduce bicycle theft, the authorities have transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Public Works Department and the French Municipal Council's tax offices to the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Department. Reportedly, the main reason for this measure is to make it easier for the police to investigate the activities of bicycle thieves.

Licensing Fee: 31 Yuan

Starting today, the police in both concessions have officially begun handling license issuance. Anyone who owns a bicycle and is unclear about the new regulations can directly inquire at the licensing offices at Fuzhou Road (International Settlement) and Avenue Dubail (French Concession) Central Police Station. The total licensing fee is 31 yuan, which includes all donation fees, license plate fees, and registration fees.

### Bicycle Owners Urged to Obtain Application Forms Soon to Avoid Problems

According to sources from the Public Works Department's Traffic Section, bicycle owners should obtain application forms between the 8th and 13th of this month. However, few people have visited the offices on Fourth Avenue, Gordon Road, and Rue Massenet to obtain these forms. As a result, obtaining a license may become problematic later on. All bicycle owners must quickly obtain the application forms within these few days to have their bicycles inspected, stamped, and licensed on the 15th of this month.

### Bicycle Registration Procedures in the City Area

To coordinate with the two concessions and prevent bicycle theft, the Public Utilities Bureau has issued the following regulations for bicycle registration: (1) Bicycle registration should be based on the bicycle owner's evening parking address when applying for registration with the relevant authorities. (2) When applying for registration, bicycle owners should present their citizen ID card or residence permit for verification to ensure they are residents of the district before registration is approved. (3) A steel stamp number should be imprinted on the bicycle frame, seat, and sturdy area below the handlebars. The number should match the magnetic plate for easy verification. (4) A registration fee of five yuan and a magnetic plate fee of two yuan will be charged. The half-year bicycle tax remains at twenty-four yuan. If the bicycle ownership is transferred, a transfer fee of five yuan will be charged. The bureau has reportedly informed all offices and vehicle registration points to comply with these regulations, which will be implemented on February 15th. It has also been announced that residents living in the city area who mistakenly obtain licenses from the Special District will be severely punished. All bicycle owners are urged to pay close attention.

### Cooperation Between the Two Concessions to Ban Pufferfish

According to the English-language *North-China Daily News*, the heads of the health departments of the International Settlement and the French Concession, Yoshiaki Tashiro and Borde, jointly discussed preventing residents from being poisoned by eating pufferfish at the Public Works Department Health Office yesterday morning.

Close Attention to Fish Sources

This year, 50 people have died in the International Settlement from eating pufferfish. Yoshiaki Tashiro, head of the Public Works Department Health Office, reiterated to reporters yesterday, urging the public not to buy pufferfish from street vendors. Reportedly, the previous large-scale poisoning was due to vendors smuggling pufferfish during the New Year holiday. Tashiro stated that the pufferfish was transported from Wusong via Pudong to the Yangshupu district, leading to large numbers of workers purchasing it. The Public Works Department Health Office and the Central Fish Market authorities are now cooperating to closely monitor the sources of all fish.

Secret Sales Will Be Severely Punished

Reportedly, Health Office inspectors are conducting daily investigations in all areas where pufferfish might be secretly sold. Large quantities of pufferfish are often confiscated and destroyed from vendors and carriers. Since the Public Works Department Health Office banned the sale of pufferfish in the International Settlement, the routes for selling pufferfish have been cut off, so vendors are selling it elsewhere, transporting it to Shanghai. However, the authorities have decided to severely punish such violators. As for the secret sales locations, the authorities have learned about them from poisoned patients in hospitals.

Concession Authorities Cooperate to Ban

Yoshiaki Tashiro also revealed that no unfortunate incidents have occurred within the Suzhou Creek. The International Settlement Health Office is cooperating with the French Concession Health Office to ban the sale of pufferfish. He also pointed out that pufferfish must be thoroughly cleaned of its blood before cooking. Furthermore, according to Yangshupu Hospital, of the 107 workers poisoned by eating pufferfish during the Lunar New Year, 20 have died as of the day before yesterday, while the remaining 87 are in good condition. Although some are in critical condition, their lives may be spared. Borde of the French Municipal Council Health Office told a *Shanghai Evening Post and Mercury* reporter yesterday afternoon that the French authorities will cooperate with the Public Health Department of the International Settlement to prohibit the private sale of pufferfish. The French Concession has banned the sale of pufferfish in the past, so no cases of pufferfish poisoning have been found. In fact, the fish in the French Concession markets are transported from the Central China Fish Market. Therefore, after the fish market banned the sale of pufferfish, it became impossible to sell pufferfish in the French Concession markets.

### Uniform Standard of Hot Water Buckets in the City Area Must Be Completed Before Mid-Month; Non-Compliance Will Be Punished According to Law

The Hot Water Shop Guild of this city, in order to comply with the order to standardize the hot water buckets used by all businesses in the city area to a standard capacity of 1000 CC, has made arrangements to produce new hot water buckets. Starting in the latter part of last month, distribution to the relevant businesses in the four districts began. Many have gone to exchange their buckets in recent days, while others are still waiting to see. Yesterday, the guild announced that all new water buckets must be exchanged by the 15th of this month. If they are not exchanged within the stipulated time, the guild will report to the authorities, who will impose penalties in accordance with the law, including suspending operations for a few days as a warning. It is also understood that the guild is rushing to produce standard hot water buckets for the hot water shops in the two Special Districts. As soon as they are ready, a notice will be issued.

### Steles and Calligraphy (II)

— By Yun Jian Bai Jiao

In his essay "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy," he says:

"Ancient stone inscriptions record the merits of emperors or inscribe the virtues and positions of ministers to assist historical studies. Therefore, ancient calligraphers invariably entrusted their works to metal and stone to pass them on. The Qin inscriptions are clearly called 'metal and stone inscriptions.' The flourishing of stele inscriptions in the Former and Later Han Dynasties produced a plethora of calligraphers. During the Eastern Han Dynasty, mountains, rivers, temples, and tombs all had inscriptions carved in stone, which were most rule-abiding. Descending to the Western Jin and Northern Dynasties, the Han stele inscriptions in the Central Plains were well-established. Scholars admired them, imitating and studying them. When compiling the Books of Jin and the Southern and Northern Dynasties, they described famous calligraphers as being good at [Zhuanshu] seal script, cursive script, regular script, or semi-cursive script, but those who excelled in inscription calligraphy were the most respected. In those days, if one was not good at inscription calligraphy, one could not become a calligrapher.

Calligraphy began as signatures on silk scrolls (as seen in the *Shuowen Jiezi*). Later generations classified any small piece of paper that treasured calligraphy as calligraphy. The modelbooks in the imperial collection today are not stele inscriptions. This is because the Southern Dynasties prohibited carving inscriptions on stele inscriptions, resulting in very few stele inscriptions (as seen in the *Zhaoming Wenxuan*). Calligraphy was valued, completely transforming into regular, semi-cursive, and cursive scripts, without any remnants of ancient ideas. ...During the Eastern Jin Dynasty, folk reproductions of calligraphy were mostly done by artisans, and the writing style was still close to that of the inscription. This is quite different from the *Preface to the Orchid Pavilion Collection*, which could not be transformed by ordinary literati."

At the same time, he also said:

"Northern Dynasty stele characters have too many broken forms, especially because the characters are mixed with [Fenli] official script. During times of war, no one taught or studied, leading to confusion of the six scripts and local ignorance creating characters." - From "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy."

"The Northern Dynasty clans were simple and unadorned, not valuing elegance and sticking to old methods, rarely willing to be flexible. Only during times of chaos were their styles vulgar and lowly, ...with too many broken forms, which officials like Yan Zhitui and Jiang Shi corrected." - From "Categorization of Southern and Northern Calligraphy."

He also admits:

(Short scrolls allow for free expression, so calligraphy excels in this;

(2) Stele inscriptions have strict boundaries and profound calligraphy, so stele inscriptions have the advantage." - Both from "On Northern Steles and Southern Calligraphy."

It can be seen that his discussion on the strengths and weaknesses of steles and calligraphy is very open-minded. However, looking at these two articles, his theory of dividing into southern and northern schools, whether from a geographical perspective or from the perspective of individual people, his systematic explanation is not satisfactory, and in fact, it is impossible to make it satisfactory, and it will only become more and more confusing. Because the division of regions and people, and the division of the calligraphy styles of various families, to be able to clearly divide north and south, the difficulty or impossibility is just about the same as the division of north and south schools or a certain school or a certain school in other academic aspects. I can't help but try to talk about the topic of stele inscriptions and calligraphy itself. For example, taking Yan Lugong's works, Family Temple Stele, Magu Xiantan Ji, Yan Qinli, etc. are stele inscriptions; General Pei's Stele of Contending for Seats, Sacrificial Stele Draft, Three Memorials, etc. are calligraphy. In terms of people, he is from Shandong and belongs to the Northern School. In terms of writing style, his characters are close to He Ming, which belongs to the Southern School. Now, let's ignore Lugong for the moment, and just look at Zhong, Wang, Ou, and Chu in Ruan's two articles. Isn't his division already quite difficult to arrange properly? As for him saying that the unification of calligraphy is due to the emperors' love for it, that is only one side of the story. - This reason will be discussed in detail below. - After Ruan started the trend, Bao and Kang simply erected the banner of "Respecting Steles and Disdaining Calligraphy," honoring Wei and Tang dynasties. Although they respected Ruan, they had already changed their tune! Their scholarship was mediocre, their attitude was very extreme, and their rhetoric could not be established with sincerity. They liked to use their own ideas to make claims, and many of those they liked were hated by good people, and those they hated were liked by bad people. They ultimately wanted to compare the characters of stonemasons and potters to Zhong and Wang, just as Shen Bo's discussion liked to make source theories of who came from whom, which seemed to trace back to the source, but was actually lacking in historical knowledge and absurd in judgment: Changsu praised even the most infamous images, such as the stele of Qi Bei Junxiu Luo and the stele of the Sui Dynasty Ashina Duzan, as wonderful, while also deeply criticizing the Yutian Wang type in the Longmen Twenty Items, all of which are biased arguments!

Why is it said that Bao and Kang's greatest argument for suppressing calligraphy is to follow Ruan? What did Ruan say? In his theory of Southern and Northern Calligraphy, there is a passage:

"The Song calligraphy has been re-engraved many times and cannot be traced back. The seals of Han emperors and Qin ministers are all falsely created. How can the calligraphy of Zhong, Wang, and Xie be like the original stone inscriptions of the various stele inscriptions of the present dynasty!"

Originally, the human psychology of disliking the old and liking the new is something that people of ancient and modern times may not be immune to: the attitude of trusting hearsay instead of seeing for oneself is also the same for people of ancient and modern times who are unwilling to use their eyes and brains. Therefore, if something is indeed a research-based text, people will regard it as an ironclad case. Ruan's two major articles, presumably, Shen Bo and Changsu only read the above few sentences, and were suddenly struck by inspiration, and then became curious and used their own minds to vigorously promote and swear to like it; and later generations regarded it as a conclusion. In fact, regarding the fallacies of the imperial calligraphy, Qia Tie, such as Song Huang Bosi, had a Stele Engraving of the Imperial Calligraphy, and Qing Liang Shanzhou had a Chunhua Secret Stele Examination and Correction, all of which were before Ruan, and Ruan had certainly already read them. As for the stele inscriptions being used to collect materials, it was originally the same situation as the calligraphy. And the good or bad of the collection is something that both those who collect calligraphy and those who study stele inscriptions pay attention to.

Why is it said that Bao and Kang's rhetoric is not based on sincerity? Because they very much hope that you call people to learn stele inscriptions and learn souls, but when they describe where they have gained their strength, they are actually talking about calligraphy with great interest! - See the article on describing calligraphy (Shen Bo) and the article on describing learning (Chang Su) - Isn't that exactly what the saying goes, "slapping yourself in the face"?

In the past, when I read Shen Bo and Chang Su's writings, I wanted to write an article to correct them. Later, I saw that Zhu Dake had an article criticizing Bao Shenbo and Kang Changsu on calligraphy (Oriental Magazine, Volume 27, No. 2, Special Issue on Chinese Art), which can truly be said to have preempted my thoughts. That article really contributed to the study of calligraphy, and his arguments are very pertinent. The original text is quite long, so I won't quote it here. If you are studying this issue, it is a very good reference material.

I generally agree with Ruan's views on the stele inscriptions and calligraphy themselves. Because I can't help but think that when learning calligraphy, we should know the shortcomings of calligraphy; when learning stele inscriptions, we should also understand the shortcomings of stele inscriptions. Take the strengths of stele inscriptions to make up for the shortcomings of calligraphy; take the strengths of calligraphy to make up for the shortcomings of stele inscriptions, that is exactly the spirit that scholars should have! Regarding the comparison between the two, I think that:

A. The intrinsic value of stele inscriptions and calligraphy cannot be judged solely on whether they are directly inscribed on stone or not. Original carvings and early rubbings, whether stele inscriptions or calligraphy, are equally valuable.

B. It is hard to believe that stele inscriptions, carved on stone, can be hammered and chiseled by stonemasons without losing any of the original calligraphy.

C. The better re-engraved copies of calligraphy still retain their original form, but many of the original carvings of steles in the imperial court, whether the calligraphy is by a calligrapher or by a stonemason who is not very literate.

### Government Bonds Suddenly Rebound After Frequent Declines

The market for government bonds suddenly changed very quickly and significantly yesterday. Initially, the decline was very sharp, with Type C breaking the 70-yuan mark, seeing a minimum price of 68 yuan. After entering this level, after 11:30 AM, a rebound suddenly occurred, and all bonds rose in a straight line. Type C broke through the 70-yuan mark again, seeing a high price of 50 cents, and it was not easy to buy in. Since the market price has turned red, it has fallen for three consecutive days, with a difference of seven or eight yuan between the high and low prices. The rebound was expected, as the floating supply had been exhausted, and the selling pressure had fallen sharply. Finally, several capitalists absorbed a large amount, and the price soared extremely sharply. After one rise and one fall, the buying side was ultimately strong. If the sellers replenish again today, we will see new market prices again. For other types, the small price for Type B was 5.5 yuan, and the final price was 7 yuan. Type D had the clearest trading, with a price of only 65.5 yuan, making it the lowest-priced and most cost-effective type in the entire bond market. The lowest for [illegible] was 6 yuan, and the final price was [illegible] yuan. The differences between the various competitions were significant, and today they should level out. The trend is due to the rise in popularity, and should continue to rise.

### We Need Enthusiasm!

— Yuan Tao

Recently, to save coal, I often wash my face with cold water. But when the weather is too cold, I occasionally use some hot water—this has almost become a habit for me. However, even though the habit has been formed, my facial nerves' ability to distinguish between "cold" and "hot" remains, not numbed in the slightest. So, every morning, taking a hot face that's just emerged from the warm quilt and suddenly putting it up against cold water that's almost freezing—its unwelcome reception by the facial nerves is a matter of course.

Conversely, if the water I use to wash my face is steaming hot, though it's only a small amount, it often creates a feeling of "mutual enhancement" when it comes into contact with my hot face. But if the water's heat is lukewarm, warmer than the surrounding air but far less warm than my own face—washing my face at that time also feels quite uninteresting to me.

When people become worldly, facing a cold face with a hot face is such a thing that makes one come full of enthusiasm, but I make them leave disappointed and cold. This is not only unkind but also borders on cruel. Therefore, all those who are kind and good at adapting, even if they cannot always be "responsive to every request" and make everyone leave satisfied, at the very least, they can surely emit some enthusiasm, which is extremely needed by the other party, from their warm heart, so that the other party's eagerly expecting heart can at least receive some warm comfort and guidance, and not return frozen.

Interpersonal relationships cannot lack a certain element: enthusiasm. Enthusiasm is like a warm air, as lovely as winter sunshine. With it, humans will not feel coldness, but a feeling of harmony like spring.

I remember a foreign film called "The Cold-Faced Man." Fortunately, it was a comedy, making people laugh it off. If there really were such people in the world, it would be such a disappointing thing! Because cold-faced people in the world are like unnecessary cold air ducts, constantly spreading their cold air to the world, causing a terrible freezing effect in human society. On the contrary, what we need are enthusiastic and striving people, harmonious people, and people who always smile, because only they can turn a cold society into a warm one.

### Michelangelo's Project One of the Letters of the World-Renowned Artist

— Translated by Gu Xin

Because Michelangelo Buonarroti (Aliehelmmgolo Buonarroli) was born in 1475. His paintings and sculptures possessed bold creativity and flawless technique, so he enjoyed fame at the age of twenty-one. When Pope Julius II summoned him to Rome, he was a ruthless and politically ambitious man who did not yet have a great understanding of art, but he knew what he wanted. At this time, he was summoned to build a tomb, a tomb befitting his status. The proposed plan resulted in "the tragedy of the tomb," which lasted for forty years. All his designs were large-scale, with the main building being three stories high, and there were forty bronze reliefs and marble statues.

It is said that the Pope would have demolished the meeting hall of St. Peter's Basilica to accommodate this huge building. However, things did not go smoothly. The Pope's leading architect, Bramante, wanted to replace Michelangelo with his own nephew Raphael, so he slandered the Florentine Michelangelo to the Pope. Michelangelo's dignity and pride were no less than the Pope's, so in a fit of anger, he fled back to Florence. The following letter is one he wrote to Giuliano (Pope’s other architect), in response to the Pope's summons for him to return and complete the tomb.

"...It will be a peerless project..."

Text Giuliano, a great master, the Pope's architect

Giuliano, I know from your letter that the Pope is angry about my departure and is willing for me to freely use money to complete the project we agreed upon; I also know that I can come back without fear of anything.

Regarding my departure, I can tell you the following facts: on Holy Saturday before Easter, I heard him talking to a jeweler about a court official, saying that he was unwilling to spend another penny on stone. This shocked me greatly. However, before I left, I still asked him for some money to continue working. He replied, telling me to go again on Monday: I went for four consecutive days—Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday—but he didn't see me. Finally, on Friday morning, I was asked to leave, that is, I was expelled! The person who asked me to leave said that he recognized who I was, but these were his orders. Therefore, having heard those words on Saturday and receiving such treatment in the following days, I lost all hope. However, this alone is not the entire reason for my departure. There is another reason, but I am unwilling to write it here; it is enough to make me think that if I had stayed in Rome, my own tomb might have been prepared before the Pope's tomb. That is the reason for my sudden departure.

Now you are writing to me on behalf of the Pope, and of course you will read this letter to the Pope. Please let His Holiness know... If he wants his tomb completed, it is best that he does not continue to anger me or ask me how far my work has progressed. I will always abide by my promise and complete this project within five years, on the burial site he has chosen, which is inside St. Peter's Basilica, and it will definitely become a beautiful project as I promised. Because I am certain that if this project is completed, it will be a peerless project.

If His Holiness wants to continue, please have the agreed-upon money handed over to a person in Florence, whose name I will tell you. ...Regarding the money and the project mentioned earlier, I am willing to follow His Holiness's guidance, and I can also provide him with any guarantees he requires in Florence. It is best that things are done the way they should be, and I can give him complete guarantees, even if the guarantee is the entirety of Florence. However, there is one more thing I must mention: the project may not succeed if it is carried out in Rome, but it can succeed here, because there are oaths and advantages here that Rome does not have. ...I ask you to give me a reply as soon as possible. Besides, there is nothing else to say.

Your Michelangelo

Sculptor, in Florence

May 2, 1506

Aftermath: The Pope issued three edicts and threatened to wage war against the Republic of Florence, only then did Michelangelo return to Rome. However, upon his return, he was not allowed to continue working on the tomb. After some trivial work, he was ordered to decorate the ceiling of the Sistine Chapel. For four years, he was virtually a prisoner, bravely carrying out that arduous labor, lying on his back high up, amid "the disturbances of mankind," exhausting the creation of the universe and the fall of man.

A year later, Julius II passed away. His inadequate successors and the succeeding Popes also interfered with Michelangelo, forcing him to change the plan of the tomb five times. The only result of forty years of efforts to fulfill the contract was the heroic statue of Moses; Craven once said that in this work, there was "the anger of forty years of bankruptcy and contraction, in which the artist's vision and the boundaries of reality collided and harmonized." Finally, the contract itself was destroyed by Pope Paul III, who ordered Michelangelo to paint "The Last Judgment" on the walls of the Sistine Chapel—many critics consider this painting "the greatest project completed by a single hand since the dawn of humanity."

### Reading and Self-Cultivation

— Cheng Fu

We know that reading can not only increase knowledge but also cultivate virtue. Self-cultivation and doing things originally need to be honed in practice, not by relying on reading, but the words and deeds of the past seen in books can at least give us good stimulation, inspiration, and confirmation. This kind of help is really beneficial and indispensable.

What modern young people should pay special attention to is:

(1) We are born in this turbid society, and the temptations from the outside world are so strong. How can we keep ourselves from falling?

(2) Life in the world is always inevitable to have worries and suffering. When this kind of situation comes to us, how can we get spiritual comfort and avoid depression?

(3) If we want to accomplish a career or learning, we must go through many twists and turns. How can we keep our minds clear and continue our energy?

I think these three items are the most important turning points for self-cultivation. This kind of self-cultivation needs to rely on actual practice. If there is no preparation beforehand, then where can we start when things come to a head? There are only two kinds of preparations: one is the reminders and supervision of good teachers and helpful friends, and the other is the long-term immersion in the words and deeds of the past. Good teachers and helpful friends are more desirable than attainable, and the words and deeds of the past exist in books for us to pick up at any time. The greatest function and greatest benefit of reading on self-cultivation lies here.

The best materials for self-cultivation are reading biographies and letters of famous people. When reading biographies of famous people, it is not necessary to read them as history. You can specialize in reading them as self-cultivation books, see how they behave, how they do things, and how they pursue learning, and imagine what I would do if I were in his position. What would I do when faced with difficult things? We often use this kind of effort, which can not only hone virtue but also develop talent and wisdom. The predecessors' discussions on the benefits of reading history mostly focus on this point.

It is best to read the letters of famous people and their discussions with friends on daily matters and learning. Reading them is most beneficial to people's minds. If we can concentrate on reading letters exclusively, it will be very beneficial and interesting.

The reading methods mentioned above all take helping self-cultivation and doing things as their purpose. Confucius said: "Ancient scholars studied for themselves." Reading this kind of book is mainly for the purpose of directly benefiting themselves. Only by training oneself well can one truly be beneficial to society.

### Brief News

The Yi Guang Theater Troupe, which performs at the Lyceum Theatre, has been established for a short time, but its performance is getting better day by day. Recently, there have been rumors that the troupe will cooperate with the Zhong Zhong Theater Troupe, but the troupe authorities have strictly denied this. Cooperation is often a rumor.

The Shanghai Conservatory of Music serves the community solely by performing authentic Western music. It is scheduled to hold its first chamber music concert on the 14th at the Dumei Grand Theater. The program has five items, all of which are orchestral performances, and Miss Man's cello solo and Mr. Guo Ji's violin solo. No tickets are sold, and it is completely free.

"Not the you I know—just like the you now. That's the important thing. In my mind, you will never grow up. Never. For example, when someone talks to me about our respected chairman of the board, I will think to myself, oh yes, a cheerful little boy, with his hair sticking straight up—absolutely unable to understand what the difference is between a noun and an adjective." (Loud laughter) "Uh, uh, I definitely can't say any more— humph, I could talk all night. Please think of me sometimes, I will definitely be thinking of you. Hsec olim meminisse juvabit. I still don't need to say any more." Much laughter, shouting, and prolonged cheers.

August 1913. Chips went to Wiesbaden to seek treatment, living in the room of a German teacher named Staefel, who was thirty years younger than him, but the two got along very well. In September, when the semester began, Chips returned and lived in Mrs. Wickett's house. He felt much stronger and more useful after the vacation, and he almost regretted his resignation. However, there were still many things he wanted to do. He invited all the former students to have tea. He paid attention to all the important matches on the Brookfield sports field. Once a semester, he dined with the principal and once with the teachers. He took on the preparation and editing work for the new "Brookfield Outlook." He accepted the position of chairman of the "Old Boys' Club" and often went to London to dine. He also occasionally wrote articles for Brookfield's regular magazine, which was full of jokes and Latin idioms. He read the "Times" newspaper every morning—reading it very thoroughly, and he also began to read detective novels—he had been addicted to them ever since Sherlock Holmes first appeared and caused a sensation. At that time, he was busy and happy.

A year later, in 1914, he attended the end-of-semester banquet again. This time, there was a lot of talk about war—the civil war in Ulster, and the dispute between Austria and Serbia. Staefel was leaving for Germany tomorrow and told Chips that he thought the Balkan events would not lead to anything. (33)
