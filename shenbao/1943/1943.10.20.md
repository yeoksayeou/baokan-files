### Actively Promote the Education and Care of Homeless Children

In this city, homeless children are a sight that meets the eye everywhere. Because these children are deprived of education and care, the strong among them become petty thieves, and the weak become beggars. Moreover, they are covered in filth, wandering the streets, which greatly affects the appearance of the city. There are many charitable organizations in this city, such as those for nurturing infants and caring for the young, but they only focus on the adoption of poor children and have not extended to the accommodation and education of homeless children. However, due to limited manpower and resources, or insufficient funds, they have been unable to carry out large-scale clean-up operations. In addition, the lack of communication between the various organizations has prevented them from fully maximizing the efficiency of the overall accommodation and education efforts.

Since the handover of the concessions on August 1st, more than two months have passed. There are not many things about the inside and outside of Shanghai that have changed from the past and are worthy of praise. Taking the matter of homeless children on the streets as an example, the accommodation and education of these children has the positive significance of cultivating the nation, not to mention the fact that the municipal authorities should also find ways to accommodate them, rather than letting them fend for themselves, simply because they obstruct the appearance of the city. Moreover, as the weather gradually turns cold, these homeless children are sleeping on the streets, without clothes or food, suffering from both cold and hunger. Even out of compassion, we should find ways to accommodate them. Therefore, it is our deep hope that the municipal authorities will, for the sake of tidying up the city's appearance, quickly plan to accommodate homeless children on the streets, and regard it as the first act of good governance after the takeover of the concessions, which is not an overstatement.

The Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association is a non-governmental organization dedicated to promoting the welfare of citizens. According to reports, at its winter members' meeting on the 16th, the association suggested "joining hands with charitable organizations to raise funds to accommodate homeless children on the streets," and immediately established a "Homeless Children Education and Care Committee" to take charge of the work. We immediately voiced our strong support in the editorial on the 17th, hoping that the association would actively promote this work, and offered three suggestions. We have learned that the Homeless Children Education and Care Committee held its first preparatory meeting yesterday and decided on several implementation methods. (All can be found in today's newspaper.) We express our deep admiration for the association's attention to this matter and its rapid action. Regarding the various points discussed and decided, we would like to express our humble opinions as follows:

(1) Homeless children are innocent people who have lost the love and protection of their parents, but their innocence and intelligence are no different from those of ordinary children. They can be nurtured into adults and become members of the future society. Therefore, the responsibility for educating and caring for these homeless children should be borne by society. At present, the combined strength of the existing infant-nurturing and youth-caring organizations is not enough to shoulder this heavy responsibility. Therefore, it is extremely necessary to establish another organization with greater strength to shoulder this entire responsibility. However, the original organizations have experience in handling these matters, and in order to avoid duplication and waste of work, they should be contacted to work together. As for the location for education and care after accommodation, we suggest that rural areas are more suitable. Firstly, the cost of food, lodging, and general goods is low. Secondly, the customs are simple and honest, and the environment is beautiful. Thirdly, the air is fresh, which is beneficial to the children's health. Although it is difficult to build houses on a large scale due to the current material difficulties, vacant houses such as temples in rural areas can be used, which is easier than finding houses in Shanghai. Shanghai is only a temporary transition for accommodation. Once the rural areas are properly arranged, the children can be moved in.

(2) It is not easy to obtain accurate figures on how many homeless children there are in Shanghai. However, the age of the children to be accommodated should have appropriate distinctions and restrictions from adults. Most adult beggars have reasons for giving up on themselves and cannot be compared with innocent children. The association assumes that 5,000 people will be accommodated, divided into several batches. The first batch is 1,000 people. Of course, the number of 5,000 people is an assumption. In fact, there may be more than this number. However, if the handling is indeed successful, it will be easy to raise funds, and it can be handled in batches until the cleanup is completed.

(3) At the beginning of the operation, the most problematic issue is the raising of funds. The association assumes that the expenses for half a year will be 8 million yuan, raising 3 million yuan from all sectors of society, and hoping that the government will assist with 5 million yuan. Regarding this number, one cannot say that it is quite large, but in terms of the former, with the current economic capacity of the society, 3 million yuan is not difficult, but the focus lies in how society recognizes this initiative? How enthusiastic are they? In terms of the latter, of course, there is no major problem, but the focus also lies in how the authorities recognize this initiative? How determined are they? If society has awareness and enthusiasm, and the authorities have awareness and determination, then not only will it be easy to raise the current funds, but the results will definitely achieve satisfactory results. We hope that people from all walks of life will, based on the feelings of loving their own children, consider the innocence of these homeless children, look forward to them becoming the backbone of the country and society in the future, and do their best to contribute generously, so as to achieve the purpose of accommodation and education.

(4) Government agencies in charge of social welfare include the Ministry of Social Welfare at the central level and the Bureau of Social Welfare in Shanghai. It is within their scope of duty to accommodate and educate homeless children, and they should have taken the lead in planning and handling this matter long ago. Now that the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association has taken on this heavy responsibility and actively promoted it as a non-governmental organization, it is the government agencies' undeniable duty to fully assist and enhance the momentum of this initiative, without waiting for a request to do so. We hope that the relevant authorities will attach importance to the positive significance of educating and caring for homeless children and their own responsibilities, provide full assistance to the association's future funding, and provide strict guidance to the association's future work.

Finally, we believe that school-age children not only missing education but also missing care is a rare phenomenon in modern civilized countries. Our Shanghai is one of the largest cities in the country and also an international city. Whether the city's appearance is tidy or not is of great concern to international and domestic people. Moreover, after the takeover of the concessions, the city's administration is entirely in the hands of the Chinese people. The improvement or deterioration of the city's appearance is even more related to the entire face of the Chinese people. Therefore, purely for the sake of tidying up the city's appearance, the municipal authorities should pay active attention to this matter and strive for its success. Moreover, educating and caring for children also has the significance of cultivating the future lifeline of the country.

### Cabinet Officially Decides to Delegate Central Authority to Local Governments in a Thorough Reform of the Official System

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) In order to strengthen the domestic system and realize the administration of the decisive battle period, the Japanese government has carried out a major reform of the central administrative organs, and at the same time thoroughly delegated the powers and affairs of the central government offices to the local governments, in order to speed up administration. The Cabinet has actively formulated concrete plans, and has now achieved a consensus. After soliciting opinions at the Local Administration Cooperation Conference held on the 18th, the Cabinet formally decided on the 19th to submit various measures for streamlining and strengthening the local administrative organs for discussion at the regular Cabinet meeting, after exchanging opinions. The content of this matter has been released by the Information Bureau at 5 p.m. The significant expansion of local administration and the simplification of central administration, strengthening the speed of decisive battle administration, can be expected. In addition, the draft official system of the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has been finalized by the Legislative Bureau and submitted to the Cabinet meeting on the 19th for review. In addition, the proposals of the Cabinet and the Ministries of Foreign Affairs, Internal Affairs, and Finance, as well as the official system of the Air Defense and Water Department to be established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs, were also submitted to the Cabinet meeting yesterday for review. The Japanese government will consult the Privy Council on all of these matters. In addition, the Cabinet has also consulted the Privy Council on the reform of the official system and organs of the Ministry of Military Affairs, the Ministry of Transportation, and the Ministry of Communications. Therefore, the Japanese government's reform of the official system has been completely decided.

### The Philippines Begins to Expand the Internal Structure of the New Government While Strengthening Economic Cooperation with Japan

Manila, 19th (Central News Agency) In order to reorganize the internal and external administrative organs after the founding of the country, the Philippine government convened a special congress on the 18th, first creating a Planning Institute to strongly implement various domestic plans. It is also starting to expand and strengthen government organs. In addition to establishing a Ministry of Foreign Affairs, it is also planning to set up two or three separate ministries to promote wartime administration and promote smooth operations. At the same time, it will also decisively strengthen the lineup of various ministries. The internal structure of the new government is roughly as follows: The administrative organs of the independent Philippines were generally divided into six ministries, but after independence was renamed the Republic, it is expected that it will expand to at least nine or ten ministries. First, in terms of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, it is not known whether the Ministry of National Defense will be established. However, because the Philippine National Army has not yet been formed, it is expected that the Ministry of National Defense may not be established in the short term. Matters such as defending the country and maintaining domestic security will be temporarily placed under the jurisdiction of the Ministry of Internal Affairs before the Ministry of National Defense is established. Therefore, within the powers of the Ministry of Internal Affairs, the police force will definitely be strengthened. Furthermore, in terms of general administration, the lineup must also be greatly strengthened to strengthen the government's administrative power. The Ministry of Internal Affairs is the largest organization within the government, so it is expected that two vice ministers will be added to manage general administration and police affairs, in order to assist the Minister of Internal Affairs. It was also once proposed to establish a Ministry of National Defense. Before the National Army is formed, the Minister of Internal Affairs will concurrently serve as the minister, and one vice minister of Internal Affairs and one vice minister of National Defense will be appointed, with the former in charge of general administration and the latter in charge of police affairs, so that the National Defense Army can be easily formed. Next, it is expected that the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce and the Ministry of Education and Welfare will be reorganized. The Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce will be divided into two departments: Agriculture and Forestry, and Commerce and Industry. The Ministry of Education and Welfare will be divided into two departments: Education and Labor Welfare. Because the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has the important task of developing natural resources, and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry also has the important task of properly establishing a self-sufficient economy, it is necessary to have each as a ministry. In addition, the Ministry of Education also needs to be established as a separate ministry in order to cultivate the spirit of East Asia and serve as the foundation of an independent country. In addition, with regard to other ministries, it is expected that there will not be much difference from the administrative powers before independence.

Organization and Work of the Planning Institute

Manila, 19th (Central News Agency) At the parliament convened by Philippine President Laurel on the 18th, he first declared that the establishment of the Planning Institute was one of the ways to expand non-administrative organs, and decided to organize it in accordance with Administrative Order No. 1 of the same day. According to the administrative order, the nature of the Philippine Planning Institute is entirely an economic administrative center and a mother body for design, and its functions are as follows: Develop and utilize economic resources, rebuild the economic self-sufficiency system, and establish countermeasures to ensure the financial resources of the new government. Assist the President in adjusting important national policies or amending matters, reviewing various plans or various undertakings of the executive and legislative branches, and adjusting or correcting them. At the beginning of the establishment of this institution, it was temporarily called the Economic Review Council, and its main purpose was to focus on the first item, the comprehensive planning and establishment of the utilization and development of economic resources. The President of the Planning Institute may, when necessary, convene ministers, directors, and representatives of other government agencies to provide or submit information, and the President has issued a close order to various executive agencies to provide assistance. The position of President of the Planning Institute is currently temporarily held concurrently by the Minister of Agriculture and Forestry, while the Vice President is filled by Roxas. He once served as Minister of Finance and was the President of the National Economic Committee during the Matsu government, and was the planner of the current Philippine nationalist economic mechanism. On the committee side are Minister of Finance Aranas, civil engineering transportation expert Dou Si, and various authorities in the Philippine economic community, with the appearance of an economic staff headquarters. With the functioning of the Planning Institute, the Philippine national economic mechanism will definitely be significantly improved, and it is expected that not only the self-sufficient economic system will be prepared, but also economic cooperation with Japan will be significantly enhanced. Ambassador Kurusu

### Ambassador Kurusu Delivers a Public Speech

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) Japanese Ambassador Kurusu Saburo gave a public speech at Tokyo Imperial University on the afternoon of the 19th. The topic was "Criticizing the War Aims of Britain and the United States." He pointed out that the war aims of Britain and the United States were by no means to resolve the contradictions and chaotic state that caused this war, but to forcibly restore the pre-war order to the world in order to fulfill their ambition to dominate the world. He also exposed the conspiracy of Britain and the United States, "In order to cover up this ambition, Britain and the United States evaded the war aims and only engaged in empty talk about post-war issues." He then separately reviewed the post-war management theories of various countries, explaining that the great ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is purely based on the historical interdependence of the various nations of Greater East Asia, and is a rational order that meets the requirements of the environment. Finally, he solemnly stated, "The mission we bear is to achieve the goal of liberating East Asia and the East Asian nations working together to build the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and to further extend our happiness beyond the exclusive possession of the East Asian nations to the whole world, with the aim of jointly building a truly world peace." Thailand Celebrates the Reception of New Territories, Prime Minister's Residence Hosts Grand Banquet

### Thailand Celebrates the Reception of New Territories, Prime Minister's Residence Hosts Grand Banquet

Bangkok, 19th (Central News Agency) The four northern Malay states and the two southern states were completely transferred to Thailand on the 18th, the day Japan's military administration ended. Prime Minister Pibulsonggram held a grand reception at the Prime Minister's official residence at 4:30 p.m. on the 18th to celebrate this event, and invited Japanese officials and civilians, including Ambassador Tsubakami and the commander of a certain unit, as well as members of the Axis diplomatic corps.

As for judicial administration, it is under the jurisdiction of the Kien court.

### Chinese Front: Japanese Air Force War Results, U.S. Air Force Based in Chongqing Suffers Major Losses

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 p.m. on the 19th that the Imperial Army Air Force bombed the enemy's air power stationed in Chongqing, especially attacking a certain U.S. Air Force base, and bombed and destroyed enemy military facilities and ships, and crushed the enemy's attempts to attack. The combined war results from late July to early October are as follows: (Enemy Damage) 124 enemy planes shot down, 24 of which are unconfirmed. 17 enemy airports and military facilities bombed and destroyed, a total of 53 bombings. 7 enemy ships sunk, 11 destroyed. (Our Damage) 40 planes self-destructed. A Glimpse of the Army Air Force's War Results Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) According to military experts here: The situation of the Japanese Army Air Force operating on the Chinese front is that the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the Chongqing Air Force have 300+ aircraft on the front line. Recently, in order to echo the enemy's war in the southwest Pacific and the operation to retake Burma, they have been constantly bombing Japanese-occupied areas, disrupting the rear, and wanting to conduct air raids on Japan itself. At the same time, they have been preparing a certain base in the interior and building frontline bases such as Suichuan and Ji'an. However, the Japanese Army Air Force had already taken the initiative and repeatedly bombed the enemy's bases from late July to early October, destroying airport facilities and aircraft parked on the ground. They also engaged in fierce air combat with enemy aircraft, shooting down many of their fighters and repelling enemy aircraft that came to conduct air raids, inflicting heavy damage. During this period, Japanese aircraft destroyed a total of 124 enemy aircraft (24 of which have not been confirmed), destroyed 17 enemy airport military facilities, and bombed 53 times in total. Sunk and destroyed 18 enemy ships, completely crushing the enemy's attempt and completing the provincial task of defending the Japanese mainland. The content of its war results is recorded as follows: (Enemy Aircraft Shot Down) 12 B/24 bombers, 1 B2/5 (unconfirmed) fighter (P38) type 2 aircraft (1 of which is unconfirmed), (P40) type 94 aircraft (19 of which are unconfirmed), (P43) type 5 aircraft (1 of which is unconfirmed), and 1 aircraft of unknown type, a total of 115 aircraft. Destroyed Bombers (B24) type 8 aircraft, (P41) type 1 aircraft, a total of 9 aircraft. Destroyed Main Airports and Military Facilities, bombed Jian'ou 12 times, Hengyang 9 times, Guilin 4 times. Lingling 3 times, Baoji, Zhijiang, Wuzhou, Nanyixiong, Suichuan each 2 times, Chongqing, Yunnan, Ganzhou, Nanning, and Ji'an each 1 time. (Destroyed Wharf Facilities) Bombed Badong 2 times. Wanxian and Sandouping each 3 times. (Sunk and Destroyed Ships) Sunk 3 ships of 1,000 tons, 4 ships of 500 tons, destroyed 3 ships of 1,000 tons, 2 ships of 500 tons. 2 tanker ships, and many other small boats.

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) According to a certain Japanese military base, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing has been coveting Japan for more than a day, so in addition to Kunming as its base, it has also established intermediate bases in Guilin and Chongqing, and has also established forward bases in other places in an attempt to take the opportunity to raid the Japanese mainland and cut off the Japanese army's support routes. However, since July, their attempt has been crushed due to the continuous attacks on their bases by the Japanese Army Air Force. At the same time, due to the loss of a large number of aircraft and airmen, their strength has also been eliminated. Therefore, it has recently been reported that Stilwell and other leaders have flown to New Delhi, or are consulting with the Southeast Asian anti-Axis military command to reorganize the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and replenish personnel and equipment.

The U.S. Air Force Operates Independently

Moreover, Chongqing has witnessed the U.S. Air Force's disastrous defeat and is even more disappointed with it. They are increasingly pessimistic about the future of the war of resistance. According to Chongqing's hopes for the United States, the sixth is to supply aircraft and equipment to rebuild the Chongqing Air Force. However, the United States did not respond to Chongqing's request and sent its own air force to station in Chongqing, thereby seizing Chongqing's air power. Since then, the Chongqing army has only been responsible for building bases and performing ground service work, while the U.S. military has exclusively handled the operations and has not contacted the Chongqing Military Commission. In this way, Chongqing's face of independent resistance has been completely lost. When the U.S. Air Force first arrived, Chongqing expressed its welcome and provided the U.S. air force with all the conveniences for combat, such as building bases, communication facilities, and meteorological observation, with the Chongqing army undertaking all ground services, and military and civilians from all over the country mobilizing to provide thoughtful hospitality in order to establish goodwill. However, as a result, the U.S. Air Force never contacted the Chongqing army, which greatly disappointed Chongqing. The reason for this is not the secret operations of the U.S. Air Force, but the fact that they do not regard the Chongqing army as a true ally. To this day, the U.S. Air Force has never jointly operated with the Chongqing army and has not provided any assistance to the Chongqing army. For example, when Japanese aircraft attacked Guilin at the end of July, the U.S. Air Force abandoned the Chongqing Air Force and fled on its own. Such selfish behavior is even more obvious in their daily lives, so it has formed a target of resentment among military and civilians from all over Chongqing.

Severe Lack of Manpower Replacements

When various places in Chongqing are feeling the lack of food, the U.S. Air Force uses a large number of transport planes to transport food, cigarettes, and alcohol from India, but all of these are for their own enjoyment. When the plague was prevalent around Guilin, the U.S. Air Force stationed in Guilin only cared about its own safety and never cared about the Chongqing military and civilians. In addition, due to the arrogance and violence of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing, its military discipline has become even more chaotic. The prostitutes in Guilin, Kunming, and other places are almost exclusively patronized by U.S. Air Force soldiers. Their tyranny cannot be described in words. Recently, because they have repeatedly suffered defeats and there is a severe shortage of manpower, they have made Chinese airmen who have been trained in the United States join the team. However, these measures have further revealed their selfish nature. The working hours of Chinese airmen are much longer than those of Americans, but their salaries are only one-fifth of those of Americans. All aspects of food and accommodation are inferior to those of Americans, so the Chinese people's antipathy towards them has been increasing.

Lieutenant General Nakazono Dies Heroically

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 19th that Lieutenant General Nakazono Moritaka has been serving as the commander of the front-line air force since June of last year, commanding the Japanese Air Force stationed in Chongqing, curbing the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force's rash actions, crushing the enemy's ambition to conduct air raids on the Japanese mainland, and establishing special merits. Lieutenant General Nakazono died heroically in early September while fighting enemy aircraft in South China. In addition, the staff officers of the corps, Lieutenant Colonel Miyazawa Hiroya and Major Takada Masami, also died because they were on the same plane as the lieutenant general.

### Finance Minister Praises New Law: Handling Transactions of Italian Residents; Restoring Normalcy for Residents under New Government

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency) Regarding the suspension of transactions involving the Italian state, Italian individuals, and Italian legal entities, and the special regulations for Italian transactions, the Ministry of Finance has repeatedly issued notices for public awareness.

### Western Yunnan: Japanese Army Continues to Attack, Intense Battles Unfold

Lisbon, 19th (Central News Agency) A dispatch from Chongqing reported that the Japanese army is operating in the Gaoligong Mountains north of the Burma Road and has recently reached the Nujiang River bank about 80 kilometers southeast of Pianma. After continuously shelling the Chongqing army's positions near Liuku for two days, they moved to other locations. It is also reported that two units of the army are continuing their attacks in western Yunnan and are engaged in intense battles with the Chongqing army.

Fines for Police Violations Increased Fivefold

Nanjing, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The application of the Law on Penalties for Violations of Police Regulations is originally closely related to the Criminal Law. The penalties stipulated therein serve the same function as the penalties prescribed by the Criminal Law. Currently, the fines stipulated in the Criminal Law have already been increased fivefold, while the fines for violations of police regulations remain at one cent or more and fifteen yuan or less. This not only violates the principle of consistency with the Criminal Law, but also, under the current standard of living, this minor amount is difficult to achieve the effect of punishment. This is the first point that urgently needs to be revised. The Law on Penalties for Violations of Police Regulations stipulates that a fine of one yuan can be commuted to one day of detention, while the Criminal Law stipulates that one yuan or more and three yuan or less can be converted into one day of labor. A comparison of the two shows a clear imbalance. This is the second point that urgently needs to be revised. The food rations for detainees in various police agencies are used under the item of fines for violations of police regulations. Recently, the price of grain has risen daily, resulting in insufficient expenditures. This is the third point that urgently needs to be revised. At this police administration meeting of the Ministry of Interior Affairs, various provinces and cities raised proposals to increase the fines for violations of police regulations by five times in accordance with the wartime sentencing of fines, in order to meet the current needs. Based on the above reasons, the Ministry of Interior Affairs has specifically drafted temporary measures for wartime sentencing of fines for police violations and submitted them to the Executive Yuan meeting for decision. The 183rd meeting this morning has already approved them.

### The General Office for Rice and Grain Purchasing and Sales Terminates All Operations; Interview with Responsible Person of the Ministry of Food

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency dispatch) - All work of the Rice and Grain Control Committee is currently being actively promoted. However, the full-scale purchasing work has yet to be fully established due to the internal organization, so it still needs a little time. The pharmaceutical affairs of the General Office for Rice and Grain Purchasing and Sales of the Ministry of Food will be terminated by the 20th of this month. Therefore, all parties are particularly concerned about whether the distribution work of all parties will be interrupted during this transition period. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically visited the responsible person of the Ministry of Food yesterday to inquire about the Ministry's policy on the distribution of all parties during this transition period. According to him: The original agreement with the Rice and Grain Control Committee was that the conference would be responsible for the distribution of all parties starting in October. However, due to the cumbersome procedures, the preparations have not yet been completed, and the Ministry has been repeatedly requested to continue to maintain it. In addition, all parties are concerned and firmly advocate temporarily maintaining the status quo. For the sake of the overall situation, the Ministry will make preparations for the allocation and distribution, which has already been approved. The quantities include: Military and police rice until December; Rice for the citizens of Nanjing and Shanghai can be maintained until November; Each meeting city clearing unit to October; Rice for official residences and civil servants until November. The reason why the Ministry is allocating and distributing such quantities is to allow the Rice Control Committee to have ample time to make full preparations. However, since the original business closures have ended, we sincerely hope that the Rice Control Committee will start purchasing and continue the distribution as soon as possible to ensure that the food and military rations of the people are not interrupted.

### Intense Battles in the Dnieper River Basin; German Troops Still Firmly Defend Positions in Kremenets

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Berlin dispatch: The Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front has stagnated in the Dnieper River basin, and the war situation has changed in recent weeks. However, since the 15th, the Soviet army has launched a fierce attack in the Kremenets area, and the war situation has become tense again. According to the German authorities on the 16th, the intensity of the offensive has been unprecedented since the Soviet summer offensive. The offensive has lasted for three days, not only has it not weakened slightly, but it has become even more intense, and the progress of the situation deserves attention. According to the Soviet military's attack point, it is located in the area north of Chernihiv, the area south of Smolensk, and the area southeast of Velikiye Luki, especially the offensive in the Kremenets area is the most intense. At the moment, the Soviet army is continuously moving out of the bridgehead on the right bank of the Dnieper, and a large number of tanks and mechanized units are trying to break through the German positions, but according to the German authorities, their strategic breakthrough operation has not been successful. The current labor is, in the event that the Soviet army bypasses the rear south from the Kremenets area after the bend of the Dnieper River Bay, not only will the German army under Marshal Manstein in the south be caught in a difficult situation, but the German positions in the Crimean Peninsula will also be threatened. However, the German authorities believe that it is not yet time to express their opinions on the evolution of the battle situation in that area, so they are currently taking a very calm attitude. As far as the climate is concerned, it is now mid-October, and rain has been falling everywhere on the Eastern Front, but this is not the official arrival of winter, and the Soviet offensive cannot be stopped by this.

### Focus of Italian Theater Shifts to Central Mountain Region; German Delaying Tactics Effective

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Havas report: It was learned yesterday that the Berengeri troops continued to move to the southern front.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - A special correspondent for the German News Agency in the Mediterranean region said: The British and American military operations in southern Italy are now focused on dealing with the German front in the Apennine Mountains. The war activities on the two wings of the coast have gradually decreased on Sunday, apparently due to the extremely difficult transportation encountered by the enemy in this area. The German military's tactics in the past few weeks have made it virtually impossible for the British and American forces to use the north-south highway. These highways are almost completely damaged by mines or other explosives and are unsuitable for use, so the anti-Axis forces cannot advance rapidly. The characteristics of this strategy can be seen in the battle northeast of Capua at the entrance to the Apennine Mountains on Sunday. There, the British and American forces, especially near Gaster, tried to break through repeatedly, but were blocked, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. The German flat-shooting artillery and anti-aircraft artillery destroyed four British armored reconnaissance vehicles and three tanks. At the same time, the British and Canadian forces tried to open the highway from Fucha to Rome, but were also blocked by the German army. It was difficult for the enemy to seize a part of Bellano in the Apennine Mountains. However, when the German army carried out the bravest attack from the mountain head positions overlooking from near Bellano, the enemy was defeated, and several British and Canadian troops were cut off and captured. At the same time, several wounded enemy soldiers were also captured in the area.

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Havas military visitor Settoris said: The characteristics of the southern Italian events at the end of last week have not changed. The German army is still resisting the advancing enemy army with a delaying strategy with a small number of troops. Although the troops are small, they can often give the enemy a powerful blow. Northeast of Capua The enemy suffered heavy injuries under the German army's strategy. The German army's use of long-range artillery also contributed. The intensive artillery fire for several days finally prevented the enemy from deploying on the northern bank of the Volturno River. According to the German war report on the 17th, the German rearguard had withdrawn from the Volturno and Apennine Mountains, The troops withdrew northwest and north to Qunqia Tuolo and Ganpobasu. The progress of the British and American troops in the above two districts was only a few kilometers, and the losses were extremely heavy. The Allies are still encountering our army's confusing strategy and cannot see where General Kesselring will feel and where the main force will work. At the end of the week, the enemy was still greatly replenishing its troops. The US 5th Army had removed the troops on both wings of Qunqia Tuolo and devoted itself to the westward advance. However, since the transportation along the way had been destroyed, it was extremely difficult to transport heavy military equipment. Therefore, the British and American forces The two wings and the middle wing did not cross the mouth of the Fuliang Tuonuo River, namely the line of Kayer Caisailueto, Qunqia Tuolo, and Ganpobasu, and the war on the eastern wing remained unchanged.

### German Sweep in the Balkans Proceeds Smoothly

Berlin, 19th (Central News Agency dispatch) - Expanded German News Agency: In the past few days. The two major sweeping operations by the German army in the Balkan region south of the Danube River have proceeded smoothly and successfully. The purpose of this operation was to track down the guerrillas in the Farasgar Mountains. After the Cossack volunteers launched a fierce attack on the guerrillas, they had been driven away and 800 guerrillas were captured. On the battlefield, an equal number of bandits were also eliminated and many other war trophies were captured. According to reports, many of the bandits killed each other, and the Party and communists often had conflicts. This shows that the British are becoming less interested in Serbia as a country under the pressure of Moscow. Other sweeping operations in the Saluo Mountains of Slovakia are also continuing. The German army is working with the local guards to eliminate the enemy. The work is mostly imported at night. A hospital full of bandits and other secret armories full of military supplies have also been occupied. One bandit has taken advantage of the darkness to go unnoticed. In the search for the remains of 230 people, we escaped to the mountains and took the wounded bandits with them. There were 300 bodies on the battlefield and 1,800 prisoners, most of whom were seriously injured. The vehicles used to secretly transport party members were also captured.

Chairman's Address: Collective Effort

Respected officials, representatives, guests, and preparatory committee members: Today marks the meeting of the preparatory committee for the regional purchasing merchant associations of this committee. I am deeply grateful for the presence of all the officials, leaders of various agencies and organizations, and representatives from all sides, which demonstrates their enthusiasm for our committee. I am also pleased that all the preparatory committee members from the regional purchasing merchant associations, regardless of distance, have also attended, which demonstrates their commitment to their work. Since the beginning of preparations for this committee, four or five weeks have passed. During this time, we have received guidance from various parties and assistance from friendly officials and people from all walks of life. In particular, I am grateful for the presence of friendly officials who have traveled from afar. Furthermore, through the efforts of all the staff of this committee, the various important internal operations have finally begun to take shape. Most of the preparatory committee members of the regional purchasing merchant associations have undergone legal reviews and guarantee procedures and have been recognized as qualified by this committee. From now on, they will proceed according to the business accumulation stipulated by this committee. Therefore, we have specifically convened the regional preparatory committee members of this committee to gather, so that everyone can exchange opinions, connect with each other, and at the same time ask all the officials and representatives for guidance. Rice and grain are the source of life for the people, and as the saying goes, "Food is the people's heaven." Its importance is self-evident, especially at a time when the Greater East Asia War is actively unfolding. "Sufficient food and sufficient troops" are important conditions for establishing and protecting the country. This committee is entrusted by the central government and expected by the people of the whole country. On the one hand, it bears the responsibility of maintaining the people's food supply, and on the other hand, it has the responsibility of adapting to the wartime system. This dual responsibility is of utmost importance. I am of ordinary talent and shallow experience, and I am deeply afraid that I will not be able to fulfill this task. I hope that Chinese and foreign officials, leaders from all walks of life, and people from all sectors of society will provide long-term guidance and assistance. At the same time, I hope that all the preparatory committee members in the region will work together to share the responsibility of this committee. The first step is to "fulfill our duties," and the second step is to strive for excellent results, so as not to disappoint the government and the people. I sincerely look forward to the early success of this committee and the regional preparatory committees with a passionate heart.

Mayor's Instruction: Solve the People's Food Problem

Xu Shaoxiu, representing Mayor Chen, delivered instructions, saying: Today, the Grain Control Committee is convening a general meeting of the preparatory committee for regional purchasing trade associations. I am honored to represent Mayor Chen in attending and meeting with everyone. In view of the sound organization of past rice and grain purchases, the National Government has strengthened the procurement organization and established the Grain Control Committee to handle purchasing work. I believe that the people's food is the most important issue, and I hope that all preparatory committee members will work together under the assistance of the government, the Grain Control Committee, and friendly forces to achieve satisfactory results and solve the problem of military supplies and people's food. This is my hope for this conference.

Minister Tajiri Hopes for Cooperation

Okazaki, Counselor of the Japanese Embassy, representing Minister Tajiri, delivered a speech, saying: Today, I represent the Embassy to say a few words to you. The key to ensuring military and civilian food is the active purchase of rice and grain. The Chinese and Japanese governments have entrusted the Chamber of Commerce Control Committee to organize the "Rice and Grain Control Committee." The previous results of rice and grain purchases were not satisfactory. This time, the Grain Control Committee is responsible for breaking through the difficulties in purchasing. I hope that the Chinese and Japanese sides will work together to achieve good results in the purchase of rice and grain. I also hope that the rice and grain control mechanism can lead other control mechanisms. This is the main point of my hope today.

Lieutenant General Kinoshita Awaits the Grain Association

Lieutenant General Kinoshita, Commander of the Deng Unit, delivered a speech, saying: The total amount of production in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces is sufficient to supply both military and civilian needs, which has been generally confirmed. The food problem in Central China is definitely not due to insufficient rice production, but rather due to the poor management of past purchases and transportation, as pointed out by various sectors. Therefore, the success of solving the food problem depends entirely on the completion of the purchase and transportation tasks. This is what the military expects from the Grain Control Committee. The impediment to the efficiency of past rice purchases was the excess and profit of intermediaries, and the suppression of prices, which caused farmers to be unwilling to sell. This time, the Grain Control Committee will directly purchase from farmers and decide on fair prices for distribution. The fair and appropriate distribution to farmers, merchants, and consumers is a major determination for the future.

Major General Ota Expresses Hope

Major General Ota delivered a speech, saying: I hope that the staff of the Grain Control Committee and everyone will support this great work with morality. The military will provide as much assistance as possible. If difficulties arise, I hope that you will contact the military to complete the mission.

Speech by Unit Commander Takagi

The main points of the speech by Unit Commander Takagi: I am very pleased that the Rice and Grain Control Committee has been fully established and that procurement has begun under Chinese-Japanese cooperation. Since ancient times, there has been a saying that "when clothing and food are sufficient, people will know etiquette." Ensuring rice and grain is not only crucial for the stability of people's livelihoods and the progress of culture, but also an important undertaking to achieve the victory of the Greater East Asia War for lasting world peace. The complete solution to this problem is the greatest responsibility and the most honorable undertaking of the Rice Control Committee. Since this committee is established through Chinese-Japanese cooperation, its success will demonstrate the achievements of Chinese-Japanese cooperation and shared hardships. It is hoped that in the same region, both Chinese and Japanese parties will procure simultaneously and cooperate to overcome various difficulties and achieve the greatest results. In order to complete the rice procurement, it is necessary to obtain the assistance and cooperation of all relevant Chinese and Japanese agencies and units and to maintain close contact. Chinese and Japanese merchants should unite strongly and work hard under the guidance of the highly respected Chairman and Vice Chairman to complete the mission, so as to ensure the sound development of the Committee.

Director Chen Riping of the Economic Department Speaks

Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Department of the First District Administration, said: Today, officials from various agencies, friendly forces, members of the Grain Control Committee, and preparatory committee members from various exploration offices are all present. I am honored to be present at this meeting. Due to time constraints, I will not elaborate. My only hope is that everyone will step up their work, strive to purchase, and receive the assistance of friendly forces and military police to achieve a bright future.

Representative Thanks and Urges Continuous Supervision

Xiao Yicheng, representing the preparatory committee members from various regions, replied: Today, the preparatory committee members from the regional purchasing trade associations are holding a meeting in the main hall of this committee. We are honored to have officials and friendly guests present to provide guidance and give instructions. We are deeply moved by your words. In the future, we will follow the instructions of the officials and strive to implement them. However, the work of rice and grain purchasing is very heavy, and our strength is very weak. We hope that the officials will supervise us at any time and provide guidance so as to avoid failures.

### Teachers and Staff of 72 Municipal Elementary Schools Petition

In the past, the teachers and staff of the 72 municipal elementary schools in this city had extremely low salaries and high living expenses, making it difficult to maintain their livelihoods. They had previously requested assistance from the Municipal Education Bureau. The Education Bureau formulated a minimum standard for the treatment of teachers and staff in various elementary schools in June and July, with a teacher's monthly salary of 440 yuan, and submitted it to the Municipal Government for approval. At the beginning of this month, the Bureau received an order from the Municipal Government to increase the salary of teachers in various municipal elementary schools to 330 yuan, and the salaries of directors and principals were also increased accordingly. However, after only a few months, the cost of living has soared, making it still ineffective. Therefore, Director Lin of the Municipal Education Bureau is actively planning to improve the treatment of teachers and staff in various schools. The teachers and staff of the 72 elementary schools, who are already under pressure from their livelihoods, jointly dispatched a representative from the principals and a representative from the teachers and staff, a total of more than 100 people, and submitted a petition to the Education Bureau for assistance, requesting an increase in the treatment of teachers and staff and office expenses. Director Lin Jiongan of the Municipal Education Bureau received them at 9:00 AM yesterday, offered many words of comfort, and promised to forward the request to the Municipal Government and enact laws to improve treatment in order to maintain education.

### Prerequisites for Increased Production

Yesterday, it is the responsibility of the industrial sector to strive for the advancement of business and the increase of production, so as not to disappoint the expectations of investors. However, to seek an increase in production, it is necessary to solve the problem of raw materials for factory production; the raw materials for factory production are mostly agricultural products. In recent years, prices of all commodities have risen, and the cost of farming for farmers has also increased accordingly. The cost of agricultural products this year, according to the recent estimates of the China Economic Research Association, has increased up to three times more than last year. The livelihood of farmers depends entirely on the income from agricultural products for support. If the purchase price of agricultural products is excessively lowered, it will inevitably cause losses to farmers, thereby discouraging them from engaging in farming. The old saying "cheap grain hurts farmers" serves as clear evidence. Therefore, to increase production, it is necessary to first encourage the increase of agricultural products.

The most effective way to encourage agricultural production is to raise purchase prices. For commodities such as cotton and grain, procurement was once difficult due to excessively low prices. Recently, the authorities, recognizing this, have gradually increased the purchase prices of cotton and grain, both to show consideration for farmers and to facilitate procurement. This kind of nurturing policy is most appropriate.

In addition, there are two other things that can directly promote the increase of agricultural products. One is agricultural loans, with various banks organizing syndicates to carry out agricultural loan work. All aspects, such as improving seeds, purchasing fertilizers, and improving rural life, are promoted through agricultural loans. The second is land reclamation, which is promoted by the government and expanded in scope at any time and any place. For example, the recent initiative by the Construction Department to divide and cultivate farmland along the shores of Taihu Lake can be said to be an excellent policy direction. It provides direct assistance to the production increase movement.

### Various Trade Associations in the City Actively Develop Association Affairs; Reorganization and Consolidation Work is Ready

Various major and minor trade associations in this city have been reorganized by the relevant competent authorities since April of this year, with the aim of adapting the associations to the wartime system. The work of consolidating the associations began half a year ago. The major associations have already completed their reorganization, and the minor associations have also mostly completed their restructuring. It is estimated that there are about 300 trade associations in this city, and each association is now actively developing its affairs.

Strengthening Institutions

The evaluation committees established by various trade associations are dedicated to evaluating the prices of various commodities in their respective industries. In order to strengthen these institutions, the associations will not only have directors and supervisors of the associations serve on the committees, but will also invite experts in the industry to investigate the raw materials and costs of various commodities, and set fair price limits. To assist the evaluation committees in setting price limits, investigative teams will also be established, dispatching staff to secretly investigate whether stores and retail departments are complying with the price limits.

Purchasing Raw Materials

The raw materials needed by various industries were previously procured individually by each business from the producing areas. However, the control of material movement has been very strict recently, making procurement not only difficult but also causing substantial freight costs. Recognizing this, some associations will apply for assistance from the authorities to purchase raw materials in bulk from the producing areas for their members, transport them to Shanghai, and then distribute them to the individual members.

### Paint is a Major Commodity; Businesses Should Join the Trade Association

The Shanghai Special Municipality Chamber of Commerce recently received a report from the Coarse and Fine Paint and Sundry Goods Trade Association stating that since paints have been exempted from requiring permits for transportation within the three provinces and two cities, and sundry goods are not subject to control, a small number of businesses that do not need to move materials within the city believe that whether or not to join the association is irrelevant to their interests and are delaying joining. It asked how to correct this. The Chamber of Commerce for Trade and Industry sent a letter to the Commercial Control Council for a reply. According to a reporter's investigation, paints are included in chemical industrial products and have been classified as major commodities by the Ministry of Industry. According to Article 13, Paragraph 2 of the Provisional Regulations for Industrial and Commercial Trade Associations, companies and firms engaged in major commodities may not operate without joining the trade association. Trade associations should guide non-member businesses to join the association in accordance with the law, or report to the competent authority to order them to join the trade association in accordance with Paragraph 1 of the same article. The Commercial Control Council has sent this intention to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for handling.

### Egg Supply and Demand in this City; New Institutions Will Be Established; Strict Control Will Be Implemented

The price of eggs in this city once soared sharply. Upon investigation, the reason was actually due to the monopolization by unscrupulous merchants. It was found that the relevant authorities in this city had established specialized agencies for the control of eggs, but all aspects were not sufficiently strict. Therefore, unscrupulous egg merchants still had room to operate. The authorities believe that the rise in egg prices is of great concern to people's livelihoods, so they are paying close attention and are trying to suppress it. Recently, the First District Public Office has set price limits for various types of eggs, and retailers are absolutely not allowed to exceed the price limits, otherwise they will be severely punished. It is now learned that the authorities will not only regulate the price of eggs but will also strictly control the supply and demand aspects.

Controlling Buying and Selling

In order to make the control work effective, the authorities will establish a new control institution. Everything is still under consideration and research by the relevant people. This institution will implement reasonable and proper control over the import and market trading of eggs. In the future, all movement of eggs, whether moving them in or out, will require an egg transportation permit issued by the authorities.

Distribution Ratio

The demand for eggs in this city is very large, and the monthly import volume is very considerable. The import and distribution of eggs will be jointly undertaken by the Japanese and Chinese sides. The Japanese agency in charge is the Japanese Egg Industry Federation, and the Chinese agencies are the National Egg Industry Federation and the Shanghai Egg Industry Association. Regarding the distribution of eggs, the Japanese and Chinese sides will also follow a reasonable ratio. The Japanese side will account for about 60% of chicken eggs, and the Chinese side will account for 40%. For duck eggs, the Chinese side will account for 60%, and the Japanese side will account for 40%.

Translated Commentary

### Rice Appraisal and Food Production Increase

In peaceful areas, increasing food production is an important issue. Although the purchasing problem is also important under social conditions, the fundamental goal is to increase production. Only with excellent agricultural production can the food problem be fundamentally solved.

It was recently rumored that the Suzhou Rural Clearing Cooperative and the China Cooperative Guidance Committee convened a Rice Production Increase Appraisal Conference to encourage rice production increases. This is indeed a meaningful move, and its results are highly anticipated.

Of course, the problem of increasing food production cannot be solved by appraisal conferences alone. The fundamental requirement is the necessity of large-scale planned practice. The main purpose of the appraisal conference is to address the issue of variety improvement in the production increase policy. While improved varieties can certainly increase harvest yields, the fertilizer problem is also extremely important and cannot be ignored.

According to the research results of ordinary people, the characteristics of rice in Central China are quite similar to those in Japan. In the future, the rice production increase policy in Central China can refer to Japan's past experience as a basic direction for improvement.

Rice cultivation in Taiwan is currently very abundant. They have adopted two strategies: one is to switch from indica rice to japonica rice, and the other is to implement chemical fertilizers. According to their experience, fertilization has little effect on indica rice, while it is most suitable for japonica rice. Fortunately, the Qingxiang area in Central China is mostly a japonica rice area, so there is no need to change varieties, and the fertilizer policy can be implemented directly, which should achieve satisfactory results.

In addition, Nanjing has a large-scale chemical plant with production equipment and nearby pyrite mines, which are excellent conditions. Needless to say, the relevant parties should provide as much assistance as possible to develop them, so that the chemical fertilizer policy can be implemented. As a result, rice can increase dramatically, not only solving the food problem but also providing a solid foundation for the vast farming population. The agricultural policy can naturally be promoted smoothly. (From the Dalu Xinbao, October 16)

### German Army on the Eastern Front Adopts a War of Attrition

Currently, the German army is implementing a decisive and implicitly historical retreat operation on the Eastern Front. The operational front extends 1,300 kilometers from Dmitriev, north of Smolensk, along the Dnieper River to the Sea of Azov. Regarding whether the retreat operation, which has relied on the natural barrier of the Dnieper River for three months, is coming to an end, the German authorities are not making predictions, and the Soviet side is also taking a cautious attitude. In short, both armies have not been able to obtain a positive or negative conclusion on the outcome of the Dnieper River campaign from the current war situation, which is probably the current truth.

In fact, the battle situation of the Red Army's extra-large bridgeheads and the Dnieper River crossing operation is unprecedented in strategic locations such as Zaporozhye. The Red Army is determined to make a breakthrough near Kiev. However, while retreating, the German army repelled the Red Army's offensive, leaving deep trenches in various places on the east bank of the river, forming a tortuous battle line like a winding river. The Red Army, which occupied the strategic position of the , used the Red Army's bridgehead as a target and has been constantly waging fierce battles since September 28. It is rumored that the Red Army has successively reinforced seven infantry divisions in the Zaporozhye area.

Soviet Food Shortage

Following the German-Soviet war, we can first find that the so-called Soviet winter offensive and German summer operation formula has been completely broken, because the Soviet Union has already launched a full-scale offensive in the summer. This is primarily because the Soviet Union is eager to solve the food problem, and regaining Ukraine is essential. Secondly, it is feared that the Red Army's weapon production will not keep up with the speed of German production as the war drags on, so as soon as the good opportunity for the British and American landing arrives, it will launch a tragic decisive battle. In any case, the Soviet Union's approach of sparing no lives or materials and launching an all-out war has indeed surprised both friend and foe alike.

Now, from the Yelsk area, one can already hear the cry of, "Is it still potato soup today?" It is said that due to the shortage of bread, Soviet workers are gradually showing signs of fatigue and weakness. After repeated conscriptions, the factories have almost become a world of women. Not only that, even the front lines have seen the emergence of women's aviation regiments that have undergone one year of training.

Although the headquarters still implies today that German and German resources and resources are abundant, to encourage the world of public opinion to re-examine the nature of its non-European war, the Red Army's 180-degree turn in the summer offensive, if launched by the Soviet Union's already depleted war potential, then the judgment that the Eastern Front is facing an important milestone is not necessarily impossible.

German Army Saves Strength

Moscow announced that, because the muddy period has arrived, a special intermediate corps composed of the elite of the Cossack soldiers and the Siberian cavalry combined tank unit has handed over to the summer assault vehicle. The Red Army's current advantage is indeed an undeniable fact, but even the British and Americans do not believe the interpretation of the German army retreating under pressure. Therefore, we acknowledge that the German side has a planned retreat. Moreover, if the next stage of operations is considered, it is necessary to prevent the loss of people and materials.

That is to say, on the one hand, it is considered to prevent reckless operations of bloodshed for every inch of land, and on the other hand, it is the most effective means to deal with the Soviet guerrilla war. Gai Shibencai is particularly committed to the special strategy for the Soviet Union, and even the Soviet guerrilla team has now completely abandoned the scale of the previous special detachment and has become a mobile surprise force. For example, a military force that forms a connection line behind the German army, and has aircraft, artillery, and tanks is free to come and go, and launches a large-scale rear disruption war.

Then, related to the above, shrinking the battle line, reorganizing it, and at the same time thickening the defensive line, and maintaining close contact with the strategic reserve force, is also very necessary to consolidate a strategically advantageous position. Regarding this strategic thinking and war situation, we must admit the German army's cleverness in decisive battles. If the war cannot end within the year, it is certainly necessary to complete various preparations for the next stage of operations and gain time. What's more, for planned retreat operations, the Soviet Union often encounters large-scale encirclement and annihilation battles by German mechanized units, just like past offensive operations. According to Red Army prisoners, the German rearguard units, which were sent down like feathers, cleverly launched multiple encirclement battles against the Red Army. Therefore, the losses given to the Soviet Union are said to be a total of 2 million casualties, a loss of 20,000 tanks, and approximately 10,000 aircraft. Compared with the losses suffered by the Red Army in the German summer offensive, this is certainly not much, but looking at the current combat power, its proportion to the Soviet Union is definitely not inferior to the past two years. Looking at the German army's losses, taking tanks as an example, it is only 10% of the Soviet Union's. From this, one can measure where the German army's purpose in this operation lies.

### Opinions on Teacher Subsidies, Part 1

This time, the municipal authorities, in order to sympathize with the difficult lives of teachers, decided to allocate a huge sum of 500,000 [currency unit] per month to subsidize the faculty and staff of private primary and secondary schools. This measure is, of course, one of good governance. As I was writing this article, I saw in the morning newspaper that the subsidies would begin to be distributed starting on the 20th of this month. From my personal point of view, regarding the distribution of this subsidy, and standing in the teachers' position, I have some opinions and suggestions for the authorities.

How to Deal with Those Holding Concurrent Positions? The distribution of this subsidy does not distinguish between primary and secondary school teachers; each person receives one share, and those holding concurrent positions are not allowed to receive more than two shares of the subsidy they deserve. The method is originally very fair, but there are many teachers who hold concurrent positions. It is possible that some people use clever methods, such as one person using two names to hold courses in two schools, and perhaps even the schools are unaware of the details. It is naturally not easy for the authorities to investigate. Regarding this point, I hope that within our group of teachers, we will conduct strict investigations and surveillance. Once discovered, even if it is a friend, we must report them without hesitation. Because this subsidy of 500,000 [currency unit] is allocated based on the number of people, if someone receives an extra share, it will cause everyone else to receive less. In other words, they are concurrently receiving what belongs to everyone, so we cannot tolerate not reporting them. At the same time, I hope the authorities will issue a clear announcement that any teacher who is dishonest and concurrently receives subsidies for more than two positions will, once verified, be permanently suspended from receiving the subsidy.

Principals Should Not Be Included in the Subsidy. The so-called subsidy refers to subsidizing the faculty and staff of private schools. Therefore, in name, even if the principal does not hold a teaching position, they are still one of the staff members and can receive the subsidy. However, most private school principals in Shanghai have made a fortune in the past few years and do not need the subsidy. Therefore, I believe that anyone who is a principal should not receive the subsidy. Because in the past two relief efforts, as I know, some wealthy principals also took a share without hesitation, and even took more than the teachers.

Who is Responsible for Not Submitting the List?

The method for distributing the subsidy this time is that each school first submits a list of faculty and staff to the authorities, with a deadline of the 15th. If the list is not submitted by the deadline, it will be considered a waiver. Then, the authorities will calculate the reported lists and use them as the distribution standard. I have heard that in addition to most schools complying with the order and submitting on time, a few schools disregarded the interests of faculty and staff, and the list was not submitted, causing the subsidies that the faculty and staff should have received to be shared among others. Who should be responsible for this? I believe that the principal should be required to compensate the faculty and staff in full and issue it according to the monthly payment schedule; otherwise, this loss is too meaningless.

Mid-Term Resignations Should Be Returned. Many faculty and staff of private schools resign mid-term, especially in recent years. When encountering faculty and staff who are in school at the time of reporting but resign in one or two months, if someone replaces them, the subsidy they should have received should naturally be received by the replacement. However, sometimes their position (teaching) does not involve hiring a new person and is covered by colleagues in the school. I believe the subsidy that should have been received must be returned. It should be temporarily kept and allocated by the authorities for the subsidy in the next semester; otherwise, the principal will definitely take it, which is unreasonable and inappropriate!

In short, with the large number of teachers in the city, the result of distributing this 500,000 [currency unit] subsidy is that each person receives a limited amount, a drop in the bucket. Although it cannot be called relief, the distribution method should be fair, so the above points should also be noted. (Seeking Innovation)

Part 2

The Shanghai Municipal Education Administration, in order to relieve the lives of teachers throughout the city, has decided to allocate 500,000 [currency unit] per month as a subsidy. The authorities' allocation of relief funds to teachers is of great significance for valuing education and cultivating the foundation of the country, which need not be elaborated on. However, there are often things in the world where "a good author does not necessarily make a good ending, and a good beginning does not necessarily have a good ending." There are cases where the result and the motive go against each other, and there are cases where the result is affected by negative influences. For example, the aviation construction lottery, which promoted aviation and consolidated national defense, had good intentions. However, the impact was to promote the people's mentality of luck, and although national defense was strengthened, it was still a loss.

There was a precedent for teacher relief funds in this city before. At that time, the education community did receive some benefits and was very excited. However, there were differences in quality, disparities in the amount, and other kinds of drawbacks, which caused some people to complain. Therefore, I would like to raise some questions for the authorities to consider before the relief funds are allocated:

The distribution of relief funds should be based on the exact number of teachers, not on the scope of the school.

Primary, middle, and high schools should be distributed universally, striving for uniformity, and should not be different. The work of primary school teachers is more burdensome than that of teachers at other levels, while the treatment is the opposite. Therefore, the levels of primary, middle, and high schools should be broken down.

The distribution should be evenly distributed among the faculty and staff of each school, and there should be no differences based on different positions. Last time, the director of education at a certain elementary school received 800 [currency unit], while the teachers only received about 200 [currency unit], which is really a joke.

Are school staff included in the scope of relief? In principle, school staff are lower-level workers in the school, and their contribution to education is no different. Their lives are perhaps even more difficult than those of teachers, so they should also be included in the scope of relief. However, there are many schools that are becoming like families, often with four or five servants, while only one or two are truly serving the school. Therefore, when providing relief to school staff, it should be given to those who truly serve the school, and should not be issued indiscriminately. In the past, the mother of a certain school principal cooked (for fear that the nanny would waste food) and the nanny and driver all received relief funds, which ran counter to the original intention of the country to provide relief to faculty and staff, and should be severely criticized.

Principals and some superfluous positions should not share the benefits. Because principals have more affluent lives and superfluous positions receive rewards without merit, they should all feel guilty in their hearts, and even if the authorities do not have this regulation, they should voluntarily give up the benefits. (For example, if the principal's wife serves as the accountant, she can be regarded as a superfluous position).

The above is about the distribution of relief funds itself. Now there are some additional problems that arise because of the relief funds, which are even more related to the future of education, so I would like to elaborate on them:

Relief funds are a passive way to improve the lives of teachers, a so-called expedient measure, a last resort. Moreover, with so many people, the amount allocated is a drop in the bucket. How much can it help with the high cost of living? Therefore, I must loudly appeal: strictly establish a public school economic system. If the authorities of each school do not implement it voluntarily, it should be enforced by the administrative authorities. As for how to make the economy public, it is not within the scope of this article, so I will not elaborate.

The purpose of allocating relief funds is, of course, to hope that the education community can settle down in teaching and improve efficiency, but it is difficult to guarantee whether the results will be as we expect. Therefore, I believe that a portion of the relief funds should be extracted—or it is best to raise funds separately—to be used as education incentive funds. According to the methods of the Jiangsu Education Department before the war, telegrams should be sent to adjust course papers to test the diligence of teachers' teaching. Various competitions and joint examinations should be held to distinguish the merits of each school's performance. Supervisors should be sent to inspect schools at any time to clarify the implementation of each school's situation. Those who are diligent, excellent, and well-implemented should be given bonuses and other honorary rewards; conversely, they should be given appropriate punishments. This is called encouraging and inspiring them, which can achieve more rapid efficiency than simply providing relief funds. (Zhang Qiyang)

### Social Service Shanghai YWCA Fundraising Rally Opens

In the past year, the Shanghai YWCA, in order to adapt to the needs of the environment, has paid special attention to constructive and educational social relief undertakings in addition to its regular work, such as nurseries, voluntary education for female workers, student relief, voluntary schools for girls, and the donation of winter clothes to the poor. Recently, it has also taken over the Children's Home (i.e., the children's shelter), which specializes in accepting stray, lost, evicted, and runaway children. In addition to improving them, it also focuses on cleanliness, hygiene, moral education, and vocational education, hoping to transform each child into a normal and useful child from the psychological and physical transformation, benefiting Shanghai. In order to continue to promote various undertakings, a fundraising rally was held, with a target of one million [currency unit]. It opened at the Bank Club at 4:00 p.m. yesterday. It is said that this fundraising is being promoted by 100 enthusiastic social workers. It is thought that with everyone's help, the goal will definitely be reached.

### Illness Caused by Eating Sand Another Fact

I read in your newspaper's service column about the impurities in Mr. Chen's rice affecting his health, which is alarming. My two-year-old son suffered from abdominal pain on the 9th of this month and died on the afternoon of the 10th. His illness was indeed an acute gastrointestinal disease. Because I always thought that children's illnesses were mostly caused by fright, I did not diagnose it correctly and delayed seeking medical treatment, ultimately leading to his death. Tracing the cause, it was also caused by the black fine stones in the broken rice that caused his death. However, the deceased is gone. I hope that the grain administration authorities will, in the future, most importantly remove the black fine stones from the broken rice to protect the people's lives, which would be a great merit. On the one hand, I also hope that most rice merchants will consider ethics and benefit future generations. (Shen Shigui)

### Sympathizing with Impoverished Teachers Donations and Charity Sales

I read the article "Teacher's Appeal" in your newspaper's social service column and deeply sympathized with him. I immediately went to Mr. Fan Mingxing's residence to investigate. The situation in the room was shocking, and the emaciated appearance of his couple and young children was extremely impoverished. It is already a problem to make ends meet, let alone the huge cost of medical treatment. In addition to paying for miscellaneous expenses, I have now obtained the consent of my friend Dr. Sun Dingyuan to provide voluntary check-ups. (Mr. Sun is a doctor at Guangci Hospital, and I have introduced him with a letter.) After confirmation, treatment will be carried out immediately. In addition to my own commitment to cover part of the medical expenses, Dr. Sun is also enthusiastic and willing to bear the remaining expenses. This enthusiasm is commendable and rare. Although Mr. Fan's medical expenses have been resolved, his family's daily expenses still need assistance from enthusiastic people in society so that Mr. Fan can focus on seeking medical treatment. (Yu Wo)

Yesterday, I saw the article "Teacher's Appeal" in the social service section. After reading it, I deeply sympathized with Mr. Fan. I also have a fellow villager and friend, Mr. Yu, who is also a middle school teacher. His body is weak, and he has been ill in bed for more than a month. His family is destitute, and his five family members are starving all day long. Not to mention the cost of medical treatment, his sad situation is no less than Mr. Fan's. Although I do not know Mr. Fan, my heart of sympathy and compassion is the same. Now I am willing to donate a Qing Dynasty Yunsi "Ma" [currency unit] worth 8,000 [currency unit] for charity sale, with 2,000 [currency unit] of the proceeds to be given to Mr. Fan to express my meager sincerity, and the remaining 6,000 [currency unit] to be given to my fellow villager and friend Mr. Yu for his living and medical expenses. The size of the [item] is extremely large and rarely seen on the market. It is quite magnificent and is very grand as a gift for high-ranking officials. There is no shortage of charitable gentlemen in Shanghai. If you sympathize and help to complete this good deed, I will also feel the same.
