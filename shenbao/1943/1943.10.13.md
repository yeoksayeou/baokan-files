Various Factions of the Chinese Communist Party Form a State of Division; Over a Thousand Youths Arrested

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to sources, the declaration from Moscow in late May dissolving the Communist International caused a great shock to the Chinese Communist Party (CCP). The Yu-based Zhejiang Daily recently published the following report on this matter: The news of the dissolution of the Communist International in late May once transmitted to and became a shadow state. Originally, the CCP was a branch of the Communist International, and any of the CCP's activities were carried out according to the orders of the party department, and its activities were also under its command. After the dissolution of the Communist International, the CCP was quite embarrassed. In order to stabilize the internal order of the CCP, Mao Zedong declared that the current state of various countries is that international organizations are no longer needed, but he still could not suppress the wavering of ordinary party members. The small organization policy implemented in various places has become stagnant, and the old orthodox international faction of the CCP giants and the "local bumpkin" faction have also become divided and began infighting. For this reason, CCP elder Zhou Enlai hurriedly returned to Chongqing to mediate. Mao Zedong adopted high-handed tactics against the local clamorous atmosphere. In mid-June, he conducted a household registration survey and arrested more than a thousand young people, who were detained in newly established prisons outside Yan'an. He also implemented the same brutal methods in the northern Shaanxi area, reporting young people and sending them to Yan'an for detention. More than a dozen students from the Suide Normal School were expelled on the pretext of attempting to disrupt the order. Among them, more than a hundred students with a stronger attitude were also detained and sent to Yan'an. Other students who were dissatisfied with the status quo went on strike and left. During this turmoil in Yulin, the value of the "border currency" fell sharply, and a major panic occurred in the financial sector of Yan'an. In order to maintain the original price of the currency, the CCP forcibly set the ratio of the border currency to the legal tender at four to one. The general merchants were in a difficult situation, and the capital of private trading companies was also stagnant. Other shops operated by agencies gained exorbitant profits from the abnormal financial situation. During this period, in addition to ordering a census, Mao Zedong actively strengthened border defense and mobilized the CCP troops in the Central District to increase the number of cavalry by more than a thousand men in Malan. In various aspects such as the Niuwu Town and Heishui, the original 3,000 rifles have recently been enhanced with equipment to strengthen the fortifications, and a fierce offensive and defensive training is being implemented. Zhu De also inspected the Malan Mizhi area in mid-June, and the atmosphere was extremely tense. Traffic was prohibited in various places such as Wuzhen Gaojiagou Hanjiacha Zhenjiang. More than 2,000 CCP troops searched from time to time, and no less than several thousand people were killed due to suspicion and other matters. Therefore, since the beginning of this year, northern Shaanxi has become a land of terror and anxiety, which reminds people of the situation in Jiangxi Ruijin ten years ago.

Chief of General Affairs of Manchukuo Speaks in Tokyo

Tokyo, 12th (Central News Agency) - Wu Buliu Zang, Chief of General Affairs of Manchukuo, arrived in Tokyo on the 11th to discuss with the Japanese government matters such as mobilizing materials and strengthening production and development policies. He met with reporters on the afternoon of the 12th and made the following remarks: The purpose of this trip is to discuss with the Japanese government the urgent increase in the production of iron, aluminum, and agricultural products. Manchukuo has two major goals: one is to defend the northern border, and the other is to assume the rear mission of the Greater East Asia War. In order to achieve this goal, the Manchukuo government is actively promoting the Second Five-Year Plan. The Second Five-Year Plan can be established after the outbreak of the East Asia War, and this year is the second year. The operation policy will adopt the principle of focusing on key points. The development and construction of buried resources and heavy industry have achieved satisfactory results, and the contribution to Japan is gradually increasing. Especially for iron, the quantity supplied to Japan has increased by 60%. However, looking at the current stage of the war, it is necessary to increase production in these two areas, so I plan to hold consultations with the Japanese authorities on this matter. In addition, increasing the amount of grain is an urgent issue for the self-sufficiency of grain in Japan and Manchukuo and the development of heavy industry in Manchukuo. This year, Manchukuo's agricultural production has benefited from the harmony of the climate and the early planting in spring, weed removal and improvement methods, and the reclamation of wasteland has increased production by 10%. There is no sense of unease about the labor problem in the mining industry. Recently, the movement of labor has also decreased. The rural labor force relies on the cooperation of the self-development and the implementation of the national mobilization service team, so the manpower is sufficient. The national mobilization service team system has about 70,000 members this year, and the number can be increased by more than 7,000 each year after next year. In terms of long-term power, the Fengman and Minfeng power plants have started generating electricity, which can fully supply the important power for the local production sector, and the expansion policy will be considered in the future. In short, what Manchukuo takes from Japan has been greatly reduced, and at the same time, the contribution to Japan in terms of heavy industry and food has increased significantly. This is the only goal of Manchukuo's current progress.

Large-Scale Offensive and Defensive War in the Lower Reaches of the Dnieper River; Fierce Fighting Still in the Nivelle Area

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The large-scale offensive and defensive war in the Melitopol area of the lower reaches of the Dnieper River has now formed the two major focal points of the Eastern Front, along with the fierce fighting in the Nivelle area of the central front. On the 11th, a German news agency war correspondent reported on this as follows: As a result of the German army's fierce counterattack north of the Sea of Azov, the stubborn resistance of the Russian army has been completely crushed, and after capturing an important strategic point, the Soviet army launched a general attack on the 10th to recapture the point, and the two armies launched a major armored battle. The superior Soviet army launched a fierce assault on the southern flank of the German positions in Melitopol after intense preparatory artillery fire, but all fourteen assaults were repelled by the German army with a small number of troops. The German army then launched a fierce counterattack, destroying about 100 Soviet tanks and completely crushing the Soviet offensive. The Soviet army in the Chapruki area also attacked the German army from the north and east of the bridgehead with ten infantry divisions and two tank brigades. The German army first adopted a defensive posture to block them, and then mobilized an armored unit mainly composed of tank destroyers to launch a counterattack, encircling and annihilating two large battalions of Soviet infantry and an anti-tank artillery unit. In this battle, the German army destroyed 38 Soviet tanks and achieved great results.

The Soviet Army Paid a Heavy Price in the Taman Peninsula Campaign

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency Report. German News Agency Report: The comprehensive report of the German High Command on the Taman Peninsula campaign stated that between September 7 and October 8, during the fighting in the Kampen bridgehead, 25,000 Soviet soldiers were killed and 3,648 were captured. Due to the geographical situation, the German/Romanian army's dispatch to the Kurch Peninsula could not be kept secret for long. From the first day the German command began to withdraw, the remaining troops fought fierce defensive battles almost every day with the enemy, who had superior manpower and materials. The Soviet army continuously increased its attacks on the middle and sides of the German front line and landed continuously behind the German defense line, trying to break through the German army in the Kupen area, but the Soviet army was tested very well and the number of victories it gained is enough to know. In the past few weeks of war, only strong rear defense and protection teams have been able to achieve balance, because a large number of German/Romanian troops have been opened to various intersections, and the Soviet has never been able to enter the German/Romanian. Most of the Soviet dead were drowned, and it is estimated that at least 100,000 people were injured. At the same time, 255 of its tank units were destroyed or unable to move. The German/Romanian army also captured 75 enemy artillery pieces and about 500 machine guns. Small firearms, rifles, light mortars, flat-shooting artillery, and other small weapons and a large number of bullets were destroyed on the spot.

Rumors That Gandhi, Nehru, and Others Will Be Released

Buenos Aires, 12th (Central News Agency) - The new British Viceroy of India, Wavell, is scheduled to take office in New Delhi in the near future. According to the Washington International News Service, the new Governor-General has an idea of opening up the Indian government's difficulties. It seems that he intends to release Gandhi and other leaders of the Congress Party. According to British diplomatic personnel stationed in Washington, because Jiangtela Bose's radio speeches from Burma and Zhaofu have greatly stimulated the Indians, the first step taken by the new Governor-General Wavell after taking office will be to release Gandhi, Nehru, and other leaders of the Congress Party.

5,000-Year-Old Ancient Boat Discovered in Denmark

Copenhagen, 12th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Hartersleben, workers there discovered an ancient boat from the Stone Age in the Vasde wilderness, estimated to be about 5,000 years old. The ancient boat is made of alder wood, which is especially outstanding, as ordinary small boats of this kind are usually made of oak wood.

Amazing Results Achieved in Intercepting American Aircraft; New Type of Fighter Appears; German Air Defense Strengthened; Amazing Results Achieved in Intercepting American Aircraft

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - The German air defense array is now increasingly strengthened. In intercepting incoming American bombers on the 9th and 10th, over a hundred more were shot down, achieving amazing results. The German military often met with the press corps at noon on the 11th and explained that the results achieved were due to the appearance of a new type of German fighter. It is said that the fighters currently used by the German army are the Schmidt 109 and Wolf 190. As for what the latest type of fighter is, the two improvers above will not be expressed. However, the high speed and efficiency of German fighters have long been well-known. As the German military often stated at the meeting with the press corps on the 11th, "Although the anti-Axis forces claim that the armor of their air fortresses is quite thick, and German fighters cannot display their strength, the new type of fighter recently used in the American air raid on western Germany immediately shot down their air fortresses when the artillery door was opened." It is not difficult to imagine that the armor or aviation performance of the German air force has been greatly improved. The US Air Force Bomber Command also admitted that the German fighters' attacks on the US Air Force were quite fierce.

British and American Aircraft Lose Two Hundred Aircraft in Attacks on Germany

Berlin, 12th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency Report: Although Germany's new air defense plan is still under development, some of the methods that have already been improved have made it difficult for the British and Americans to launch their bombing offensives. German military officials continue to maintain strict silence on the reorganization of German air defense. But it can be said that this reorganization has reached a mature stage, as can be seen from the recent large number of enemy aircraft being shot down. Within 72 hours, 208 attacking enemy aircraft were shot down, which can be said to be a success in general, especially since this number includes most of the so-called "flying fortresses," whose firepower is even greater than that of ordinary fighters. It is also worth noting that this number only includes enemy aircraft shot down in German airspace, and the losses of enemy aircraft often lost on their way home are not included, and the exact number is also unknown. If the known losses of enemy aircraft in three days are 208, then the actual losses must be at least 300. However, the success of air defense methods is not solely determined by the number of enemy losses. The question is whether the defender can strategically prevent the enemy's intentions to carry out air raids or reduce their effectiveness, so that they do not have much impact on the progress of the war or even no impact at all. Germany's new air defense methods can be said to have completed this goal. If the British and Americans come to attack again, the German command will not only be able to restore control of the air over Germany, but also deeply sell that it will be the master of the overall situation. There will surely be a day when the German army will not only be able to offset all the intentions of air raids, but also be able to launch a powerful revenge. However, the German army will not easily try its new defense methods before the important period has come, and will wait until the appropriate time to ensure the highest degree of success in the use of this new defense plan. In addition to the factors that are still unknown so far, the result of the reorganization of German air defense seems to have improved in German fighters and their equipment. The German command seems to be exerting the effectiveness of the cooperation between night fighters and searchlight teams. The high-altitude artillery team also plays an important role in the new defense system, but its method is different from the past. The effectiveness of this new defense system has been proven by the facts in the past few days. The British and Americans claim that their maximum loss will not exceed 10%, but the losses of enemy aircraft in the past few days have been above 10%. If the loss of aircraft continues to increase, whether it will be able to carry out terror air raids as many times and with as much power as before remains to be seen.

Rumor That Iranian Government Requests Withdrawal of British, American, and Soviet Troops

Istanbul, 12th (Central News Agency) - It is rumored that the Iranian parliament held a secret meeting on the 5th to discuss important national policies. According to a telegram from Tehran, it is rumored that as a result of this secret meeting, the Iranian government has decided to request the withdrawal of troops from the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union from the country. Since the anti-Axis forces invaded Iran, the country has suffered from food shortages and the situation has deteriorated, which is bound to cause conflicts between the natives and foreign troops. The King of Iran, in view of this, has taken this measure to preserve its independence.

Istanbul, 22nd (Central News Agency) - It is worth noting what attitude the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will take towards the Iranian government's request for troop withdrawal. According to Tehran Radio on the 10th, it is rumored that after the Iranian government declared war on the Axis powers, it has decided to have Iranian troops take over all the old British military garrison areas and request the withdrawal of British troops from Iran.

European War and the Balkan Countries (IV)

Croatia

The Process of the Collapse of the Former Yugoslavia

In discussing the situation in the former Yugoslavia, let's first describe the process of its collapse.

In March 1941, after Bulgaria joined the Tripartite Pact, German troops entered Bulgaria. At the same time, British troops landed in Greece, and the Italo-Greek war truly became an Anglo-German war. In the midst of the urgent situation in the Balkans, German diplomacy led the Kingdom of Yugoslavia to join the Tripartite Pact. However, a section of Yugoslavia fiercely opposed this. At the end of March, the military launched a coup, and Prime Minister was forced to flee to Greece. Under Peter II, a cabinet of national unity was formed with Air Force Commander General as the leader. On April 5, the Yugoslav government concluded a treaty of friendship and non-aggression with the Soviet Union, echoing the British and Greek forces and concentrating their forces on the Albania, Greece, and Yugoslav border areas. The United Kingdom and the United States also supported the new cabinet. At this point, Germany could not remain silent. On April 6, the government abandoned its capital, Belgrade, and moved to Sarajevo. The Croat city of Zagreb, Croatia's capital, fell to German forces. On the 10th, General declared Croatia's independence. On the 15th, three regions, , , and Northern Ukraine, were merged into Germany. By May, the Slovenia region and the Dalmatian coast were incorporated into Germany. On May 27, a new Serbian government was established. On July 12, the Montenegro state was also established. The former Kingdom of Yugoslavia had completely collapsed.

The Birth of Croatia

Croatia welcomed , the leader of the independence movement exiled in Italy, as the head of state. Based on Croatia's historical traditions, it was decided to restore the kingdom. On May 16, 1941, a declaration was made in Zagreb to restore the throne. To show that was not interested in the throne, supported the second son of the Italian Emperor's cousin, the late , Prince of Lippelbert, , brother of the brave General , who died in battle in North Africa, as king. However, the prince later withdrew for some reason, and when the situation in Italy changed rapidly due to the coup, he eventually declared his abdication.

However, after Italy's withdrawal, the national leader , took office as the Chairman of the Croatian state. When the Italian puppet regime surrendered to the United Kingdom and the United States, Chairman immediately issued a statement on Croatia's merger with the Dalmatian coast. was publicly used for the first time, which can be interpreted as the fact that since he took office as the Chairman of the state, Prime Minister Dr. also did not have this title.

Regarding the merger of Dalmatia, the operation was started by the Croatian army, navy, and Ustasha forces on the night of the 8th.

Italy and Croatia were ostensibly very close, but Italy recently was greedy and forced Croatia to make major territorial concessions in Dalmatia and other areas, and imposed military and other restrictions. This left the general Croatian people with the impression that the Italian authorities were too harsh. Although the country's founding depended heavily on Germany, in terms of territory, other than the merger of a part, it only hoped for economic cooperation. Therefore, the Croatian state leaned more towards Germany than towards Italy. This can be understood from the fact that Croatia was the first to recognize Burma when it became independent, and the country's will is clear. Now that Croatia has fulfilled its long-cherished desire, it can be said that it has a perfect system to deal with the enemy landing in Dalmatia.

Croatia has a population of about seven million, including five million Croats and one million eight hundred thousand Serbs. The main industries are agriculture, animal husbandry, and forestry. The reserves of minerals that have not been fully developed are quite rich.

Its external economic relations are part of the Greater German economic group and a supplier of agricultural products. Germany has a actively supportive policy towards the country's development, maintains trade relations, and sends experts to guide the industrial sector.

Serbia

In April 1941, the German Military Commander-in-Chief in , General , organized the Serbian Administrative Committee, which began administration under German military rule. By the end of May, it had developed into the new Serbian government in Belgrade. But even though it was said to be a new government, it was still under the commander of the occupying army. Later, the Bulgarian army replaced the German army stationed there, and this continues to this day.

In short, there is no doubt that the old Yugoslavia is under the control of the Axis forces. The activities of Soviet-backed partisans often manifested as terrorist incidents, and the tens of thousands of troops led by General Mikhailovich, the remnants of the old Yugoslavia, were also surrounded by German and Bulgarian troops and confined to the mountains. They were just bandit-style disturbances.

It is said that the British army and air force used air transport to provide material assistance to them, but these partisan forces will not be very effective unless the anti-Axis forces can land in the Balkans.

But the bandit army of Mikhailovich is an anti-Bolshevik, which is an interesting issue. Therefore, even within the former Yugoslavia, the activities of the partisans and the strategies of the British and Soviet Union are also fighting each other!

Greece

From the fall of Crete, Greece has the experience of fighting to the end among the Balkan countries and is remotely opposed to the British army in North Africa across the Aegean Sea. Due to its winding coastline and numerous islands, it faces quite complex problems in terms of strategy and security.

After initiating conflict with Italy in November 1940, the British army joined, causing Italy to fall into a difficult battle. In April 1941, the German army swept down Greece with the force of sweeping Yugoslavia. In just three weeks, it surrendered. The King of Greece and his cabinet fled to Crete and continued to resist with the joint British and Greek forces. In May, Crete also fell, eventually collapsing. The Greek military leaders who had no way out in the country accepted the terms of surrender to Germany, and the pro-German new regime led by General was born, and the mobilization of the entire Greek army was lifted.

Since then, the south has been under the military administration of the Italian occupying army, the key points in the north have been occupied by the German and Bulgarian armies, and other military key locations such as Thessaloniki, Crete, and the Aegean Sea islands have been completely under the military administration of the German occupying army.

Due to the successive events of the Italian coup and withdrawal from the Axis powers, Greece was certainly the most impacted among the Balkan countries. With Italy's withdrawal from the war today, southern Greece is of course also defended by German troops.

Greece has traditionally been an agricultural-based industry, with three-quarters of its seven million people said to be engaged in agriculture. Because the country is mostly mountainous, cultivated land accounts for only a quarter of the country's land area. Other areas such as grasslands and forests are also very lush, and mineral resources seem to be even richer, but they have not been mined due to geographical conditions. The occupation of the Axis forces can also be said to be purely for operational purposes.

Previously, some people observed that the second battle line of the British and Americans would attack the Balkans directly after capturing Crete and a large number of Kanis islands, but today, with the capture of Sicily and the Italian sea and air forces being regarded as nothing, some people think that Albania and Greece will be attacked directly. On the German side, there is also the largest division of troops in the Balkan countries stationed in Greece,

### Economy and Welfare

Recently, the Shanghai Municipal Government sent a letter to the Shanghai branch of the New National Movement Promotion Association, jointly promoting the frugality movement and prohibiting wasteful banquets, especially reiterating the ban. It said: "At a time of material shortages and high living costs, all our citizens should strive for frugality. However, in recent times, extravagance in food, drink, and entertainment has become commonplace. The cost of a single banquet can equal the wealth of an average person. Behind the rich men's wine and meat, there are bones on the roads. Reflecting on ourselves, it is difficult to feel at ease. Strict restrictions should be imposed to reverse this vulgar trend. The National Government has already promulgated measures to restrict banquets, issuing orders nationwide... All restaurants in this city must strictly comply and not exceed the limits. We also hope that all citizens will exercise self-discipline to fulfill the purpose of frugality and show sincerity in saving the nation. In the future, any violations that are discovered, whether by restaurants or banquet hosts, will be punished equally." We, of course, strongly agree with and fully support the municipal government's ban. Four months ago, we advocated for a "Frugal Banquet Covenant," advocating that banquets should only be held when necessary, and waste should be strictly limited during banquets. However, there are doubts about whether banquets are currently frugal and whether restaurants are complying. "The cost of a single banquet can equal the wealth of an average person; behind the rich men's wine and meat, there are bones on the roads." This kind of wasteful phenomenon is indeed a fact in Shanghai and not just a figure of speech. However, for some nouveau riche and wealthy classes, pursuing enjoyment is the greatest pleasure in life. To expect them to "reflect on themselves and feel uneasy" is like playing the lute to a cow, an overestimate. Regarding "any violations that are discovered, whether by restaurants or banquet hosts, will be punished equally," we wonder how many people have been discovered and punished? Generally, the content of government orders is always well-reasoned and vigorously implemented, but in reality, the results either deviate from the intention or are completely ineffective, falling into the trap of bureaucratic formality.

Civil servants should undoubtedly abide by laws regarding social frugality. However, in reality, senior civil servants would not occupy a very small percentage in the statistics of restaurant banquet hosts. Therefore, we also hope that officials will exercise self-discipline, reduce socializing, and save extravagance, setting an example and creating a positive atmosphere. Then, strict supervision and enforcement can achieve real frugality.

It is rumored that recently, the Japanese authorities in China have restricted banquets and socializing for military and political personnel, with the aim of saving extravagance. We commend the self-discipline of the foreign authorities, but it is especially important that they walk the talk. Superiors should ensure their orders are carried out, and subordinates should obey unconditionally. In an instant, this spirit of integrity should permeate all levels. This strict discipline is truly something we can learn from, especially those in officialdom should pay close attention. We believe that among officials and between officials and civilians, exchanging opinions and fostering friendships is sometimes unavoidable. In such cases, replacing banquets with tea parties seems acceptable.

As for the majority of citizens, given their current living conditions, the practice of frugality does not require government urging or social advocacy. Even if they wanted to waste, they could not, as they have already reached the point where they cannot save any more. Therefore, from the perspective of equal living standards, there is a particular need to restrict the waste of a minority of people. The recently established Citizens' Frugality Movement Committee should not focus its efforts on all citizens, but rather concentrate its publicity and guidance on purely consumer venues such as restaurants and entertainment venues, where it is more likely to be effective and practical.

While urging citizens to be frugal, it is also necessary to provide them with welfare. Frugality is the obligation of a small number of citizens, while welfare is the right of the majority. Citizen welfare initiatives should aim to meet the common needs of the majority and benefit the majority. There are many different types of welfare initiatives. Below are some of the major and essential ones:

From the perspective of citizens' health, more active promotion of healthcare should be undertaken. Healthcare is already well-developed in advanced countries. For example, in Japan, the Health Center, which is the central organization for guiding national healthcare, had 49 centers in Showa 13 (1938) and has now increased to 239. To adapt to the healthcare guidance system and establish a medical system, the Japan Medical Corporation was established based on the National Medical Law, with a budget of 600 million yen, with the three major tasks being the prevention and eradication of tuberculosis, the elimination of areas without medical care, and the improvement of medical content. Among the five million citizens of Shanghai, tuberculosis is very easy to breed due to poor nutrition and air quality. Prevention and eradication are very necessary, and the government and society should jointly raise funds to promote healthcare and guide citizens' health.

To strengthen the power of social charity, charitable organizations in the city should be merged and adjusted for unified advancement. Whether raising funds or carrying out activities, they must be centrally managed, with division of labor requiring cooperation to correct the past fragmentation caused by each acting on their own and forming factions. The government's social welfare authorities should assume leadership responsibility,统筹经费与個別指導業務, while those with specific funding sources and designated uses will maintain their original status, but their business policies should be guided by the unified agency.

Relieving unemployment is not a charitable undertaking, but should be solved with a productive perspective. Small and light industries and handicrafts should be established, and the unemployed should be recruited for training and employment. Employment registration and referral agencies should be established, liaising with industry and commerce to facilitate referrals. Those who register should be provided with compulsory education and training when necessary to improve their employment skills.

Guiding citizens to save and organizing citizen welfare should be conducted by the same government agency to ensure the equitable and rational progress of citizens' obligations and rights.

The Greater East Asia War is a war to open up and build Asia. Whether East Asia can be restored from the exploitation of the British and American empires depends entirely on whether this war can be won. Today's Asia is no longer a British or American colony or semi-colony but an Asia that has been liberated and is beginning to be rebuilt. We all have the determination and confidence to help each other to complete this great war. Burma was the first country to break away from British bondage and become a new nation during this great war. I believe that there will still be those in Asia who rise up to restore their autonomy and freedom, such as the Indian independence movement led by Chandra Bose, which cannot be regarded as anything other than the spirit of Asians based on this justice."
