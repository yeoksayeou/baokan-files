### Request for Further Donations to the Scholarship Fund Campaign

Not long ago, this city launched a North China disaster relief effort and achieved excellent results in a very short period. This fully demonstrated that the citizens of Shanghai are eager for public service and unwilling to lag behind the rest of the country, and are worthy of being a national model. Now, we are conducting a scholarship fund campaign that is even more proactive than disaster relief. The success or failure of this campaign directly affects the future of out-of-school youth in this city and indirectly affects the future talent pool of the entire country. Therefore, we once again make a special appeal to all sectors of society, hoping that everyone will continue to contribute generously out of their eagerness for public service, so that this scholarship fund campaign will achieve unprecedented success.

At present and in the future, the most important issue for China's revival is the issue of talent. No one can deny this. When we ask every enthusiastic person engaged in the revival and construction of the country and society, they all sigh in unison that there is a severe lack of talent at present! Many undertakings and many plans cannot be carried out not because of a lack of funds, but because of a lack of real talent. To put it bluntly, judging from the feelings of ordinary entrepreneurs in Shanghai today, all those who truly develop their careers also feel that talent is the most important issue. The reason for the current lack of talent is naturally because the work of cultivating talent five or ten years ago was not carried out adequately. However, if we compare the current schools for cultivating talent and the number of students with the situation five or ten years ago, then we cannot but admit that, in any case, the situation five or ten years ago was much better than it is now. Not to mention middle schools and elementary schools, but even in terms of specialized schools and universities, the number of schools and students at that time was several times higher than it is today. When we flip through old newspapers from a few years ago, the enrollment advertisements during summer and winter vacations are more numerous than they are now, and the number of students in each school is generally several times higher than that of today's general large, medium, and small schools. With so many schools and students in those years, it still led to a lack of talent. When we think about the issue of China's revival and construction and talent five or ten years from now, given the scarcity of schools and students today, anyone with a heart cannot help but feel disheartened!

For the sake of the future revival and construction of society and the country, we must step up the cultivation of talent today. However, in reality, taking Shanghai, the most culturally developed city in the country, as an example, there is a serious and widespread phenomenon of out-of-school youth. The reason for this phenomenon is, of course, that the work of restoring schools at all levels after the Incident has not yet reached an ideal level, resulting in a sense of insufficient schools, as well as a lack of specialized teachers and material facilities, so that the content of general schools has not been enriched. However, the most serious and widespread reason at present is that the children of ordinary families below the middle class, the children of ordinary civil servants, and even the children of teachers in various schools are all in a state of being unable to afford schooling. Even providing elementary school expenses is already very difficult. Therefore, we often hear the sigh, "Those who teach other people's children have no one to teach their own children." Similarly, ordinary middle- and high-ranking civil servants also rarely have the ability to maintain their children's middle school expenses. As for the expenses of universities and specialized schools, they are definitely beyond the reach of families below the middle class, and they have become institutions of learning only for a small number of wealthy children. Regardless of the content and educational outcomes of such schools for wealthy children, such a small number of students, even if everyone becomes a specialist in the future, will definitely not be enough to meet the needs of the country and society! Therefore, at present, assisting out-of-school youth who are unable to afford schooling, so that they are no longer barred from the doors of schools, and cultivating a large number of talents in the future is of the utmost importance, whether from a social perspective or from the perspective of national interests.

The target for the scholarship fund raised by this newspaper's current scholarship fund campaign is tentatively set at 1.5 million yuan. In today's Shanghai, this figure is not a staggering amount. However, if it can be successfully completed within one month, it can assist 1,500 elementary school students (250 yuan per student, totaling 375,000 yuan), 1,000 junior high school students (350 yuan per student, totaling 350,000 yuan), 1,000 senior high school students (450 yuan per student, totaling 450,000 yuan), 500 university or vocational school students (550 yuan per student, totaling 275,000 yuan), and 250 vocational school students (200 yuan per student, totaling 50,000 yuan) so that they can continue their studies for this semester. In other words, this 1.5 million yuan can prevent 4,250 young people from dropping out of school during this semester. Given the large population of this city and the large number of enthusiastic people in this city, throwing whips can stop the flow of a river, and accumulating gold can build a tower. If those who are rich and benevolent come forward to set an example and continue their efforts, the expected target will not be difficult to reach in the shortest possible time. Yesterday, we received a generous donation of 100,000 yuan from Mr. Sheng You'an. His enthusiasm and righteous act are indeed admirable, and his earnest concern for benefiting the poor and talented is particularly commendable for his far-sightedness and his loyalty to cultivating talent for society and the country! We, on behalf of the young people who receive scholarships, would like to express our respect to Mr. Sheng. We firmly believe that Shanghai is not lacking in people with the same outstanding vision and enthusiasm as Mr. Sheng. If they can avoid letting Mr. Sheng have the exclusive beauty in front, and donate enthusiastically, then only fifteen people like Mr. Sheng are needed to fully achieve this goal! Of course, we still sincerely welcome small donors. We hope that insightful wealthy people will regard participating in the scholarship fund campaign as a supreme honor, and regard donating money to support education as a glorious obligation for citizens of the new era towards the future revival of society and the construction of the country. We hope that the list of donors published every day will become ironclad proof of the Chinese nation's unyielding self-improvement, and use this list to inspire the movement for the revival of national culture.

In the North China disaster relief donation drive, citizens and organizations from all walks of life in Shanghai have won a glorious championship. We eagerly look forward to demonstrating the superior character of the Chinese nation's eagerness for public service in this scholarship fund campaign as well! On behalf of millions of out-of-school youth, on behalf of the society and country in urgent need of talent, we sincerely appeal to insightful wealthy people in this city!

### The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference Held. Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Speech. Increasingly Confident in the Understanding of the True Intentions of Japan by Various Ethnic Groups in East Asia. Confident in the Prospect of Victory in the War.

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Fourth Central Cooperation Conference was held at the Greater East Asia Hall on the morning of the 14th at 9:00 AM. Japanese Prime Minister and President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, Tojo, first stated his experiences during his visit to the South and his confidence in victory. He said that he had previously visited the Republic of China, Manchuria, and the Philippines, and this time he visited Thailand and various places in the South. He witnessed the understanding of Japan's true intentions by various countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, and the concentration of the total strength of one billion people on the path of defeating Britain and the United States. This is the realization of comprehensive cooperation with Japan. He also witnessed the gradual transformation of huge national defense resources into combat power. His belief in Japan's victory in the Greater East Asia War has become stronger. At this moment, Japan will not hesitate to provide the greatest assistance and cooperation to these countries and ethnic groups. Therefore, concrete measures are gradually being taken. The victorious posture of the Greater East Asia War and the foundation for the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia are so solid that it is truly gratifying. Regarding Europe, our country and our allies such as Germany and Italy are increasingly consolidating their unity and advancing together on the path to defeating Britain and the United States, which is also extremely gratifying. Because of the war of justice and because of the unity of East Asia, our victory is unwavering. However, the acquisition of this victory still depends on the extraordinary efforts and sacrifices of our one hundred million people. The enemy, Britain and the United States, are now carrying out counterattacks with their reliance on material resources, and their momentum should not be underestimated. However, this is also known to our country, so there is nothing to fear. Because under this certain-to-win situation, we can only raise our fighting spirit, display an indomitable spirit, and move forward to the final victory of the Greater East Asia War in a dignified manner. Finally, the Prime Minister also hoped that the national people would rise up together to gather the total national strength and enhance combat power, meaning that the government had previously convened a temporary parliament to discuss and prepare for emergency increases in corporate food production and other issues. This is to strive to enhance combat power. However, in order to enhance combat power by using the total strength of the country, every citizen must stand up with the spirit of sacrificing oneself for the country and fight for the country. Therefore, I sincerely hope that our one hundred million people will share joys and sorrows and work together to develop each person's ability. We should also step up efforts to refresh our lives, save on consumption, increase savings, and not be moved by any situation. Furthermore, we should thoroughly practice a clean and simple life with a robust spirit to contribute to the country. At this serious moment, we will demonstrate the traditional spirit of our one hundred million people, so as to glorify the country and determine the fate of East Asia for a thousand years. This is our important responsibility. The country expects and desires that military officers and civilians unite in one heart and devote all their efforts to developing the performance of our nation. This is also the only way to support the holy cause and glorify the country. The purpose of convening the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference is also for this reason. With the full enthusiasm of the national people, their confidence in the enhancement of combat power will definitely make a great contribution.

Suzuki Reports on Corporate Policy

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Suzuki, President of the Japanese Planning Board, spoke at the plenary session of the Japanese Central Cooperation Conference on the 14th regarding the special law for enhancing combat power and preparing enterprises passed by the 82nd Temporary Parliament of Japan and its implementation policy. He requested the cooperation of both government and private sectors to carry out rapid and smooth preparations to meet the urgent needs of the war situation. The main points of President Suzuki's speech are recorded below. The production situation is an important factor in combat power, and it has been progressing very smoothly since the second half of last year. In particular, in the first half of this year, unprecedentedly good results have been achieved. The achievements of important industrial production are very beautiful. At the current stage, to break through the urgent war situation, we can only win with the strong force of the people. Therefore, we must enhance combat power, and if we do not immediately develop the total force of the people, we will not be able to achieve the urgent goals, because of the increase in aircraft, ships, and personnel. However, we must remember that the foundation is extremely broad. The previous enterprise preparations were often difficult due to the relationship of the controlled economy, and had to be changed to be spontaneous, self-defense, and have a passive character. However, this time, the enterprise preparations are for the purpose of turning it into combat power. We are preparing to launch a part of the strong power of the law, and the preparation policy is to prepare those that are easy to start and turn into combat power first, regardless of the excellence or corruption of their business. This is the electrical key's characteristics. The implementation method is to turn tens of thousands of labor force into combat power, and steel will also be able to be appropriated by tens of thousands of tons. Due to the impact of the above-mentioned enterprise preparations on the economic order, it is also very large. In terms of funds, tens of billions of yuan in cash will also be spent. The government is implementing various policies to handle these situations, seeking to keep good methods to maintain economic order and strengthen economic power. Now we must thoroughly recognize the demands of the war on us and the appearance of the war. We must stand on the traditional spirit of not fearing any difficulties in wartime in order to seek a living.

Amau Director-General Vigorously Criticizes Britain and the United States

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Amau, Director-General of the Japanese Information Bureau, delivered a speech on the recent general international situation at the Fourth Central Cooperation Conference. The general idea was that Britain and the United States provoked this war to destroy Japan. Democracy is the slogan flaunted by Britain and the United States. Their democracy is nothing more than the democracy of the British and Americans or the nationalism of the purely Anglo-Saxon nation. Today, a part of the nation, regardless of whether they are British or American citizens, absolutely do not recognize their freedom and equality. This matter is already known to the world. They regard the Asian nation as a different race and have no expectations other than to satisfy their material needs. Since Japan first awakened, the Asian nations have also awakened one after another. Today, the atmosphere of liberating all of Asia is high, and leaders who resist Britain and the United States and fight for independence are rising at any time. Burmese Governor Bamo is now fighting for the independence of Burma. Filipino Independence Preparatory Committee Chairman Laurel and Vargas, Roxas, and other patriots are also working with the enthusiasm of comrades for the independence of the Philippines. In addition, Indian Chandra Bose previously expressed his aspirations for independence in Tung. In his speech, he said that India has now seen the dawn of freedom. Such a good opportunity will not reappear in the next hundred years. After Contractor Bose arrived in Zhao Nan, he has announced his ambitious plan to organize a provisional government of free India. The British Cone has appointed Wavell as the new Governor-General of India and implemented military oppression politics, but the final victory will be for oppression or independence, and there is a certain trend. However, we already deeply know that the final victory belongs to justice. Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the Premier of the Kuomintang, who prompted the awakening of the neighboring Republic of China, said when the Guangdong government was established in February of the 12th year of Taisho, "Japanese and Chinese are both Asians." Therefore, even if Japan and China are at war, it is only a dispute between brothers and will not harm the brotherhood. If we leave our country and go to Canada, the United States, and south to Australia and New Zealand, and west to South Africa, we will feel that Chinese and Japanese are indistinguishable. But it is also precisely because of this that we are both rejected from entering. On the contrary, the British and Americans have invaded Asia, such as China, which is no different from a British and American colony, and the Chinese are no different from their slaves. In order to build Asia for Asians, we cannot but fight together. Looking at the current situation, it is true. The attitude of Britain and the United States has not changed at all. The Atlantic Charter once declared respect for the national spirit, but its deception is now proven by facts. Britain and the United States have not been threatened by other countries at all. Why are they willing to engage in war? The British and Americans monopolize the world's resources and can live comfortably. Why is there a need for war? This should be the question of ordinary Americans and also the question of the world. The facts indicate that Britain and the United States want to destroy Japan, destroy China, oppress Thailand, the Philippines, Burma, and India, and make Asians slaves forever, and use war to satisfy their ambition to invade the world and complete their hegemony of the world. The war is also the rise of Asians to break the shackles of Britain and the United States and build a world of truth, goodness, and beauty. The dawn of Asian liberation has now arrived. The fate of the Asian world, the liberation of Asia, the world of righteousness, and the life and death of Japan are completely in this battle. Therefore, this war is a war to determine the universe and create a new era.

### Japanese Economic Mission Departs Beijing Today to Shanghai. Chinese and Japanese Officials Hold Farewell Banquet.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Economic Mission has been in Beijing for three days, and has had sincere talks and exchanges of views with all levels of the Chinese government and the public, with very satisfactory results. It is learned that the mission's task in Beijing has been completed and is scheduled to leave Beijing for Shanghai on the morning of the 15th, and then return to their country.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the highest economic advisor of the National Government, held a tea party at his official residence at 4:00 PM on the 14th to entertain the Japanese Economic Mission. General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China, also held a banquet for the mission at 7:00 PM on the same evening.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) The Japanese Economic Mission has been in Beijing for two days. The 14th was the third day. At 8:00 AM, the mission went to the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum to pay their respects to the tomb of the Father of the Nation. At noon, they visited Foreign Minister Chu to have sincere talks. Foreign Minister Chu hosted a banquet at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association. During the banquet, Foreign Minister Chu and the head of the mission, Ogura, gave sincere speeches, and the atmosphere was very harmonious.

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) To welcome the arrival of the Japanese Economic Mission in Beijing, the Central News Agency, together with the Japanese Domei News Agency and the capital's newspapers, held an economic and cultural symposium at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association at 3:00 PM on the 14th. The symposium began at 3:30 PM and lasted for more than an hour. The overall results of the symposium can be summarized in the following four points: (1) The current economic situation in China is still good, and the only difficulty is the currency issue. There are two ways to remedy this: (A) Start with guiding the national psychology, especially to enhance the public's awareness of economic construction; (B) To make the materials have a reasonable unity, so as not to be scattered, so as to avoid the occurrence of bad phenomena. (2) Regarding the issue of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation, the most important thing is that economic circles in both countries must have a deep understanding of each other in terms of psychology and spirit. There should be more exchanges and contacts with each other to eliminate past barriers, and then cooperation can be smoothly successful. (3) Regarding the currency issue, the current issue of currency unification in China is completely different from the unification of the old legal currency in the 24th year of the Republic of China. At that time, it was not the government unifying the currency, but the extension of the effectiveness of British and American currencies. Now, the government and the people are closely linked, and it is predicted that the unification of the currency of the entire China can be successfully realized. (4) Regarding the issue of development, the development of the South is absolutely optimistic. At present, except for the transportation problem which is more difficult, everything else is quite satisfactory. The production mechanism has been fully restored, and all materials are more abundant than before. For example, rice and rubber are showing signs of excess. Since Britain and the United States lost Nanyang, they have had great difficulties in all materials, especially the rubber item is even more lacking. Therefore, the economic power of Britain and the United States does not need to be cared about, but it cannot be ignored. In the future, as long as the people of China and Japan work closely together, the construction of the Co-prosperity Sphere can be completed.

### Wang Kemin Arrived in Nanjing Yesterday to Report on the Process of Taking Office and to Seek Instructions on Administrative Policies

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, reported to Chairman Wang on the process of taking office and sought instructions on future administrative policies in North China. He took a plane from Qingdao on the afternoon of the 14th with Shao Donghu, a counselor of the Commission, and flew to Nanjing at 5:15 PM.

Qingdao, 14th (Central News Agency) Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, arrived in Qingdao by plane on the 12th and returned to his private residence to rest. On the 13th, he met with a group of reporters and expressed his firm beliefs regarding the most important issue of grain in North China and other points. The general idea was that the successive deaths of Yin Tong and Zhu Shen were not only a great loss to him personally, but also to the country. On the 3rd of this month, he received an urgent telegram from Chairman Wang and immediately rushed to the capital. At that time, due to the large number of government affairs, he could not ask for detailed instructions, so he planned to visit again another day, so he hurriedly went to Beijing to take office. He and former Chairman Zhu had a close personal friendship and often exchanged opinions and consulted each other. Therefore, he intends to follow the example of former Chairman Zhu and strengthen his policies. The most urgent issue to be resolved at the moment is the grain issue. Regarding this point, the Materials and Price Handling Committee is actively preparing countermeasures as the center, especially the Standing Committee members, Shi Jing, and Wang Yintai, who are the most involved. Director Wang is currently focusing on regulating funds, while Director Wang is focusing on political negotiations. Therefore, he believes that the fundamental policy for solving the grain problem has long been decided by the authorities and is being actively implemented. Although it has not yet reached the stage of publication, it can often be seen in the facts within days.

### Agenda for the Greater East Asia Literary Conference

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) The Second Greater East Asia Literary Conference, organized by the Japanese Literature Patriotic Association, is being actively prepared with the assistance of the Japanese Army, Navy, and the Three Provinces of Greater East Asia.

### Many Indian Defense Soldiers Deserting

Guangzhou, 14th (Central News Agency) According to a New Delhi telegram, the number of desertions of Indian soldiers in the Indian Defense Forces has recently increased sharply. Although the authorities have been seriously monitoring, there are still groups attempting to escape by force. Therefore, the number of soldiers feels insufficient, and the Indian Governor's Office is also very embarrassed. It has issued a proclamation to various states, saying that it will improve the treatment of Indian soldiers in the future and order the rapid replenishment of insufficient soldiers. According to the analysis, the mass desertion of Indian soldiers is due to dissatisfaction with the treatment of the British, and the strong independent air inside and outside India and the increasingly fierce anti-British sentiment are one of the reasons. However, the results of the countermeasures taken by the British authorities are still quite questionable.

### Grew Again Warns the Americans: Do Not Underestimate Japan's Strength

Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to a New York dispatch, former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, now State Department Advisor Grew, gave a speech yesterday at Columbia University.

Grew spoke in a serious tone, saying that in the war between the United States and Japan, a great deal of blood, sweat, and tears would likely be sacrificed. We should not completely rely on the soldiers fighting on the front lines, but must rely on all the people of the nation, he said.

### Naval Air Force Deals Heavy Blow to U.S. Forces on Rendova Island; Eleven Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Central News Agency, Shonan, July 14th.

### Soviet Offensive Plan Fails; German Forces Advance Victoriously; Two Large Soviet Tank Formations East and Northeast of Belgorod Destroyed by Germans

Central News Agency, Berlin, July 14th. Colonel Hammar, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, announced that the attrition of Soviet forces continues. On Sunday, another 407 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the two major battle zones north and south of Kursk. The German counter-offensive is intensifying, mopping up the remnants of Soviet forces and repelling their reserves. Because the Soviet forces attempted to relieve the encircled areas, the battle zone greatly expanded, and the opened gap has stretched to about 250 kilometers. The Soviet Union's original offensive plan has not only been thwarted by the German forces, but the German counter-offensive has forced the Soviet army to sacrifice a large number of troops. On Sunday, the number of Soviet reserve troops surrendering was countless. As a result of the battle north of Belgorod on Sunday, the German army has extended its bridgehead east of the entire Donets River and outside the Psel River, cutting off the connection between two large Soviet tank formations and at least six Soviet divisions. South of Orel, the positions of important German strongholds have also advanced. Although Soviet resistance is strong, it ultimately cannot stop the organized actions of the German forces. The Soviet Union used entire divisions to resist the advance of the German spearhead units and used multiple tank regiments to defend against the German flank attacks. These concentrated Soviet tank formations were blocked by German Tiger tanks, anti-aircraft guns, and flat-trajectory guns. To the east and northwest of Belgorod, two large Soviet tank formations were destroyed, with tank losses amounting to no fewer than 336 vehicles. In addition, 70 Soviet tanks were destroyed in the south of Orel and north of the front-line bend during the Soviet relief operations. The Soviet army was greatly defeated there. At the same time, in these tank battles, aerial attacks on Soviet concentrations were particularly effective. Dive bombers and tank-busting bombers repeatedly attacked Soviet tank concentrations and their movements, either defeating them or destroying them. Soviet grenadiers never advanced after the tanks were destroyed. At the same time, German fighters once again maintained their air superiority, with no fewer than 103 Soviet aircraft shot down, including 27 shot down by German anti-aircraft guns.

### Two Military Commanders Replaced in Spain

Central News Agency, Madrid, July 14th. According to an announcement published in yesterday's official gazette, the Spanish government has ordered the replacement of the Western Army commander on the Atlantic coast and the Canary Islands.

### Australian Foreign Minister Arrives in the United States

Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to a Washington dispatch last night, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt has arrived in the United States from England. It is reported that Evatt will meet with President Roosevelt before traveling to Canada and then returning to Australia.

### U.S. Senator Hopes to Repeal the Chinese Exclusion Act

Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to Washington, the bill to repeal the U.S. Chinese Exclusion Act was shelved in the Senate Naturalization Committee last month. Now, Representative Studer, when meeting with a United Press reporter on the 13th, believes that repealing the Exclusion Act is the best way to buy the greatest friendship from Chongqing. He also said that Americans should consider that this is in their own best interests, and that by repealing the Act, the United States can obtain Chongqing's assistance in the war against Japan. Therefore, he hopes to pass the Act before this autumn. From this, we can see that the so-called humanitarianism of the United States is based on seeking its own interests, and how deeply rooted the concept of racial inequality is can be imagined.

### New Capital Tri-Daily

Skyscrapers, Night Flowers, Grand Opening Tomorrow Night. Undoubtedly another creation of the New Capital Hotel.

Towering high atop the seventh floor of the New Capital, lush with flowers and trees, dimly lit and scenic murals. Under the grape trellis, it is suitable for heart-to-heart talks: the open-air dance floor is suitable for dancing: it is a nocturnal gathering place, a summer retreat, comparable to Mount Lu; there is no hot summer here.

"Young, novel, satisfactory!" The New Capital always stands at the forefront of the times! (Two)

### Battles Intensify in Southeastern Sicily; British Advance Halted Before Most German Forces Deployed

Central News Agency, Berlin, July 14th. Captain Setorius, a military correspondent for the Transocean News Agency, stated that the Anti-Axis forces, taking advantage of their air and naval superiority, landed a large number of fresh troops (at least two to three divisions) in southeastern Sicily on Sunday night. Most of these fresh troops joined the U.S. Seventh Army, so that General Patton could not only defend the bridgeheads established at Licata and Gela after the initial landing, but also expand these bridgeheads. On the Licata bridgehead front, Canadian troops, operating under the command of U.S. commanders, have advanced twelve kilometers to the west and north. Whether Patton's right flank has advanced from Gela to the east and southeast to a certain extent and can maintain continuous contact with General Montgomery's left flank operating in the Pozzallo to Rosolini area is still unknown. The main landing points for the British Eighth Army were Syracuse Bay and the small ports of Augusta, adjacent to the south of Cape Crosi. On Monday, a large number of troops landed at these two locations and immediately advanced north along the coast. The intention of the British command seems to be focused on reaching the Catania Plain as quickly as possible. The German operational reserves have blocked the advancing British forces northwest of Augusta, where fierce fighting is now taking place. The central part of the British Eighth Army on the slopes of the mountains west of Syracuse and Avola is currently holding its position temporarily, but General Montgomery's left flank is very active. Its main direction of attack is from Pachino via Rosolini (which was occupied by the British) towards Ragusa. The British are constantly increasing the number of tanks operating in the central area. The British have not used field artillery on a large scale, but in areas close to the coast, the long-range guns of the British fleet can compensate for the lack of field artillery. In the interior, large formations of the British Air Force have appeared to compensate for the lack of field artillery. The Axis forces facing the brunt of the fighting are currently local reserve forces operating in the southeastern area. Most of the reserve forces have not yet been deployed. It is rumored that the Anti-Axis forces have also landed at Trapani on the west coast and Porto Empedocle on the south coast. This has not yet been confirmed. In general, Sicily is only part of the vast Mediterranean area, and the Anti-Axis forces, with their naval and air superiority, are able to use this area as a theater of operations. It is estimated that the ten divisions they have landed on Sicily have not reached half of the military strength they have concentrated in the Middle East and North Africa in the past few months. Moreover, the troop transport ships used by the Anti-Axis forces in Sicily have not reached two-thirds of the tonnage of all their ships in the Mediterranean. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces can either use all of their forces in Sicily, or attack the southern flank of Europe with the same or greater force. In short, the Anti-Axis forces are not threatened in the Mediterranean, so they may soon unleash all of their concentrated operational potential to launch a major offensive.

Axis Forces Maintain Original Positions

Central News Agency, London, July 14th. According to Berlana, a Sicily special correspondent for the German News Agency, there was fierce fighting throughout Sicily on Monday. German and Italian forces everywhere maintained their positions. It is said that the German and Italian forces launched a swift counterattack, wiping out a large part of the U.S. forces advancing from the southern coast of the island. A U.S. tank formation approached the carefully concealed Axis positions in the mountains and was attacked on its flanks by German anti-tank weapons, resulting in the complete annihilation of the U.S. forces. In the area of British tank operations on the east coast of the island, the Axis forces maintained their defensive line very successfully, and as a result, the British forces had to halt their attack due to heavy casualties. According to British sources, the attacking Anti-Axis forces encountered fierce resistance from a large number of the latest 75mm cannons, which fired incessantly from both sides throughout the day. According to a Reuters correspondent stationed in Washington, it was widely reported in Washington last night that the Axis forces were preparing to join part of their main forces in the battle against the U.S. forces advancing from Gela. News from the Anti-Axis headquarters in North Africa reported that air reconnaissance teams had seen Axis forces making significant movements south from the interior of Sicily. The rumors of a fierce Axis counterattack against U.S. forces in southern Sicily largely refer to the Gela area. Washington believes that this is the prelude to a major battle, with both German and Italian forces involved in the counterattack. Last night, the German News Agency learned from the German High Command that although the Anti-Axis forces had made victorious counterattacks in several places on Sicily, Berlin believed that the battle for Sicily was still in its initial stages. For military reasons, the details of the current stage of the battle cannot be released. However, the enemy has begun to feel significant supply difficulties due to the serious losses suffered by transport ships. The attacks by the German and Italian air and naval forces on the Anti-Axis ships have seriously hindered the operations of the British and American forces. The German side stated that from a military perspective, the position of the Anti-Axis forces is extremely unfavorable, as their supplies must be transported across the sea and their base of operations is only a relatively small coastal area. Berlin explained the severity of the Anti-Axis ship losses by saying that in the first twelve days of July, the British and Americans lost a total of 300,000 tons of ships. The success of the defense of Sicily is due to the large formations of Axis air forces being able to brave extremely heavy anti-aircraft fire and launch fierce attacks on Anti-Axis transport ships. It is said that two giant troop transport ships, totaling 20,000 tons, were directly hit and sunk near the southern coast of Sicily on Monday. A 5,000-ton munitions ship was also sunk. Several barges nearby were also destroyed. In addition, eleven ships carrying troops and heavy equipment, totaling 40,000 tons, were also directly hit and severely damaged, forcing the Anti-Axis forces to abandon them. Furthermore, six fully loaded landing craft were hit and set on fire by German fighters, causing very serious losses to the U.S. forces.

Fighting Will Reach Catania

Central News Agency, Rome, July 14th. ANSA News: According to the message on the situation in Sicily published in yesterday's Italian "Giornale d'Italia", it can be seen that Catania, the second largest city on the island, will soon have fighting. After occupying the port of Augusta, the British and American forces have advanced along the coastal highway to a location 50 kilometers from Catania. The city has a population of 220,000 and is not only the most important commercial area on the island, but its scenery is also the best on the island. After the eruption of Mount Etna in 1693, which destroyed the entire island, the city was rebuilt according to a unified plan. The soil and building materials are mostly lava, so the city's air-raid shelters should be the best on the island.

### Rumor: Eisenhower Has Returned to North Africa

Central News Agency, Lisbon, July 14th. According to a dispatch from Algiers, General Eisenhower, Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis forces in the Mediterranean, returned to North Africa from Sicily yesterday.

### German Forces Switch to a Major Offensive on the Eastern Front

The major battle in the central sector of the Orel-Kursk-Belgorod region has already begun. Two million German and Soviet troops are engaged in fierce offensive and defensive battles in the Kursk salient, which are intensifying daily. The mobilization of people and material by both sides is extremely active. On the 7th, the German authorities announced that the battle of Orel-Belgorod had transitioned from a "counter-offensive" to a new stage of "offensive war." Elite German divisions have broken through important Soviet lines in various locations, crushing several enemy positions. On the first day of the counter-offensive, the 5th of this month, the German forces were subjected to a fierce attack by Soviet tank groups, but the German forces accurately identified the technical defects of the Soviet tanks, skillfully attacked them, and quickly annihilated 120 of them. On the second day, the German forces added new elite infantry reinforcements and the new "Tiger" tank units to meet the latest Soviet tank groups and the strongest assault mechanized units, penetrating deep into the enemy's lines in one fell swoop, achieving great results, and destroying 196 tanks. On the third day, the 7th of this month, they seized the initiative of the offensive war, and the situation changed into a formal large-scale mobile war.

German "Tiger" Tanks Deployed for the First Time

This battle is not a simple battle on a broad front. On the Eastern Front, centered on Kursk, there are many individual battles taking place along the line from Orel to Belgorod. Their scale and qualitative intensity are comparable to the large-scale offensives that occurred on the Eastern Front in the past two years. The most noteworthy aspects of the current situation are the intensity of the new tank formations and air combat of the two armies. In addition to the U.S.-made "Lee" and "Grant" tanks, the Soviet army also deployed the newly touted T-34 tanks in an attempt to break into the German lines. The German army first deployed sappers, anti-tank grenade launchers, and cleared minefields in front of the German forces, and then used tank units to switch to the offensive. Germany deployed the latest "Tiger" tanks to the Eastern Front for the first time, using their equipment and firepower to suppress Soviet tanks. On the 6th alone, 196 Soviet tanks were destroyed.

637 Aircraft Shot Down

The German Air Force not only provided cover for dive bomber attacks, but its fighter squadrons also engaged the Soviet Air Force in major air battles, recently creating a record of shooting down 637 aircraft. Comparing the air force strengths of the two armies, with the ratio of German to Soviet aircraft at 1.5 to 1, the German forces hold a dominant advantage, showing that the German Air Force's spirit is still as high as ever. Moreover, the German forces are gradually advancing eastward from the south of Orel and the north of Belgorod, and are pushing the large Soviet army protruding to the west of Kursk into a large encirclement. If this move is successful, the expected human and material losses to the Soviet Union will be very significant.

Soviet Union Defends with All Its Might

Since March 23, although the past few months have been superficially peaceful, the two armies, who have been buried in preparations for battle, suddenly chose the same area as the main battlefield, for two reasons:

(1) The traffic in this area is more convenient than elsewhere, making it easier for the two armies to assemble and move.

(2) The area between Belgorod and Orel can be said to be the crucial point of the center of the Eastern Front, serving as the center of operations.

However, German military personnel in Berlin are trying to avoid explaining the developments of this battle, and unanimously maintain that this decisive battle is not the "summer offensive" that the German army claims. They point out that the Soviet Union is publicizing this as the beginning of the German summer offensive as a propaganda tactic to cover up the failure of the Soviet army's own offensive, and claim that the Soviet Union will inevitably repeat the failure of the Kharkov offensive. In fact, according to reports from war correspondents on the front lines, the Soviet army, taking advantage of the convenient traffic network concentrated in this area near Orel and Belgorod, assembled a large army of one million, devoting all its efforts to building strong defensive positions, and attempting to seize the opportunity to take the offensive. Moreover, the Soviet defensive positions almost resemble permanent positions, and the internal positions in the rear gradually weaken, which proves that they have the intention of taking the offensive against Germany.

The Seriousness of the Situation

The German army has resolutely endured this offensive by the Soviet Union because the German army has already had three experiences of transitioning from a "counter-offensive" to an "offensive" posture since the start of the war against the Soviet Union. The difficult first operation was last summer when General Timoshenko launched a large-scale offensive against the German army in the Kharkov area, leading to a counter-offensive and immediately changing to a summer offensive. The second was also in the Kharkov area. Taking advantage of the momentum of the winter offensive at the beginning of this year, the outstanding German divisions in Field Marshal von Manstein's operation, the Hitler Division, and the Greater Germany Division, stopped the fierce offensive of the Soviet army, and transitioned from a counter-offensive to an offensive, securing strategic ground. This time, the German army had already known about the Soviet army's offensive operation prepared in this area against the German army, so it concentrated as many reserve troops as possible in the Orel and Belgorod areas. On the night of the 7th, their spokesman said:

"The reason why the German army had strictly maintained silence on the Eastern Front before was to adopt an inductive operation, intending to inflict as many material and human losses as possible on the Soviet Union."

Although the German army has not yet mobilized its main tank forces and taken a true offensive, the German and Soviet armies will certainly carry out tremendous mobilizations of people and materials in the future to expand the battlefield and intensify the fighting. The movements of the entire Eastern Front in the future will be seen in the situation of these few days. Therefore, the published news is extremely cautious and concise, and deserves attention.

### Self-Defense Corps on Duty, Investigating and Prohibiting Bad Habits

The Municipal Baojia Committee stated that when the Municipal Self-Defense Corps members are on duty, they often exhibit various bad habits such as being shirtless, smoking cigarettes, watching street operas, and dozing off, which is highly inappropriate. The organization of the Municipal Self-Defense Corps was originally intended to enhance the self-defense capabilities of citizens and ensure local security. The duty of Self-Defense Corps members is to assist the military and police in jointly maintaining security, and they should serve diligently in the spirit of autonomy, which is the foundation of local self-government. If these habits are not strictly rectified, they will greatly affect the future of self-government. In addition to sending personnel to secretly investigate at any time, the committee has also ordered each office to instruct its subordinates to strictly investigate and prohibit such behavior. Those who dare to disobey will be punished immediately in accordance with the reward and punishment measures, in order to rectify these habits.

### Water Company Stipulates 50% Increase in Water Rates; Calculated Based on Water Meter Readings from August 1st; Company Lost Approximately 8.8 Million Last Year

(Central News Agency, Shanghai, July 14th) The Japanese military-managed Shanghai Waterworks Company only converted old currency prices to new legal tender prices for consumer usage in May of last year. Subsequently, in order to cooperate with the price policy, it intended to suppress the increase in water rates. However, recently, due to the soaring price of raw materials and the increase in salaries for employees, the current water rate structure has resulted in large losses (approximately 8.82 million last year), making it difficult to manage. Now, it has been decided that starting with the water meter readings on August 1st, the current water rates will be increased by 50% to balance income and expenditure. The water rates of the Shanghai Waterworks Company have always been extremely low, about one-third cheaper than the water rates of the Central China Water and Electricity Company (2.3 fen per cubic meter). Although the Shanghai Waterworks Company is increasing water rates this time, it will still be only half of the water rates of the Central China Water and Electricity Company, and will also be lower than the water rates in North China and Manchuria. In addition, the company has decided to change the graduated water rate system to a single rate system to conserve water.

### Joint Venture Company Rice Ordering: Part of the Order Has Arrived in Shanghai, Next Period's Ration Can Be Increased

According to the Shanghai News Agency's inquiry with the Rice and Grain District Management Company, the first batch of 20,000 piculs of rice (reported by Datong News Agency as 100,000 piculs) arrived here from the Suzhou production area on the 10th, and will be available for purchase today.

Strict Management of Joint Venture Company Members

The Shanghai Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company previously handled member registration, and certificates were issued in accordance with regulations. Those who have not joined the company will not be allowed to operate in the food industry. The company is striving to guide the public food supply onto the right track. If any rice merchant who has joined the joint venture company is found to be negligent in service, violates regulations for personal gain, or hinders public interest, they will be ordered to withdraw from the joint venture company, and their registration certificate or registration book will be revoked, and they will never be allowed to engage in the same business again.

Next Period's Ration Should Be Increased

According to Mr. Zhang, Chairman of the Municipal Grain Committee: The distribution of household rice in the city was reduced to one Sheng in the 40th period, and the dates were also delayed for a year. As for the 41st period and the 19th period in the urban area, they were also temporarily changed to one Sheng per person due to the above reasons, but the monthly period has been on time. Now, the first batch of a large amount of national rice from the Joint Management Company arrived in Shanghai daily starting from the 10th, and the rice for this period is also mostly supplied by the company, and the ration will definitely be increased starting from the next period, or the original amount of grain will be restored.

41st Period to Be Sold Universally Starting Tomorrow

The rice shops in the two concessions and the rice sales offices of the Public Works Department will simultaneously start selling the 41st period of household rice tomorrow. Citizens can purchase one Sheng of white rice, broken rice, or brown rice from designated rice shops with the No. 41 joint ticket of the rice purchase certificate. The selling price is 4.5 yuan. The validity period is until the 22nd of this month, but all rice shops and rice sales offices will temporarily suspend rice sales for one day on the 20th.

### Commemorating the Recovery of the Concessions: Grand Sale from August 1st for Three Days, and Window Display Competition

The Shanghai concessions will soon be recovered. The city's merchants and people will have a grand celebration to express this historically significant event. The Municipal Propaganda Department, in order to guide public propaganda, has jointly organized a shop window propaganda competition with the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The overall plan has been decided. All industry associations will mobilize all shops in the city to hold a three-day celebration grand sale from August 1st to 3rd. From the 1st to the 7th, displays related to concession propaganda will be arranged in the windows. Experts will be hired to judge. Those with excellent results will be given prizes, bonuses, and certificates to encourage them. The detailed measures are currently being drafted and will be announced and implemented once decided.

### A Visit to the Shen Bao North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition

— Feng Weichang

For the past two days, the Shen Bao has been holding the "North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition," which has been widely publicized. Despite the muggy weather, I also went to visit the art treasures with excitement, and to witness the ideal "righteous and courageous" scene of everyone competing to purchase items to help disaster relief.

The venue is located on the fourth floor of the former HSBC Bank on the Bund. Its surroundings are majestic and magnificent buildings overlooking the Far East. It faces the Huangpu River, which is bright and open, cool and comfortable, without any urban atmosphere. Although the weather is dull, the visitors are still particularly enthusiastic.

Among the exhibits, the highest priced item is the handwritten vertical scroll by Sun Yat-sen donated by Mr. Ding Fubao (priced at 100,000 yuan). I think that those who respect and commemorate the founding father and are concerned about the disaster victims in North China will not hesitate to pay this amount. Next is the running script by Chairman Wang donated by Han Jingqi, priced at 10,000 yuan. Perhaps during the competition, someone will offer a higher price to obtain it. Let us wait and see. Secondly, the original works of Kaizhong Gate and the masterpieces of famous people in ancient and modern times are extremely rare treasures. In a word: "A dazzling array of beautiful things!" In addition, there is also a five-carat diamond ring donated by Mr. Sansheng, which is extremely valuable and priced at 160,000 yuan.

Yesterday and today, the young painters Chen Penglu and Chen Honglu brothers, and the young painter Qian Hailong, were specially invited to paint on the spot and sell their works for charity. Many kind people also donated a lot of treasures, so the visitors and buyers were even more crowded.

The initiator also went to watch again, as if there was still more to see. It is said that the guests who attended the event totaled no less than several thousand, including Chinese and foreign celebrities, scholars, and artists, which is considered the grandest event of its kind for emergency relief in North China.

The organizers of the event also hope that people from all walks of life will enthusiastically donate and purchase items, achieving two goals with one action, and striving for perfection, taking it as their responsibility to save as many lives as possible. After my visit, I also sympathize and appeal for it.

### Rationed Sugar Supply for the Fifth Period: Deadline for Payment and Delivery (Most of the Ninth Period Cigarettes Have Been Picked Up)

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants General Business Office, with the approval of the military authorities, handled the fifth phase of rationed sugar distribution and the purchase of sugar for June by special group users (i.e., type B retailers). Preparations have been completed, and sugar purchase certificates will be issued within three days from yesterday to tomorrow, and the following methods are specified:

Deadline for Delivery to Avoid Mis-Selling Sugar

(1) Retailers who sell rationed sugar should bring the previously issued blank receipts with their seals affixed to the office within the above-mentioned deadline to fill in the amount of items to receive the purchase certificate. And pay the payment to the designated sugar company before the 17th of this month, and deliver the goods no later than the 20th of this month, so as to avoid the date of mis-selling sugar. (2) Special group users should also bring the purchase application receipt to the office within the above-mentioned deadline to exchange for a purchase certificate. And pay the payment to the designated sugar company before the 17th of this month. Each user should bring the deposit receipt when exchanging the purchase certificate to the office in order to adjust the amount separately. As for the sugar bag deposit, starting from this period, it will be directly deposited with the office in accordance with the provisions of Announcement No. 119 to serve as a long-term guarantee. (3) All users who were previously given mandatory allocations will be included in the special group and should pay the certificate money as required. It is reported that the quantity and price of the fifth phase of rationed sugar will be temporarily the same as the previous phase, and the cooperative will officially announce it within days. The sugar price for type B users and special allocations will be calculated according to the adjusted new price, plus a retail donation of 2%.

Slight Reduction in the Quantity of Cigarettes Allocated in the Ninth Phase

The China Tobacco Allocation Association has notified all wholesalers and retailers to pay for and pick up the ninth phase of allocated cigarettes. Most shops have now picked up the goods, and the ninth phase of cigarettes will be sold soon. It is reported that the quantity of goods dispatched in this phase is slightly smaller than the previous phase due to the moldy season. The type of cigarettes still adopts a mixed system.

### Shanghai Will Promote Income Tax: Tax Policy Will Change After the Recovery of the Concessions

The Ministry of Foreign Affairs of the National Government and the Japanese authorities signed an agreement on June 30 in the capital to return the Shanghai Public Concession. From August 1st, the government will implement the recovery of all administrative rights of the Public Concession. The issue of recovering the French Concession has also been negotiated several times and has achieved satisfactory results. It is reported that the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance of the National Government and the Tax Investigation Office of the Ministry of Finance are actively researching and promoting the income tax plan and detailed implementation methods for investigating tax evasion in order to prepare for the unified promotion of tax policy as the time for the recovery of the two concessions approaches.

### The Fourth Phase Has Not Been Sold Out: Postponing the Deadline

According to a reporter from Guofeng News Agency, the Shanghai Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office decided to issue the fourth phase of allocated edible oil in the city and the two concessions at the same time. However, among the total amount of more than 8,000 dans issued, 4-5% has not been completed. It has been decided again, hoping that residents in a few areas who have not yet obtained four taels of edible oil per person will not have any doubts, because the office will not handle the special allocation of oil for the fourth phase and the oil for restaurants until the universal sale of oil is completed, and then it will be handled according to the situation.

### Painting and Drama Associations Welcome Director Liang of the Propaganda Department

Since the National Government issued an order appointing Liang Xiuyu, consultant of the Propaganda Department, as the Director of the Propaganda Department of Shanghai Special City, he has been actively preparing and planning future work policies and is quite busy. In order to express their welcome, the city's Chinese and Japanese cultural circles, initiated by the China Painting and Drama Association, held a tea party at the International Hotel yesterday afternoon. More than 100 representatives from newspapers and magazines attended. Feng Jie, the former Director of the Shanghai Office of the Propaganda Department of the National Government, attended as a guest. Shangjue Dailang, Director of General Affairs of the China Painting and Drama Association, entrusted by the Propaganda Department of the National Government, delivered a welcome speech, followed by Feng Jie. Finally, Director Liang of the Propaganda Department delivered a speech. The situation was enthusiastic.

### Social Association Promotes Welfare Undertakings

Since its establishment, the Chinese Social Undertakings Association, under the leadership of Director Ding, has organized undertakings that have become quite widespread, especially in the capital, such as the Vocational Guidance Center, Children's Education Institute, Obstetrics Hospital, Mass Funeral Home, Mobile Library Car, Small Loan, etc., which are beneficial to society. The association has set up promotion departments in various provinces and cities. The Shanghai Promotion Department was established in January of this year, located at No. 69, Zhaofeng Village, Yuyuan Road. The undertakings that have been undertaken include the Personnel Consulting Office, Free Tutoring School, Labor Children's School, and Labor Clinic. Currently under preparation are the Poor Children's Sales Group, etc., which are all welfare undertakings that benefit the poor and the public.

### Wu Chao Succeeds as Chief of Zhabei Police Bureau

Sun Jiang, the chief of the Zhabei Police Bureau of this city, applied for resignation due to illness, which was approved by Lu Ying, the chief of the Municipal Police Headquarters. However, because the northern district is important and the railway station is nearby, the supervision of police affairs in the district cannot be interrupted for a day. Therefore, Wu Chao, the chief of the Inspection Department, was specially transferred to serve as the chief of the Zhabei Police Bureau. After receiving the order, Wu went to the bureau to take office a few days ago. The position of chief of the Inspection Department will be temporarily held concurrently by Zhu Susheng.

### Welfare Bureau Director Concerned About the Health of Those in Care

Sun Mingqi, Director of the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, inspected the relief home (Yelai Road, Nanshi) hosted by the bureau for the second time the other day and gave a speech, saying: "When this bureau took over in March, I came to inspect it once and saw that there were many people in care with dark skin and thin bodies and many who suffered from skin diseases. Now I see that the faces of all the people in care have gradually become rosy and the skin diseases have been mostly cured. However, the municipal government stipulates that the food ration for each person in the hospital is 3.2 yuan per day, which is really meager. It has been clearly ordered that the investigation and statistics section should investigate the prices of commodities before purchasing food and report them to the director for approval. The general affairs section then purchases them, the accounting section inspects and receives the payments, and then hands them over to the supply section for safekeeping and distribution. All staff members have the responsibility to supervise each other. Every morning before selling, a list of the daily supplies for the people in care should be prepared and posted in the hospital, indicating how many yuan for rice, how many yuan for meals, and how many yuan for sugar, oil, salt, firewood, etc. Whether they are consistent should be verified and weighed daily by representatives elected by the people in care in rotation in order to achieve perfection. The staff in the hospital are poorly paid and extraordinarily poor, but they should have a spirit of sacrifice. I hope they will work hard and conscientiously."

### Shen Bao Cup: North China Relief Donation

The Shen Bao Cup North China Relief Donation yesterday continued to receive 500 yuan from Qiu Xianghua and 400 yuan from Zhou Shulian, totaling 900 yuan in storage vouchers. The balance is 5,900 yuan.

### Little Painter Paints for Guests

This newspaper is hosting the North China Emergency Relief Painting and Calligraphy Charity Exhibition. Starting at 3:00 pm today, young painter Qian Hailong will be specially invited to paint for guests to help add to the fun. Mr. Qian held a solo exhibition at the Daxin Painting Hall in 1940 and 1941, which was well received. He also participated in the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association and won many silver cups and silver tripods. In 1942, he participated in the painting and calligraphy charity exhibition of the orphanage and the painting and calligraphy charity exhibition for the relief of overseas Chinese in Nanyang. In 1943, he won first place in the calligraphy competition of the Confucian Society. He is currently 14 years old and has studied English and Japanese at Liangcai and Mu'ertang Second Night School. He is also a student at Jinan Affiliated Middle School and will enter the first year of senior high school in the regular middle school next semester. Children are welcome to visit.

### Prohibition of Radio Application for Permits: Deadline is the 20th of This Month

The Japanese Army and Navy authorities issued a notice at the end of last year, stating that anyone who manufactures, uses, possesses, or transfers prohibited radios must apply for a permit from the authorities before July 20 and provide detailed instructions for everything. Those who do not complete the formalities within the deadline will be severely punished according to military law. The authorities recently issued another statement as follows: The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Dispatch Army in China and the Supreme Commander of the Chinese Fleet issued a notice on December 18 last year prohibiting the manufacture, use, possession, or transfer of radios. The application for permits in the Shanghai area will be closed on the 20th of this month, and those who violate the regulations will be cracked down on immediately. In the future, without legitimate reasons or in violation of regulations, (1) radios with more than seven tubes, (2) radios that can listen to frequencies outside the range of 550 kHz to 1500 kHz, (3) those who manufacture, transfer, or use radios that can be arbitrarily changed into two-way radios for transmission or communication without reporting to the responsible office.

### In the Midst of Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings: A Visit to the Poor and Sick Relief Association

After Guan Ting, Lin Kanghou, and Yuan Ludeng, three elders, published an article "Thoughts on the Unified Promotion of Charitable Undertakings," it aroused the attention and interest of the general public in the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association. It turns out that there is such an organization for relief and guidance of charitable groups and civil organizations in Shanghai! In order to satisfy the hopes of the society, the reporter specially visited the association and recorded its actual situation so that readers can see the bright side that is working seriously at this time and place.

The Motives and Nature of the Establishment

Number 402, Continental Building, the words "Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association" written horizontally on the closed door of an ordinary office told me that I had arrived at my destination. The staff were working quietly but nervously, and almost no one noticed a reporter's visit. A worker led me to the "Committee Room," where a person in charge warmly shook hands with the reporter and immediately answered the reporter frankly! No, it is also the questions that today's socially minded people have about the association.

The Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association was established last autumn because the number of poor and sick people in Shanghai increased day by day, which aroused the compassion of people with hearts. As the association's "Origin" states: "What we see every day are pigeon loft households, homeless crowds, malnutrition, disease, and bodies lying dead on the road, numbering in the dozens or hundreds every day, and the number of children's bodies is often more than double that of adults, which is especially alarming." If this phenomenon is not automatically eliminated by more affluent citizens, the consequences for the future of society and the country will be unbearable. Therefore, Wen Lanting and other celebrities enthusiastic about charitable undertakings invited like-minded people to establish the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association and launched a fundraising campaign to raise 5 million yuan in new currency for emergency relief for the poor and sick. They first assisted those whose situation was the most miserable, whose affairs were the most dangerous, whose rescue was urgent, and whose effect was the greatest. The main subsidized undertakings are (1) emergency relief for epidemics (summer), (2) porridge and clothing distribution (winter), (3) education and training of homeless children (proactive), (4) relief for the old, weak, disabled, and thin (passive), and (5) medical treatment and medicine distribution. As for the method, it is "to selectively subsidize charitable organizations in this city that have the same purpose as this association and have achieved results, based on the severity and urgency of the situation." Therefore, the association itself does not organize any charitable undertakings and has become an agency for supporting charitable organizations. (To be continued)

Economic News and Commentary

### Enterprises and Talent

Yesterday, in discussing the pathological state of the Chinese economy, there was one matter that I felt compelled to mention: the relationship between enterprises and talent in the Chinese economic sphere. Recently, there has been a trend of rapid development in various domestic enterprises, but the most difficult aspect is the lack of true talent, especially talent applicable to the industrial and agricultural sectors. On the job-seeking side, there is a lament of "overstaffing," while on the employer's side, there is a cry of "talent is hard to find." The reason for this is that job seekers tend to be ordinary talents, while the business world seeks specialized technicians, especially specialized talents suited for the industrial and agricultural fields. In recent years, the nation has faced many crises, and all endeavors have been neglected. Institutions for cultivating talent have not yet paid attention to this point. Coupled with transportation barriers and the dispersion of talent, the business world often laments the difficulty in finding talent. Recently, I heard that those in charge of running agricultural and industrial vocational schools, with the aim of training specialized talent suitable for agriculture and industry, are gathering experts to discuss solutions. From this, one can see that business people, feeling the lack of talent, are urgently trying to train their own. However, this matter is of great importance, involving countless details, and is by no means something that private forces can handle alone. It is hoped that those in charge of education and business leaders who bear great expectations will all pay attention and work together to cultivate industrial and agricultural talent to meet the needs, both as preparation for improving their own industries and as a contribution to post-war production. At the same time, we must ensure that many graduates have something to do, so that they do not graduate from school and become unemployed in society. In particular, educators should be aware of the great responsibility and quickly work together with business leaders to build a solid foundation for the business world and to find a proper path for the future industrial and agricultural talent. The development of the new China's industrial and agricultural enterprises depends on this!

### Ministries of Finance, Food, and Industry to Confer on Unified Food Control

Nanjing, 14th (Central Social News Agency): The procurement and distribution mechanisms for supplies in Central China are now under our own unified control, following the Japanese implementation of a new policy towards China. All matters are being promoted under the new organization of the Commercial Unification Council. Regarding the procurement of food, the Ministry of Food of the National Government directly manages this transitional phase. Subsequently, as a result of the Ministry of Food's efforts, the food industry association organized the Rice Cooperative Society, which is progressing rapidly. Therefore, the issue of whether the Commercial Unification Council should uniformly control food is being re-examined. This afternoon at 1:00 PM, National Government Finance Minister Zhou, Food Minister Gu, Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry, and related personnel from the Japanese Embassy held their first consultation at Minister Zhou's residence. It is expected that liaison meetings will continue on this issue in the future. In terms of promoting the unified control of materials in Central China, the results are highly anticipated.

### List of Members of the Wuhan Materials Control Council

Hankou, 14th (Central News Agency): The Wuhan Branch of the Materials Control Review Committee is about to be established. The mission of this committee is to control materials, suppress prices, and other matters. It is expected to stabilize the people's livelihood in the province in the future. The list of members of the committee is as follows: Chairman: Yang Kuiyi, Governor of Hubei Province; Vice Chairman: Zheng Zuyu, Governor of Jiangxi Province; Zhang Ren, Mayor of Hankou Special City; Committee Members: Chen Weizheng, Yao Yixin, Advisor Enokiya, Chief Staff Officer Ogawa, Department Head Otowa, Department Head Kazusumi, Naval Attache Okino, Consul General Takatsu, and Cai Wenshi, Sun Ditang, Hashimoto Seiji; Secretaries: Youshi Zhendong, Xu Shenzhi, Zhou Lianzhen, Lieutenant Colonel Yamamoto, Major Nakano, Endo, Chief of the Third Section of the Liaison Department, Lieutenant Commander Fujishima, and Vice Consul Matsuo.

### Municipal Materials Investigation Committee Divides into Three Zones for Investigation

Since its establishment, the Materials Investigation Committee has set up an office in the Ma Ting Building on Jing'an Temple Road to begin its work. Regarding the overall task of investigating stockpiled materials, Chinese and Japanese investigators from the committee's investigation team hold investigator liaison meetings on a regular basis to communicate and exchange ideas on the investigation work, and are proceeding step by step. After several recent investigator liaison meetings, a concrete plan for investigating materials has been agreed upon, and personnel will be dispatched to conduct investigations separately, starting immediately. The scope of the investigation is temporarily divided into three major areas: the First Special Zone, the Second Special Zone, and the Urban Area (including Nanshi, Huxi, Zhabei, and Pudong). It is reported that the initial targets of investigation are essential commodities such as daily-use cotton yarn and cloth. This is because cotton yarn and cloth prices have recently risen sharply, and it is inevitable that there will be speculative hoarding activities. If evidence of hoarding and profiteering is found, those responsible will be reported and dealt with in accordance with the regulations for punishing hoarding.

### Various Trade Evaluation Committees Commence Work

The various industry trade association evaluation committees organized by the city's trade associations to assist the authorities in suppressing prices have been actively carrying out evaluation and investigation work in recent days. It has been found that past work focused on price limits, which led general unscrupulous merchants to replace goods with inferior products in order to obtain illegal profits. Therefore, in addition to price limits, future investigation work will also closely monitor whether goods meet standards. Large numbers of investigators are dispatched to member stores and retail departments every day to conduct secret investigations. Once it is discovered that goods exceed the price limit or do not meet standards, the store will be severely punished.

Mark Prices

The various industry evaluation committees have specifically notified member stores and retail departments that they must mark the price of each item displayed and not be ambiguous. It is found that the settlement authorities have also repeatedly ordered this measure, because marking the price of goods not only facilitates customers, but also makes investigation work easier.

No Refusals to Sell

Recently, stores have often concealed goods and refused to sell them, which is tantamount to hoarding in disguise. The various evaluation committees also attach great importance to this and dispatch personnel to conduct close investigations. If the above situation occurs, it will be reported to the trade association for handling.

### New Directors and Supervisors of the Banking Association Take Office

The Shanghai Banking Association convened a meeting of member representatives on the 26th of last month and elected the 14th Board of Directors and Supervisors. Before the new Directors and Supervisors took office, all association affairs were temporarily handled by the previous Executive Committee. Now, the association held a joint meeting of the new Directors and Supervisors the other day to hold an inauguration ceremony and elected Yu Fuxiao as Chairman of the Board, Wu Zhenxiu, Guan Tingmin, Zhu Rutang, and Zhu Bosu as Executive Directors. The date of the first meeting of the Executive Directors and the number of meetings per month have not yet been decided.

### Stock Exchange to Resume Operations in Mid-August

The Shanghai Chinese Stock Exchange, which has been closed for a long time, is now actively preparing to resume operations under the responsibility of Zhang Weiru, Chairman of the Board of Directors of the China Merchants Bank and former Chairman of the Stock Exchange, after being ordered by the Ministries of Finance and Industry to prepare for the resumption of operations. The exchange has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting at the Hong Kong Road Bank Club at 2:00 PM on the 24th of this month to discuss the number of brokers to be reorganized and the increase in capital. It is estimated that in addition to the original 80 brokers, 35 Chinese stock brokers, 42 foreign stock brokers, and 43 other brokers will be added, for a total of 200 brokers. The capital will be increased from the original old currency of 1.2 million yuan to 20 million yuan in national currency. Part of it will be recognized by the old shares, and part will be raised by recruiting new shares. It is scheduled to resume operations and trading in mid-August. The trading will mainly be in Chinese stocks, but in order to prevent speculation and currency outflow, all transactions will be limited to spot trading in principle.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks first fell sharply, then suddenly surged. A certain group was very active, and all those seeking to sell were absorbed. After 10:30, all new and old stocks were in a state of demand exceeding supply. The New New Company of the department store industry once retreated into the Customs, then flew back out and exceeded the peak of the previous day. Yong'an and Guohuo Company rose after a pullback, with the latter approaching the major hurdle. Neiyi and Jingfu Jinglun two shirts rose sharply throughout the day. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile rose by hundreds, Rongfeng Textile and Dasheng Factories 1 and 3, and small denominations such as Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing, Meilun Plush, Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving, and Xinhe Yarn Factory were all advancing to new highs. In the cultural industry, the prices of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore unexpectedly rose. Nanyang Tobacco, Great China Matches, and the public utilities Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric disappeared from sale. The new pharmaceutical industry, Minyi, Zhongxi, and Star Perfume, became firmer. Great China Industrial and Jiu'an Industrial both saw active trading and price jumps. Xinyi Real Estate was firm, and Xinya Construction was strong.

### Money Houses Tighten Lending, Credit Tightens, Interest Rate Opens at 24%

The market conditions in Shanghai's various industries have tightened slightly due to rumors. Although the black market for rice is calling for high prices, it is restricted by the authorities' ban, and no formal transactions have been completed. Gold shops are claiming to have no spot goods, and no exchange transactions have been made for two days. The handling fee for door-to-door sales cannot be increased, so they would rather not do business. Speculative rice merchants are also hesitant because they have no way to purchase spot goods. There is not much change in military tickets and joint tickets. The market price of stocks and cotton cloth has slightly increased. In order to prevent speculation and curb the rise in prices, money houses of various financial institutions are tightening their lending business. As a result, the money market in the city is tightening, and the interbank interest rate rose by 2 points yesterday (14th) to 24%. The overall financial situation remains stable under the extensive support of the Central Reserve Bank. Although the market situation seems tense on the surface for the past two days, the actual financial situation is unusually solid.

### Restoring Social Morals

— Zhen Diao Ge

Nowadays, many people in the community feel that "human relationships are thin." As a result, they have turned their attention to classical Chinese literature. Consequently, many people are inscribing maxims and printing family precepts to give to relatives and friends, with the aim, of course, of benefiting future readers. These actions and views are indeed worthy of praise and commendation, but I feel doubtful about their effectiveness.

If one wants to be a "gentleman" or a "sage," one needs to cultivate oneself. Although it is not necessary to "travel ten thousand miles and read ten thousand books," one must at least know something about the way to conduct oneself and the methods of cultivation. The best way to do this is through maxims and family precepts, because these are the "personal experiences of hardship and adversity, and the insights gained from self-reflection and self-discipline" of the ancients. Moreover, the sentences are short and easy to remember. However, I believe that if maxims are copied in books, family precepts are printed in books, and even if "utensil inscriptions" are remembered on all daily necessities, but they cannot be put into practice, they are still useless and cannot "restore social morals." On the other hand, even if there is no collection of maxims or family precepts, but each person has a sentence that they consider the most useful maxim and remember it in their heart, practice it at all times, reflect on it at all times, and constantly improve oneself, then perhaps there can be some effect.

Therefore, I believe that maxims are necessary, but they require you to know and then act, and act in a concrete and practical way. It is definitely not possible to "restore social morals" by simply copying some good words and printing some family precepts.

### Peking Opera and Film

— Yan Huizhu

People often ask me: "What is it like to sing Peking Opera and act in movies?" My answer is: both are art. Although the meaning is the same, the methods of expressing art are different, so the taste is also different.

Peking Opera has a fixed script, and the same few plays are always sung. Although movies also have scripts, what is filmed each day is completely different. In Peking Opera, the distance from the audience on stage is far, so it is very convenient to sing. In movies, although there is no audience, there are many staff members on the set. If you are shooting a close-up, very close to the camera, you have to make various different expressions, such as smiling, crying, talking, and other actions. It is really difficult. In Peking Opera, you cannot sing the wrong words, otherwise, the audience will boo. It doesn't matter in movies, if you say something wrong, you can reshoot it. Also, when singing Peking Opera, you can't see for yourself whether it is good or bad. Whether the tone and body language are good, you must have an observer to criticize. Movies are different. When the filming is finished and it is screened, you can watch your own acting, and you can see whether it is good or bad at a glance.

From this, we can see the different points of artistic expression between Peking Opera and film. This is my personal feeling when filming the movie "Elopement."

### Random Notes from the Movie City

Hua Ying's basic actors Rong Na, Yang Liu, and Kui Jiajia went to Tianjin a few days ago and performed on stage at the Xinzheng Central Theater in Tianjin. After receiving the news, Hua Ying's Actors' Department specially sent Wu Wenchao to Tianjin to negotiate and urge Rong Na and others to return to Shanghai to work. The North China Performing Arts Association also urged them to return quickly and sent personnel to accompany them to Shanghai.

Following "Silk," which is playing at the Da Guangming Cinema, "Imperial Stele Pavilion," starring Wang Yaoqing from Beijing, will be screened. This film is a Peking Opera performance brought to the screen, and the actors are all outstanding talents from the Beijing theater scene.

Since filming began on "Rebirth," seven or eight tenths of it has been completed, and it is scheduled to be completed before the 20th of this month. Wu Lei, the screenwriter and director of "Rebirth," caught a cold while going to Yangzhou to shoot location shots for "Elopement." After returning to Shanghai, he was busy with the work of "Rebirth," which led to typhoid fever. He was sent to the hospital on the first of this month and unfortunately passed away the night before last, at the age of twenty-five.

Zhu Shilin's new work, "Second Generation," was explained at the Huaying Fourth Factory in Xujiahui Triangle on the afternoon of the 13th, and filming will begin in the coming days. The male roles in the play are played by Liu Qiong, Lu Yuyi, and Gu Yeqi, and the female roles are played by Tong Yuejuan and Chen Qi.

The Sino-Japanese co-produced song and dance film "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" is being worked on day and night. Director Fang Peilin and star Li Lihua have both become thin due to overwork. It is reported that the filming has now been completed and will be screened at the Da Guangming Cinema on the 28th of this month.

After the filming of "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" is completed, Li Lihua will continue to film "Begonia," directed by Ma Xubang.

Zhang Shichuan's new work after "Red Face Iron Blood" is "Happy Angel." The script has been approved, and it will star Li Hong. Filming will begin on the 16th of this month.

Huang Han's new work, "Rebirth," is being prepared. As soon as the scenes are completed, the actors will be selected.

Li Xianglan's new film "Yellow River" has been released in various parts of North China.

Huaying Company is filming a major film on the disaster situation in North China, "A Thousand Miles of Mourning." Wang Yin has been designated as the director because Wang Yin is from Tianjin and is more familiar with the disaster situation in North China than other directors. Wang Yin will personally visit the disaster area in North China for on-the-spot inspections when necessary. Gao Zhanfei, Cai Qiuxia, and Yan Jun have been internally designated to star.

### Parental Love

— Hong Nong

If people do not know the love of parents, when will they call on their parents in times of difficulty? If people all know the love of parents, when will they forget their parents in times of peace and happiness? If people do not know how to serve their parents, when will they teach their children to be filial? If people all know how to serve their parents, when will there be so few filial sons?

Hair has fallen and teeth have loosened, think about what your parents have become old for? Panting while lying down and struggling to walk, think about what your parents have become ill for? Unwilling to seek beautiful clothes, unwilling to seek fine food, think about what your parents have saved for?

Although the daughter-in-law is healthy, she cannot be diligent. Love for the daughter-in-law all stems from the love for the son's heart. The grandson is in her arms, and she dares not startle him. She loves her grandson even more than her own feelings. When her son goes out, she advises him earnestly. Her soul often flies to a thousand miles on the pillow. When her son is ill, her heart is sad and her eyes constantly shed a thousand lines of tears. If her son has done wrong, she does not speak of it. If people talk about it, she must cover it up. When death is imminent, her eyes do not close. If her son is by her side, she still turns her eyes. From youth to strength, and from strength to old age, the heart that loves the son wholeheartedly will not be finished even in death.

May I ask, can the son ever fully understand? The young crow knows how to feed back, and the lamb knows how to kneel and suckle. Even birds and beasts are like this, why do human beings not realize it? Do not say that there are too many things to neglect, please wait for leisure to make up for it? Do not say that you do not have the strength, please wait for when you can do it? I only fear that the son will wait, but the parents will not wait. The wind stops and the trees are still, and the grief and tears are in vain!

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

Li and Lu both stared at Staff Officer Zhang at the same time, nodding their heads without a word to say. Everyone was thinking, what kind of trick is this? While they were lost in thought, there was a sound of footsteps at the door, and two people in gray clothes and flat-topped hats walked in,挟 [xié] carrying a haggard A-Kun, who was hanging his head and not saying anything. Town Chief Li immediately ran over and said.

"A-Kun! Let's go back together!" A-Kun still didn't know what was going to happen to him, so he was obediently manipulated. Suddenly, he heard Town Chief Li, whose voice was very familiar, calling him, so he raised his head and showed a weak and powerless look, looking at the two people in gray cloth standing beside him, sobbing and unable to speak, nodding slightly.

"You go back together! There's nothing wrong!" Staff Officer Zhang said to Town Chief Li, and waved his hand to the two people in gray cloth beside him to tell them to leave. Town Chief Li put his arm around A-Kun and said:

"Let's go! It's getting late!"

"Thank you, Staff Officer Zhang! Tomorrow we'll have tea at the Wu family teahouse in the east of town and talk." Town Chief Li greeted Staff Officer Zhang while walking out.

"Okay! We'll talk again tomorrow. Goodbye!" Staff Officer Zhang said, and sent them out to the outside door, past which was the street.

"Goodbye! Goodbye!" Town Chief Li greeted, and the three of them walked straight west. After only a few steps, Town Chief Li had already reached the door of his own house, knocking on the door while saying:

"A-Kun! Don't be sad, go back and rest. It's already a great fortune to be able to spend the night at home tonight. You have to know that it's destined for you to have something happen. These days, bad luck often comes from the sky even when you close your door and sit at home! What can you say? Junqiang—the name of the Lu Jia Chief—you should rest early, you're very tired!" After saying that, he went into the house. A-Kun nodded, and Lu Jia Chief also went back to his own house first. A-Kun, with heavy steps, the waning moon in late September, hanging in the sky, it was already late, looked at the old wooden door of his own house, and a slight light was revealed from the cracks, knowing that his wife was still waiting. A burst of howling—howling—howling dog barks, in the moonlight, his own dog couldn't recognize his master's face, and chased and barked madly, approaching and discovering that it was his own master, and immediately wagged its tail and jumped to express its close welcome to its master. Could it be seen in his eyes that his master had already suffered a huge trauma in his heart? A-Kun naturally couldn't muster up the interest to tease the puppy, and silently went forward. But that innocent puppy didn't show any snobbery and kept following its master. (Eleven)

### Re-examination of Ginkgo for Treating Lung Disease

(1) Ginkgo, also known as Bai Guo, contains toxic substances. Contact with the skin can cause inflammation and rashes. Its components contain two kinds of "ginkgolic acid" and "ginkgo oil," which can only kill pneumococcus, erysipelas streptococcus, or gonococcus. Ancient medical prescriptions have used it effectively in many cases, but it is ineffective in killing tuberculosis bacteria. The letter from a friend in Beiping published in your newspaper probably refers to the fact that pneumonia and lung abscesses have been cured. If the sputum contains pus and blood, resembling bayberry, or the sputum resembles iron filings, resembling containing dust, eating raw ginkgo every day, seven grains a day, will surely cure it in seven days. If you don't use ginkgo, then taking the western medicine "Solacil" has the same effect. As for the treatment of tuberculosis, eating more pine nut meat, cod liver oil, and air needle injections can treat it. In recent years, I have been extracting vitamin K from pine nut oil to treat the first and second stages of tuberculosis, which has been quite effective. Burning rue and other things in the sickroom has also been effective. As for how to extract chemical components from other various aroma oil types for injection to treat tuberculosis, I am currently conducting research and analysis. (Fan Fengyuan).

(2) Take a fresh pig lung, wash the blood clean, then draw out the tibia tubes on the lungs, add two taels of spinach, five or six slices of fresh ginger, and a little aged wine, simmer the broth over low heat and eat it lightly. Do not use soy sauce. If you find it too light to eat, you can add a little fine white salt, as little as possible. The above is for the early stages of lung disease. About three to five servings will be effective. If it is pulmonary atrophy, you need to add two qian of Ophiopogon japonicus and one qian of unprocessed Rehmannia root and boil them together. In short, there are many kinds of lung diseases, and they cannot be generalized. For example, pulmonary abscess, pulmonary atrophy, weak lungs, or blood in the sputum, etc. However, lung disease is not a terminal illness. Patients often hesitate in their views, resulting in delays or self-inflicted harm, or due to psychological effects, resulting in chronic illnesses that cannot be cured.
