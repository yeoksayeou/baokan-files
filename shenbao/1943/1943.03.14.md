### Improving Local Grassroots Politics

Since the new year, to adapt to the needs of the new situation after participating in the war, both the central political and local political institutions of our country have been improved. However, it seems that there is also a need for thorough improvement of local grassroots politics. This is because the grassroots organizations of local politics, namely the political institutions in villages and towns below the county level, are the source of all national policies. If a certain level is not sound, it will greatly hinder the implementation of national policies. Moreover, if the politics at the township and even county levels can be actively improved, the foundation for national construction after the war can also be laid.

In improving grassroots politics, "systems" and "talents" are equally important, but under the current actual situation, the strict selection and appointment of talents is particularly important. In principle, local grassroots politics should first implement autonomy, so that outstanding individuals among the people can directly participate in politics. Although the Baojia system is a relatively primitive form of autonomy, if it can be reformed appropriately based on new political theories, with reference to the local political systems of contemporary powerful countries, and after considering the special circumstances of various parts of our country, it may not be impossible to make it an initial form of autonomy, and then realize the local rule of modern countries. Of course, in some areas today, peace has not yet been restored, and some areas are still under military control, but generally speaking, the vast areas along the coast, the Yangtze River, and even North China no longer have special conditions. Preliminary "local autonomy" has the possibility of being implemented, so that the strength of the people can be concentrated under national policies, and the reality of comprehensive simplification of administration can be achieved. In particular, talents for local autonomy should be cultivated immediately and extensively to meet the increasingly urgent needs of various parts of the country in the future.

The fundamental reason for the unsoundness of local grassroots politics in the past is the lack of political training and political experience of the general public. Oppressed by thousands of years of autocratic politics, they only have passive political beliefs and lack active political ethics. Most citizens can only take care of themselves and cannot work together to benefit the community. Therefore, if we want to improve grassroots politics today, we must start with cultivating the active political morality of the people, so that everyone can consciously and automatically engage in the cause of benefiting the local community and serving the country. The key points of this kind of cultivation work, or local political tutelage work, must first focus on the two major problems of the past: the control of local bullies and gentry and the lack of political construction talents. Efforts should be made to cultivate construction talents, so that fair and virtuous people can come out to govern. As for the cultivation of talents, the fundamental countermeasure is for the government to establish special local political cadre schools, and to set up civil administration or local administration classes in the political science departments of various national universities, to train graduates from high schools and above, so that they can become cadres for local grassroots politics in the future. Those with the best performance should be given a trial period as township chiefs, and then gradually promoted, and it should be stipulated that in the future, those who have not served as township chiefs and have achieved results should not be appointed as county magistrates. In the future, when autonomy is implemented and township and county magistrates are elected by the people, this can also be used as a qualification to restrict candidates. Because the power of local bullies and gentry has long been deeply rooted in the local area, unless new people are thoroughly appointed and new policies are implemented, it will never be possible to improve local autonomy and promote genuine autonomy.

Although today's local grassroots politics cannot be said to be completely disconnected from provincial and central politics, the existence of its bad phenomena is an undeniable fact. On a large scale, it is enough to hinder the implementation of national policies, and on a small scale, it also makes local people with lofty ideals disdain to engage in local politics. Since talents are unwilling to go to villages and towns, grassroots politics will never improve. Therefore, we hope that the government will enrich the political institutions of villages and towns, clearly define their political tasks, first connect the politics of villages and towns with that of counties, and further seek to professionalize the duties of village and town and county magistrates, respect their positions, improve their treatment, and strictly examine their performance, so that many talents in the country will be willing to engage in local autonomy. Then, use political power to eliminate local bullies and support fair and virtuous people, implement political training for the people, so that the general public can be sure that politics is closely related to their daily lives, and they will not easily give up their rights. Then, it will be possible to improve today's local grassroots politics and facilitate the mobilization of people's power. Then, total war participation can be thoroughly realized. And it will be of great help to the construction of a new China after the war.

Translation and Discussion

### Progress in Japanese-Vietnamese Cooperation

The Japan-Vietnam Trade Implementation Agreement was completed this year. On the 4th, the Governor-General and Ambassador Kuriyama, the Director-General of Administration, completed the signing in Hanoi. At the same time, regarding the existing treaties between Japan and Vietnam, such as Vietnam's current regulations, tariff and trade agreements, and residence and navigation treaties, etc., discussions will be held on those that may hinder economic exchange between Japan and Vietnam, in order to seek improvement and application. As a result, Vietnam, standing as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, expressed its most frank goodwill. On the simplification of procedures for Japanese residents to enter the country and the prohibition of foreigners from engaging in occupations such as doctors, Japanese language teachers, trade agents, printing and publishing industries, etc., only Japanese residents will be permitted if they are beneficial to Vietnam's economy and culture. Other understandings were reached, such as easing restrictions on Japanese use, equal treatment for Japanese and Vietnamese in enterprises, and granting various facilities and concessions necessary for the conduct of war, and fair allocation of the ratio of imports and exports of Japanese merchant ships, so that the application and interpretation of current regulations and treaties are favorable to Japan.

After the establishment of the Joint Defense Agreement this year, the relationship between Japan and Vietnam has undergone a leap forward improvement. At that time, the situation in France itself, after Marshal Petain came to power, established the fundamental policy of cooperation with the Axis powers. Thus, the complex political situation was reflected in the internal situation of Vietnam and showed various fluctuations. The agitation of the Tergol faction and the incomplete severance of relations with Britain and the United States caused Vietnam to be subject to many external constraints in becoming a member of the New East Asia, and its position was extremely difficult. Today, after a year and a half of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to Japan's war results, external constraints have been swept away, and the domestic political situation has become stable. Therefore, Vietnam does not need to worry about internal and external affairs, all obstacles have been removed, and it has finally become a cooperator in the construction of the Greater East Asia.

Japan's policy of cooperation with Vietnam, of course, also increases its obligations to that country. Originally, the focus of France's policy towards Vietnam was to make Vietnam its own market. Therefore, Vietnam has not yet seen the emergence of modern industries. Exports are mainly agricultural products, and imports from overseas are mainly textile products and other daily necessities to adjust the country's economy. Now, the channel of exchange with the home country has been cut off, and all imports and exports cannot but depend on Japan. Last year, the export of Japanese processed products to Vietnam was sufficient to meet internal needs and more, and many were stored up. Therefore, it is believed that it is not necessary to implement the agreement in accordance with the agreed quantity. Because the stored materials have their limits, it is feared that Japan will not need to supply all the processed products needed by Vietnam this year. This quantitative agreement has been fulfilled almost completely. In view of Vietnam's cooperative attitude, Japan has plenty of room for maneuver in exporting materials, which goes without saying. Based on such mutual cooperation, the economic cycle that is generated will not only make Vietnam's export capacity to Japan increasingly strong, but also make its trust in Japan a cornerstone for the construction of the Greater East Asia.

Hankou, Central News Agency, 13th – After the Japanese army made a surprise landing on the Yujun's key point Ouchikou on the south bank of the Yangtze River, the Yujun in that area has been defeated. The retreat route of the remnants of the 137th Regiment and the 129th Regiment of the 43rd Division of the Yujun was blocked by the Yufang battle team, so they returned to Wuzui, 12 kilometers northwest of Ouchikou, at dawn on the 12th and continued to resist stubbornly. However, they were eventually unable to resist and abandoned mortars and machine guns, etc., and fled in all directions.

### Li Wenli of Yu Xuezhong's Troops Leads His Troops to Surrender

Qingdao, Central News Agency, 13th – Li Wenli, the former commander of the Second Column of Jie Jin in the Yufang, decided to lead his troops to surrender to the National Government because he realized that the war of resistance was wrong. It is now learned that the unit will hold a surrender ceremony soon. After the former Commander Li was captured, his subordinates also showed signs of wavering. In order to show their consistent support for Commander Li, those above the regimental commander jointly asked the Japanese army commander, saying that if Commander Li wanted to surrender to the National Government, we, all the officers and soldiers, would swear to take the same action as Commander Li. Commander Li was moved by the loyalty and support of his subordinates, so he decided to lead his troops to revolt. According to reports, Wu Huawen, General Li Yingping, and the troops of Commander Li have already surrendered to the National Government. The Yujun troops of Yu Xuezhong have been reduced by 70,000, and the strength of his remaining 114th Division is extremely weak, so its collapse must be near.

### Yu Overseas Chinese Committee Decides to Mobilize Overseas Chinese Case

Guangzhou, Central News Agency, 13th – After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Yufang discussed overseas Chinese countermeasures and plans to mobilize overseas Chinese to return to the country. According to a telegram from Yu, the Overseas Chinese Affairs Committee recently decided on the Overseas Chinese Mobilization Case, the content of which is divided into four parts: human resources, finance, materials, and culture. After investigating and registering the skills that each overseas Chinese is proficient in, they will be put on standby for requisition. If there are no suitable jobs, they will serve in the military. As for financial mobilization, it is to encourage overseas Chinese savings, digest public bonds, and invest in charitable foundations. The vehicle for mobilizing materials is still to increase the productivity of overseas Chinese. Cultural mobilization stipulates the popularization of art and culture adapted to the Three Principles of the People, and promotes the general mobilization law and the necessary sciences for national defense construction, as well as cultural publishing activities in the Japanese-occupied areas of Nanyang, and promotes foreign relations. In short, it is nothing more than borrowing the name of the war of resistance to exploit the human and material resources of overseas Chinese.

### Japanese General Headquarters Announces Major War Results Achieved by Air Force Destroyed a Total of Thirty-Two Enemy Planes Sank and Heavily Damaged One Enemy Ship Each

Tokyo, Dōmei News Agency, 13th – The Imperial General Headquarters announced at 11 am today that the Japanese side had shot down 32 enemy planes in operations in New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Aleutians, and had sunk and heavily damaged one enemy transport ship each. The communiqué is as follows: (1) The Imperial Navy Air Force sank an enemy transport ship of 3,000 tons in the eastern district of New Guinea on March 8 and heavily damaged another enemy ship. (2) Sixty enemy planes attacked a certain Japanese air base in the Solomon Islands on March 11. Eleven were shot down by anti-aircraft guns of the Imperial Navy. The Japanese side suffered minor losses. (3) Japanese naval aircraft attacked a certain enemy air base in eastern New Guinea on March 11 and shot down 18 enemy fighters that attempted to intercept. The Japanese side lost two aircraft, both of which crashed into enemy targets. (4) On March 11, 30 enemy planes attacked Narukami Island (Kiska Island) in the Aleutian Islands. Three were shot down by Japanese anti-aircraft guns. The remaining enemy planes were driven away. The Japanese side suffered minor losses.

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 13th – According to a telegram from San Francisco, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces Headquarters announced on the 12th that the Japanese Air Force bombed eastern New Guinea on the morning of the 7th.

Tokyo, Dōmei News Agency, 13th – People close to the Navy recently stated that the war results announced this morning by the Japanese side on March 8, 10, and 11 in eastern New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and off Narukami Island have proven with facts that enemy aircraft, warships, and transport ships that dare to enter the Japanese army's attack range will inevitably be severely attacked by the Japanese army. In the short period from March 1 to 5, the Japanese army shot down or destroyed 124 enemy planes in New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, and sank four enemy submarines. This shows how closely the Japanese army is operating in these areas, and how urgent the enemy is trying to maintain its position. The Japanese side is constantly intensifying its attacks in the south and north in order to defeat the enemy. On March 8, enemy ships appeared in eastern New Guinea, aiming to transport war equipment and military rations to that area. The Japanese Navy Air Force detected the enemy's actions and immediately launched an attack, sinking a 3,000-ton transport ship and damaging another. Some time ago, the Japanese side lost five transport ships, which is true, but the war results announced this morning show that once the enemy enters the Japanese air force's attack range, it cannot move freely. The recent situation in the Southwest Pacific has clearly revealed the difficulties the enemy is currently encountering. The Japanese side's operational plan is to strengthen its air power in order to cut off the enemy's supply line and bomb the enemy's outposts until the enemy runs out of ammunition and food and finally surrenders. On March 10, 60 enemy air force planes attacked the Japanese base in the Solomon Islands, and 11 were shot down by the Japanese side's fierce anti-aircraft fire, which proves how strong the Japanese side's land defenses are in these areas. The fact that the enemy sent a large number of 60 planes to attack the Japanese base shows the enemy's desperate defense of its position on Guadalcanal Island. It also confirms that the enemy is extremely afraid that Guadalcanal Island will be isolated. The reason why the Japanese side is increasing its troop strength in this area is to concentrate air strikes on Guadalcanal Island. When the Japanese air force attacked New Guinea on March 1, enemy planes took off to challenge, and a total of 18 were shot down, including 12 Lockheed P-38 fighters and 6 P-39 Bell fighters. These war results show that the Japanese side is prepared to meet any enemy attacks head-on. On the same day, 30 enemy planes attacked Narukami Island, and Japanese anti-aircraft guns shot down three of them. All these war results show that Japan is not only strengthening its air force in the south, but also in the north. Soon, Japan will use its formidable air force to defeat the enemy in both the north and the south.

### German Mechanized Units Rush into Kharkov City Center; Soviet Pressure in Orel Region Weakened; New German Offensive Launched in Kursk Region

Stockholm, 13th (Domei News Agency) – Berlin officially announced last night that German troops, after a fierce attack by mechanized units, have reached Red Square in the center of Kharkov. They now occupy the western, northern, and central parts of the city, up to Red Square. Simultaneously, German forces have advanced 25 miles north of Kharkov and are coordinating with German columns advancing from the Sumy and Akhtyrka (northwest of Kharkov) areas, attempting to encircle Soviet forces west of Valky. According to a Reuters correspondent in Moscow last night, Soviet forces in Kharkov are currently facing a difficult situation, with German forces constantly attacking at various points along the semi-circular front line, seeking to identify weaknesses in the Soviet defenses. This German counter-offensive is only part of the intensified resistance of the German forces on the Eastern Front. The German side has deployed numerous infantry divisions, supported by 900 tanks and large formations of aircraft, launching a fierce attack on Kharkov from the southwest. The Soviet forces, facing this intense assault on a very narrow front, may have retreated to a new line of defense. According to the German official news agency, in the past two weeks, German forces have destroyed three Soviet armies southeast, southwest, and south of Kharkov, and have cut off Soviet road and rail communications from all directions except the northeast. Only then were they able to enter Kharkov. Soviet pressure in the northern Orel region has weakened, and the new German counter-offensive in the Kursk region is also progressing rapidly, although details are not yet known. On the central front, the German High Command continues to carry out systematic operations in accordance with pre-determined plans, aimed at shortening the German line. On Thursday, they withdrew from Vyazma, about 140 miles west of Moscow. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a special communiqué last night, announcing the occupation of Vyazma.

German Forces Continue to Shorten Lines, Withdraw from Nep River Bulge

Somewhere in the Soviet Union, 13th (Havas News Agency) – In the past 24 hours, the fighting on the Eastern Front has been focused on Kharkov.

Moscow Radio also acknowledged fierce fighting near the city, and the Red Army is facing increasingly difficult circumstances. German aircraft and tanks have gained an advantage in that area, and fresh troops are constantly joining the battle. Moscow Radio also stated that this situation is only temporary, and that the German counter-offensive in the Kharkov area is only a manifestation of the general increase in German combat power. As for Vyazma, the Red Army continues to advance south of Bely and west of Sychyovka, while German forces continue to shorten their lines, apparently planning to completely withdraw from the Nep River's upstream bulge.

### Medan Celebrates the First Anniversary of its Restoration; Four Sultans of Sumatra Visit Japanese Army Hospital

Medan, 13th (Central News Agency) – Today is the anniversary of the Japanese army's entry into Medan, the central city of Sumatra. The Medan City Hall, in order to make the natives permanently commemorate this significant day and to promote the determination to engage in a long-term war, has designated this day as the "Sumatra Restoration Anniversary."

### Wartime Production Configuration in Japan (II) – A Visit to the Kanegafuchi Metal Industries’ Puhara Factory: Working Day and Night Without a Moment's Rest

We went to visit the Kanegafuchi Metal Industries Co., Ltd. factory in the Puhara area of the Tokaido, not far from Mount Fuji, which is touted as a paragon of Japanese scientific production. The factory was founded in Showa 14 (1939 in the Republic of China calendar). Although its history is not particularly old, the history of Japan’s Kanegafuchi Metal Industries itself is still quite new. Actual production is said to have begun around Showa 9, so the factory's history cannot be considered new. The environment here is stunning. Looking up, there is Mount Fuji; looking to the right, there is Suruga Bay; and on the left, there is a continuous range of mountains. The scenery is truly outstanding. Moreover, more than 100,000 tsubo (translator's note: one tsubo is approximately six square feet) of flat land stretches out before your eyes. This is probably because the large-scale production of Kanegafuchi metal requires maritime transport, a vast flat foundation, and mountains for easy power generation, so the factory was established here.

We first met with the factory director, Mr. Hideharu Takeda, and the engineering section chief, Mr. Hiroshi Kagawa. The factory directly produces aluminum from Kanegafuchi metal raw ore, and not through the production of foreign materials. Aluminum is used today in many daily necessities, telecommunications, telephones, transportation, and especially military supplies. It can be called the mother of culture and the darling of the age, with a relationship that cannot be separated from the demands of the times. Recently, in the decision to increase production, it has been specifically designated as a super-priority industry, and is therefore being produced day and night. Recently, it has caused the United States to shift from a battleship-first doctrine to an air power-first doctrine. The important aircraft materials are mostly a type of aluminum. This one fact alone should make us greatly concerned about it.

Bauxite, transported from the south, is first processed to make alumina. This substance is chemically called aluminum oxide, and is formed by the strong combination of oxygen and aluminum. By processing it further, aluminum can be made. However, this requires a great deal of electricity. Therefore, the amount and quality of the product will vary in price depending on how the electricity is obtained and used. This is why it is necessary to have a special scientific organization for the production of Kanegafuchi metal.

Mr. Takeda, Mr. Kagawa, Mr. Ishikawa, and I drove around the vast factory grounds. First, we went to see the port used for maritime transport. The waves of the coast are turbulent, and the wind and waves are fierce, but the wharf has been completed to eighty percent using special methods. For now, let's avoid the detailed report and say briefly that the scale of this wharf is too large to be considered just an engineering project belonging to a company's factory. From here, looking at the factory, we can see towering chimneys, several long, rectangular, tall factories, and several aqueducts running from the top of the mountain to the power plant. The grandeur of these structures, no matter how outstanding they are, all display the majesty of modern science. It is truly spectacular.

Next, we went to see the electrolytic workshops, which are the main part of the factory's production. In this towering factory building, more than twenty electrolytic flat furnaces are set up vertically. Because electrical processing is underway, the field has become smoky, and alumina powder is scattered in some places. People wearing masks to protect against the fire are holding stirring rods and stirring back and forth. The roaring flames and the gurgling sound of the crane make the field mystical, presenting a solemn scene. Each electrolytic furnace is a flat furnace of about fifteen feet, built with carbon-coated refractory bricks, and a carbon anode rod is suspended on the top. Several people form a group to manage several furnaces, with class leaders, squad leaders, and group leaders, each doing their best in production.

Cryolite is placed in the furnace for use as a solvent, and alumina is added to it and mixed. When a strong current is applied, the alumina decomposes, and the strongly combined gas and aluminum separate. Compared with other fire operations, the difficulty of this operation is not simply waiting for the metal to dissolve before processing, as in other refining processes. Instead, the workers must endure the high heat of 1,000 to 1,500 degrees Celsius, and continuously stir the ore in the furnace with a special stirring rod, continuously putting alumina into the furnace to liquefy it and promote the decomposition of oxygen and aluminum. Because this operation must be carried out under high heat, special consideration is given to physical strength, and masks and body masks are often worn during operation, but even in summer, several people inevitably faint. Factory Director Takeda believes that in order to fully carry out this difficult operation, there must be understanding between superiors and subordinates. Based on this idea, people who serve in the factory, regardless of their duties, must spend six months to two years in the factory to experience this work.

The commander of the factory's employees, Director Kobayashi, expressed his gratitude for the company's rational management and told us: "We all deeply know the importance of aluminum in this Greater East Asia War. We all hope to produce more one kan (translator's note: two kan is approximately one hundred taels in China) of aluminum, so that we can build more aircraft. Here, there is no rest for 365 days a year, and it is rotated day and night. No one has thought about taking a break during the Mid-Autumn Festival or the New Year, and everyone is working hard. Please pass this situation on to the outside world!" At this time, I didn’t know how to answer, so I could only lower my head and think silently.

The crane hanging on the ceiling constantly made a gurgling sound, lifting the liquefied aluminum and transporting it to the refining site, where it was transported by the machines waiting below to the refining site. The refining site is equipped with excellent Swiss-made refining furnaces, which are used to further refine and purify the transported aluminum, and then pour it into the designated molds to form blocks of aluminum.

Finally, we went to see the heart of aluminum production, the power rectification site. It was the exact opposite of the factories we had seen before, it was such a quiet and beautiful place, and it was completely a model of an orderly scientific organization. The power, which is the source of the factory's activities, is all controlled, adjusted, and generated here. Inside, there are more than twenty sets of equipment used to convert alternating current with a voltage of 60,000 volts into direct current. These equipments are said to be worthy of the world, but we feel unspeakable hope and greatness.

Factory Director Takeda said: "Since the establishment of the factory, I have been working hard with all my heart and soul. I have spent a lot of effort to guide the employees in the factory. At first, the local people were unwilling to work seriously and were unwilling to do their best, but the local people originally had the energy to plant tangerine trees on the endless slopes and mountains. Therefore, as long as they understand the meaning of the work in the factory, they will be willing to work hard, so the factory has achieved today's results." This is his noble business experience.

In order to win the final victory in the Greater East Asia War, we feel that the necessary production in today's life, no matter what, must make increasing production the first priority. This is true for any factory. However, regarding the hard work of material production, not to mention mines, not to mention steelmaking and ironmaking, especially in the production of aluminum, it cannot be understood without witnessing it, and there is unspeakable hard work. I hope everyone should know. What should we do today, especially at this moment? What I want to tell everyone is that we should do everything we can to make these industrial warriors who are contributing their hard work feel at ease and work with hope. This is our only urgent task. (Original by Hisazo Takayama. Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, March 6th)

### Aoki Receives German Reporter

Essen, 13th (Haitong News Agency) – Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki received the Tokyo correspondent of the Essen National Daily, Mr. Dieserkling. This was the first time Aoki received a foreign reporter. He said that the Ministry of Greater East Asia and the Japanese military headquarters are jointly formulating a construction plan. In terms of economy, they will develop resources. After the war, Asia and Europe will exchange goods on a large scale. Aoki claimed that the rumor of issuing a unified currency for Greater East Asia is not true. The Peso of the Philippines and the currency of the Dutch East Indies will continue to be retained.

### European Economic and Military Resources Under Decisive Battle: Germany Takes the Lead

(Special Dispatch from Berlin by Tatsutaro Kasagi, 4th) In the European war, centered on the German-Soviet conflict, both sides are exerting their final strength in a fierce struggle. The economic power that determines this mortal combat has also mobilized its last resources. However, this economic power was not created hastily, but accumulated over decades of tireless effort. Current productivity is built on past foundations and constrained by them. Nevertheless, the recovery of this productivity, in both quality and quantity, has been augmented with new efforts, and its pace has accelerated. A year ago, we all thought that every country was already using the most recently manufactured weapons in the war, but since then, we have felt that fresh factory products produced under bombardment are continuously appearing on the front lines. Although surprising new weapons are rare, the competition in the performance of aircraft, tanks, artillery, explosives, and other items is intensifying, and both sides need to consume astonishingly large quantities. One of the characteristics of the Soviet counteroffensive, like last year's German offensive, is the concentrated use of warfare, firing massive amounts of shells regardless of consumption. As such, military production today cannot but exhaust all its strength and exert its highest capabilities. However, the foundation of military production is constrained by the rise and fall of the production volume of basic raw materials such as iron and coal. Therefore, the active force that constitutes war power should first be the problem of the production volume of iron and coal. Generally speaking, although countries are making extraordinary efforts to produce basic raw materials during wartime, due to traffic obstruction, labor shortages, and the low efficiency of new labor forces, there is instead a tendency to decline. World oil production appears to have reached its peak in 1941, as has coal.

Coal and Iron Production in Various Countries

Britain's coal production has clearly decreased sharply during the war. The peak of 230 million tons in 1938 can be considered the apex. In 1941, it was 206 million tons, and last year it is estimated to have decreased to 200 million tons. Britain's copper and iron production was 14 million tons before the war in 1937, and is now approximately 10 million to 12 million tons. As for other purely military supplies such as aluminum, contrary to the trend of sharp increases during wartime, it is considered very smooth if they can generally maintain pre-war production levels. The ups and downs of Germany's coal production cannot be detailed, but due to the semi-obligatory system of Sunday labor, the large-scale adoption of foreign labor, and the use of mining machinery, efforts have been made to increase its production rate desperately, even under continuous British bombing raids. Before the war, it was 400 million tons, and now, after incorporating the occupied territories, it is 500 million tons. This number is truly enormous, even enough to supply Italy, Switzerland, Sweden, France, and the Balkan countries, from which Germany obtains military raw materials and other necessities as compensation. Steel production was about 20 million tons before the war, and now it is announced as 40 million tons. This is also due to the incorporation of new territories. Although the actual efficiency is unknown, the increase in absolute numbers, whether coal or iron, is undoubtedly certain. The scale of military production built on this foundation is also imaginable, and its function is two to three times that of Britain. As for the Soviet Union, most of European Russia and part of the Caucasus have been ravaged, and mines and factories have been destroyed by themselves. According to pre-war statistics, the Soviet Union has already lost 64% of its iron ore and 61% of its coal during the war. Part of its equipment has also been relocated. Although military factories have long been moved to the Ural region, steel cable production has decreased by 20 million tons and coal has decreased by 150 million tons compared to pre-war levels. It can be seen that the impact is quite profound. If we exclude American aid, Germany is far superior to Britain and the Soviet Union in terms of iron and coal alone.

Looking at oil, which is most directly related to war power, the Soviet Union's oil production was 30 million tons in 1938, of which Caucasian oil accounted for 90%. This enormous quantity was not even enough for the Soviet Union's agricultural mechanization before the war. Since the German army cut off the Caucasian railway last summer and the Volga River froze last winter, Soviet oil has been severely restricted, at least in terms of transportation. It can only transfer the oil used for Ukrainian agriculture to military use. As for Germany's oil reserves, if we combine Germany's domestic oil and synthetic fuels with those of other Axis countries and occupied territories, the production volume for last year is expected to be enormous. Germany does not use much fuel for agriculture, so there should be no temporary changes after acquiring Romanian oil.

Germany's Production Restructuring

After possessing the above-mentioned enormous basic raw materials, Germany's current production has been reorganized. Regarding weapons, there was sufficient leeway for preparation, at least until the spring of last year. Therefore, in last year's offensives in Crimea, Kharkov, and Stalingrad, engines and high-density firepower artillery shells were fired without hesitation, and the consumption quantity also increased accordingly. After Minister of Munitions Speer took office last year, he inaugurated a new era for German military production, progressing at an amazing speed. In April, a central planning department was established within the Four-Year Plan Office, determining the highest comprehensive plan and ensuring the priority of military needs. At the same time, the Munitions Bureau, which originally belonged to the commander of the Wehrmacht, was also transferred to the Ministry of Munitions, which had full authority to supervise and guide military production. On one hand, new groups were organized for military production and specific military product producers, allowing them to operate as independent organizations similar to those of the Ministry of Economy. Among civilian industries and export industries, operations were shut down or reduced and reorganized for military production, shutting down low-efficiency operations and concentrating production in high-efficiency operations. This was rapidly completed last year. The construction of new factories was stopped, and existing equipment was fully utilized after being replaced two or three times. The military production policy was changed at this point. All raw materials and resources were directly used for the accelerated production of military supplies. This has been the case since the spring of last year. The reorganization of production has been largely completed through the above-mentioned measures. The recent mobilization, which has brought all women to work in factories, is to make up for the shortage of labor. Women are used as much as possible to replace the original labor, so that a huge new force can be extracted and formed.

There are currently six million foreign workers in use. To ensure the continuous participation of new labor, President Hitler's proclamation on the 24th of last month required this country, France, Lithuania, and Greece to close shops roughly similar to those in Germany, and to draw out a large amount of labor from peacetime industries. According to news reports, women over the age of 45 are also encouraged to voluntarily apply for labor. The allied countries of Europe and all occupied territories will implement a "historically unprecedented total mobilization."

Current Status of Food Problems in Various Countries

Regarding the food problem, the most drastic changes in the past year have been in the Soviet Union. The situation in Britain is also gradually becoming more severe. As for Germany, because it has already implemented a minimum level of control, there have been no changes, at least on the surface, in the past year. According to Swiss newspapers, by last year, the Soviet Union had lost 40% of its miscellaneous production, 50% of its livestock holdings, and 88% of its sugar production in the vast areas abandoned due to the German invasion. The remaining population in this area accounts for 2% of the total population. Although this may be somewhat exaggerated, the magnitude of these numbers cannot be disputed. The transportation of surplus products from Central Asia and Siberia cannot be viewed optimistically due to military transportation needs. Last September, the monthly food ration was: 200 grams of meat, 200 grams of oil, and 2,700 grams of bread (weekly amount). This is compared to the monthly ration for ordinary consumers in Germany (amount for four weeks): 1,400 grams of meat, 824 grams of oil, and 2,250 grams of bread (one week). There is clearly a large difference, except for bread. Moreover, although the ration for Soviet heavy industry workers and the military is higher, with reports of a sevenfold increase in meat and oil, it is still lower than the ration for German heavy industry workers. It can be said that the Soviet Union's crisis last year was resolved by importing food from the United States. Generally speaking, the food problem for the public has indeed become quite difficult.

The food problem in Britain is also approaching its end. Bread will now also have to be rationed. Until now, although it seems to be in a predicament, it is eking out a living with imports from the United States and Canada. However, imports are entirely dependent on shipping issues, so it cannot be said that Britain's food is fundamentally stable. The Minister of Food personally stated last autumn that "the food situation in Britain will undergo major changes within the year." With merchant ship sinkings being reported daily, the future is by no means bright.

In summary, Germany should not be complacent and joyful about the food problem on the current Eastern Front, but it is much better than the opposing camp. Even compared to neighboring allied countries, its rations are quite balanced and universal, so it can maintain low prices and ensure the minimum amount of food for the lives of workers and other general public, and feel at ease.

Price Problem

The economic turmoil in various countries, centered on the food problem, cannot directly determine their political situation, but the soaring of prices in economic phenomena casts a shadow of political unease on the minds of the general public. Except for Germany, the price levels in various countries seem to be rising like tides. Until the summer of last year, the average retail prices over three years were 65% in Britain, 98% in neutral Switzerland, 86% in Hungary, and 6% in Germany. This is the official report. Actual living costs may be different, as there are black market prices in each country. In a certain small Balkan country, prices have increased three to four times in the past two years. However, the above-mentioned index is still a general trend.

The political situation is not related to the rise in prices, but the psychological reflection caused by the rise in prices is directly related to the stability of the political situation. This is not a problem in Germany itself, which has strict control, but the price situation in its allied countries, such as Romania, Bulgaria, and other Balkan countries, is a cause for concern. Therefore, German Finance Minister Funk said that Germany's economic problem is not Germany itself, but the economic problems of its allied countries and occupied territories around Germany.

The rising prices in Southeast European countries, neutral countries, and Italy are forcing countries to constantly change their trade agreements with each other. Because the defense of the European continent is bound to be centered on Germany, even neutral European countries cannot but mobilize economically for Germany. More than half of Sweden's exports go to Germany, and three-quarters of Switzerland's trade is with Germany. Swiss factories work for Germany's military production. Although the payment agreement between Germany and Switzerland has not been extended, it is actually proceeding as before in the absence of an agreement. Germany has even mobilized potential foreign exchange in Switzerland to supplement its payment methods. After the revision of trade agreements, the total amount of the agreement tends to increase, and its content reflects the changes in the economic situation of both parties. The increase in Germany's clearing balance with various countries indicates that Germany is gradually becoming the center for purchasing goods in Europe.

After Germany obtains a decisive victory, its powerful productivity can easily compensate for the trade balance, so it can be regarded as a "reliable deposit." This is equivalent to putting excess currency in the country into cold storage before the end of the war, waiting for it to be resolved after the war. However, Germany's over-borrowing is a much smaller problem compared to the situation in Britain, which has rapidly increased its debt to the United States due to the American Lend-Lease Act. The increase in this debt has weakened Britain's position in speaking to the United States, causing it to be coerced by the United States and the Soviet Union, which is the reason for Britain's recent anxiety. Britain's economic distress is even greater than the domestic food problem, promoting the decline of the British Empire. If the war continues, its distress will become even more profound.

Changes in the European Economy

In conclusion, this all indicates the extraordinary tension in the economies of European countries under the decisive battle situation. The sense of tension is very different from a year ago, and many changes have occurred. Generally speaking, there are two major significant directions. First, the European economy is progressing towards organization centered on Germany.

First, we have the significant changes in Germany's internal economic structure. On one hand, under the guidance of Minister of Munitions Speer, the munitions industry is trending towards efficiency and centralization, and the labor force is being reorganized. On the other hand, under the guidance of Minister of Economy Funk, the control mechanism has been completed due to the management of all business operations.

This is one aspect of Germany's wartime economic strengthening and sophistication. The exchange of goods in Europe, centered on Germany, forms an economic group including all neutral countries. Second, is the passive aspect. Regardless of the Axis or anti-Axis groups, they are all developing towards inflation due to the gradual lack of materials. This tendency opposes organization and has the effect of disintegrating the economy. This first lies dormant in neutral countries, causing general fluctuations. The economic turmoil reflected in people's minds will then develop into political turmoil. This is the aspect that needs the most attention at present. Therefore, the most special problem at present is not only military, but also economic, focused on the struggle for Ukraine. The gains and losses of this struggle will double the difference in the economic characteristics of the two sides. The purpose of Germany's final total mobilization is precisely this. However, the current stage of the European economy has not yet had a decisive impact on victory or defeat. The most important thing at present is still the development of the war situation, but the economic power that actively supports this battle is gradually becoming the stage of stimulating the national psychology in economic life. Strong national character can be stimulated by this. Therefore, what determines everything in the end is the national spirit spurred by the economic pressure. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 6) Regarding Soviet relations, the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Standley, recently made comments which he did not wish to comment on. When asked whether the President had previously expressed his willingness to meet with Stalin after the Casablanca Conference, Mr. Roosevelt also did not wish to give any affirmative indication on that question.

Argentina, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: It is learned here that Roosevelt declared at the Washington intelligence meeting today that although the U.S. Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Mr. Standley, is a man of few words, he sometimes likes to be loquacious. Roosevelt refused to comment on the Soviet government's attitude towards the United States as described in Mr. Standley's recent remarks.

### Rumor that the Polish Government Plans to Move to the United States

Sweden, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: The Daily Mail reports that General Sikorski, leader of the Polish government-in-exile, has notified the British Foreign Office that he intends to move the Polish government from London to Washington to protest the British attitude towards the Soviet-Polish dispute. It is said that Mr. Sikorski met with the U.S. Charge d'Affaires in Britain before submitting the notification, so this decision was agreed to by the U.S. side.

### Intense Dispute Over Australia and New Zealand Income Tax Cases

Sweden, Keijo, 13th, Haitong News Agency: According to news from Sydney, when the Australian Senate met yesterday, the government attempted to link the Income Tax Bill with the National Welfare Fund Bill. Senators had divergent opinions and would not yield to each other. Prime Minister Curtin has decided to convene a cabinet meeting the day after tomorrow to discuss the issue. The government believes that this bill should be passed or rejected at the same time, but the opposition criticized the government for using the National Welfare Bill to appease the public bearing the new tax and depriving the Senate of the right to pass tax bills and reject the welfare bill.

### British and American Troops Reinforce in Preparation for Offensives; Axis Forces Near Thamirah Advance Towards British Positions Three Times

Lisbon, 13th, Allied News Agency: According to news received here last night, in the battles of French Tunisia, there were only minor localized battles in the northern coastal areas on Wednesday and Thursday, and Axis reconnaissance teams attacked in front of the southern Mareth Line. Berlin news reported that British troops shelled several forts on the Mareth Line, indicating that British General Montgomery has made preparations there and is expected to launch an offensive at any time. In northern Tunisia, a British tank team attempted to approach the main Axis front line but was repelled. However, a Reuters dispatch from the Allied headquarters stated that the Axis forces near Thamirah attacked with infantry, covered by artillery fire, and advanced towards the British positions three times. Axis patrol teams inside Tunisia attacked the positions of the British Eighth Army several times in front of the Mareth Line, destroying several vehicles and returning to their defenses after capturing several British soldiers. The Axis reconnaissance team confirmed that Montgomery's troops have received reinforcements of troops, tanks, and aircraft. Its main force consists of the British 44th Division, 51st Division, British Guards 201st Brigade, New Zealand 2nd Division, and two tank detachments, all gathered between the coast and the mountains west of Sha'ao, and seems to have completed all preparations for attacking the African Corps of German General Rommel on the Mareth Line.

Berlin, 13th, Haitong News Agency: After suffering a disastrous defeat last month, the American troops in central and southern Tunisia have recently received reinforcements from Morocco, Algeria, and other places. However, these reinforcements also lack combat experience and are no better than the previously defeated American troops. Northwest of the Great Salt Lake, desert combat units under Tegor have recently been discovered, whose mission seems to be to connect the U.S. Fifth Army and the British Eighth Army. However, due to the special terrain there, it is feared that it will be difficult to achieve this goal. As for the main force of the British Eighth Army, including the 44th and 51st Infantry Divisions, as well as the attached two Zuke Brigades, the New Zealand 2nd Division, and the British 21st Guards Brigade, they have been deployed in front of the Mareth Line. Some British artillery has already shelled the Axis positions, and it is expected that the day of the general offensive is not far away. However, it is unknown whether the U.S. Fifth Army and the British First Army have also completed preparations.

### Japanese Occupied Territories in the South Pacific Promulgate Exchange Control Orders

Jakarta, 13th, Central News Agency: The Japanese military administration in Java has specially formulated the Exchange Control Order for the occupied territories in the South Pacific to facilitate the smooth exchange of funds between various places in the South Pacific. It was officially announced today by administrative order and will be implemented from the 15th of this month. In the past, remittances between the occupied territories in the South Pacific such as Malaya, Sumatra, Burma, North Borneo, and Java were limited to Japanese soldiers, military personnel, and general Japanese travelers' travel expenses. However, after the implementation of the new management order, indigenous people and overseas Chinese, as well as other foreign nationals, can also freely remit funds, which is very convenient for the general public.

### Lao Cai Inspection Report on the Northwest End of the Vietnam Border

Hanoi, 13th, Central News Agency: The key areas along the Yunnan-Vietnam railway line and the neighboring Vietnamese areas such as Wen Shan in the east have all been occupied by the Yu direct line army. Therefore, since the end of last year, the Vietnamese army has been strengthening its forward defenses along the border and rushing to build a long and large fortress defense line. The Yu and Vietnamese armies are confronting each other on the border. In order to understand the truth of the situation in that area, the reporter recently went to Lao Cai, the northwest end of the Vietnamese border defense line, for inspection. The streets of Lao Cai are built in the mountains along the Nanxi River, with a population of about 1,400 people. Because it is a distribution center for materials in the surrounding area, it is a gathering place for overseas Chinese and various ethnic minorities. Outside the Lao Cai station is the confluence of the Red River and the Nanxi River. Looking at the opposite bank from afar, it forms a T-shape, which is where the enemy's position is located. It is located on the left bank of the Red River, on a cliff of gray soil. A large triangular fortress is built in gray, and black gun emplacements can be vaguely seen around it. The tricolor flag hanging on the fortress flutters in the wind. The remains of a destroyed iron bridge still lie across the shallow stream. Eighty meters from the north bank, houses are densely packed, appearing to be a street. Armed Yu troops can be seen on the opposite bank. The Yu troops currently guarding the street at the river mouth are part of the "198th Division of the 54th Army." The garrison commander is Pan Yukun, deputy division commander of the division. Behind the street are white trenches winding through the continuous mountains. From the first peak on the right to the fourth peak on the left, it is the enemy's first line of defense. Once the war starts, the street of Lao Cai will bear the brunt, because the two places are so close. When I was about to view the enemy's bunker, I suddenly saw the enemy's sentry post, which seemed to be gradually approaching. The tense situation was evident. This border has been effectively sealed off since the Japanese army entered. However, because the Yu side is short of materials, if traffic with Lao Cai is cut off, the lives of the Yu people on the opposite bank will be impossible to solve. Therefore, after the agreement between Lao Cai and Hekou, Yu people are allowed to go to Lao Cai for shopping from 8:00 am to 11:00 am every day. Under the strict supervision of tax officials and military police sent by both parties, about 300 overseas Chinese are allowed to cross the river to shop every day, mostly women. They take a ferry to Lao Cai and purchase daily necessities within the permitted scope in shops opened by overseas Chinese before returning. Although the two places are separated by a river, the prices are two or three times different. The miserable and desolate scene on the Yu side is in stark contrast to the prosperous situation on the Vietnamese side. After the Japanese army air force entered Vietnam on January 28 last year, it heavily bombed the power facilities of the Yu side in Hekou. The remains of the bombing can still be seen on this shore. Now, the Yu army soldiers and officers feel that the number of people surrendering from the resistance is increasing day by day. I met four Yu officers, including Captain Liu, who had come to the street market of overseas Chinese. Captain Liu was originally the captain of the Second Company of the 25th Division of the Yu Central 52nd Army. He resolutely returned two weeks ago and is now engaged in farming there. According to him, no one in the Yu army now believes that they can achieve final victory. The Yu army is currently short of food on the Yunnan border, and the military salary is only 80 yuan per month, but prices are very high. Ordinary cigarettes cost 25 yuan per pack. The local people on the border do not speak the Yunnan dialect, which deepens the alienation between the military and the people. Moreover, due to the spread of epidemics, many people have died. News of the Japanese victory, even after any concealment, will still be heard. In addition, Captain Gan, who surrendered from the 184th Division of the Yunnan Army, said that Long Handou, the brigade commander of the 3rd Brigade of the 60th Army of Yunnan, is a brother of Long Yun. He was previously confined to the western Yunnan area due to the pressure of the Yu direct line army, and his actions were closely monitored. Until last year, his secret transportation of military supplies from Vietnam was discovered by the Yu side, and he was arrested by the Yu side and sent to Chongqing. The previous rumor that Long Yun was arrested was actually a mistake about this matter. However, since then, Long Yun's military power has been effectively deprived. Recently, the 20th Army Group of the Yu side was transferred to the Yunnan Province, and Zhang Fakui also arrived in Kunming at the same time. It is also learned that the 52nd Army of the Yu side will soon be transferred to Guangdong, and the 54th Army will move towards Burma, exchanging defenses with the troops required by the 20th Army Group. Also, the enemy's defensive position seen on the opposite bank in Lao Cai is a guard position. Its main position is far behind, more than 100 kilometers away.

Industry Registration

In order to implement rational economic control, purchase materials nationwide, and centralize distribution, the National Government decided to establish the National Commercial Control Association and designated reputable industry leaders as initiators to be responsible for handling autonomous control matters. The organizational system of this commercial control institution is divided into (1) local industry associations, (2) industry federations, and (3) the National Commercial Control Association. It is learned that the local authorities in this port, in order to strengthen material control in the future, had previously ordered various industry associations to register. By the end of last month, approximately 300 had registered, with affiliated factories and shops reaching 36,000. However, among the various industry associations, some have similar characteristics, and it may be necessary to gradually merge them in the future to streamline the control work. The count is: 6 associations in the metal sector, 13 in the machinery sector, 17 in general merchandise, 6 in clothing, 9 in liquor and sauce, 25 in food, 6 in food and beverage, 28 in textiles, 7 in pharmaceuticals and cosmetics, 13 in manufacturing, 9 in fuel, 6 in leather, 7 in paints and dyes, 5 in cereals, 6 in oils, 4 in tobacco, 4 in transportation, 3 in photographic equipment, 5 in books and stationery, 4 in finance, and 17 in other categories.

### Diplomatic Promotion Association Reception - Ambassador Arita - Leaders from All Walks of Life Participate in Tea Party for Cordial Conversation

Japanese Ambassador to Vietnam, Arita Hachiro, made a brief stop in Shanghai on his way back to Saigon. The National Diplomatic Promotion Association of this city held a grand tea party yesterday (13th) at 4:30 p.m. on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to receive him, inviting important leaders from all walks of life to accompany him. Those present included Zhou Zuomin, Tang Shoumin, Xu Jianbing, Zhao Zunyue, Sun Mingqi, Zhou Jue, Zhang Yipeng, Chen Binhe, and others.

The guests and host conversed cordially for a time, and the meeting ended with satisfaction at around 6 p.m.

### Silk and Cloth Shops - Inventory Registration - Xie Da Xiang and Others Unsealed - Secret Investigation of Tampered Rulers

The authorities have long formulated price limits for goods sold by various silk and cloth shops in this port. However, at that time, because the inventory of each shop was not investigated thoroughly, there were occurrences of fraud in various shops. In order to remedy this shortcoming, the industry association has been ordered to carry out inventory registration. All cloth shops should comply. If there are false reports, once discovered, the business license will be revoked and the business ordered to close. Recently, inaccurate rulers used by various silk and cloth shops have also been frequently discovered. Therefore, in order to prevent residents from being deceived by these shops, the authorities have also dispatched plainclothes detectives to conduct investigations in each shop. Regarding the matter of the authorities ordering all shops to uniformly use specially manufactured standard rulers, according to the reporter's inquiry from Datong Daily, it is still under expert research.

Unsealing of Shops and Penalties Unknown

The police authorities of the French Concession strictly manage various shops in the concession and send out a large number of secret agents to closely investigate illegal shops. If there are price increases, once verified, a sealing-up penalty will be imposed. A few days ago, Xie Da Xiang Foreign Cloth Shop and others were sealed up for price increases. However, they have been unsealed as of yesterday. As for the issue of fines, the French authorities have not yet officially announced it. It is reported that the French police authorities and the Evaluation Committee authorities summoned the shop owners for a reprimand and instructed them to strictly comply with the authorities' intentions in the future. If the above-mentioned situation occurs again, more severe penalties will be imposed. The purchase is only in order. From the sentry box, only three hundred and eighty-nine seats have been completely built so far, with one hundred and twenty-four seats missing. We still need the cooperation of all parties. Statistics show that theft cases in Nanshi have indeed decreased significantly in the past six months. The number of criminals arrested by the police force in half a year is about one hundred. There are still many improvements to be made in the police force's facilities in the future. I hope that all parties will continue to provide cooperation and suggestions at any time, etc. Next, Zhu Yunsheng represented Director Lu in delivering a speech, and Instructor Nishimura gave a speech. The situation was extremely harmonious during the banquet, and it ended at around 3 p.m.

### Buddhist Association Continues to Distribute Congee as Usual

The congee distribution center established by the Shanghai Buddhist Association in the Guandi Temple in Nanshi has been in operation for more than a year, distributing congee to more than 3,000 impoverished people daily, which is truly a great benefit to society. Recently, the association suspended congee distribution once in order to sort out congee tickets. Now that the sorting is complete, congee distribution has resumed as usual from 8:30 a.m. to 10:00 a.m. every day since the 12th.

### Investigation of Household Rice Rationing Situation in the Two Concessions

After the formal establishment of the Grain Department, in order to actively promote the wartime food policy, it is urgent to understand the household rice rationing situation in the Public Concession and the French Concession in this city in the past. Therefore, a special form has been created, instructing the Municipal Grain Administration to investigate and report in accordance with the form for reference by the Ministry.

### Strictly Enforce Wartime Economic Laws and Regulations - Strive to Complete Wartime Economic Policy - Talk by Wang Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau

Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Wang Zhigang, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, to inquire about his thoughts on the National Government's promulgation of the two provisional regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement and the National Commercial Control Association. Wang made the following remarks: "The Wartime Economic Policy Outline and the regulations stipulating that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic institutions and not participate in political movements and training were previously deliberated and promulgated by the Supreme National Defense Council separately. The National Government promulgated the regulations on the Prohibition of Wartime Materials Movement and the National Commercial Control Association on the 11th. According to these laws and regulations, the purpose is to seek the establishment of a wartime economic system and the strengthening of wartime economic power. This bureau manages the economy of this city, and it is its responsibility. In the future, it will strictly enforce all laws and regulations promulgated by the National Government regarding material control and price stabilization, and the management of industrial and commercial organizations, so as to gradually improve the soundness and rationality of the economic structure of this city under the guidance and supervision of the government. As for the concession area, we will maintain close liaison with the concession authorities and other relevant parties in the future so that the economic administration in the urban area can be consistent with the cooperation of all parties. In short, the strict enforcement of wartime economic laws and regulations is to achieve a balance between supply and demand of materials, rational distribution, and price stabilization, in order to complete the wartime economic policy. At this time of war, the government is implementing rational control measures under the wartime system, on the one hand, to ensure military supplies, and on the other hand, to strive to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, in order to seek the economic recovery of the country. I hope that all sectors of the city will understand this and work together. If there are still violations of all wartime economic laws and regulations in the future, once discovered, they will be dealt with strictly in accordance with the law. Please do not make mistakes."

### Shanghai Municipal Government Jurisdiction - Divided into Two Regions - 19 Districts in the Urban Area, 7 Special Districts - Formation of Boundary Committee to Survey Boundaries

The Municipal Government believes that the new jurisdictional area is several times larger than before the incident, and the district is vast, making it extremely difficult to implement municipal administration. Therefore, the city area is divided into urban and special areas and reorganized in accordance with the Special District Office Organization Regulations promulgated by the Executive Yuan. It is learned that the urban area is planned to be divided into 19 autonomous regions such as Hunan, Caojing, Fahua, Pusong, Zhabei, Xiang, Yinhang, Sanlin, and Dachang. The special area will be reorganized separately from seven districts including Beiqiao, Baoshan, Nanhui, Fengxian, Chuansha, Jiading, and Chongming. A boundary committee and a Baotou committee are currently being formed, and preparations are being made to hold a district chief training center in order to gradually promote local autonomy and complete the city's organization.

Although most have already been replaced in accordance with the regulations, there are still a few who are waiting and watching and delaying the exchange. The West Shanghai Police Department recently issued an announcement, limiting hotels, boarding houses, apartments, public entertainment venues, clubs, employment agencies, dance halls, and wine shops in the area who have not followed the regulations to obtain business licenses for this year to follow the regulations by the end of March at the Second Section of the bureau and report to the municipal government for investigation at any time.

It is learned that the cooking oil industry wholesale office has already transported a large number of iron drums to various oil pressing factories in Pudong yesterday to fill oil in order to realize it as soon as possible to meet the urgent needs of the citizens. About 500 barrels can be filled in two or three days and will be transported to Puxi for distribution to the concession rationing agencies.

### Strict Inspection of Residence Registration at Iron Gates in Urban Area Starting Yesterday - Those Who Do Not Carry Certificates Are Prohibited from Passing - Old Citizen Certificates Confiscated

There are not many days left until the end date. The heads of each branch should carefully plan and send police to check from door to door from today and order the police on duty to check pedestrians at any time. Those without a residence certificate are prohibited from passing to warn against negligence. At the same time, explain the importance of the residence certificate and order them to apply for it as soon as possible, so as to ensure that the deadline is completed and the decree is given importance."

### I am Also One of Shanghai - A Talk by Ambassador Arita

Standing on the edge of the Waibaidu Bridge, in the skyscraper Broadway Mansion, a kind and amiable Ambassador Arita adds to the scenery on the second floor lobby. At four o'clock on the afternoon of the twelfth, Ambassador Arita invited news reporters here. He sat quietly in a large leather chair, wearing a tea-colored suit, with gray hair. His face was still so clear and healthy that you couldn't tell he was seventy-two years old. He opened the conversation with a smile. He said first: "Let me first give a general overview, or should I listen to your questions first?" Then he said again, "I'll speak first!"

I have a very good relationship with Shanghai. In March of Meiji 35, I was transferred from Xiamen to Shanghai to serve as consul for two years. Later, I went to Beijing as a minister for six years. In Showa 4, from January to June, I negotiated with the National Government at the time to resolve the Jinan Incident, which lasted six months. Later, I came to Shanghai two or three times. So I understand the general situation of everything in Shanghai very well.

At the League of Nations meeting during the Manchurian Incident, I demonstrated unyielding diplomatic negotiations. When I was serving as the minister in Beijing, the current emperor of Manchukuo also came to the Beijing Embassy to take refuge because he felt that there was danger around him. Many historical traces from the past are still lingering in his mind. He then answered the news reporters' questions:

I wanted to buy a hat in Fukuoka, so I went to a foreign goods store. I picked out a hat, and after paying, just as I was about to reach out to take the hat, the clerk said to me, "Please pay with a clothing coupon." (Translator's note: Japan controls all goods and implements a system of rationing goods according to population. Shopping requires a coupon.) But since I was returning from a foreign country, of course I didn't have a clothing coupon with me, so I had no choice but to ask the store to return the money and went back. Shanghai also has a system of rationing sugar and charcoal! (Yunpeng: Translated from the March 13 issue of the Mainland News)

### Promoting Bills of Exchange in the Banking and Finance Industry: Acceptance and Discounting Allowed; Stipulating a Time Limit for Collateral of Goods; Guarantors Liable for Repayment

In order to prevent the use of financing to fuel speculation and hoarding, all banks and financial firms have followed the new lending measures passed by the trade association to tighten restrictions. As for commercial acceptance bills, efforts are being made to promote them. Recently, all banks and firms have agreed to provide convenience for acceptance and discounting in accordance with bank acceptance contracts. The contract methods are recorded as follows:

Goods as Collateral for Bank Acceptance

(1) The bill of exchange issued by the contracting party is limited to paying off a certain amount of money for a specific purpose. (2) The due date of the bill of exchange issued by the contracting party shall not exceed a certain number of days after the date of issue, but it should expire before a certain day, month, and year in the Republic of China. (3) The contracting party shall deposit the cash with your bank at the latest one day before the expiration of the bill of exchange for payment and will not delay. (4) The acceptance fee is calculated at a certain amount per month per thousand yuan of the face value of the bill, but if the bill period is less than one month, it shall be calculated as one month, and the contracting party shall pay it with the bill each time it requests acceptance. (5) Your bank may notify the contracting party at any time to stop acceptance or reduce the limit or shorten the period stipulated in Article 1 of this contract, and the contracting party is willing to comply. (6) The contracting party and the guarantor solemnly declare that the collaterals opened on the back of this contract or to be delivered in the future are entirely owned by the contracting party, and no other person has any rights. If disputes arise in the future and cause your bank to suffer losses, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation. (7) Regarding the quality and quantity of the collaterals contained in the warehouse receipts, bills of lading, and other documents, the contracting party and the guarantor guarantee that they are completely accurate. If discrepancies in quality, shortage in quantity, or false content are found in the future, regardless of whether the collaterals are stored in your bank's own warehouse or in other warehouses or in transit, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable. (8) The warehouse bills of lading and other documents in the preceding article shall be endorsed by the contracting party to establish a pledge at the time of delivery, and transferred to your bank's account. In the future, your bank may extract or inspect the contents of the collaterals at any time. If it is later found that the transfer procedures are still incomplete, the contracting party shall complete the supplementary defense, and all transfer expenses shall be borne by the contracting party. (9) If your bank believes that the collateral must be moved to the warehouse, the contracting party shall bear the expenses upon notification and immediately comply. In the event of any loss due to the transfer of the warehouse, the contracting party is also willing to be responsible and has nothing to do with your bank. (10) If the collaterals need to go through transportation, customs declaration, or other procedures, the contracting party shall comply, and all expenses shall be borne and paid by the contracting party. (11) Warehouse rents and various donations and taxes payable for the collaterals shall be borne and paid by the contracting party. If fines or detentions are caused by tax evasion or violations, the contracting party shall be responsible for handling them and have nothing to do with your bank. If your bank suffers losses due to the above-mentioned disputes, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable for compensation.

Guarantor Fully Responsible

(12) The collaterals shall be insured by the contracting party at the current price in your bank's name (or with your bank as the preferred beneficiary) with the insurance company designated by your bank for fire insurance. If your bank deems it necessary, it may order the contracting party to add water insurance, military insurance, or other insurance, and all expenses shall be borne by the contracting party. All insurance policies and insurance premium receipts shall be delivered to your bank for safekeeping. In the event of an accident, your bank may directly receive the compensation from the insurance company to offset the acceptance and payment made by your bank. If the insurance compensation is insufficient or even cannot be compensated, the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately pay another considerable collateral or cash, and shall not excuse accidental losses to claim exemption from responsibility. If, before receiving the compensation, your bank believes that it is necessary to provide another considerable collateral, the contracting party is also willing to comply. (13) If the contracting party fails to register, transfer, move the warehouse, insure, or handle other procedures or pay various expenses, your bank may handle or pay on its behalf, and the expenses handled or paid on its behalf shall be immediately repaid by the contracting party; otherwise, your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate, but your bank has no obligation to handle or pay on its behalf, and if it does not handle or pay on its behalf, it shall not bear any actual responsibility or loss. (14) If the price of the collateral falls below the market price at the time of the contract, or if there is a trend of decline, the contracting party and the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable to immediately increase or exchange considerable collateral or pay cash, at least to make up for the amount of the decline. (15) Your bank shall not be liable for any mold, rot, insect infestation, damage, adulteration, leakage, consumption, or destruction of all or part of the collateral due to natural disasters, accidents, and other force majeure events, and the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately increase or pay another considerable collateral or cash. (16) The type and quantity of collateral exchanged or increased by the contracting party shall be approved by your bank. (17) If your bank allows the contracting party to exchange all or part of the collateral or retrieve part of the collateral, it does not need to notify the guarantor, and the guarantor is still jointly and severally liable and shall not raise any objections. (18) The contracting party entrusts your bank as the sole agent for the sale or disposal of the collateral, and this contract is also proof of authorization.

Disposing of Collateral to Compensate for Losses

(19) If the contracting party violates or fails to perform the terms and conditions of this contract, or if your bank believes that there is a risk of violation or non-performance, all the acceptance and payment made by your bank may require the contracting party to immediately repay. Your bank may also sell or dispose of the collateral without notifying the contracting party and the guarantor. The contracting party and the guarantor have no objection to the method of sale, the level of the selling price, and the timing of the sale or how to dispose of it, but your bank has no obligation to sell or dispose of it. If the market price falls without sale or disposal, your bank shall not be liable for all losses. All receipts for the collateral issued to the contracting party after the sale or disposal shall be invalidated, and all expenses incurred due to the sale or disposal shall be borne by the contracting party. (20) The amount obtained from the sale or disposal of the collateral shall be used to offset your bank's acceptance amount and various expenses, and your bank may calculate interest at the interest rate. If the overdue interest is insufficient to repay, the contracting party and the guarantor shall still be jointly and severally liable to immediately make up for it, but if the contracting party still has other funds or properties in any name in your bank's head office or branch known to your bank, your bank may also allocate the funds to pay the insufficient amount. All receipts issued to the contracting party shall be invalidated, or the property shall be sold or disposed of in accordance with the preceding article to offset the sufficient amount. After the collateral and other funds and properties have been sold, disposed of, or allocated, if there is a surplus after offsetting your bank's acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses, your bank may return it or deduct other matured and unmatured amounts owed by the contracting party to your bank, and the debts of other debtors guaranteed by the contracting party in your bank. (21) If lawsuits are caused by this contract, the litigation fees (including your bank's attorney fees) shall be compensated by the contracting party and shall not be evaded.

Waive Court Jurisdiction

(22) If the contracting party violates or fails to perform the terms and conditions of this contract, the guarantor shall be jointly and severally liable to immediately compensate your bank for the acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses. The guarantor shall not delay the performance of the guarantee liability on the grounds that the collateral has not been sold or disposed of, or that the contracting party's property has not been forcibly executed, or any other excuse, and voluntarily waive all the rights of the guarantor related to the guarantee articles in Section 24 of the Civil Law Price Code. (23) The guarantor shall not withdraw the guarantee on its own. Even if the guarantor has declared the withdrawal of the guarantee in the newspaper, the guarantee liability in this contract is still valid, but if your bank believes that the guarantor needs to be replaced, the contracting party shall comply upon notification without any objection. (24) If there is more than one guarantor, they shall all be jointly and severally liable, that is, any guarantor shall be liable for paying your bank's acceptance amount, overdue interest, and various expenses in full. (25) The performance of the terms and conditions contained in this contract by the contracting party and the guarantor shall be at your bank's business premises. (26) If the contracting party and the guarantor violate or fail to perform the terms and conditions of this contract and are sued by your bank, the contracting party and the guarantor voluntarily submit to the jurisdiction of the Chinese court where your bank is located, regardless of whether the contracting party's and the guarantor's domicile, residence, business premises, or nationality have changed, that is, waiving the right to object to the court's jurisdiction.

### The Police Authorities in the Nanshi District Have Decided to Ban Disguised Pawnshops; Existing Pawnshops Have Been Ordered to Close; Pledged Items Must Be Redeemed Within Fifteen Days

The illegal pawnshops in the old Ximen, Nanyang Bridge, Zhonghua Road, Minguo Road, Xiaobeimen, and Luxiangyuan Road areas of Nanshi District are dedicated to high interest rates and exploiting the poor. The pledged items are forfeited after two or four months, and there are even more than a hundred pawnshops that can accept pawn tickets. They neither fulfill the registration procedures with the authorities nor obtain business licenses. It is obvious that they are taking the opportunity to defraud money and disrupt the area. Although the Municipal Police Bureau has ordered the closure of dozens of illegal pawnshops such as Continental Yufeng and prohibited them from operating, the pledged goods must be redeemed within fifteen days; violators will be severely punished. However, the generally closed pawnshops have changed their appearance, canceled the name of the pawnshop, and written on the signboard "Specializing in the purchase and sale of gold and silver jewelry, diamonds, and other goods." There are also newly opened disguised pawnshops attempting to fool people. According to the reporter's investigation, the Municipal Police Bureau believes that the disguised pawnshops and the pawnshops that have been closed and reopened are actually acting against orders and defying the law. Yesterday, it ordered the respective branch bureaus to strictly ban them and prohibit them from operating under any pretext; violators will be severely punished.

### Banning Illegal Pawnshops; One Public Pawnshop Set Up in Nanshi and Zhabei

Our Municipal Government has long strictly prohibited illegal pawnshops. Now, in order to correct the root cause, it has decided to set up public pawnshops to benefit the common people. The method is to first set up one public pawnshop in Nanshi and Zhabei, and then promote them to other districts. It is heard that the Municipal Government has ordered the Economic Bureau to draft regulations and budgets in detail and submit them for approval and preparation as soon as possible.

### Neighborhood Association Guidance Meeting Held; Fire Prevention Lecture; Demonstration of the Effectiveness of Fire Extinguishing Bombs; Notice to Neighborhood Association Chiefs to Attend

The Neighborhood Association Guidance Committee of the Public Concession, in order to instill fire prevention knowledge in citizens and protect social security, has specifically scheduled a fire prevention lecture and fire extinguishing bomb demonstration meeting at Zhang Garden (ie, the Continental Swimming Pool) on Jing'an Temple Road at 11:00 am today (the 14th), Sunday. As the event is closely related to the neighborhood association's fire protection organization, all neighborhood association chiefs have been notified to attend in person on the due date to gain awareness, so that they can indirectly instill fire prevention knowledge in citizens and protect security.

### Frugal Birthday Banquet to Help Students; Deeply Admired

Our newspaper received donations from all walks of life yesterday to help students, which is deeply appreciated. We also received a letter from Mr. Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, stating that they will use the savings from the frugal 50th birthday celebration of their respected father to help students, which is worthy of admiration for longevity and dedication to the world. The letter said, "The eighth day of the third month of the lunar calendar is the date of the 90th birthday of our father Hongru. Coincidentally, our mother Yu will also celebrate her 50th birthday on the 27th day of the tenth month of the lunar calendar. The year Guiwei coincides with the birthdays of both parents, a auspicious year, needless to say. The children and relatives planned to hold a celebration for the millennium, but our parents, seeing the difficult times, stopped their children from extravagant celebrations, in gratitude. Now, in order to fulfill the kindness and do something for longevity and the world, we have been ordered to save the peach noodles and wine banquet expenses on that day, and transfer them to various charitable organizations, one to wish the two elders longevity and boundless blessings, and the other to fulfill the natural duty of mutual assistance among human beings. Now we offer 500 yuan, hoping that you will receive it and allocate it to the student aid fund to contribute our meager efforts. (The amount of donations to various charitable organizations is listed below.) A total of 500 yuan each for the Xinwen Bao Lending Fund, Tongren Fuyuan Hall, Pushan Villa, Family Aid Village Association (run by Master Gainanxuan), and Nursery Hall. Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, jointly."

Student Aid Funds Received Yesterday

The student aid funds received yesterday include: Gu Naiwang, Naiwen, and Naiqiang, 500 yuan; Mrs. Hu, 200 yuan; anonymous (receipt number 2937 from Pu Jiting), 100 yuan; Chen Keren, 30 yuan; surplus money from the Tongren Shouyan meal, 17 yuan; Yang Jingshan, 6 yuan and 3 jiao, totaling 853 yuan and 3 jiao of savings coupons, with a balance of 252,622 yuan, 8 jiao, and 9 fen.

### The Chinese Religious and Moral Association Continues to Hold Spring Relief

The Chinese Religious and Moral Association in this city, since last winter, seeing that the prices of all goods have soared and the livelihood of the poor has been greatly threatened, has had the initiative to provide porridge and clothes in eleven places inside and outside the city. Since its implementation, it has greatly benefited the poor. Now that spring is approaching, the suffering of the poor has not yet been relieved. In order to carry out the initial intention of relief, the association has decided to continue to hold spring relief, and the porridge and mobile relief vehicles are dispatched daily in the two concessions to save the elderly, weak, and poor people on the streets.

### The Donation to Ban Superstitious Items Does Not Conflict with Religious Beliefs; The Survey in the Concession Has Been Completed; Taxation Can Begin After the City's Entire Survey Is Completed

After the establishment of the Preparatory Office for the Donation of Superstitious Business Items of the Municipal Finance Bureau, the outside world has slightly misunderstood, thinking that it conflicts with religion. A reporter from the Shenwen News Agency specifically visited the Preparatory Office Director Nan Ping. According to the conversation, the explanation of the relationship between the office and religion was quite detailed. According to Yun: "Since the establishment of this preparatory office under the order, those who do not know the truth in the outside world often think that this office conflicts with religion. However, the establishment of this office does not conflict with religion at all. People have their own freedom to believe in religion. What this office wants to ban in the future is not the belief in religion, but superstition. Therefore, the scope of the donation is only limited to those who engage in business in the form or name of religion. If any party has consultation and other matters, they can contact this office." According to the person in charge of the survey department, since the survey work of the department has begun, it has successively completed the survey of Nanshi, Husi, the French Concession, and part of the Public Concession. The rest, such as Hongkou, Yangshupu, Jiading, Pudong, Chongming, etc., are also scheduled to begin the survey within days. Once the entire survey work is completed, taxation can begin.

### Coal Stock Registration Completed; Totaling 14,000 Tons; Creating a Table to Report to the Coal Association; Unregistered Coal Stocks Are Not Allowed to Be Moved

The Shanghai Coal Association, in order to maintain the stability of the fuel market in Shanghai for a long time, sent a letter to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company at the end of last month, entrusting the company to handle the registration of coal stocks. The company has been handling it for more than ten days since it was entrusted to start, and it has been completed by the deadline of the 10th of this month. Yesterday, the statistics were completed, and the total amount of registered coal reached 14,848 tons and 487. Now the company has created statistics on the registration process and sent them to the Shanghai Coal Association for reference.

Tiered Registration

Yesterday, reporters from the Shanghai News Agency learned that the coal stock registration handled by Da Zhong Lian Coal Company this time was divided into three tiers, including coal briquette factories, fellow traders, and retailers. However, the types of coal are very diverse, but bituminous coal, white coal blocks, and chips are all included. The number of companies and the amount of coal stocks in the three tiers are listed as follows: (1) Three coal briquette factories, with 1,034 tons and 86; (2) Fourteen fellow traders, with 9,750 tons; (3) Twenty-nine retailers, with 4,63 tons and 627.

Reporting for Review

Yesterday, according to the person in charge of Da Zhong Lian Coal Company, the company was entrusted by the Shanghai Coal Association to handle the coal stock registration again, and also sent letters to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association, coal briquette factories, fellow traders, and other companies, requiring all fellow traders to re-register all their coal stocks, regardless of bituminous, white, block, or chips, within the deadline. Now the company has created a report on the process and reported it to the Coal Association. If the coal stocks are not registered, they will not be allowed to be moved in the future.

### Rickshaw Pullers at the North Station Entice Merchants and Seize Opportunities to Rob; Pulled to Remote Places, Accomplices Conspired; Impersonated Police Officers to Search and Rob Personal Belongings

Yang Xiaoqi, a rickshaw puller from Jiangbei, is only nineteen years old. Recently, he had a whimsical idea to collude with Xiao Long, who is at large and also a rickshaw puller. They specialize in soliciting passengers at the North Railway Station, all of whom are merchants from other cities such as Zhenjiang and Xuzhou. They do not know the route in Shanghai. The gangsters took the opportunity to deliberately pull these merchants to remote places, and on the pretext of having accomplices impersonate inspectors from the police agencies to search for contraband or citizen IDs, they robbed personal belongings and fled separately. On the afternoon of the 23rd of last month, at 9:30 pm, Yang Xiaoqi pulled a passenger, Yuan Yangchong, from Zhenjiang to a remote place on Feilun Road. Xiao Long, together with Dai, searched for a citizen ID in front of him.

Robbed of Valuables

Valuables worth 1,500 yuan were robbed and escaped. After the incident, Xu Kaitai, a detective from the Hongkou Police Station, was arrested and sent to a special court for interrogation.

### Police in the Two Concessions Are Planning to Eradicate Pickpocketing Activities; Detailed Measures Will Be Drafted and Promulgated

In order to stabilize local order, the police in the two concessions have implemented various measures to eliminate pickpocketing activities. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the police are now planning to completely eradicate these petty thieves. The new system for licensing bicycles recently implemented is an example of eradicating the activities of bicycle thieves. However, the authorities believe that bicycle thieves are only one type of thief, so they are paying close attention to other types of thieves. It is also heard that in the near future, they may promulgate and implement similar measures to the new licensing system to eliminate petty thieves.

### The Western Football League Group A Game Was Held Yesterday; Lianyi Won Over the Saint Team; The Score Was Three to Zero

The second round of the Western Football League Group A game between Lianyi and St. Francis was held at Jiaozhou Park yesterday afternoon starting at 3:30 pm. There was a large audience. Qu Yongfu of Lianyi performed well in this game, causing Fu En, the soul of the Saint team, to lose control. Sun Jinshun made the greatest contribution. Only Xu Erzhi of St. Francis was slightly active, and the rest did not perform well. Lianyi won over St. Francis with a score of three to zero, making the future of the championship even brighter. Lianyi gained the advantage of kicking off and attacked with all its might, going deep into the hinterland. W Xun broke through their encirclement in the middle and relieved the siege. After seven minutes, Zhuo Shijin got the ball and moved forward, and Li Yichen shot fiercely and scored. Lianyi took the lead in the first half with a score of one to zero. Changing the field and fighting again, St. Francis was even more unable to support. Taking advantage of Sun Jinshun's opportunity to sneak in, he crossed Greenberg, and Niu Li tried it out and actually hit the target. In less than five minutes, Gao Baozheng's time came, and he swept across at ten yards, and the Saint team's goalkeeper could not stop it, and the ball went into the net, winning with a score of three to zero.

### The Entire Aspect of French Vietnam (3)

— A Vietnamese Person

(3) Cochinchina and the Four Protectorates

French governance of its colonies did not solely rely on military force, but rather learned from the British strategy in India, designating some areas for direct rule while preserving existing feudal or tribal governing structures like principalities and dukedoms. This allowed them to maintain a semblance of power, though only in name, and to control the populace. Thus, even though Vietnam had fallen, small courts still existed, with kings who held nominal power, complete with officials and popular support, but actual political authority rested with the French, and their role was merely to approve decisions.

Currently, French Vietnam is governed by a Governor-General appointed by the French government. However, the only area that is purely a French colony in name is Cochinchina, known as "Nam Kỳ" in Chinese. This includes major provinces like Saigon (formerly Gia Định), Biên Hòa, Định Tường, Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên, An Giang, and the Côn Lôn Islands (Côn Đảo archipelago). Its total area is a mere 64,700 square kilometers, with a population of 4,616,000 (1936 census). France's direct colonization of Cochinchina has a long history. It began in 1858, during the reign of Qing Emperor Xianfeng, when a Spanish Catholic missionary was killed by the Annamese. France used the pretext of protecting Catholics and dispatched troops to occupy the Annamese capital of Huế and Tourane (Đà Nẵng) in September of that year. In February of the following year (1859), they occupied Gia Định (now Saigon) in Cochinchina. Two years later, in December 1861, they captured Biên Hòa, northeast of Gia Định. The following year, the Annamese army launched a counter-offensive against Biên Hòa but was soundly defeated. Simultaneously, Định Tường, Vĩnh Long, and the Côn Lôn Islands were also captured by French forces. Unfortunately, internal strife broke out in Annam, weakening the country's sovereignty and forcing it to submit to France. Consequently, in March 1863 (April 1863), Annam signed a treaty with France, agreeing to: (1) cede the provinces of Gia Định, Biên Hòa, and Định Tường in Cochinchina, as well as the Côn Lôn Islands, to France; (2) pay an indemnity of 20 million francs for military expenses; (3) allow French and Spanish missionaries to preach freely in Annam; (4) require French permission for Annam to cede territory to foreign countries in the future; and (5) grant French merchant ships and warships free navigation on the Mekong River. In 1867, under the pretext of "maintaining order and suppressing insurgents," the French further occupied the provinces of Vĩnh Long, Hà Tiên, and An Giang. In the spring of 1874, the French signed the Treaty of Saigon with the Annamese king, officially recognizing the six provinces of Cochinchina as French territory. Both Annam and France notified China of this treaty, but the Qing government's protest was ineffective. Thus, Cochinchina became the "French Cochinchina colony."

Besides Cochinchina, French Vietnam also includes four protectorates: Annam, Cambodia, Tonkin, and Laos.

The protectorate of Cambodia lies southwest of Annam. In ancient China, it was known as "Chenla." It has an area of 181,000 square kilometers and a current population of 3,046,000 (1936). Its inhabitants are mostly Indians who began migrating to Cambodia in the late Song dynasty, bringing with them the culture of Indian Brahmanism. During the reign of Emperor Chengzu of the Ming dynasty, it was briefly annexed by Annam. In the late Ming and early Qing dynasties, the Nguyễn clan rose to power and again incorporated it into Annam's territory. During the height of the Qing dynasty, Siam (Thailand) became powerful and vied with Annam for control of Cambodia, with the northern part falling under Siamese influence and the southern part under Annamese influence. During the Taiping Rebellion in China, the Siamese further supported Norodom as the King of Cambodia, excluding Annamese influence. When Norodom died in 1860, his two sons vied for the throne. Norodom, with the support of Siam, succeeded to the throne, while his brother Sisowath sought help from the French colonial authorities. The French Governor of Cochinchina, Bonard, seized the opportunity to expand French influence and declared Cambodia a French protectorate on August 11, 1863, employing French advisors. In July 1867, a French-Siamese treaty was signed, with Siam recognizing Cambodia as a French protectorate. France ceded the provinces of Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon in northern Cambodia to Siam, and the Mekong River was established as the border between Laos and Siam. In 1904, the French ceded the provinces of Preah Vihear and Laos from Siam to Cambodia. In 1907, they took Battambang, Siem Reap, and Sisophon. On the other hand, as early as 1884, France signed a new treaty with the Cambodian king, transferring national administrative power to France, which was exercised by the French Resident-General in Cambodia. Today, though the royal family still exists, it is merely a figurehead.

The protectorate of Tonkin, or Northern Vietnam, is located in the northern part of Annam and borders the provinces of Guangdong, Guangxi, and Yunnan in China. It has an area of 115,700 square kilometers and a population of 8,700,000 (1926), making it the most populous region in Vietnam. From a strategic standpoint, it is a good base for encroaching upon southwestern China and competing for dominance in East Asia. Therefore, after France gained control of Cochinchina and Cambodia, it moved to seize Tonkin. In December 1873, France sent troops from Cochinchina to Hanoi and signed a treaty with the Tonkin authorities, accepting French protection, allowing French ships to navigate freely on the Red River, and opening Haiphong and Thái Bình as trading ports. At the same time, they used force to occupy Hanoi and the area along the lower Red River. At that time, Liu Yongfu, a brave general of the Taiping Rebellion, fled to Annam with his troops after the rebellion failed and garrisoned the Tonkin region. He effectively resisted and defeated the invading French forces, killing the French commander Francis Garnier. Liu's Black Flag Army gained great renown, but the Annamese king, unaware of the true situation and lacking diplomatic acumen, signed the Treaty of Saigon on January 15, 1874, recognizing the French right to send a Resident-General to Huế (the Annamese capital) and Tonkin and accepting French protection. However, the Tonkin authorities, in cooperation with the Black Flag Army, resolutely refused to implement the Treaty of Saigon. The French were unable to navigate the Red River or preach in Tonkin, a situation that lasted for eight years. In 1882, the French government sent Henri Rivière to lead troops to attack Tonkin, drive out the Black Flag Army, and on April 25, occupy Hanoi and the area along the lower Red River. But on May 19, the Black Flag Army launched a counter-offensive, killing the French commander and wiping out the French forces. This shocked France, and the French National Assembly passed a bill allocating 5 million francs to finance an expedition to Tonkin. They sent warships to launch a large-scale attack, capturing Huế in August and forcing Annam to sign a humiliating treaty. Tonkin's administration was placed under French supervision, and Tonkin became a French protectorate.

The protectorate of Annam accounts for approximately one-fifth of Vietnam's total territory, with an area of 147,651 square kilometers. According to the 1936 census, it has a population of 5,656,000, second only to the protectorate of Tonkin. Annam is the heartland of Vietnam, historically serving as its political center. At its peak, its influence extended throughout Vietnam, encompassing Tonkin, Cambodia, and Cochinchina. However, after France occupied Cochinchina and designated Cambodia as a protectorate, the royal family's power declined. On December 15, 1874, unaware of the true situation, Annam signed the Treaty of Saigon with France, unknowingly falling into the status of a protectorate. Later, the Tonkin authorities, in alliance with our Liu Yongfu's Black Flag Army, repeatedly defeated the French in battle. Yet, the Annamese dynasty remained unprepared. In August 1882, French warships launched a large-scale attack, landing at Huế and forcing Annam to sign a treaty under duress. The main provisions of the treaty were: (1) Annam was to become a French protectorate; (2) France would handle Annam's foreign affairs; (3) French Resident-Generals and administrative officials would be stationed in Annam and Tonkin; (4) the province of Bình Thuận would be ceded to France; (5) Qui Nhơn, Quảng Nam, and Đà Nẵng would be opened as trading ports; (6) France would have the right to freely suppress the Black Flag Army in Tonkin; (7) customs and finances would be managed by the French; and (8) the administration of Tonkin would be supervised by the French. From this point onward, both Annam and Tonkin became French protectorates.

The protectorate of Laos lies west of Annam, bordering Thailand and Burma. It has an area of 231,400 square kilometers, the largest among the Vietnamese states, even larger than two Jiangsu provinces combined. According to the 1936 census, it has a population of 1,012,000, with only 4.37 people per square kilometer, making it the least densely populated region in Vietnam. Its inhabitants migrated from Sichuan, Guizhou, and Yunnan in China over 2,000 years ago, settling along the banks of the Mekong River and the upper reaches of the Chao Phraya River. They share the same origins as the Miao, Yao, and Yi peoples of China. During the Qianlong era of the Qing dynasty, Laos was invaded and occupied by Siam, pressuring Annam. As a result, the Mekong River was established as the border between Annam and Siam. When French influence permeated Cochinchina, Laos was annexed by Siam. After France swept through Cochinchina, Cambodia, Tonkin, and Annam in 1882, it issued an ultimatum to Siam, demanding the restoration of the Lao territories that had historically belonged to Annam and requiring Siamese troops to withdraw west of the Mekong River. In 1893, France enforced its border claims by force and compelled Siam to withdraw its troops. On October 3, the so-called Mekong Treaty was signed: (1) Siam recognized all territories on the left bank of the Mekong River south of 23 degrees north latitude as belonging to Cambodia and Annam; (2) Siam agreed to withdraw all its troops stationed on the left bank of the Mekong River within one month; (3) Siamese warships were not allowed to navigate the Mekong River; (4) Siam was not allowed to build fortifications within fifteen miles of the Mekong River's banks; (5) Siam had to pay France 2 million francs in war reparations. From then on, Laos fell within the French sphere of influence. In 1896, Britain and France negotiated and signed a treaty on January 16, guaranteeing the independence of Siam, with the Mekong River as the boundary of French influence. In 1904, Britain, France, and Siam reached an agreement, extending French influence 7,800 li (approximately 3,900 kilometers) west of the Mekong River. Thus, the status of Laos as a French protectorate was established.

France has a colonial governor in Cochinchina and Resident-Generals in the various protectorates. The Governor-General of French Indochina, based in Hanoi, oversees the political affairs of the Vietnamese colony and protectorates. He is assisted by three bodies: the Governor-General's Council, the Resident Council, and the Supreme Council of Economic and Financial Affairs, which serve as high-level advisory bodies to the Governor-General of French Indochina. In addition, Cochinchina has a Cochinchina Council, while the other three protectorates each have a Protectorate Council. Furthermore, Cochinchina has a Colonial Council, Tonkin, Annam, and Cambodia have Economic and Financial Councils, Tonkin and Annam have People's Councils, and Cambodia and Laos have Indigenous Advisory Councils. From this, it can be seen that the French rulers largely emulate the British and American approach in their governance of Vietnam, adopting a policy of appeasement and limited democracy as a means of winning over the people.

Economic Affairs & Economic Translations

### New Movement Restrictions and the Shanghai Economic Community

The Sino-Japanese economic community in this city has expressed concerns regarding the reform of the system of restrictions on the movement of goods and the institutions for the entry and exit of goods. In particular, the special privileges enjoyed by Japanese merchants to purchase and allocate goods in the interior have been fundamentally revised, and the Japanese side is extremely concerned about how the future trading institutions will be organized. The following are the observations of both the Japanese and Chinese sides.

Japanese Merchants' Observations

We have long known that after the determination of a new policy towards China, the economy of Central China must be readjusted on the basis of a new situation. This economic reorganization is an inevitable consequence of the new policy decision. We must seek to cooperate with Chinese economists from a new standpoint, strengthen the National Government, and promote the participation of the Central China economy in the war effort. The Japanese merchants are determined on this point and will not cause any further problems. However, what is worrying is the reorganization of the institutions for the purchase and allocation of goods. Although the institutions that have been announced are ideal for the general public, how they are operated is of great importance. If they can strengthen the institutions of the National Government, then the wartime system of the Central China economy can also be promoted. Therefore, how these institutions are operated in the future is of great interest. In conclusion, the problem still lies in the issue of morality on the part of the Chinese merchants. This time, the authorities' wise decision has had a significant impact on public sentiment. The change in the perspective of the Chinese merchants indicates they are determined, and it is believed that the changes will be successfully implemented. The details of the lower-level institutions have not yet been published, so there is no need to elaborate. In short, if the Chinese merchants' awareness can be clear, then the lower-level institutions will also be sound. How to organize these institutions now is our greatest concern!

Chinese Merchants' Observations

The Shanghai Chinese Economic Community

Expressed appreciation for this reform of the goods control system and expressed gratitude for the goodwill of the friendly nation of Japan. Intellectuals believe that after the realization of Chinese autonomous control, China's responsibility is heavier than before. They strongly advocate that all goods purchase and allocation should be based on the principle of Sino-Japanese equality. For the sake of the complete operation of the National Commercial Control Association, they hope that Japanese economists will provide more assistance to China, which lacks experience in economic control. (Yun Peng: Translated from the Continental News on March 13)

Economic Commentary

### Expectations of the National Commercial Control Association

Since the start of the war, the first major event in the Chinese economic community has been the promulgation of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline," and the second major event has been the stipulation of the Wartime Goods Movement Control Regulations and the establishment of the "National Commercial Control Association." The former is the cause, and the latter is the result; the former is a general principle, and the latter is a specific measure. Such a measure is indeed a foundation for the implementation of the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline," because the most important conditions in the "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" are "increasing production" and "regulating prices."

Not long ago, the "Economic Affairs" section of this newspaper also convened a symposium with leaders of the Shanghai industrial and commercial communities to discuss prices. The results of the discussion indicated that what the people hoped from the authorities was nothing more than increasing the supply of raw materials for production, clearing the sources of goods, paying attention to control measures, and strengthening commercial institutions (see the February 27 edition of this newspaper). Only two weeks have passed, and our expectations can be said to have been fulfilled as desired. There is no doubt that such a measure is a wise move on the part of the authorities and a source of welfare for the people.

The restriction of goods movement and the establishment of the Control Association can originally be discussed together, because their relationship is linked. Therefore, Minister of Industry Mei said the following in his statement: "The Wartime Goods Movement Control Regulations are a temporary measure. In the future, when the lower-level organizations of the National Commercial Control Association can reach the stage of universal strengthening, the association can be fully responsible for the autonomous control of all goods movement. Therefore, it is hoped that people in all localities will understand the spirit of the government's policy and actively and automatically strengthen the organization of each industry itself." We believe that these few words are worth pondering.

The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association has a dual meaning: one is the expression of the authorities' trust in the people, and the other is the expression of the people's sense of responsibility to the authorities. Because the authorities resolutely entrust the power of economic control to the people, this is the authorities' trust; the people are happy to accept such a complex and arduous task without hesitation, and this is the people's sense of responsibility. When trust and responsibility are combined, they are sufficient to form sincere cooperation, sincere economic cooperation. In addition, one aspect of trust is sufficient to evoke the sense of responsibility of the other party, and one aspect of the sense of responsibility is also sufficient to strengthen the trust of the other party, so the relationship between the two is also reciprocal.

Standing from the perspective of the private economic sector, we only talk about the issue of responsibility. Since we have grasped the authority of national economic control, we must of course take fulfilling our responsibilities and achieving results as our primary task. It must be known that the place of authority is not necessarily the place of achievement, but the place of achievement is precisely the place of authority. This statement is not philosophy, but it is the ultimate truth.

We deeply know that the National Commercial Control Association will become a powerful private economic organization, and we also deeply know that the leaders of the National Commercial Control Association must be the first-class talents of the private economic community. Because of this, our expectations for this new organization are all the more eager. Our only hope is to strengthen the lower-level organizations of this new organization, and especially to pay attention to the personnel issues in the lower-level organizations. Past experience tells us that, whether in Chinese political or commercial institutions, there are often very perfect systems and very wise leaders, but only because the lower-level organizations have not been cleared and corruption has occurred, the reputation has fallen to the ground and all previous efforts have been abandoned. This is the most painful thing in the past and the thing that must be most guarded against in the future. Such a situation can be compared to a very magnificent car. The structure of the entire machine is extremely solid, and the driver's skills are extremely superb. However, because of a defect in the parts of the car's chassis—even a minor part such as a screw—the car malfunctions, and the traffic police point out that the driver is not careful. Wouldn't it be wrong? Therefore, even if the driver knows that the vehicle they are driving is a new type of vehicle, they should still be careful to check whether all the parts installed under the car are complete and whether there is any damage. Our expectations for the soon-to-be-established National Commercial Control Association are also the same, that is, to strengthen the lower-level organizations and carefully select the lower-level personnel, taking fairness, integrity, and honesty as the conditions for selecting lower-level personnel and as the subject of training lower-level personnel. The treatment can be improved, but the management must be strict. This is the prerequisite for strengthening the lower-level organizations, and it is also the prerequisite for strengthening the entire organization.

### Banks and Money Houses Implement Credit Tightening: Loan Terms and Discounts All Handled in Accordance with Regulations, and Extreme Care Taken in Investigation and Review

After the member banks and money houses of the Banks and Money Houses Association followed the new loan methods decided by the joint meeting, tightened restrictions on loans, and avoided fueling speculation and hoarding, each bank and money house has recently been extremely cautious about all loans. At the same time, a special department-like organization has been established for investigation and review, and those familiar with the situation of each industry have been assigned to be responsible for handling: (1) investigating the business conditions and credit of each industry; (2) investigating the market prices of goods; (3) reviewing the legitimate use of the loan applicant. Loan applicants are limited to members of the industry association who have obtained a business license from the competent authority or have been registered. Goods used as collateral must prove that the holder's purpose is not to hoard for profit, and daily necessities are all rejected. Regarding loan "terms, valuations, and discounts," they are all handled in accordance with laws and regulations. As for the interest rate level, it has been adjusted to reflect market conditions, and the monthly interest rate has been appropriately increased to between 2% and 3%.

### Huazhong Tobacco Cooperative Notice: Qualified Wholesalers Pay Security Deposit from the 15th to the 17th of This Month, 50,000 Yuan for Class A, 30,000 Yuan for Class B

Regarding the Huazhong Tobacco Distribution Cooperative's handling of cigarette distribution to cigarette shops in this city, the various preparatory procedures have been completed. The qualification review of each registered cigarette shop has also been completed. It is now learned that the cooperative has issued a notice to the wholesalers who have passed the review, instructing them to pay the "security deposit" within three days, from the 15th to the 17th of this month. 50,000 yuan for Class A and 30,000 yuan for Class B, the payment should be made to the Jiangxi Road Tobacco Industry Bank as an agent, and then exchange it for a formal receipt from the cooperative, and receive a wooden sign of "Designated Merchant", that is, a designated wholesaler, and instruct each shop to hang it in a prominent place for identification. On the 18th, the cooperative will convene a meeting of more than 280 registered members of the industry in the city at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to provide business guidelines, and then begin to handle the distribution of goods. After the distribution of goods in the future, each cigarette shop must keep detailed records of business accounts so that the cooperative can send personnel to investigate at any time.

### Hua Yu Bank to Establish More Branches in the Interior

Hua Xing Commercial Bank transferred the right to issue banknotes to the Central Reserve Bank in January of the 30th year of the Republic of China and is active in the financial community as a purely commercial bank, guiding general commercial banks. In order to expand its business, in addition to establishing a branch in Hankou, it has also decided to expand its branches in the interior. In the past, there were only ten branches in the interior. After adding the three branches in "Hankou, Jiujiang, and Anqing" this time, it will be able to intensify the absorption of funds in the interior. At the same time, in terms of loans, it can establish close contact with the cooperatives that specialize in the purchase of agricultural products and develop all agriculture.

### North China to Conserve Fuel by Strictly Limiting Automobiles—Cargo Trucks Only Supply Essential Goods

Peiping, March 13, Hai Tong News Agency—In order to conserve fuel, the traffic of automobiles in North China is strictly limited. Large cars used by schools to pick up and drop off students and by factories to pick up and drop off workers are still allowed to run, but only if the distance does not exceed three kilometers. Cargo trucks are only used to transport essential products.

### Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry Holds Industrial Technology Roundtable

The primary condition after joining the war effort is to transform barren lands into productive areas. Hanyang and Wuhan, as industrial cities, particularly require development. Recognizing this, the Hankou Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry held an industrial technology expert roundtable at 3:00 PM on the sixth of this month in the Chamber's meeting room. The key discussion points were as follows: (1) Issues concerning industrial raw materials; (2) Issues concerning industrial power; (3) Issues concerning industrial capital; (4) Technical capabilities of Chinese workers and other related issues; (5) Issues concerning industrial zones and integrated industries; (6) Issues concerning industrial groups; (7) Desired assistance from the Chamber of Commerce and Industry on industrial issues; (8) Other matters. Many opinions promoting increased production were voiced during the session, yielding excellent results. (Continental News, March 20th)

Movement of Goods to be Handled by National Commercial Control Association

Following the National Defense Council's approval to establish a "National Commercial Control Association" and the formulation of wartime goods movement regulations, the control of goods in Shanghai and other domestic locations will now be managed by the National Commercial Control Association, supervised by both Chinese and Japanese officials. The recently promulgated goods movement laws by the authorities have reduced the number of items regulated compared to the past. Therefore, certain businesses that Japanese merchants previously had exclusive rights to will now be open to Chinese merchants as well.

### Review and Expectations for Farmers' Lives This Year

— Sheng Jian

Recently, there has been a surge in discussions regarding economic issues, but they largely focus on industry and commerce, with little attention paid to agricultural affairs. Although some have planned or proposed developing the rural economy and encouraging financial institutions to engage in agricultural lending, no concrete actions have been reported to date.

The importance of agriculture to the national economy is actually greater than that of industry and commerce. Commerce is the communication and application of goods, and industry is the process of turning raw materials into finished products, both of which are only semi-productive industries. Agriculture, on the other hand, derives from cultivating the land without damaging it, truly a purely productive industry. Agriculture is a source of resources that can be used inexhaustibly.

Given the importance of agriculture as described above, and China being an agricultural nation, it is unfortunate that China's economic and intellectual circles offer little assistance to agriculture and are largely indifferent, leading farmers to adhere to ancient farming methods for thousands of years, with no means of improvement. Many uncultivated lands remain, and there is no way to develop them. This is not because farmers do not consider improving cultivation methods and expanding land, but because intellectual circles have not engaged in disseminating knowledge to farmers, rural education has not been developed, and economic circles have no intention of investing in rural areas.

Today, Chinese agriculture rarely involves collective investment; it is mostly small-family farming, with the amount of land cultivated determined by the number of people in the family. The most common are farm households with ten to twenty mu; those with over one hundred mu are extremely rare, as one person's strength can only cultivate three or four mu. Due to the inability to improve farming methods, the rural economy is very difficult. During the busy season, using old methods and tools to cultivate three or four mu of land requires working day and night, and once the busy season is over, there is nothing to do. Rural side occupations have also never been emphasized in China, and the weakness of the farmers' economy, lacking side occupations to supplement it, is a major cause.

Agriculture is the foundation of the national economy and cannot be ignored; it must be supported. Therefore, farmers' production and consumption must be reviewed. Today, the income and expenditure of farmers' lives are truly unbalanced. This issue is now extremely critical, more so than improving cultivation methods and expanding land, and yet it has not been noticed by the people.

Currently, most farm households cultivate ten to twenty mu of land. Let us now take the example of a family of three cultivating ten mu to examine their annual income and expenditure, and it will be clear that farmers' lives cannot be stable.

Let us now list the income and expenditure figures for the best farmland in areas like Wuxi and Changzhou, as shown below: (Calculated for Ten Mu)

Field Income:

Rice (Best harvest: roughly one dan per mu; lowest harvest: one dan per mu; average: three dan) 30 dan

Value (at production site price) … 5000.00 yuan

Wheat (six mu) 6 dan … 1500.00 yuan

Rapeseed (two mu) 2 dan … 1000.00 yuan

Miscellaneous grains (two mu) … 600.00 yuan

Firewood (rice and wheat stalks, etc.) … 600.00 yuan

Total Income … 8700.00 yuan

Cultivation Capital:

Fertilizer (Infertile land requires an additional 60% increase over the following figures)

Soybean cake 600 jin … Current value 720.00 yuan

Ash and human manure 700 jin (300 self-supplied) (400 purchased) … Current value 240.00 yuan

Miscellaneous fertilizer … Current value 400.00 yuan

Total 1360.00 … Average 136.00 yuan per mu

Mechanical water lifting (double the cost for oxen and manual labor) … 600.00 yuan

Hired labor 40 workdays (excluding three for transplanting rice and harvesting rice, etc.) (and temporary hires for necessary work) … 400.00 yuan

Rent payment At nine dou per mu, discounted by 30% of the market price … 1575.00 yuan

Total Capital Expenditure … 3935.00 yuan

Net Profit after deducting income and expenditure … 4765.00 yuan

Annual living expenses for a family of three (calculated at the minimum rural living standard):

Rice 7.5 dan … Value 1875.00 yuan

Wheat 2.5 dan … Value 625.00 yuan

Fuel (50 yuan per month) … Value 600.00 yuan

Cooking oil and lamp oil (1.5 yuan per day) … Value 540.00 yuan

Salt … 100.00 yuan

Matches One small box every five days … 18.00 yuan

Soap bar One bar every half-month … 264.00 yuan

Clothing Four short cloth garments made per person per year, totaling twelve garments: one each for spring, autumn, winter, and summer … 720.00 yuan

Shoes and socks … 200.00 yuan

Farm tool repair … 340.00 yuan

Medical expenses … 300.00 yuan

Other … 720.00 yuan

Total 6302.00 yuan Net profit is insufficient by 1537.00 yuan

The above harvest figures are the average figures for current cultivation harvests, and they are extremely accurate. The month refers to good farmland where both rice and wheat can be planted; if it is cotton or mulberry land, the harvest is even less than this figure.

The rent payment item in the expenditure refers to those who rent land; those who own their own land only need to pay national grain tax. At most, they only need to pay 20% of the rent amount. However, farmers who own their own farmland are very rare. Many poor farmers do not pay rent; in addition to rent, they also need to pay a small rent. Farmers who have to pay a small rent often move to cities to work because they cannot afford to pay the rent.

Regarding the living expense item of rice, farmers are laborers, and the above figures are truly the minimum; most of them are higher than this. Furthermore, dishes are not included, as they have self-grown vegetables. However, annual sacrifices and religious superstitions, family visits, and those who cannot work such as the elderly and children are not included in the calculation. They cannot maintain their livelihood because the selling price of rice at the production site is different from the soaring price of fertilizers and daily necessities. This year, the price of rice is more than 20 times higher than the price at the time of the incident, while the price of fertilizer has reached 45 to 60 times higher, and the price of daily necessities and clothing has risen to 70 to 120 times higher. Previously, one dou of rice could be exchanged for one set of clothes, but now it requires three dou. One sheng of rice could be exchanged for three bars of soap, but now it requires 1.2 dou. The price of rice today is indeed high, but the price of other items is even higher. If no effective relief measures are devised, the rural economy this year will reach a critical juncture. The relief methods are nothing more than the following:

(1) Implement low-priced allocation of agricultural fertilizer.

(2) Improve the method of allocating daily necessities in rural areas.

(3) Increase the quantity of daily necessities allocated. The above points are only temporary economic relief. Half of spring has passed, and the busy farming season will arrive in a blink of an eye. The allocation of fertilizer must begin immediately. Water-lifting machines, etc., should also be modified to burn firewood. Last year's autumn drought caused dry and withered rice fields everywhere due to the lack of mechanical water-lifting.耕牛耕牛年來亦因來源絕迹，大見缺乏。In recent years, plowing cattle have also been in great shortage due to the disappearance of their sources. If these various aspects are not relieved early, not only will agricultural production not increase, but even the existing production will not be maintained.

The general situation of this year's farming year has been described above. The government authorities should pay attention to it, and the Shanghai economic circles with idle funds should also implement rural loans, such as purchasing water-lifting machines and renting them to farmers at low prices, which may also be one of the assistance methods. It is hoped that they will earnestly advance to lay the economic foundation of the country.

Economic Survey

### The Evolution of the Pawn Industry in Shanghai

— Chen Xitai

The pawnshop industry is not only established to regulate the economy of the poor, but also one of the social economic institutions. I don't know when pawning started in our country. The author does not have time to do research. Only based on what I have seen and heard, I will briefly describe the general situation of the modern pawn industry and the evolution of the pawn industry in Shanghai over the past few decades.

Opening a pawnshop requires a large amount of capital to be reserved to wait for the pledge of goods. Therefore, the pawnshop is a place where wealth and goods gather, and it is also the target of thieves. Therefore, throughout the dynasties, once there was turmoil, the pawnshop would be the first to suffer. Tracing back to the Taiping Rebellion in the late Qing Dynasty, the pawnshop suffered disaster and naturally ceased to exist. After the chaos was pacified, the survivors were devastated, and people's lives were exhausted. Local authorities established public pawnshops everywhere to regulate the poor. The pawn period was stipulated to be three years, with a four-month grace period, and a monthly interest rate of 1.2%. The capital was either allocated by the provincial treasury or raised by local gentry. Subsequently, in cities with better public security, private pawnshops were established. The pawn period was the same as that of the public pawnshops, but the interest rate was mostly 1.5%. In rural towns, there were private pawnshops (acting as agents), called "receiving pawnshops." Although the term was the same as that of the public pawnshops, redemption could be made from the receiving pawnshop within two months or six months (depending on the amount of capital). After the deadline, the goods could be redeemed from the designated public pawnshop in the city, and the interest rate was 2% per month. This was because the receiving pawnshop did not have much capital. For the benefit of the people, the public pawnshops allowed merchants to open agencies in rural towns. Therefore, the interest rate of the receiving pawnshops was higher, and they were allowed to transport goods that had not been redeemed within the prescribed period to the city and re-pawn them at the public pawnshop. During this period, the pawnshop not only accepted pledges of clothes and jewelry, but also agricultural tools and agricultural products such as silk, cotton, and cotton cloth in rural towns, which was similar to today's bank warehouses. After the founding of the Republic of China, private pawnshops were once again on the decline due to constant turmoil. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, most of the pawnshops in Nanjing, Suzhou, Yangzhou, Zhenjiang and other places were still state-owned or state-assisted private enterprises. From this, it can be seen that the pawnshop industry is important to the social economy. In Shanghai, however, things were different due to the concessions. All private pawnshops and regulations in the Chinese and concession areas still followed the old public pawnshop model, with a term of three years and four months. The interest rate was 2% per month. However, because the term was too long, the valuation was very low. For example, if the pawn capital was one yuan, after 40 months, with the addition of interest, it would increase to more than 1.8 yuan. Therefore, an item originally worth 10 yuan could only be pawned for 2 or 3 yuan. Shanghai's concessions were also places where Chinese and foreigners lived together. Ordinary working-class poor people had no valuables, let alone valuable items that could be pawned at the pawnshop. Therefore, small pledges with high interest rates in the concessions emerged. It is said that the term of the first pawns was only one month, with a period of ten days, and the interest rate was 3% per period. Later, as more and more people engaged in this industry, the industry became competitive, and the term was changed to two months, and the interest rate was reduced to 2% per period. Later, the Public Works Department began to crack down on and manage it, and it was changed to a four-month term. The interest rate was 2% per period for those below 3 yuan, and 3% per month for those above 3 yuan. Although the term was short and the interest rate was high, it was convenient for the poor, so small pawns were able to flourish until today. Among the 40-month pawnshops and the 4-month pawnshops, there was also a type of pawn that was in between. Its term was set for 18 months. The interest rate was the same as that of the pawnshops, at 2% per month. In recent years, it has been changed to 12 months. On Mingguo Road in the French Concession, at the Laobeidou intersection, there is a Yuanshun store that still hangs a high-quality sign, which is this type of pledge.

After the founding of the Republic of China, the situation changed faster and faster. Moreover, Shanghai was a civilized center and a prosperous place, and people competed for fashion. The term of the pawnshops was too long, and the clothes that were full of clothes became stale after 40 months, and no one patronized them. It had no choice but to gradually shorten the term to 30 months, 24 months, and 18 months. Recently, due to the rising prices of goods, it has been changed from 12 months to 8 months. In this process, the pledge has been changed from four months to six months and eight months due to the shortening of the term and the increase in the value of the pawnshop, which has caused many pledges to tend to pawnshop loans. In order to compete for business, the interest rate for pledges exceeding 5 yuan was calculated at 2% per month. For those over 10 yuan, the monthly interest rate was cheaper than that of pawnshops. Some large pawnshops also set the term to 18 months, and the interest rate was reduced to 1.4% per month to compete with pawnshops. Since the completion of the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway and the opening of traffic, the main station was established in Zhabei. The market in Zhabei has gradually prospered as a result. Pledges have also gradually been opened in Zhabei. Subsequently, the city wall of Shanghai County was demolished, and Nanshi was revitalized. Pledges also invaded, and pawnshops were no longer the only ones in the market. However, the value of pawnshops was low, and the value of pledges was high. The pledges were more convenient for borrowers, so they tended to go to them. Therefore, the pawnshops in Nanshi Zhabei Chinese area launched a group attack on the pledges. In the early years of the Republic of China, they filed a complaint with the Jiangsu Provincial Supervisory Agency, accusing the pledges of heavy interest and exploitation, which harmed the poor, and requested a ban. As a result, those who had already opened businesses were ordered to formulate regulations, restrict compliance with the regulations, and allow them to obtain licenses to operate normally. It was not allowed to secretly open new ones to restrict them. Therefore, on the Nanshi side, at the junction of the French Concession, the opening of pledges along the roads of the French Concession was scattered, which was a deformed phenomenon to welcome the pledges of Nanshi. When the August 13 Incident broke out, not only Zhabei Nanshi in the Chinese area, but also the Hongkou area and the edges of the concession were affected. They all moved into the central area of the concession to choose a place to resume business. Because many people were fleeing to the concession, the population was dense, and the pawn industry was also quite prosperous. Unfortunately, good times did not last long. Taking their own money to guard the goods for the pledgers, the prices of the goods skyrocketed, and the value of the currency continued to depreciate. They could not withstand the pledgers' repeated turnovers. In addition, the redemption of pledges on behalf of customers emerged. The "frames" of the pawnshops and pledges were turned almost empty by three times and four times. Therefore, when new and old currencies were exchanged, the pawnshops and pledges had to stop pawning. In order to take care of the livelihood of their partners, on the one hand, they presented to the Public Works Department to narrow the scope, shorten the term, and increase the interest rate to try to support themselves. Therefore, pawnshops changed from 12 months to 8 months. Pledges changed from 6 months to 4 months. The interest rate was increased to 6% per month. Moreover, the business hours were short due to the short capital, and the business was only open for a few hours a day. Both the owner and the partners were tired and depressed. On the other hand, they simply cut the nails and cut the iron to close the business and find another way out. That is why there is today's deformed prosperity in Nanshi.

During the August 13 Incident, the concession area was completely closed all around. When the war moved west, the chickens and civilians near Shanghai gathered in the refugee area of Nanshi. Because the boundary was closed and impassable, daily necessities had to be carried around the concession for pledges, which was quite troublesome. At this time, speculators contacted Japanese merchants as a background and established a trading company in the refugee area. They specialized in pledging pawn tickets, with a deadline of seven days and a grace period of three days, totaling ten days, and the interest rate was calculated as 2% of the pledge capital. Later, because the business was quite busy, more and more people engaged in this industry, so they also pledged cash. According to Japanese pledge regulations, the term was one month, and the face value of the regular ticket was also written as 2% of the pledge capital, and no interest was charged separately. (The amount of interest taken according to the pledge capital has been clearly written on the face of the ticket.) Later, when a part of the iron gate was opened, only a very small number of pledges resumed business in the refugee area. Moreover, the municipal authorities tried to revive Nanshi and specially designated Nanshi as an entertainment area. Therefore, the pledge became more and more prosperous. However, if you want to apply for a pledge license in Nanshi, according to the legal rules, you must operate according to the term of 8 months and the monthly interest rate of 2%. As for those who resumed business after the war, although they did not submit to the Social Affairs Bureau to allow shortening the term and increasing the interest rate, in fact, they have already imitated the precedent of the concession and printed an appendix on the pawn ticket saying "In this extraordinary time, the industry has agreed to set the monthly interest rate at 0% per yuan and set four full months as the expiration date" to indicate that in this extraordinary period, they could not comply with the legal rules. This is the recent evolution of the pawn industry in Shanghai.

### On the Communication of Chinese and Japanese Cultures …Dedicated to Mr. Hayashi Fusao with the Utmost Sincerity

— Zheng Xun

Chinese rice can be moved to Japan, and Japanese peaches can be moved to China. However, due to differences in climate and soil, the harvest will definitely not be as good as the original, and even after years of improvement, it is difficult to avoid deterioration.

Whether the transplantation of plants is successful is determined by the different conditions of climate and soil. Needless to say, cultural exchange is determined by the different conditions of the historical realities of each nation. Ignoring the adaptability of climate and soil to transplant plants, there is no guarantee that it will be completely satisfactory in the future. Similarly, ignoring the historical realities of each nation and talking about cultural communication is also not guaranteed. Therefore, before discussing the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures, we must deeply consider the national characteristics of China and Japan, the history they have experienced, and the political, economic, living, and all other states in which the people of both countries are currently.

There would be no Japanese culture without the historical realities of the Japanese nation, and similarly, there would be no Chinese culture far from the historical realities of the Chinese nation. However, people in the world who discuss the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures often forget this fact. These people always think that there is a culture that can be applied to both Japan and China that transcends everything. This is the biggest illusion.

Political independence, economic cooperation, military alliance, and cultural communication. I think it is worth noting that cultural communication is listed together with the remaining political economy and military affairs. Because cultural issues are a part of national issues, the issue of Chinese and Japanese cultural communication must start from the historical realities of the Chinese and Japanese nations in order to explain everything else.

In recent years, both the Chinese and Japanese governments and the public have devoted great efforts to the work of Chinese and Japanese cultural communication. The organization of the China-Japan Cultural Association and the promotion of various undertakings, Mr. Hayashi Fusao's exchanges with the domestic cultural circles, etc., are all full expressions. Furthermore, it is said that Japanese writers' groups are preparing to establish "Literary Halls" in various parts of China in an attempt to exchange ideas between writers of the two countries and publish literary magazines, etc. These plans are all very good. However, relying solely on inviting guests, building houses, publishing magazines, etc., will still not achieve cultural communication. I hope that Japanese writers must have a deep understanding of China's historical reality.

Recently, I saw a record of a literary symposium by Hayashi Fusao, Kusano Shinpei, Tao Changsun, Zhang Ruogu, etc. in the Japanese Continental News. In summary, it seems that Hayashi Fusao has no understanding of the current situation of Chinese writers who are suffering in reality. Hayashi Fusao's words mean that Chinese writers should not be bound by politics and reality to create a "pure literature" that transcends these realities - he not only cannot understand Chinese literature, but his understanding of general literature is also very unreliable.

It is impossible to create literature far from reality.

The historical realities of the nation have nothing to do with these fantasies.

We have old people groaning under high prices, and we also have intellectual classes who feel distressed about the current political situation. We need to share their suffering and strive for a bright China in this suffering. This is our literature. Literary figures who can understand and sympathize with our journey, regardless of nationality, regardless of fame, are all our "literary friends."

Hayashi Fusao said: Japanese people suffer doubly, while Chinese people suffer quadruply. If Mr. Hayashi wants to be a friend of Chinese literature, then I hope that he needs to have the most profound understanding and reflection on this quadruple suffering.

### First Insomnia

— Fang Ming

Every night, going back and forth twice, the corner in front of the cigarette and paper shop has become a place I pass through every day, and one I am very familiar with.

On the uneven sidewalk paved with square stones of different sizes, lies a tattered mat with only a few strands left. On top of it, a high pile is huddled, covered with a piece of torn hemp sackcloth, rhythmically rising and falling, sobbing. The dim light shining obliquely from the snack shops across the street makes this high, mound-like monster appear even more eerie and terrifying. This terrifying monster is something that catches my eye every night as I pass by.

One early evening, in the same spot, two children, around seven or eight years old and of similar age, were sitting listlessly. One, a girl, seemed slightly older. They were both squatting there, exposing two coal-black arms, their hands tucked into the pockets of their thin cotton vests. Their bodies trembled violently, their teeth chattered, and they let out intermittent, weak moans:

"…Mister…Miss…save…save me…so…cold…ah!…"

This sound was also very familiar to my ears. But this time, it pulled me back from my hurried pace and forced me to glance at them. I wanted to look longer and dig out a couple of small denomination notes from my pocket for them. But I didn't know if I had any small denomination notes left in my pocket, and time didn't allow me to linger for even a minute, or even a second. I could only cast them one last glance of farewell before leaving. When I looked back at them again, they were also staring at me, as if they understood everything, or as if they were secretly mocking my stinginess and harboring resentment towards me.

As usual, another evening, the sky was exceptionally gloomy. As I rushed out the door, a fierce gust of cold wind struck me in the face, making me shiver and shrink my head into my collar. When I got to the street, I realized it was snowing. The pedestrians along the road were murmuring: "It's snowing! Spring snow is colder than winter snow!"

In the corner in front of the cigarette and paper shop, the mound-like monster still existed, rising and falling. Specks of snow fell on the torn hemp sackcloth, the edges of the tattered mat rustling softly, mixed with the monotonous groans coming from the edge of the hemp sackcloth. The air became even more gloomy.

I glanced at it habitually and strode away. Because of my hurried pace, I occasionally bumped into pedestrians. Their resentful curses came from behind, and I had to ignore them.

The wind howled, and the cold of the deep night was especially piercing. The snow fell even harder, and a thin layer had already accumulated on the rooftops and sidewalks, and it was still falling endlessly. I struggled through the snow on my way home, almost covered in a layer of white powder. My running shoes were also soaked, making a "chih-pu chih-pu" sound as I walked, my toes were numb with cold, and my hands were immobile.

The snow fell thicker and thicker, and the scene before me was a blur of gray and white. There were even fewer pedestrians, and the surroundings were unusually silent, punctuated only by the monotonous sound of "sha-sha-sha-sha," accentuating the atmosphere of desolation.

I walked forward with my head down, and jumbled thoughts constantly occupied my mind. I unknowingly walked past the corner of the cigarette and paper shop. But suddenly, a thought popped into my head, as if I had forgotten something. I involuntarily turned around and walked back towards the corner of the cigarette and paper shop. In the dark corner, there was no longer a high, mound-like pile, only a expanse of white. I wondered where the monster had moved to. But when I got closer, the high pile was still there, but it was buried in snow and couldn't be clearly distinguished at first. Yet, I suspected it was no longer rising and falling, no longer moving, and I could no longer hear any groans. Had they fallen asleep? But even asleep, they wouldn't be completely silent and motionless. So I raised my foot and gently kicked the high pile. But it still didn't move. I suddenly felt a wave of terror and quickly turned around, lifted my feet, and ran straight back to the dormitory.

I lay under the covers, and the shadow of terror still flickered before my eyes.

"These two poor little lives, have they disappeared under the cover of white snow?" I tried to dispel these jumbled thoughts, but I couldn't. I closed my eyes tightly and tried to fall asleep, but I couldn't. I simply let myself think, let my thoughts develop endlessly.

"Why do they have to suffer…what crimes have they committed? …Aren't other people enjoying themselves?…"

"The great world writer Gorky, he spent his childhood begging and scavenging for garbage. Who can say that these two dead little lives, and all the poor wretches in Shanghai and all of China who suffer the same fate, are absolutely without talent?…"

The clear ringing of the bell came from the dormitory supervisor's room; it was one o'clock. Lingering thoughts still stubbornly occupied my mind and refused to leave. Sometimes it was drowsy and blurred, and sometimes the high, mound-like monster, the pitiful faces, and the weak groans and sighs… reappeared before my eyes.

I had my first insomnia.

### Sincerity and Socializing

— Lin Huajie

I don't know whose article influenced me, but I always felt that the dispersal of a lavish banquet and the departure of the guests was a rather desolate scene; and I really dreamed of a banquet that would never end.

But when my profession gave me a kind of luck, a kind of luck that allowed me to attend banquets often, I began to understand how ridiculous the idea I had previously held was. (People should form their own feelings in their own lives, and should not accept the feelings that others have gained in their lives!)

Imagine at a banquet where cups and dishes clink and the host and guests are all happy, the host says the purpose of the banquet in a witty tone, and humbly asks for understanding: the dishes are too meager; and the distinguished guests, although eating a feast that costs a thousand gold, have not forgotten that their mouths have another use, so the conversation at the table is lively.

If you haven't just brought a mouth with you, you can't help but be surprised at how erudite our hosts and guests are. Words come and go in droves, from unknown places to unknown places. Although they come and go freely, the talk always revolves around certain topics: gambling, prostitution, and business.

But what can you say sitting at the table? With what words can you join in the fun in this lively scene? Escape? No, you can't escape; look, the host's car of words is rushing towards your station, can you let this car derail at your station? To be honest, you lack that bit of courage, so you smile.

Smiling is also a language, a polite language. However, when constant smiling is not an expression of emotion, but becomes a language, you understand the sadness of smiling. And your smile, just as people call that kind of banquet, is a form of socializing.

That's why I started to fear banquets, not because my stomach can't handle the greasiness; I'm afraid of the socializing smile that the mirror shows me. The education I received praised sincerity: but the reality of society wants you to socialize! And the ultimate price of this socializing is the loss of sincerity.

(Our various "families" are still talking about reading and being a person, two completely unrelated topics.)

Sir, I have only been out of school for one hundred and seventy-four days, maybe I have seen too little, I hope time will allow me to see a little beauty. I hope that future generations can see a little beauty: (Our society expects a lot from young people, but leaves them so little!)

### Squeezing and Pushing

— Ling Qingnian

"Squeezing" means "squeezing in," and "pushing" means "pushing out." The methods are old; examples from ancient times are as common as weeds, easily picked up. Although the Compendium of Materia Medica has not listed them as effective remedies for the world, they seem to be included in The Art of War by Sun Tzu. In today's world, where "talented people emerge from every generation, each leading the literary scene for five hundred years," they have long been used to the point of extreme familiarity.

These are certainly not things that a common farmer can hear about. But in the suburbs of the city, according to the saying "everyone praises him, and all the people of Chu cheer him on," if some risk-taking heroes with the idea of doing business also took a bit of a Shanghai style, carrying a big rooster, packing two packages of Pyramid cigarettes, or a few pieces of Lao Xiangmao there and here, then they would be more familiar with squeezing and pushing than in the fields; otherwise, they would inevitably "lose both the lady and the troops," considering him unlucky.

Therefore, even in urban transportation, squeezing and pushing are becoming more popular. For example, on the tram, it's like the noisy society as a whole; to exist in this miniature society, you must learn all the skills of squeezing and pushing. First, you have to squeeze into a long line at the station. Before the tram even gets close, a torrent of people rushes towards the body of the tram. As a result, the tram doesn't crush people to death, but people have to squeeze the tram. A large string of people hangs on the front of the tram. But the people don't move forward, because there are people in front. And no one dares to wait on the footboard for five minutes, because there are also people behind them. Some people may be stout and broad-minded, so those squeezed on the left and right make him uncomfortable. So he uses both elbows, hitting people's noses; or perhaps he is a bit clumsy underfoot, so he grabs the armrest and takes full control, not allowing people to move forward.

Sometimes, there is a standstill for a dozen seconds, with people only moving left and right at the tram door, while the tram car is still empty. The ticket sellers really have occupational diseases; they explain their ancestry for three generations, and there are still two or three hanging on the iron gate. The tram has already started. So the heroes below who adhere to the ancient teaching of not standing under a dangerous wall can start arguing: "Pig, is this a life-saving tram?"

But after having the opportunity to squeeze onto the third or fourth life-saving tram, if the ticket seller still refuses to pull the iron gate, the aforementioned heroes will shout that they are being squeezed to death - this precisely shows that they are already working hard to "push." They desperately grab for a corner seat, but it doesn't work! They push people away, but other people's buttocks are flexible, while their own buttocks nonchalantly press on other people's knees. But those sitting next to them, in order to avoid being invaded, can poke with their hands, turn their bodies forty-five degrees, cross their legs, and light a cigarette.

So another hero is squeezed out. He can only huddle in a corner, still retaining the right to curse loudly. The entire tram car is squeezed and pushed even more fiercely. When it arrives at the station, the victor squeezes down the footboard in one go, and the hero next to him is especially envious, so he gives a cold push.

[The hero is] pushed under the tram wheels. - This is one of the social news data about squeezing and pushing. Very ordinary.

"They must seek monopoly and ascend to it, and look around to see that there is no market profit, so people all think it is cheap, and so they collect taxes on it." Who told him to take the tram? Wood, charcoal, or a tricycle wouldn't cause him to be "squeezed in" and "pushed out." This is the fault of the common people.

Gentlemen of ancient times would not have squeezed and pushed in such an unsightly manner. Yielding replaced extreme wickedness; although they could "squeeze in," they were still "pushed up" in the end. The Song Dynasty's Emperor Taizu of Chenqiao mutiny was a typical historical figure, and Julius Caesar of Rome was also the most intelligent. I think, rather than being "pushed out," it is more interesting to belong to "pushed up," and it does not lose the style of gentleness and kindness.

For example, currently, "running the market" means "squeezing in," and "closing early" certainly does not mean "pushing" customers out by force. In the end, they all "push up" the price of stockpiled goods - today's gentlemen also do not lose their gentleness and kindness, and they can be allowed to be listed outside of the base people.

I.

I bitterly guard my lonely small room,

Annoyedly listening to the merciless chimes,

Calculating the passing of the year's end.

II.

With a heavy limp, counting the rugged stone steps, climbing upward with difficulty - this is for the sake of a dream!

"Ah, what a steep mountain path!" I look up in anguish -

A subconscious thought flashes by, hope seems to have been taken away by the mountain wind.

I lower my head in frustration - feeling that I have been deceived!

"Take a break!" Looking at the stone bench by the roadside.

Looking at the long journey ahead, my eyes are a little moist, but who would know: —

In this empty mountain wilderness, there is a traveler sobbing.

"This is the course of life! Be brave, go forward!" The mountain wind whispers in my ear.

I awkwardly move my limp foot.

III.

Dreams are sweet, life is bitter.

The past is like passing clouds —

There is nothing to reminisce about.

### "杞憂" - A New Crisis in the Theater World

— Meng Lang

Because of my love for theater, I make sure to watch every performance, and I haven't stopped for years, so I can be considered an old theatergoer. But in recent years, the impression of watching plays has become more and more bland, even boring! - I don't think this is a personal interest problem.

Can the superficial prosperity and liveliness of theatrical performances explain the natural development of its essence? The declining standards of theatrical art are a matter of ironclad fact. Because I love it too much, I would like to present my observations below for the reference of those engaged in theatrical work: - Let me state in advance that this is only a spectator's impression, and whether it is correct or not is up to the theater elders to decide!

"Opening a Play" First-ism

In fact, this is an old cliché, but now it has been revived and is becoming increasingly heated. Mainly, I think this is based on commercial requirements: what kind of plays are most popular with the audience? This is of course a prerequisite after the theater troupe is corporatized. Therefore, in order to adapt to this requirement, most playwrights condescend to follow suit, abandoning their "life faction" or "artistic faction" stubborn views, and flock to the path of "farce (Meloderama)," because only this kind of thing is written: the plot is tortuous, the plot is lively, suffering - suffering happily, dying - dying cleanly, without seeking rationality, and lacking individuality. The audience is stimulated enough, fortunately they come to seek enjoyment or vent; it is also convenient to write themselves, as long as they do their best to "be strange and unique" and "be funny"!

Try reading the special issues of the performances of various theater troupes. The author either praises himself, or admits his sins in advance, saying "there is no book without coincidences," just to muddle through for a living; alas, they automatically take off the sacred and inviolable signboard of dignity! Even more, they are beautifully called "horror plays," "legendary plays," or "…" Who knows that this kind of absurd and unprincipled "farce first-ism" not only cuts off the glorious history of the theater world, hinders the progress of performance and acting, and makes Chinese theater troupes fall into an abyss of no return, and can only degenerate and not develop one step further; at the same time, it may get the opposite effect of "winning the audience" - driving away the truly heartfelt supporters, so as an audience member who appreciates theatrical art, I am afraid that it will be impossible to watch a meaningful real tragedy or comedy in the future!

Performance "Variety Show-ization"

In recent years, the theater people have indeed made progress, understanding the psychology of the audience and being able to cater to their preferences. The directors are not willing to be outdone and have established their special achievements, which is: performance "variety show-ization." In Andreev's famous works, a Henan variety show actually appeared, coming and going without a trace, winning some foolish laughter from the audience! In the meantime, some animal dances are strung together, cow dances, horse dances - purely Hollywood movies' boring gimmicks. Recently, inserting Peking Opera into spoken drama seems to have become the most fashionable thing: so a cappella, inserting jokes, gongs and drums, stage rehearsals... even the bustling meeting of Confucius Temple has been moved to the stage. When the mood is up, add such a piece of Kunqu Opera or Storytelling, if they think of Shanghai Opera or Shaoxing Opera, why not insert it? I believe that in the near future, even the magic of Chinese shadow puppetry, Deng ××'s stunts, He's diabolo; solo plays, ventriloquism, or grass skirt dances, etc., have the possibility of being moved to the stage; in this way, the audience spends one price and watches many interesting variety shows, which is more economical than going to the amusement park!

Some people want to argue: the insertion in the play is for the needs of the plot, or to increase the atmosphere, show the background, express the identity, occupation, and hobbies of the characters in the play…! But please, the directors responsible for the performance, think quietly with their artistic conscience: is it entirely for these, and is there no intention to overstep the mark in the slightest - to cater to the audience's low-level tastes: to join in the fun, to have some flourish?

I do not oppose the necessary insertions in the play, because that is reasonable and has an organic effect on the play itself. What I am worried about is that this "variety show-ization" of the performance will destroy the unity and harmony of the overall mood and atmosphere of the performance, and even rob the guest of his host, replacing the artistic life of the drama itself with variety shows. - I hope I am a worrier, because this is a matter below common sense. For theater directors who have a correct understanding and rich cultivation of theater art, of course they have a plan in mind and will certainly not fall so low and humble!

Watching "People" Not Watching "Plays"

Recently, the newly emerging spoken drama has also partially been infected with the bad traditional poison of old dramas: watching "people" not watching "plays." The audience often goes to see a play because they want to see a certain actor, and if it is not him or her performing that day, they even want to ask for a refund. The emergence of this phenomenon may be because a certain actor's acting skills are superb or he or she performs seriously, so he or she has won the favor of thousands of viewers, and naturally has faith and admiration for him or her. But the fact is not always the case. "The audience of the green × Civilization play also often has similar events happen. Is this also the artistic success of the Civilization play actors? No, there are reasons for its existence. The star system or the leading role system is at work!

Although China's newly emerging spoken drama has only a short history of thirty years, it has always maintained its excellent tradition: there is no leading role here, and there is no star appearance. There is no distinction between the protagonist and supporting roles in the play. Everyone is a member of the performance, because it is a comprehensive art, which is essentially different from old dramas. It is a collectively created organic whole. But when it falls into the hands of merchants who believe in "money first," the situation changes. In order to sell tickets, the bosses desperately push out a few stars to attract the audience - and use their blind idol worship. Even in the most advanced theater troupes, they are also producing stars in large quantities, at least they are helping to foster the growth of the star system. The leading role openly drawing actor tax is one example. At the same time, actors themselves often have a fondness for showing off, writing articles to brag, wanting to use the likes of Mei Lanfang and Cheng Yanqiu to establish their own position. They think that it is best to climb to the star throne, so that they can gain both fame and wealth from now on!

If the above-mentioned tendencies continue to develop, the art of drama will be completely dismembered, lose its inherent glorious characteristics, and repeat the terrible mistakes of Civilization Plays. If a script with only a few lines of dialogue is not used, but a scene list system is used, what is the difference between this and Civilization Plays? As for the awareness of content, it has become very weak! Therefore, as an audience member who cares about it, I am deeply worried about its future development! Since I have perceived some hidden crises, I will not hesitate to say them straight out, even if it is disappointing. Fortunately, this is an occasional impression of an audience member, and whether it is correct or not, I say again, is up to the theater elders to decide!

### Expectations - Dedicated to Bai Mao Literary Weekly

— 㕳 Xu

At this time, the Shen Bao opened a literary supplement, perhaps some people regard it as superfluous; at this time, let me have some expectations for literature and art, perhaps some people regard it as "太大大"; however, I am touched by the "Bai Mao" call for papers said, "The relationship between literature and art and the times is important" this statement, inevitably some sense that I want to say.

Literature and art is a branch of the literary department, and also a kind of art department, which no one can deny! Because she integrates the skill of text, thinking, writing, etc. In the art garden, she is also an important cultural tool that expresses the image of society and promotes social progress. Therefore, some people say: literature and art is a dagger, literature and art is a mirror, yes, she expresses the reality of society, she stabbed and criticised the dark side of the current society, and demands social progress, we must never neglect the use of this mirror!

But here we feel very sorry, is that the efficacy of literature and art, still only retained in its own surface, check this many years of experience and cause, the main is not due to the misunderstanding of the essence of literature and art by the general public?

For example, in the earliest period, the performance of literature and art, seems to be limited to the wind, flowers, snow, moon, and the people who use it to express, most of the arrogant and elegant, thinking that the effect of literature and art, but just playing with pen and ink, for their own appreciation and pleasure; such a concept passed to the later, the value of literature and art was raised to the sky in general! Most think that literature and art is not dyed with vulgarity, Qingya noble a class of people exclusive art, "May Fourth" since, this exclusive style, seems to have been slightly hit! But the exchange station seems to be a general class of literati, the form of literature and art, is the liberation of a layer of cage, but after all, only one layer, the right to use, still occupied by a few scholars, along to this day, to let him still do promotion and fortune, patting horses to express merit is not considered, even portraying, with women as the object, with women's affairs as the impression, directly expresses the decadence of the literature and art performers at this time and place: but indirectly to the society on the public security caused more customs crime, speaking of this, we should not help but call injustice for literature and art!

In order to adapt to the needs of the times, we strictly require the emergence of normal and healthy literature and art is very legitimate! Therefore, my expectations for Bai Mao are as follows:

1. Of course, it should not be a place for the emergence of this kind of elegant and erotic works, but to express the confirmed reality; a new garden of literature and art adapted to the times.

2. Widespread acceptance of contributions, the standard should not be limited to too high, so that she can achieve the purpose of popularization.

3. Accept as much as possible the opinions and submissions of all parties, we do not forget that "literature and art is to the masses!"

4. Accordingly, we rejoice in the founding of Bai Mao, while drawing on her development and prosperity, to open a new face for the literary and artistic circles in the future!
