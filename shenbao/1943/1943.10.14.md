### Congratulating the Independence of the Philippines

"Where there is a will, there is a way." The Filipinos, who have continuously struggled for freedom and independence for over two hundred years, have finally fulfilled their long-cherished wish. Today is the day of the founding of the Republic of the Philippines. From now on, the Philippines will be a strong member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Their future is full of brightness.

The Philippine Independence Preparatory Committee has already completed the historical task of establishing the foundation of the nation and has formulated a constitution. The first President, Mr. Laurel, will be inaugurated today. For three hundred years, countless patriotic Filipinos have shed precious blood for the great ideal of independence. Now that it has been realized, the eighteen million people of the Philippine Islands are sincerely delighted and how excited they are!

The United States had also formally promised the Philippines its independence. According to the Tydingsâ€“McDuffie Act, it was to be granted independence on July 4, 1946. Initially, the United States wanted to annex the Philippines into its territory, although there were strong opponents within the country at the time. However, the American business community, enthusiastic about developing the East Asian market, supported the annexation of the Philippines as a stepping stone for aggression in Asia. The strong opponents of this gold-dollar imperialism were farmers and laborers. They said, "The annexation of the Philippines is nothing but a burden on the United States." Sure enough, the subsequent development of the situation proved that the views of the farmers and laborers were correct. Because the management of the Philippines required extremely high sacrifices, the United States had to pay a considerable price to maintain the finances of the Philippine Islands, importing millions of tons of sugar from the Philippines every year. In addition, the United States also needed to import copra, hemp, and other materials at particularly high prices every year.

Because of the import of such a large quantity of materials, it was not for necessity. On the producer side in the United States, especially many sugar producers who had invested in Java and Cuba, suffered great sacrifices. Therefore, sugar investors and general farmers expressed extreme dissatisfaction with the management of the Philippines. In addition, hundreds of thousands of Filipinos migrated to the Pacific coast of the United States every year, and the cost of employing them was lower, so they were also opposed by the American labor community. However, when the U.S. authorities maintained the Philippines as its territory, it was impossible to prevent the immigration of Filipinos in terms of the situation, so the labor community even expressed disagreement with maintaining the Philippines.

The fact that American farmers and laborers regarded the Philippines as a burden and began to advocate abandonment was originally an excellent opportunity for the Filipino people to gradually nurture the independence movement. Therefore, the Democratic government, which had always supported the interests of farmers and laborers, gave the Philippines a long-term check for independence.

However, what exactly does the independence promised by the United States entail? The United States ruled the Philippines for more than twenty years, and tried its best to numb the Filipinos, creating a completely parasitic personality. Making them eat American food, wear American-made clothes, drive American-made cars, speak American language, and do American-style entertainment, assimilating Filipinos in various environments. As a result, Filipinos gradually turned to Americanism, making them 100% dependent on American products. If the United States does not import them for a day, they cannot live for a day. This situation is what the American business community wants. Therefore, once the aforementioned foundation of complete dependence of the Philippine Islanders on American goods is created, the American business community believes that whether the Philippine Islands are politically dependent on the United States is not a problem. Therefore, the American business community did not strongly oppose the independence bill.

From the above observations, we dare to say that the focus of the Philippine issue lies on the Filipino people themselves. That is, how can they prepare for their independence economically and financially and break away from the scope of dependence on the United States.

According to the independence bill decided by the United States, it is stipulated that all financial assistance will be completely stopped from the day of the independence of the Philippines, such as the import of sugar and copra. In addition, a ban on Philippine immigration has been formulated. In addition to being deprived of all benefits, Filipinos are also forced to accept several conditions. For example, it is stipulated that the political form of the Philippines must be an American-style false democratic republic, that American language must be used in public schools, and even that naval bases must be reserved.

What the United States is trying to do is to make the Philippines a prototype of a small America. The Americans are very clear about the fact that Filipinos are an Oriental nation with an Asian environment. So why do Americans force the chemical American political organization and way of life on this different nation in a different environment? If Americans really give Filipinos happiness and prosperity, why don't they allow Filipinos to have a political form and way of life that are most suitable for their traditions and environment? In fact, the United States has never allowed the possibility of independent freedom. Americans cannot abandon the indirect control of the Philippines, and at the same time cannot abandon the desire to make the Philippines a market exclusively for American products. In the American plan, the independence of the Philippines contains elements of hypocrisy. This should be pointed out.

Now the Filipinos are no longer groaning under the oppression of tyrannical and hypocritical Americanism, but have gained true freedom and independence. Under the situation of the new order in Greater East Asia, as a member of Greater East Asia, they have accepted the opportunity for unlimited development and prosperity in the future. We cannot help but express our congratulations to the Filipino people, and at the same time express our congratulations to the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Although the number of Chinese residing in the Philippines is not very large, they occupy a fairly important position in the economic community. Here, as the Philippines completes its independence and the whole country is renewed; at the same time, as the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate to strive for victory and complete the new order, we hope that the overseas Chinese in the Philippines will continue their past efforts and assist the local government in jointly promoting the prosperity and prosperity of the Republic of the Philippines.

### Chairman Wang's Remarks

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - The Philippines is scheduled to declare its independence today (the 14th). Chairman Wang of the National Government has issued the following statement: The glorious independence that the eighteen million people of the Philippines have been looking forward to has been realized today. We, standing on the position of East Asian comrades, express our infinite congratulations. Britain and the United States have carried out aggression in our East Asia for a long time. Many East Asian nations and their countries have been enslaved and shackled by Britain, which is known to all. The Philippines was also sacrificed under the control of the United States. Although the Philippine nation has risen up against the United States from time to time, it has failed to achieve its goal due to the strong oppression of the United States. The meaning of the Greater East Asia War lies in defeating Britain and the United States and liberating East Asia. Due to the heroic achievements of the soldiers of the friendly Japanese nation, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been driven out of the Greater East Asia region. The nations of Greater East Asia, which were previously oppressed and exploited by Britain and the United States, have achieved the opportunity for revival. The establishment of the Republic of the Philippines has also achieved success through this opportunity for revival. While celebrating the completion of the Philippine Republican Government, we also express our respect to the brave soldiers of the friendly Japanese nation. We also hope that all the vassal states and compatriots of East Asia will unite sincerely, uphold the concept of common prosperity and strive hard to achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Vargas' Statement

Manila, 13th (Central News Agency) - Vargas, the chief of the Philippine executive branch, issued a long statement through the same news agency on the 12th, as the Declaration of Independence is about to be issued. The gist of the statement is as follows: The allied Japanese Empire has granted the Philippines the freedom to initiate and establish administrative institutions. Today, the primary political issue in the Philippines is the perfection of domestic administration. Other basic and important issues are national defense. I dare say that all Filipinos hope for the independence of their motherland and the stability of the government. We Filipinos cooperate with the nations of East Asia based on the principle of protecting national security. Today, no country in East Asia other than the Japanese Empire can resist foreign enemies and defend the motherland. However, if the countries of East Asia practice great unity under the guidance of Japan, there is no need to fear foreign invasion and defeat. The political significance of the Philippines becoming a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and realizing independence lies in this. The economic significance of Philippine independence has been carefully reviewed and there is no need to repeat it. Only by joining the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and implementing economic cooperation with the countries of East Asia can the Philippine economy achieve its own prosperity. First, independent Philippines must strive for self-sufficiency in daily necessities such as food and clothing. We should not rely solely on foreign imports as in the past, but should try to reduce the burden on the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Second, we must exchange materials necessary for co-existence and co-prosperity with the countries of East Asia, and jointly seek economic development with the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Independent Philippines also has cultural issues, which is indeed a major challenge. Due to the rule of the United States and Spain for the past four centuries, our national character has been greatly influenced. The general intellectuals have a deeper understanding of Western civilization than of Eastern civilization. They rarely have a deep knowledge of Eastern civilization, and their understanding of Eastern civilization is also very weak. Our spirit cannot be changed in a short period of time, but if there is no cultural communication and spiritual connection with the countries in the Co-Prosperity Sphere, the foundation of all necessary work between the Philippines and these countries will not be stable. At the same time, it cannot avoid being criticized by others. We Filipinos base ourselves on a political form suitable for our country's inherent conditions in the political sphere. In the economic sphere, we take self-sufficiency as the principle and seek mutual development with the countries of East Asia. In the cultural sphere, we revive the true Philippine culture and establish a closer spiritual connection with our allied nations. We are currently working hard to restore our national language, inherent system, and ethnicity in order to revive nationalistic ideas. At the same time, we are striving to improve ourselves in order to obtain the glory of our nation. We Filipinos have a blood connection with the allied nations.

### Burmese Ambassador to Japan Issues Statement

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - Thai Maung, the Burmese Special Envoy, met with a group of reporters at the Greater East Asia Guest House at 10:30 a.m. on the 13th and issued a statement, the gist of which is as follows: Burma has recently gained independence, and the special and sacred mission I bear is extremely important. Since 1911, I have been the first to advocate Pan-Asian Unionism, hoping to realize the ideals of my youth. I am extremely honored to be able to observe the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. All the people of Burma believe that establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is the only effective way to bring peace to East Asia, and they all hope that the Japanese army will achieve final victory. I believe that in order to achieve the sacred mission I bear, close personal contact is also necessary in addition to diplomatic contact between the two countries. Burma aims to become an important and powerful member of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and will make the youth take on heavy responsibilities in this war. Buddhist teachings say that it is better to be enslaved and gain eternal life. The Burmese people deeply understand this meaning, so they must gain independence in thought, action, and speech. The Burmese people know that defeat will be a fatal blow to the Burmese nation, so with the support of the guiding country Japan and our comrades-in-arms, we should overcome the ups and downs of the war situation and endure everything with courage. The Burmese people have become familiar with how to adapt to this environment due to the war in the past year. I dare say that they will give full cooperation until Japan achieves final victory.

### Japan Strives to Increase Production of Important Materials

Tokyo, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to recent surveys, important materials such as steel, coal, minerals, and machine tools in Japan in the first half of this year (April to September) have all exceeded the planned production targets, which proves the hard work and spirit of production personnel. It has been found that the production figures for the first half of the year in Japan in previous years have often shown a downward trend, but this is necessary especially during this period when the war situation is becoming increasingly pressing, even if it means increasing one ton of iron or one machine tool. Japan is currently overcoming all difficult production conditions and moving towards increased production. As a result, the production of various materials in the first half of the year at the end of September exceeded the planned targets and achieved beautiful results. However, given the needs of the current war situation, a leap in production is also needed in the second half of the year, so various industrial circles are making every effort to plan production countermeasures.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in North China

German Troops in Italy Implement Detachment Actions Battles Developing in the Jelsi Area Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Local battles in the Apennine Mountains continued on Monday. At the same time, British forces in the western coastal area were limited to reconnaissance activities, while in the eastern coastal area, they were limited to disruptive artillery fire. The main battles on Monday were the continued attempts by American and Canadian forces to break through in the Calere area west of Benevento and the Jelsi area west of Volturara. In several places, enemy attacking units followed the German detachment actions with the strength of a regiment, and the German army maintained order and was not interfered with by the British and American forces during the implementation of the detachment actions. The development of the battle in the Jelsi area is the clearest example of this point, as two Axis counterattacks were repelled in front of the German defense line, suffering heavy losses. Another enemy regiment, behind the mountains east of the area, was suddenly attacked by German mortars and heavy mortars and suffered heavy losses, so the British and American forces were unable to make further attacks in the area. In order to clear the roads, the German army launched a fierce counterattack, resulting in the capture of many British and American prisoners of war. Fierce Battles in Mountainous and Plain Areas The German rear guard in the Calere area resisted the American advance at the road obstacles in Guartia, and after five days, established new positions in the Cerreto Mountains. Two American attacks from the south-central and southeast directions were repelled by the German heavy artillery in the Montaguardia mountain area, and the Germans did not even need to use grenadiers. Powerful British reconnaissance teams on the Campanian Plain attempted to probe the possibility of crossing the Volturno River at Grazzanise, but before the British troops crossed to the south bank, they were repelled by the German river defense force. The enemy reconnaissance team was divided into three teams, one of which was annihilated, and the other abandoned its dead and retreated in haste.

Chilean Foreign Minister Visits Mexico Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Mexico City: Chilean Foreign Minister Funante arrived in Mexico City on Monday and will stay in Mexico for several days. Eastern Front Battles Approaching Gomel Soviet Troops Fight with Winter Equipment Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to Haitong News Agency: The weather on the Eastern Front is very cold, as can be seen from the winter equipment carried by the reinforcements dispatched by the Soviet side. It can be seen that these troops were originally intended for winter operations, but the enemy made no achievements on the main battlefields and the far north and far south fronts on Monday. The Soviet army in the Nevel area attempted to make a wide-ranging breakthrough in the German defense line in the middle reaches of the Velikaya River, but failed. The enemy retreated in the face of difficulties and seemed to have changed its target, attacking left and right from the breakthrough point, but to no avail. The German army's counterattack with a large number of tanks was quite successful, and the enemy pressure in the Nevel area has not decreased. As for the southern route, the Soviet offensive between Chaipruki and Melitopol seems to have weakened slightly, and the Soviet army has no hope of breaking through the German line, which remains unshaken. It seems that the Soviet side has not abandoned its plan to recover Crimea. Timoshenko may intend to attack from the Kerch Strait, or land somewhere on the peninsula. If the Soviet side does have this plan, then the Soviet army in Novorossiysk must continue its offensive without end. Between Smolensk-Minsk Highway and Gomel, the German army continues to withdraw according to plan, and fierce battles occur between the rearguard and the enemy army. Now the battle is gradually approaching Gomel. The Soviet bridgehead at the mouth of the Pripet River on the Dnieper River line is under pressure from German counterattacks from the north and northwest. At the same time, the enemy army is advancing towards Kiev, and fierce battles are taking place. As for the smaller enemy strongholds on the four banks of the river, they are still under German control, and the bridgehead in Kremenets has not been expanded. German Troops Launch Counterattacks Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to the German News Agency: Under the cover of new heavy assault guns, German grenadiers attacked on Monday between the Sea of Azov and Melitopol, penetrated the Soviet line, and made offensives to the south and east, gaining considerable territory. The Soviet army made arduous resistance from several high positions, but after several hours of fierce fighting, was finally repelled. The Soviet army then mobilized powerful tank units in an attempt to recapture its high positions, but its counterattack finally collapsed under the fire of the assault guns, and fifteen enemy tanks were unable to move. North of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched several attacks under the cover of powerful artillery, mortars, and platoon fire, but were all repelled. A local gap in the German line was surrounded from the flanks, and the enemy suffered heavy casualties and abandoned eleven tanks, thirteen infantry cannons, twenty-nine small-caliber mortars, more than sixty machine guns, and a large number of rifles on the battlefield. After this loss, the enemy did not attack further in the afternoon. The Soviet offensive towards Chaipruki was blocked, suffering heavy losses. At the same time, in the central Dnieper River area, the enemy repeatedly tried to protect its bridgeheads and beachheads, but all failed. In general, the situation in the central Dnieper River area has not changed, but the German army has made some progress in the offensive. Between a certain point and the mouth of the Pripet River, the Soviet army launched an attack with a powerful infantry unit, and fierce battles broke out in the wet forest. As a result, the German tank unit and grenadiers stopped the advance of the Soviet offensive unit, and finally repelled it to its original position. The point where the German line was temporarily broken through was sealed off during the counterattack on the evening of October 12. In the southern area of Gomel, German grenadiers repelled a powerful Soviet unit to the opposite bank of the Sozh River, and the enemy lost hundreds of prisoners of war and a large number of war materials, including five of the latest type of 15.2 cm heavy cannons. The 7 cm thick armor plate on this type of assault gun was penetrated by German direct-fire artillery shells, and many Soviet troops who attempted to resist on the east bank of the river were killed. Heavy Rain and Muddy Roads on the Eastern Front Zurich, 13th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reported from Moscow that the heavy autumn rains in the Soviet Union have begun, and many areas have become muddy, blocking the roads. It is difficult for the Soviet army to maintain transportation. British Troops in Iran Retreat in Part According to the Tripartite Agreement Ankara, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to news from Tehran: British troops in Iran will soon withdraw in part. This withdrawal is being carried out in accordance with the agreement signed by Britain, Iran, and the Soviet Union. The agreement stipulates that if Iran is at war with a foreign country, the task of defense will be entirely the responsibility of the Iranian army. Now Iran has declared war on Germany and the Iranian army has been reorganized and is able to assume this task. However, Iranian sources believe that the withdrawal of British troops indicates Britain's willingness to yield to the Soviet Union in the Near East. It is said that in the oil-producing area of southern Iran, the British side has special interests that need to be protected, so it is not included in the withdrawal. European War and the Balkan Countries (5) Turkey's policy of neutrality can be said to be a matter of fate. Turkey has always cleverly positioned itself in the delicate balance of power between Germany, the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain. However, if bloody warfare occurs, this balance of power will inevitably collapse. In this sense, the recent essay by Mr. Y, a first-class commentator in Turkey, is quite noteworthy. He said: "Turkish investors and public opinion have often stated that Turkey will not participate in the war unless it is attacked from the outside. But we must not forget that Turkey and Britain have an alliance, and this is not a one-sided alliance relationship where Britain only assists Turkey when Turkey is attacked from the outside. Therefore, Turkey can stand on the side of Britain in the war, and in this case, it is not an absolutely necessary condition for Turkey to be attacked from the outside." It is truly laughable for Mr. Y, a pro-British figure, to say such things. It is generally believed that this alliance treaty is one-sided. Has Turkey not remained silent and stood by while Britain was attacked by Germany and Japan? So, does Turkey now want to change its attitude and be loyal to its alliance with Britain? Absolutely not. The Hope of Maintaining Neutrality Remains Unchanged In March 1941, the Soviet Union and Turkey jointly declared friendship. In the same month, a Hungarian-Turkish trade treaty was concluded. In June, a German-Turkish friendship treaty was concluded. In August, Britain, the Soviet Union, and Turkey jointly declared. In September, a British-Turkish trade treaty was established. In October, a Romanian-Turkish trade treaty and a German-Turkish trade treaty were established. In December, the United States had the Lend-Lease Act for Turkey. In March 1942, a Bulgarian-Turkish trade treaty was established. In May, the Italian-Turkish trade treaty was extended. In June, a German-Turkish weapons loan agreement was concluded. In September, an Azerbaijan-Turkish wheat purchase agreement was concluded. In October, a US-Turkish grain agreement was concluded. In December, an Italian-Turkish trade agreement was concluded. Until February of this year, there were barter agreements in Rome, new Hungarian-Turkish trade liquidation agreements, etc. Regardless of the Axis or anti-Axis powers, diplomatic relations are equally close. This spring, on the way to the Casablanca Conference, Churchill visited Turkey, and there were rumors of closer ties between Britain and Turkey, but soon there was a visit to Berlin by military envoys. It can be seen that Turkey's all-round handling is nothing more than wanting to maintain its own neutrality and stability on top of the balance of power between the Axis and anti-Axis powers. Having experienced the suffering of being involved in the war in the previous world war, Turkey understands very well that even if the British and American side wins, Turkey will gain nothing. The Balkan Peninsula is under the sphere of influence of the Soviet Union, and it is impossible to obtain a piece of land. Even the "straits," which Turkey is most concerned about, are in danger of being taken away. Turkey, which has become a modern country by relying on the oil industry on Aderse Island, will never participate in the war if it gains nothing in the ruins of the battlefield. However, the surrender of Italy was a shocking event for Turkey. Italy's withdrawal made Turkey feel that the balance of power was in danger of collapsing. The fact that Turkey is rapidly trying to get closer to the United States is to make the United States restrain the Soviet Union's pressure on Turkey. According to recent information, the Turkish government is receiving the transfer of transport ships from the United States and building warships with the help of the United States. Turkey's Greatest Fear Due to the development of aircraft, the value of the Dardanelles Strait, which connects Europe and Asia, has been considerably changed, but what Turkey is most concerned about is still the Soviet Union's use of force to control the "straits." Britain requested the use of Turkish ports for ship repairs, and the United States used the Lend-Lease Act to show favor and wanted to lease air bases, but both were rejected by the Turkish government. These are all for the purpose of war. From the war to the post-war period, the Soviet Union's national policy is to pressure Turkey with the "straits" issue as the center. Therefore, when the German army withdrew from the Caucasus this spring, Turkey feared that the Red Army would come down and made strict preparations on the border. The preparations on the Soviet-Turkish border are made by at least more than half of the Turkish army's elite sixty divisions. Turkey is now desperately rectifying its military equipment, and continues to order weapons loan agreements from Germany, Britain, and the United States. Britain and the United States' supply of weapons to Turkey has aroused the dissatisfaction of the Soviet Union, and it has requested restrictions. As a result, it is said that it has recently been self-restrained. In short, on the German side, when advancing into the Balkans and bringing the countries into its sphere of influence, it knows that forcibly pulling Turkey into its embrace is not the best policy. Maintaining Turkey's neutrality is the task of the German ambassador to Turkey, Mr. Papen. The Soviet Union, in addition to using its own pressure to destroy the balance of power, does not like any other factors to be inserted into the changing situation in Turkey. It is a purely selfish policy. Recently, British newspapers have launched quite fierce attacks on Turkey's policy of maintaining neutrality, forcing the implementation of the alliance treaty. Of course, this can be seen as a first-class psychological warfare by Britain, which wants to get Turkey to participate in the war. The government authorities may not express the same views on this in the British military. That is, the military authorities believe that from the perspective of defending the British Empire, in preparation for future wars against the Soviet Union, Turkey should be placed on the front line. Regardless of the truth of the matter, if we refer to the fact that the Soviet Union requested that the second front be designated in France, we can know that the Soviet Union does not welcome the British and American advance in the Balkans. The Soviet Union and the British and American pulling-work centered on Turkey The Key to Turkey In this way, the question of Turkey's participation in the war cannot be simply decided by the arguments of Mr. Yeqin or the situation of the Axis powers mentioned above. This time, the situation in the Mediterranean centered on Italy's surrender, that is, the Soviet Union's advance in the Mediterranean, is no less than a bolt from the blue for Turkey. To what extent will the compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union reach, and what position will Turkey's neutrality occupy in the discussions of these three countries is beyond the scope of speculation. Judging only from Turkey's policy of neutrality, what it fears most is that the Soviet Union will take advantage of the British and American Balkan offensives to gain a foothold in the Balkans. Needless to say, the compromise between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union also has its limits. Even if the Balkan landings are temporarily successful due to the concessions of Britain and the United States, there is a German counterattack there, and there is a fundamental problem above the unity of operations between the Soviet Union and Britain and the United States. In Iran and Iraq, although Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union have little contact, problems often arise. Therefore, in Turkey, in the Balkans, and in the Mediterranean, if the Soviet Union and Britain, or the United States, encounter each other, the problem will expand, right?

Filipino Residents in Shanghai to Celebrate Philippine Independence Today Hold Celebrations and Tea Party (Central News Agency) The Philippine government declared independence to the world today (14th). This time, with the full support of the friendly country Japan, it was able to formally realize an independent country. Filipino residents in Shanghai heard the news and were all overjoyed. They decided to hold a grand celebration in Shanghai on the day of the declaration of independence, and at 8:00 am, all 500 Filipino residents in Shanghai gathered at Taiping Bridge and set off on a parade, led by a band playing the Philippine National Anthem for the celebration of independence. It is scheduled to hold a grand celebration ceremony at the racecourse on Jing'an Temple Road before 9:00 am. Officials from various countries in Shanghai have been invited to participate and attend. A grand celebration tea party will be held from 4:00 pm to 6:00 pm at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund of Nanjing Road to entertain representatives of friendly countries in Shanghai. There will be a warm and grand event at that time. Director Hirota Gives a Talk (Central News Agency) Director Hirota of the Information Section of the Japanese Embassy Office, who had been oppressed by the United States for 40 years, declared its independence to the world on the 14th. Hirota gave a talk yesterday (13th) to express his congratulations. "It is with boundless joy that the Philippines declares its independence today under the decisive battle. It is a pleasure for the people of the Allied country Japan and the one billion people of East Asia that the Philippine people can have a truly independent government. On the day of the declaration of independence of the Philippines, it is ridiculous that the United States published a recommendation to advance the date of Philippine independence in the Congress. In 1898, during the Spanish-American War, the United States gave the Philippines a nominal promise of independence. In fact, the United States established military bases on the island and tried to strengthen it, making it a base for aggression in East Asia. This kind of example can be seen clearly in China. According to the previous declaration of US Secretary of State John Hay, the principle of open door and equal opportunity was advocated for China, in order to equalize the rights and interests of Britain, France, and Russia. Small favors were given to the Chinese people in cultural undertakings to cover up its superficial policy of aggression and gradually lay the foundation for its aggression. Of course, the vanguard of China was the Philippines. Today, we are able to see China's autonomous independence and Burma's independence after driving out the evil power of the United States and the flames of liberation of the East Asian nations. The independence of the Philippines further strengthens the foundation of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. We should take this opportunity to strengthen the determination of one billion people in East Asia to complete the war." Teachers' Subsidy Can Be Issued in Early Next Month Part-time Teachers Will Not Be Given Temporarily The education authorities, in consideration of the situation of teachers and staff in private primary and secondary schools, previously allocated a monthly subsidy of 100,000 yuan initiated by Mayor Chen. This matter has been going on for a month, and the education sector is very concerned. According to reporters from the Shanghai News Agency, there are already signs of progress in the issuance of subsidies, and it will be possible to issue them in early next month. Most private primary and secondary schools have already filled out the lists of teachers and staff in detail and submitted them to the authorities for review. If the lists have not been submitted so far, they will be considered as automatic waivers. It is also learned that the authorities stipulate that subsidies will not be issued to part-time teachers temporarily.

Charitable Garden Party Generous Sponsorship from All Walks of Life The Health Association Receives Celebrities Yesterday The charitable garden party initiated by the China Health Protection Association was held at the Kangle Hotel the day before yesterday to entertain people from all walks of life. More than 50 people, including Wen Lanting, Ding Fubao, Lin Kanghou, Pei Yunqing, Pan Gongbi, Zhang Wenquan, Zhan Zhaolin, Xiang Kangyuan, and Yang Fusheng, attended. Zhang Yipeng, Chen Bin, and Ma Ershi were elected as the main persons in charge. Lin Kanghou Talks About Eliminating the Sick People Lin Kanghou said in his speech on the same day: Today's society can be described as being plagued by poverty and disease. If we want to solve poverty, we must first solve disease. It is in the public's best interest to always maintain health, so a large-scale movement to eliminate the sick people is the biggest goal of our association. Spend a small amount of money to obtain the greatest effect of health protection. If we want to seek our own safety, we must try to eliminate the existence of all dangerous disease factors. I hope that the society will unite to eliminate the disease demon and save people and ourselves with one stroke. Yan Fuqing Discusses Early Diagnosis Dr. Yan Fuqing said in his speech: I suffered from stomach cancer in my early years. Fortunately, I had an early examination and diagnosis, and underwent surgery in the United States to remove almost two-thirds of my stomach. Fortunately, I recovered my health, so I am able to meet you all here today, thanks entirely to early diagnosis. The doctor also said that his friend Mr. Zhetang also suffered from the same disease and underwent surgery in Boston. At that time, the results were considered good, but unfortunately the surgery was too late and the patient died within six months. From this point of view, the early diagnosis of a disease is extremely important. Not only can individuals recover their health early and engage in production early, but also save on medical expenses and relieve the burden on the people. In recent years, the source of medicines has been cut off. To achieve the goal of saving, the only way is early diagnosis. In other words, everyone needs accurate early diagnosis. Early Diagnosis and Treatment to Save on Medical Expenses If a disease is discovered, early treatment can save on medical expenses and achieve the true goal of relieving poverty and disease. This kind of undertaking that benefits the country and the people is still in its budding stage in our country. All of you here are leaders in society and will definitely work hard to promote this preventive work that costs little and has great effects. The purpose of this garden party is not only to make you all feel physically and mentally happy, but also to make the general public have health protection. I am afraid that the society does not understand the truth, so I specially explained the benefits of early diagnosis that I have received, hoping that all circles will promote it together. The society is very fortunate, and the health cause is very fortunate. It is reported that the association's medical department is currently presided over by Dr. Xie Yingrui. Dr. Xie presided over the Health Bureau of the Public Works Department for 18 years and has devoted much effort to improving public health in this city. Now he is working hard on the health cause, which is really a fortunate thing for his career. The garden party initiated by the association is scheduled to be held on the 17th of this month at No. 1726 Zhaofei Road. The tickets are not for sale and are given to donors.

"Modern History of Japan" Translated by the Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute Published Today and Distributed by This Newspaper "Modern History of Japan," originally written by Mr. Omori Kin'gorou, is a famous Japanese historian. The narrative is detailed, the system is clear, and the most essential content is concentrated on the process of completing the Meiji Restoration. It has only been a few decades since Japan entered the ranks of powerful countries. Before the Meiji Restoration, the government came from the samurai, and the weakness of the national power was far greater than that of China at that time. After the Meiji Restoration, the situation changed completely, reforming domestic affairs, expanding power, and reaching today is a great miracle. If we are willing to review the reasons for our past failures from the success of others, this will definitely provide some historical lessons. At the same time, increasing our understanding of Japan is even more expected. In today's era of frequent Sino-Japanese cultural exchanges, this book introducing modern Japanese history is welcomed by people from all walks of life. The Sino-Japanese Cultural Research Institute was established to shoulder this mission, and Mr. Youyou generously donated all the funds for the establishment of the institute, in order to realize the work of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange as soon as possible. Therefore, the institute first selected the book "Modern History of Japan" and invited Mr. Wen Moguang to translate it. The translation is fluent and has been published today. It is distributed by this newspaper. The book has more than 300 pages, bound into a thick volume, priced at 30 yuan per volume, with postage added for outside areas. Ambassador Cai to Japan Talks About Stabilizing People's Livelihood After returning to the country for duty at the end of last month, Ambassador Cai Pei to Japan arrived in Shanghai at around 11:00 pm the night before and gave a speech as follows: "I have been abroad for almost five months. When I went abroad, the Shanghai concessions had not yet been recovered. Now I see that the Shanghai concessions have been recovered, our country's territory is complete, independence and autonomy have been achieved, and the goal of the national revolution has been achieved. Under this pleasure, I hope that the construction of a new China in the future must first stabilize the people's livelihood. How to stabilize the people's livelihood? The prerequisite must be to increase production. After increasing production, prices will be suppressed, and then the people's livelihood can be stabilized. I hope that our friendly country Japan can assist our country in increasing production. The reason is that increasing production requires solving capital, raw materials, labor, transportation, and other problems. Japan must cooperate in everything. I believe that Japan's thorough mobilization of the people under the wartime system is worthy of our country's reference. At present, the Japanese people are united and their morale is high. Many university students voluntarily serve in the military, and all Japanese women have united to serve the country. Human and material resources are fully mobilized, which has strengthened Japan's combat power. Although domestic materials are subject to strict control, because the distribution is equal, the people's livelihood is unusually stable. What is most admirable is that the price of rice has remained the same from beginning to end. It can be seen that the general public in Japan is determined and determined to fight the decisive battle. I sincerely hope that our country will quickly learn from this in order to achieve a successful war of resistance. The people should also unite and strive to revive China and defend East Asia. As the ambassador to Japan, I will do my best to promote Sino-Japanese friendship and make the people of China and Japan progress more and more in ideological harmony and cultural communication, and complete the epoch-making mission of the Greater East Asia with the determination to live and die together." Restricting the Business Hours of Cafes Limited to Midnight Since the city implemented thrift and thrift, the business hours of all dance halls, cafes, and taverns and hotels have been stipulated by the authorities and announced to the patrol. It is heard that recently, some cafes are nominally operating cafes, but secretly setting up dance floors. Their business hours start in the morning and continue until late at night. This situation not only consumes materials but also violates the national principle of thrift. The Shanghai branch of the New Life Movement Association has sent a letter to the municipal government requesting suppression. After reporting the situation, the municipal government ordered the first, second, and third police stations to comply. In the future, the business hours of each cafe must not exceed midnight in order to suppress extravagance and promote thrift. Physical Education Basketball Match Strong China and Mixed Teams Tie, Popular Shantou Team Wins The third game of the grand basketball match was held at the Paramount Ballroom at 4:00 pm yesterday.

After the break, the Shantou team's ball luck was prosperous, and it won 39 to 20. In the second game, the women's popular team and Huizhong were tied at the beginning, and the three forwards of Huizhong failed to make contact. In the first half, the popular team led 9 to 6.

### Churchill Announces: Anglo-Portuguese Agreement Established; Azores Islands Provided for British Use

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: Prime Minister Churchill announced in the House of Commons yesterday that Portugal has, in accordance with Britain's request, announced the allowance of certain conveniences to Britain and the United States on the Azores Islands to protect anti-Axis commercial shipping in the Atlantic. This agreement is temporary in nature. After the war ends, British troops will withdraw from the Azores. Britain will also provide military and other necessary supplies to the Portuguese on the Azores. This new agreement does not affect Portugal's hope to maintain its policy of neutrality in Europe and the peace zone of the Iberian Peninsula. This agreement originates from the treaty signed by King Edward III of England with King Ferdinand and the Queen of Portugal in 1373. After the Anglo-Portuguese negotiations concluded, British Foreign Secretary Eden sent a message to the Portuguese Prime Minister, emphasizing that the conveniences provided by the Portuguese government greatly contribute to Britain's effective defense of its shipping. The Portuguese Prime Minister also replied by telegram, saying that he also hopes that the conveniences provided to Britain will help make Atlantic shipping even safer.

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - The Azores Islands include nine islands. Terceira Island, which is handed over to Britain for use in accordance with the new Anglo-Portuguese agreement, is the second largest of the nine islands. Portugal's largest military airport is located on the island. The governor's office is located in Angra, the largest town on the island. The town's seaport is equipped for handling heavy goods. The northwest side of the island has strong defenses. The Azores Islands are 700 kilometers from mainland Portugal, and almost all of its residents are Portuguese.

Portuguese Government Issues Statement: Neutrality Policy Unchanged

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - Regarding the Portuguese government's provision of certain conveniences to Britain on the Azores Islands, the Portuguese government issued a public announcement on Tuesday afternoon, emphasizing that whenever the Portuguese government needs to clarify its foreign policy, it has repeatedly expressed its sincerity in maintaining neutrality, but has always stated that this neutrality is conditional in nature, and that Portugal's neutrality always depends on the Anglo-Portuguese alliance. Since the beginning, the Portuguese government has adhered to its obligations under the non-aggression pact and supplementary agreements signed with Spain, and has learned that Portugal's policy has gained the sympathy of Britain, because Britain's war policy does not conflict with the establishment of a peaceful zone on the Iberian Peninsula. Regarding the development of Anglo-Portuguese relations, the Portuguese government has informed Spain in detail, and the British Ambassador to Spain will also notify Spain on behalf of the British government. The British Prime Minister has also declared that this cooperation will strengthen the old alliance between Britain and Portugal, confirm their current friendly relations, and guarantee that future friendship will be even closer. Terceira Island in the Azores Islands has been handed over to Britain for use. All consulates of Germany and other Axis countries on all the Azores Islands will be closed, and citizens of Axis countries must also leave the country. The Portuguese Ministry of Foreign Affairs will issue this announcement soon. It is said that Portugal's policy of neutrality has not changed, nor has its collective policy with Spain. A few days ago, Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar informed Spain of this matter when he met with Spanish Foreign Minister Jordana on the Spanish border.

Anglo-Portuguese Negotiations Kept US Informed Throughout

Lisbon, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: London political circles announced yesterday afternoon that the United States government and other anti-Axis governments were constantly kept informed about the Anglo-Portuguese negotiations on the Azores Islands. It is said that the US government fully agrees with the agreement. It is understood that the British side presiding over the negotiations was Sir Campbell, the British Ambassador to Portugal, assisted by Mr. Roberts, the head of the Central Department of the British Foreign Office, while the Portuguese side was personally presided over by Prime Minister Salazar.

Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - According to news from London: After the Anglo-Portuguese governments established the agreement, the scope of the conveniences to be enjoyed on the Azores Islands has not yet been announced. However, qualified British sources hinted that these conveniences include the use of seaports and airfields, and that these conveniences can be enjoyed not only by Britain, but also by US escort convoys.

Berlin Remains Silent, Awaiting Developments

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - The German Foreign Ministry yesterday still refused to comment on the Anglo-Portuguese agreement on the Azores Islands and awaited the reaction from the Portuguese side, expecting to release the details at noon today. The general public only learned about this new political situation from a few words of news from the German News Agency, which said that this was due to British pressure, which forced the Portuguese government to make concessions. Prime Minister Churchill allegedly stated that Portugal's sovereignty over the islands would not be affected in any way by the existence of the agreement. Although officials maintained silence on this matter, two points should be noted. The British Prime Minister's announcement of this matter was not to leave his country in a state of confusion. No one believes that this move was the free will of the Portuguese government, and all believe that the success of the agreement was entirely due to British pressure. Mr. Schmidt, the spokesperson of the German Foreign Ministry, hinted at a meeting with foreign reporters yesterday that Berlin had prior knowledge of rumors about British pressure on Portugal to cede its bases to the anti-Axis powers and about negotiations on the British military occupation of the Azores Islands. Judging from the sudden interruption of the radio on the Portuguese islands and the installation of radio equipment by British companies, it is known that there will be incidents on the islands, but secrecy is still maintained from the outside world. British newspapers' recent intensification of psychological warfare against Portugal is proof of the British government's pressure on Portuguese Prime Minister Salazar. Cutting off overseas supplies is one of Britain's intimidation tactics. It remains a question whether this sacrifice of a central part of Portugal can prevent Portugal from being drawn into the vortex of war, while British policy actually seeks to make Portugal join the war.

### Spain Maintains a Calm Attitude

Madrid, 13th (Central News Agency telegram) - Here, the news that Portugal has transferred military bases on the Azores Islands to Britain during the war is being handled with a calm and reserved attitude. Political circles here claim that this matter does not cause surprise. At the same time, Spanish Marshal Franco stated that British Ambassador to Spain Hoare formally assured the Spanish government that the Spanish-Portuguese Non-Aggression Pact would not be threatened by the Anglo-Portuguese agreement, so Spain will continue to adopt a wait-and-see neutral policy.
