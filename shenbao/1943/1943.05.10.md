### How to Practice the New Political Morality

"Refreshing politics" and "rectifying politics" are the urgent demands of the people to the government today. The purpose of these demands is undoubtedly to establish a strong government to undertake the task of national rejuvenation. To this end, we have repeatedly elaborated on the way to national prosperity and decline, in order to seek correction from the authorities. Mr. Yoshida, a person from a friendly country, has also written articles on this issue (published in this newspaper on May 7th). His conclusion, based on the characteristics and actual needs of Chinese society, proposes the establishment of "new morality." New morality refers to what the general public should possess in common. We believe that while the general public must establish new morality, the government must first practice the new political morality as a guide for the public to practice the new morality.

What is "new political morality"? In short, with the aim of relieving the people's suffering and reviving the country, establish a political creed suitable for the current political environment, and start with the government itself. Here, we put forward three principles for discussion:

First, is "The world belongs to all." The country is owned by all the people. Therefore, all political measures taken by those in power should be entirely based on the interests of the people. "When the Great Way prevails, the world belongs to all." Currently, we are already the "Republic of China," a country owned by all Chinese people, and absolutely not a country privately owned by a few people or a political party. Mr. Sun, the founder of the Kuomintang, also earnestly regarded "The world belongs to all" as the highest goal of the Three Principles of the People. "Ruling the country by the party" means using ideology to win people's hearts; that is, "convincing people with virtue" and seeking benefits for the people. To thoroughly demonstrate the spirit of "The world belongs to all," the government must first achieve "appointing people based on talent," and not "appointing people based on personal interests," "family ties," or "hometown connections." For example, Chiang Kai-shek treated the country as his personal property, employing incompetent and corrupt individuals like H.H. Kung, who occupied important positions for a long time. Kung's children, still immature, held prominent positions in the financial world. This kind of appointment based on personal interests and family ties due to "nepotism," regarding the "country" and the "party" as private property, ultimately evolved into political darkness, popular resentment, and confinement to China's "Kamchatka." We must take this as a warning and vigorously advocate "appointing people based on talent." Secondly, those in power should have the demeanor of great statesmen, and should not think that those who agree with me are all right, and those who oppose me are all wrong. They should value criticisms from public opinion with a humble attitude, and must have the tolerance to accept them. If they do not ask right from wrong, but simply regard opponents and critics as enemies and try to get rid of them quickly, this will be an obstacle to blocking political rectitude. In short, everything for the public is the first point that the new political morality should put into practice.

Second, is "Respecting public opinion." Public opinion is the common will of the people, that is, the common demands of the people. This will, this demand, is often reflected in public opinion. The government must not make policies or implement decrees based on the subjective opinions of a few people, closing the door and building a cart, but must listen to the people's opinions and extensively solicit public opinion before and after, in order to make timely and appropriate revisions, especially for the benefit of the majority of the people. For example, the elimination of hoarding and speculation, opium smoking, gambling, and officials engaging in business, etc., is beneficial to the majority of the people. Therefore, in implementing such policies, we must act swiftly and decisively, and persevere to the end. These things that are beneficial to the majority of the people are the common will and common demands of the people, and the government must respect and comply with them. This is the second point that the new political morality should put into practice.

Third, is "Clear rewards and punishments." This is an important factor in promoting administrative efficiency. If those who have merit and labor are not given appropriate rewards, there will be no way to encourage progress; if those who are self-serving and derelict in their duties are not given appropriate punishments, there will be no way to warn the cunning and stubborn. Without clear rewards and punishments, the political apparatus will become a chaotic world without right and wrong, causing the capable to be buried and sighing in depression; the cunning to speculate and become arrogant; and the stubborn and foolish to occupy positions and be complacent. In personnel matters, talent and incompetence will be disordered and reversed, resulting in a decadent atmosphere and the exposure of ugliness. Confucius said: "If the name is not correct, the words will not be smooth; if the words are not smooth, the affairs will not be accomplished; if the affairs are not accomplished, the rituals and music will not flourish; if the rituals and music do not flourish, the punishments will not be appropriate; if the punishments are not appropriate, the people will not know what to do." It is precisely because right and wrong are unclear today, and rewards and punishments are not distinct, that politics has no right path and society has no public opinion; however, to seek clear rewards and punishments, it is not about formulating detailed regulations and making pleasant speeches, but about never being partial and breaking through personal connections. If those who should be punished have even more background, then they should be punished even more severely. In that case, the effect will be like the wind blowing on the grass, and the social perception will be refreshed, and political rectitude will begin from this. This is the third point that the new political morality should put into practice.

"The world belongs to all," "respecting public opinion," and "clear rewards and punishments" are the prerequisites for new political morality. Further, it lies in the spirit of practice, which is the so-called "trustworthiness" in Confucianism. Mencius discussed politics and regarded sufficient food, sufficient military strength, and trustworthiness as the three essentials. If it is necessary to abandon two of the three, then trustworthiness must be maintained, because the people cannot stand without trustworthiness. Mencius also advocated that wherever great righteousness lies, one should move forward bravely regardless of everything. Therefore, it is said: "There are things that are desired more than life, so one gives up life and takes righteousness." When we talk about new political morality, those in power must adhere to trustworthiness. Any policy that benefits the people should not be determined in the first place; but if it is determined, it must be realized and implemented effectively. This is "trustworthiness" internally. Collaborating with Japan to declare war on Britain and the United States requires practicing wartime life and contributing everything to cooperate in the war. This is "trustworthiness" externally.

Finally, we want to create a splendid and solemn Republic of China, just like an engineer building a building, we must use new methods to build it. The higher the upper floors are to be, the deeper the foundation must be, and the more the excavated old soil must be thrown away. This old soil is the current old habits and old airs in politics, where everything is only about appearances and not about reality, only about decoration and not about practice, only about flattery and not about accepting loyal admonishment, only about perfunctory answers and not about being serious. This foundation is precisely the new political morality we mentioned above. Only when we throw away these old soils far away will we be able to make the foundation deep, and only when the foundation is deep will the building of the Republic of China be built more magnificently, splendidly, and solemnly in the future!

### Japan Promptly Fulfils Its Promise: Preparatory Committee for Burmese Independence Established; Philippine Independence to be Recognized as Soon as Possible; Filipino People Express Loyalty and Trust

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee held its establishment ceremony on the 8th, marking the beginning of Burmese independence. The Burmese branch director of the Indian Independence League, District Leader Gan Ni, issued the following statement on the 8th: After the establishment of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee, the future of Burma is even brighter. The task of the committee is to establish a new Burma with its own sovereignty and responsibility. This achievement is entirely due to the friendly attitude of the government. Japan has promptly fulfilled its promises to Burma, which proves that Burma will develop into an independent country in the near future. We Indians are extremely happy to witness Burma's active progress towards independence, as this is precisely the path that India must take. It is wise to entrust the responsibility of building Burma to the Burmese people.

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – The 8th was the first day of preparation for Burma's glorious independence. The streets of Rangoon were filled with shouts of "Long Live Burma!" The city's joy and gratitude were no less than the pleasant situation when listening to Prime Minister Tojo's statement on the radio a few days ago. Seeing the Burmese people all beaming with joy, pedestrians also patted each other on the shoulders and shook hands, congratulating each other. Burma, which had not even dreamed of independence under British rule, is now being realized only a year after the Japanese army entered. Its joy can be imagined. The masses held peacock flags and continuously visited pagodas and temples, praying for a happy future and vowing to carry out the desire for an independent war.

Bamo, Chairman of the Committee, Delivers a Speech

Rangoon, 9th (Central News Agency) – Bamo, Chairman of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee, delivered a passionate speech at noon on the 8th at the establishment ceremony of the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee. The following is a summary of the main points: We, as the leaders of Burma, are working hard in today's world order to create a new country with special rights and obligations. This is a great historical undertaking. Burma is at this historical turning point, and the responsibilities we bear are extremely important and great. Since we have encountered this difficult opportunity, we must jointly bear this important responsibility and remember the pain of the past. The time for us to act has come. If we fail, we will not only fail future generations, but also cause the Burmese people to feel deeply disappointed in the present and the future. The ongoing world war is enough to determine our fate. Therefore, we must thoroughly defeat the enemies of the Greater East Asia. Furthermore, what we should build is a new world order, especially a new order and co-prosperity sphere in East Asia. These realistic situations should not be forgotten. If Japan wins, our independence can be realized. Japan respects its promise to grant us independence and uses its military strength and political ideals to save Burma and East Asia in the spirit of a pioneer. Japan came to Burma for this reason. The meaning of the new order in East Asia is that Japan grants us an independent country and becomes a sovereign country. Therefore, under the concept of mutual dependence, we must work hard to build Asia and strengthen the organizations of East Asian nations for the sake of the entire Asia. Today, all East Asian nations have completely vowed to live and die together. In fact, there is no other way.

Manila, 9th (Central News Agency) – A famous Filipino reporter, Mr. Javier, recently expressed his feelings on Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines, saying: Prime Minister Tojo's visit to the Philippines is a glorious and epoch-making event in Filipino history. He said in essence: "The dawn of the Philippines has arrived. The Philippines is now resolutely rising up as a link in East Asia and as one of the world's nations to strive for independence. Recalling that we Filipinos have always groaned under the oppression of European and American imperialism for a long time and have been their slaves, but today, Japan, the strongest country in the world, its Prime Minister graciously visits, we have gained the glorious position of an ally in the New Order of East Asia and are regarded as a member of the cooperation and construction of East Asia. The Philippines was ruled by Spain for the past three centuries, and by the United States for the past forty years. Of course, at that time, we also had representatives participating in politics, but they only knew how to desperately seek personal gain and did not hesitate to wag their tails and beg for mercy from the United States, and they did not know how to seek benefits for the people. When the Philippines fell into such a tragic situation, fortunately, the strong Japan rescued the remaining people from the fire and water. Therefore, when Prime Minister Tojo came to visit, 400,000 people in Manila gathered in Luneta Park for a grand thanksgiving meeting, which was a natural phenomenon. Prime Minister Tojo also clarified Japan's policies towards us at the meeting and will raise the position we hope for. We are deeply grateful. Prime Minister Tojo also stepped into the cheerful Filipino crowd after the meeting and smiled and bowed to the crowd, and his emotions were very sincere. The people were all grateful for this. In the past few centuries, we have been in a colonial status and regarded as slaves by European and American powers, and we are even more deceived by the so-called" and "Democracy". In the past, we would look at those who saved us with the greatest sincerity with suspicion. We must respond to any attitude, that is, we must immediately repay those who treat us with friendship. In this autumn of major turmoil in the world situation, we are promised that we will be recognized as independent as soon as possible. Considering the past Spanish and American oppression, this fact is beyond our imagination. We vow to repay this with loyalty and trust. We always remember Vargas's words: "If Japan can win, we can be free. Under the guidance of Japan, we can work hard in the position of a free and independent nation, and our destiny will be unfolded."

Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Tokyo

Tokyo, 9th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo of Japan and his party, including the Director of the Army Affairs Bureau, Mr. Sato, arrived in the Philippines from Tokyo on the 5th, and carefully inspected the local military and political conditions.

He set off from Manila on the 6th and stopped briefly in Taiwan. He arrived in Fukuoka on the 8th and stayed overnight in Osaka that night. He set off from Osaka at 10:30 am on the 9th and returned to Tokyo at 0:40 pm. He went to the Prime Minister's official residence to rest. In total, Prime Minister Tojo's trip lasted one week.

Chairman Wang has replied to Supervisor Wang in a telegram, requesting that the relevant departments quickly plan for relief to alleviate the people's suffering. The original text of the two telegrams is recorded below: National Government Chairman Wang Junjian: I have just received a telegram from Governor Tang of Shandong Province stating: Agricultural production in this province has been poor for years, especially last year. Now is the time when the old crops have been exhausted and the new crops have not yet arrived. The grass roots and tree bark have been dug up almost entirely. Cases of people committing suicide by hanging themselves on mountains are often heard. I inspected the Donglindao area yesterday, and the land is like a desert, with no water or grass growing. The tragic situation I witnessed burned my heart. The disaster situation reported by various places is roughly the same. Grain relief is urgently needed. Please allocate 20,000 tons of grain purchased from the south to alleviate the suffering, etc. I have also received a telegram from Governor Tian of Henan Province with the same information. The disaster situation in the north this year is severe, and the people are not living well. Rice bran and wheat bran are all treasures for hungry people to prolong their lives. Your Excellency cares about the people's suffering and has always been concerned about the foundation of the country. I have also reported the situation and pleaded for the people. In addition to trying my best to find ways to provide some emergency relief here, I beg you to order the relevant departments to quickly allocate grain for disaster relief to alleviate the urgent need. The telegram is extremely urgent, and I am waiting for orders. Wang Yintai bows reverently. To Supervisor Wang of the Industry General Office in Beiping: I have read your telegram of the Geng day and am deeply concerned about the severe disaster situation in Shandong and Henan. I have ordered the relevant departments to quickly plan for relief to alleviate the people's suffering. I am replying to you by telegram first, Wang Zhaoming Qing.

### Mr. Ishiwatari, Emergency Advisor, Speaks in Shanghai on Financial, Food, and Price Issues

Nanjing, 9th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Ishiwatari Shotaro, the Supreme Advisor of the National Government, went to Shanghai on the 6th to inspect the recent economic situation in Shanghai. He met with reporters at his residence on the afternoon of the 7th and answered reporters' questions on various issues such as finance, currency, prices, and food. The content of the conversation is roughly as follows: (1) Finance and Currency: Since the suspension of the issuance of new military tickets, the adjustment of the military ticket and reserve voucher at the same price has been proceeding smoothly according to the planned plan. The most important thing at present is how to stabilize the currency value and control prices. On the one hand, we must strengthen local productivity, and on the other hand, we must take comprehensive measures to stabilize prices. What is currently planned is the issuance of prize-linked savings lottery tickets and food storage certificates, etc. At the same time, we hope that powerful Chinese commercial banks can set up branches in various places to absorb funds from the interior. It is also extremely important to convert idle funds into production, so the National Government must fully consider the reorganization of small and medium-sized banks. (2) Price Issues: During wartime, handling prices is a major issue for any country. The most important method is to strengthen the exchange of materials to reduce prices, especially food prices, which have a great impact on material prices. This year's wheat harvest in Central China is very abundant. At the same time, thanks to Japan's efforts, a considerable amount of Southeast Asian rice has been imported into Shanghai. We should take this opportunity to reduce food prices. If there is a good harvest and no hoarding occurs, the exchange of materials between Central China and North China will gradually become smooth. Of course, we should also consider the needs of Central China when supplying materials to North China. (3) Purchasing and Distribution Agencies: Since the preparation of the National Commercial Control General Association, we must work hard to form internal organizations and institutions. The operation of the association must not only strive to eliminate the past direction of liberalism, but also strive to complete the war according to the national system and enter the path of a controlled economy. Only in this way can price controls be resolutely continued, and the budget for production should also be taken into account, so that the situation of low production efficiency does not occur. As for the issue of hoarding, it is of course appropriate to take decisive measures. In short, everything should be based on the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and we should especially cooperate to achieve the goals of the country.

### Jiangsu Provincial Government Investigates Religious Organizations

This kind of behavior is extremely brutal. After being intercepted by Japanese aircraft, they fled in a panic. This act of violence by enemy aircraft, like the previous bombing of Guangzhou Bay, fully demonstrates their anxiety after being criticized by Chongqing. In particular, they targeted the people of the peaceful zone, attempting to disrupt and attack bustling streets, and used machine guns to strafe and kill innocent civilians. Such heinous acts are intolerable under international law and humanitarian principles. This is concrete proof of the cruel nature of the Americans.

Buenos Aires, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to a dispatch from Washington, after the Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, held important talks with US Secretary of State Hull on the 7th, he immediately met with a group of journalists and made remarks on his return to his country and the recent visit to the Soviet Union by the former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Davies. He said, "I am scheduled to return to my country soon, but the date of departure has not yet been determined. Davies's visit to the Soviet Union carried personal letters from Roosevelt and Stalin. Therefore, the results of Davies's visit to the Soviet Union will depend on the content of these personal letters."

### Building an Economic Shanghai, Accomplishing Sino-Japanese Prosperity

— Takechi Fumihiko

(1) Shifting from Japanese control to Chinese control.

(2) Changing from government control to control by autonomous enterprises.

(3) Abolishing the special rights of Japanese trading companies and establishing a Sino-Japanese equality system.

(4) Breaking away from the economic fragmentation of one area and realizing the economy of all of China as a single unit, to serve as the foundation of an economic Shanghai.

What a great fundamental change this is! The announcement of this new policy has attracted the attention of people in the business communities of China and Japan. However, we should remember that this abandonment of initiative by the Japanese side and the abolition of the special rights of Japanese trading companies in the Chinese economy are not the result of the Chinese side's active policy of recovering rights, but rather the Japanese side's thinking on a grand scale, "to have the Chinese engage in the revitalization and construction of the Chinese economy," and therefore voluntarily abandoning them. Furthermore, the revival and development of the Chinese economy is the economy of China's original appearance, and the completion of the goal of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation must be achieved through the alignment of ideals, the unification of interests, and the promotion of efficiency. It cannot be achieved through the exercise of power or the maintenance and abuse of special rights. This is the practical conclusion reached after examining the facts.

The reasons and guiding principles for the new economic transformation can be explained as above. The next question is, what will be the results of implementing the new economic policy? This is still in the preparation stage. How the new economic policy is practiced and how it is operated is the dividing point between the merits and demerits of the new policy. Regarding the operational guidelines, I am imitating the old trick of "using your spear to attack your shield." Let us try to study the economic development guidelines described by Kong Xiangxi, the head of the Executive Yuan of the Chongqing regime, in his instructions at the "Production Conference." At the Production Conference in the 28th year of the Republic of China, Kong Xiangxi emphasized the importance of production in the wartime economy. The economic development guidelines he spoke of were four: (1) No one should be wasted, (2) No materials should be wasted, (3) Be economical, and (4) Be timely.

(3)

The so-called "be economical" means to apply economic principles and promote economic efficiency in controlled economy and planned economy. Over the past six years, the local economy has been blinded by the form of "politics dominating the economy" in controlled economy and planned economy, and has gone against economic principles, resulting in unexpected failures. The shortcomings of the non-economic nature of the controlled economy and planned economy can be compensated for by fully utilizing economic principles. Moreover, in this year of decisive battle, it is even more necessary to utilize economic principles.

"Be timely" emphasizes the "time" factor in the wartime economy. If one is not timely and cannot adapt to changing circumstances, it is inevitable that opportunities will be missed.

The above principles must be guided forward based on the comprehensiveness of the entire economy, so that the entire economy can operate in an organized manner. The current local economic situation particularly needs this. At the same time, it must be understood that only at this stage can the truth of transformation diplomacy be realized.

Let me add one more sentence here. When I was talking with a certain minister of the Nanjing government last time, we accidentally talked about the price issue. I said at the time: Today's price issue in Shanghai cannot be explained by the economic principles learned in universities: (1) supply and demand of materials, and (2) monetary theory. Nor is it, as some people say, (3) due to the unrest in the world war situation. It is really caused by the "lack of an economic reality in China." Therefore, the governments of China and Japan must confirm this fact in cabinet meetings or state council meetings, get to the root of the problem, and create an "economic Shanghai" that revives and constructs Shanghai's production and dominates the entire Chinese economy. If this step is not taken, there is no hope for the recovery and construction of the Chinese economy, the unification of the Chinese economy, and the true purpose of transformation diplomacy cannot be achieved.

Finally, I must offer one word of advice: There is pessimism regarding the construction of an "economic Shanghai." They say: The Shanghai economy has always relied on trade. However, this trade is now cut off and difficult to restore, so the "construction of a consumer Shanghai" is extremely difficult. Now, the only question is whether Shanghai can use its existing inventory to extend its economic life. The above pessimism does not need to be refuted in detail. However, I have some points to criticize these pessimists' fallacies: (1) They cannot appreciate the subtle use of "the enemy's blockade of our economy is an opportunity for our economic recovery," and (2) they only know that the Shanghai economy has always relied on trade, mistakenly believing that China has no power of self-sufficiency, believing that China's inability to break away from the sub-colonial character of trade dependence is due to the international shackles of agreed tariff systems and unequal treaties. Therefore, China has to be an investment country for other countries and an international trade market, which hinders the development of industry.

The purpose of this transformation diplomacy, the economy, is the construction of "economic Shanghai," and it must not be built elsewhere. Only the establishment of "economic Shanghai" is the foundation for the revival and construction of the Chinese economy and the stability of the Chinese people's livelihood, and it is also the foundation for grasping popular sentiment and maintaining the permanent relationship between China and Japan. It is even more the key to completing the Greater East Asia War and the great path to the surrender of Chongqing and the unification of China. "Intelligence is not as good as recognizing the trend." Only this great transformation is an enlightenment for the common prosperity of China and Japan, and it is also a good opportunity to create a unified situation. May the Chinese and Japanese military, government, and people adapt to this enlightenment and move forward bravely, build "economic Shanghai," and accomplish "Sino-Japanese common prosperity." (Written in the afternoon of the auspicious day of Tencho) (Peng Xiang, translated from the May 6th Continental News)

### Roman Military Headquarters Issues Statement, Italy's Will to Fight Remains Strong, Empire Day Changed to Day of Rights in Africa to Commemorate Fall of Tunis and Bizerte

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – The Italian military headquarters issued a statement on the 8th regarding the loss of Tunis and Bizerte, stating: The retreat of the Axis forces from Tunisia was long anticipated by the nation. The anti-Axis forces have more than adequate weapons and manpower, with a ratio of ten to one compared to the Axis forces, so their victory is only natural. But we are not at all pessimistic about the future of the war, and our will remains very strong. The Italian army has defended the area in the past, inflicting heavy damage on the enemy forces, and supported it for as long as May. This is a major military success for the Axis forces. The anti-Axis forces have attacked the area fiercely for a long time, but have not achieved any significant results. As far as the Axis forces are concerned, if the Tunisian war continues, large quantities of military supplies should be transported across the Strait of Sicily by ship, but shipping is very difficult and the damage is bound to be significant. Now that Tunisia has been abandoned, the ships can be used for other purposes, so this retreat is a good policy. As for the anti-Axis forces wanting to achieve their goals, it will still take some time. Although they landed in North Africa very smoothly, their slow pace of operations has missed a valuable opportunity.

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – May 9th was originally Italian Empire Day and Overseas Italian Day. This year, it will be used as "Italy's Rights in Africa" day to commemorate the fall of Tunis and Bizerte. The slogan of the day is what the Italian Prime Minister said, "We must return to Africa." Italian newspapers today published articles describing Italy's achievements in its colonies during war and peace, and published pictures. Today, all cities and towns are flying national flags, and churches are holding ceremonies.

Axis Forces Continue to Resist in Tunisian Coastal Areas

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – News received here tonight is that the Axis forces' strong resistance in Tunisia has not disintegrated. Several powerful Axis units are currently continuing to resolutely defend in the coastal areas, and are still able to establish contact with another powerful unit to jointly utilize a base for operations, and their traffic with other resistance centers further north has not been cut off. Although General Anderson's First Army and the American Fifth Army have occupied land in the east, the heavy price paid is unprecedented since the outbreak of the North African war. The war has now developed to the level of short-range engagements, tank against tank, artillery against artillery, and infantry against infantry. One Axis anti-aircraft battery has destroyed no less than fifty-four British and American tanks east of Mateur. Also, when the Axis forces were unable to transport artillery back to the rear due to lack of fuel, they destroyed it themselves. When the enemy forces approached, they engaged in close combat. Seven enemy tanks were also destroyed by hand grenades.

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – German and Italian forces fought the numerically and materially superior enemy, initially launching counterattacks from the northern and central sections of the North African front against the anti-Axis forces advancing towards Tunis and Bizerte. After the anti-Axis forces broke through and occupied these two bases, the Axis forces suffered a serious blow, but they still counterattacked. The Axis forces have been cut off into several isolated pockets of resistance. According to Berlin news, several main forces are fighting in the coastal areas and the area from Zaghouan to Enfidaville. Slightly further north, another Axis unit is fighting the British Eighth Army. Fierce hand-to-hand combat is taking place in all areas. The British and American forces are gradually forcing back the Axis forces by using large tank formations and hundreds of fighters and bombers. East of Mateur, an Axis anti-aircraft battery destroyed fifty-four of the anti-Axis tank force of at least 120 tanks, and later destroyed seven more. Such heroic resistance is seen in battles in all areas, but Rome and Berlin are not overly hopeful for a long-term Axis resistance. According to Reuters news, the British First Army concentrated more than 400 tanks on the Plains of Saint Cyprien on Friday and attacked a line only nine miles long. The Axis forces then retreated to the second line of resistance. After the anti-Axis air force cleared the way for the ground forces to enter Tunis, they have now turned to naval activities, hoping to disrupt Axis shipping.

### Future Military in Tunisia Lacks Tactical Importance

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Hatom News Agency military commentary expert Sertorius declared tonight: Tunisia is still undergoing fierce fighting, but the outcome of this battle is no longer in doubt. In principle, how the battle will turn out has long been determined. The anti-Axis forces have large amounts of resources and materials in the North African theater, so from the beginning it was very possible for them to overcome the German and Italian bridgehead. When the British and American forces gained air superiority in addition to their original naval superiority in the Mediterranean region, this possibility became a certainty. Since then, the enemy forces have landed in Algiers and Morocco, and it has become increasingly difficult for the Axis forces operating in North Africa to obtain the necessary supplies and sufficient reinforcements. Therefore, the disparity in strength between the two sides increased every month, and later the sea and air traffic from Sicily to Tunisia deteriorated to the point of insignificance due to the enemy forces' superiority at sea and in the air. Under these circumstances, the Axis forces were still able to hold out for as long as six months, so it can be said that the Axis forces have achieved their greatest success. Regarding the enemy side, we also acknowledge that a large part of the British infantry and tank forces (compared to the more mediocre American forces) fought well. Although the British generals cannot achieve outstanding results, they have at least gained a lot of tactical lessons since the beginning of this war, such as using large numbers of tanks, setting up centralized locations, and cooperating with the air force. But if the Axis leaders could maintain a strength ratio of one to two or even one to three, it would be difficult for the enemy forces to succeed. But in fact, the Axis forces fought with one against ten, and the anti-Axis success in North Africa should be entirely credited to the British Navy and Air Force. After Tunis and Bizerte are occupied, the British and Americans no longer need to spend their minds on combat issues, and can completely occupy the remaining parts of the North African Axis bridgehead, but they cannot obtain any military glory from this. The German and Italian forces have lost the main base of their entire defensive line, and have also been divided into several centers of resistance. Furthermore, due to the enemy forces' absolute superiority at sea and in the air, they are completely unable to maintain their supply of military supplies and food. From now on, the enemy forces' navy and air force will be even more effective. These German and Italian troops who are fighting are still fighting bravely, determined to inflict the greatest possible losses on the enemy until the very last moment. They will surely get their wish, but sooner or later they will be overwhelmed by the pressure of a large number of enemy troops. How the British and Americans will accomplish this is no longer worth noting. From now on, the war in Tunisia lacks tactical importance. The only strategy that can be used is spiritual. We can ensure that the German army's spirit of fighting will shine brightly, proving its heroism.

Rome, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Qualified sources here announced yesterday through the Stefani Agency that the numerically superior British and American forces have been trying to end the North African war for months. They suffered extremely heavy losses during the preparation phase and when attacking the Axis fortresses due to the valiant resistance of the German and Italian forces. As a result, they were finally able to enter Tunis and Bizerte, but the resistance is still continuing east of Bizerte and along the central and southern sections of the front. The Axis forces in this area are bravely resisting the numerically superior enemy. It would be a serious mistake to only consider the results obtained by the enemy forces in the recent battles in North Africa. It should not be forgotten that the war in this area began on June 10, 1940. For three years, although Britain has mobilized the strength of its entire empire, and since November last year has also obtained the assistance of the American army and air force, it has not achieved a decisive victory. The enemy forces, with their large forces in all three services and the full assistance of a powerful air force, still encountered serious resistance from the valiant German and Italian forces. The Axis resistance lasted longer than the enemy had expected, so the German and Italian command was able to adopt the necessary countermeasures. Therefore, in terms of the entire war, the fall of Bizerte and Tunis has not shaken the Axis's military situation. If we study the war situation in the Mediterranean, we can see that the British and American forces control the south, while the Axis forces control the north. The latter has a long time to organize its positions.

### Contending for Mediterranean Hegemony, Major Naval and Air Battles Imminent

Stockholm, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – According to London news, although the British military is very excited about the victory in Tunisia, it is well aware that the Axis forces have completed an important strategic task, because the Mediterranean Sea has become a no-man's land, and the naval and air forces of both sides are bound to fight each other to the death. There are many speculations in London about the future actions of the Axis forces, with divergent opinions and many pessimists. The Standard Evening News's claim that the Mediterranean belongs to me is no longer supported by the public. Vincent, a famous British naval expert, pointed out that the Axis and anti-Axis naval and air forces will have a bloody battle in the Mediterranean to seize hegemony. He said that since Sicily and Sardinia are owned by the Axis forces, navigation on the anti-Axis sea lane is extremely dangerous. The fate of many anti-Axis escort ships that attempted to break through to Malta and were annihilated can serve as a warning. Assistance has not yet obtained a decisive victory. The enemy forces, with their large forces in all three services and the full assistance of a powerful air force, still encountered serious resistance from the valiant German and Italian forces. The Axis resistance lasted longer than the enemy had expected, so the German and Italian command was able to adopt the necessary countermeasures. Therefore, in terms of the entire war, the fall of Bizerte and Tunis has not shaken the Axis's military situation. If we study the war situation in the Mediterranean, we can see that the British and American forces control the south, while the Axis forces control the north. The latter has a long time to organize its positions.

### Military Changes in North Africa Do Not Affect Politics

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency Dispatch) – Since the North African war situation has changed rapidly, the anti-Axis countries have frequently promoted this, claiming that new changes will occur in the international political situation. The diplomatic authorities refuted this claim on the 8th and clarified their views as follows: Changes in the military situation in North Africa cannot cause any political impact. How the local war situation in Tunisia develops cannot create any obstacles to the Axis countries' final victory. Italian Prime Minister Mussolini's speech on the 5th was extremely pertinent.

### Eastern Front Weather Returns to Normal; Land and Air Battles Resume; Soviet Landing in the Sea of Azov Unsuccessful; Donets Front Recovered by Germans

Berlin, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – German News Agency's Eastern Front correspondent, Hanma, reported on the 8th on the current situation on the Eastern Front, stating: The weather on the Eastern Front has returned to normal, and the land has also dried out, resulting in intensified battles and air combat in various locations. In preparation for future war developments, the Soviet army has been making strenuous efforts to strengthen its positions in the Kuban region and various parts of the Central Donets-Volga region, including increasing its tank forces. On the 7th alone, 51 Soviet tanks were destroyed by the German army, and 106 aircraft were lost. Thus, the 7th can be considered the Soviet army's most unfortunate day. The Soviet army launched offensives across the entire front in an attempt to reduce German combat power, but was ultimately unsuccessful. The Soviet army in the Kuban region also launched an offensive, but was repelled by the German army, losing 30 tanks and 740 prisoners. In air combat, German aircraft shot down six Soviet assault fighters, and German anti-aircraft guns shot down 15 Soviet aircraft. When German aircraft flew over the coast of the Sea of Azov, they discovered a Soviet attempt to land. They immediately bombarded the landing force, sinking 16 fully loaded troop transport boats and heavily damaging 28 others. In the middle reaches of the Donets River, the Soviet army, under the cover of artillery, crossed the river and rushed to the west bank. The German army immediately shortened its lines, concentrated its main forces, and launched a fierce attack, driving them back and retaking the lost ground. In this battle, 263 Soviet soldiers were captured. Furthermore, 17 Soviet Douglas bombers bombed German positions. Four German fighters took off to intercept them and immediately shot down 14. South of Orel, the Soviet army attempted to seize German positions with powerful forces, but was repelled by the German army. In this battle, the German army destroyed nine Soviet tanks, captured hundreds of Soviet soldiers, seized countless light and heavy weapons, and shot down 36 Soviet aircraft. West of Velikiye Luki, the Soviet army also launched an offensive, but lost 12 tanks, 200 prisoners, and 11 mortars, as well as a large amount of ammunition. In the Volga region, the Soviet army attempted a night raid, but was completely annihilated by the German army.

### British and American Military Officers Replaced

Amsterdam, 8th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to the German News Agency, quoting London sources, Major General Bradley has been appointed as the commander of the British Second Army Corps today. The vanguard of this corps has already participated in the fighting in Tunisia.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to dispatches from Algiers, the headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa announced on the 8th that Patton, commander of the US Second Army Corps on the Tunisian front, has been transferred to an important position, and Major General Bradolley has been appointed to succeed him.

Lisbon, 9th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The US War Department in Washington announced last night the appointment of Major General Edward as the chief of staff to Lieutenant General Devers. Devers was appointed to succeed Andrews as the commander-in-chief of the US forces stationed in Europe. Colonel Bales, the original chief of staff, will henceforth be primarily responsible for promoting cooperation between the US Army and Air Force stationed in Europe.

### Symposium on the Current Situation in China During Wartime to be Held at the Imperial Hotel in Tokyo on April 9th

Attendees: Chen Gongbo, Ōkawa Shūmei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, Yamamoto Sanematsu

Mr. Chen Gongbo, the special envoy of the Republic of China government, President of the Legislative Yuan, and Mayor of Shanghai, who visited Nanjing in response to Prime Minister Tōjō's visit, despite his busy schedule, discussed various issues concerning Japan and China with Mr. Ōkawa Shūmei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, and Yamamoto Sanematsu at the Imperial Hotel from 2:35 PM to 5:10 PM on April 9th. However, due to time constraints, more time was spent listening to Mr. Chen's opinions, and less time was available for the Japanese side to express their views, which is regrettable.

Yamamoto: Let me be the chairman today. Now, let me introduce the attendees. Starting from this side, the first is Mr. Ōkawa Shūmei, followed by Mr. Matsumoto Shigeharu, Mr. Tachibana Shiraki, and myself.

Chen: I am very happy to meet everyone today. For this meeting, please give me the topics, and I will answer them.

Looking back when I was studying in the United States, the professors sat in a row like this, and I, as a student, heard various things from the professors. That scene was exactly like this, but I later became a Ph.D. (laughter). Thinking about this makes me very happy.

Yamamoto: We are all private citizens, so please speak freely. We can talk about anything too. Otherwise, the conversation will not be interesting. Please don't be constrained by formalities, just talk casually!

One of the reasons why China and Japan have come to this fate is that Japan criticizes China for worshiping Europe and America. However, upon closer reflection, it seems that under the circumstances at the time, Japan also had no choice but to follow Europe and America. In all its diplomacy with China, Japan had no choice but to follow in the footsteps of Britain and America. We are well aware of this history. Therefore, if Japan and China jointly expel Britain and America from East Asia, and if there are no disruptors in between to sow discord between the two countries, then the situation that you are worried about will definitely be resolved naturally. - We, the peace comrades, have come to this conclusion.

So, how can we expel Britain and America from East Asia? This cannot be accomplished by China alone. If China were to do it, it could only launch riots or demonstrations within the country, such as the May Thirtieth Movement in Shanghai. To expel Britain and America from East Asia, no matter what, unless Japan takes the lead and launches a war, this wish cannot be achieved. I have repeatedly mentioned this opinion in public speeches and personal conversations when I came to your country two years ago, shortly after returning to the capital, in May of the 29th year of the Republic, as a goodwill ambassador. In particular, I mentioned the hope for a war like the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, when I had the honor of meeting with His Majesty the Emperor, I respectfully informed him that "the current East Asian problem is not just a problem between China and Japan, but a problem east of the Suez Canal." I also conveyed the same opinion to then-Vice Chief of Staff of the Army, Lieutenant General Sawada. To Commander Taniyama of the Yokosuka Naval Base, I also stated on a warship that "once something happens in the Pacific, the Republic of China is resolved to contribute all its material and human resources to the Greater East Asia War." There were also various other statements. In my commemorative album of the courtesy visit, various articles are recorded, but these statements, because they are related to military affairs, were not recorded. I will not mention these things for the time being, but I hope that you will not forget what I am about to say.

That is what was said at the banquet hosted by Prime Minister Konoe at the Seiyoken restaurant. At that time, I publicly expressed this opinion at the banquet: "Greater East Asia has two opportunities to truly cooperate. The first opportunity is when a crisis comes to East Asia, such as the arrival of the Greater East Asia War today. The past grievances will be forgotten, and China and Japan will unite as one and pledge to live and die together. This is the first opportunity: Another opportunity.

Today, Mr. Chen has taken time out of his busy schedule to give us this time. We would like to express our deep gratitude to Mr. Chen.

Now, please let Mr. Chen talk about the return of the concessions and the situation in Shanghai and China before and after the war.

Chen: Regarding the issue of participating in the war, I would like to present my opinion frankly and concretely.

Why did the National Government participate in the war? Let me first explain this point concretely.

When the peace movement started three years ago, I was in Chongqing. At that time, Mr. Wang Jingwei expressed such an ideal: "The reason for starting this peace movement is definitely not because China has been defeated and there is no other way to end this incident. We are not casually resolving the incident so that China can temporarily recuperate and then do something else. I am definitely not starting the peace movement and leaving Chongqing with such intentions." As you know, the reason why the two countries have entered a state of war is definitely not due to a short period, but due to decades of discord. Therefore, if we first casually resolve the incident, it will only be a temporary change, and perhaps such an incident will happen again in the future. For example, in Europe, there is a state of affairs where war is necessary to repeat every twenty or ten years. Needless to say, Europe has many countries, unlike East Asia, which is simple. The main countries are only China and Japan; but if this state of opposition between China and Japan continues to exist, then even if the incident ends temporarily, war will definitely break out every twenty or ten years. Therefore, our work is to prevent this incident from recurring forever, so I am studying how to make both Japan and China strive towards the same common goal.

At that time, if Japan and China decided on a common goal, it would be to drive the British and American imperialists out of East Asia. There is no other way besides this. If both countries have such aspirations, then the two countries will unite as one and can achieve a common goal. This principle was not conceived because of the incident. The Kuomintang of the Republic of China already had this slogan when it was reorganized in the 13th year of the Republic. However, the reason why this goal was not achieved later was because Chiang Kai-shek colluded with Britain and America.

For example, after Japan and China establish peace, we must establish an Eastern international organization in our East - like the League of Nations in the West, so that Greater East Asia becomes one, otherwise, true cooperation will be impossible to achieve in the future.

Why do I say these things? It is because I thought that even if a muddled peace is established temporarily, if the obstruction and instigation of Britain and America join from the outside, then the peace that was specially established will inevitably be destroyed, so no matter what, we must remove the obstructers and the cancer of peace. This is the way to seek eternal peace. Today, such a great Greater East Asia War has been launched under your country's guidance. Of course, China must realize what I have said about participating in the war and contribute all its human and material resources. My long-cherished wish and long-awaited hope can be realized, so I feel very happy.

On December 8th of the year before last, your country declared war on Britain and America, with a grand official declaration of war. At this time, a glimpse into Japan's intentions reveals that Japan has indicated that it will bear the responsibility for the Greater East Asia War, that Japan is capable of shouldering it alone, and that it need not burden China. The cadres of the National Government, upon receiving such kind intentions from Japan, immediately expressed their desire to participate in the war, and it was not until January 9th of this year that participation was realized.

At that time, when the Greater East Asia War broke out, Chairman Wang immediately declared that he would share weal and woe with Japan. Why did he not say live and die together at that time? This is because the time to participate in the war had not yet arrived, so we had to share weal and woe no matter what. With the realization of this participation in the war, we have entered the realm of living and dying together. Japan, of course, is displaying the spirit of Bushido, bearing the burden alone, and not wanting to trouble others, but on the Chinese side, we believe that not only in terms of friendship, but also from the perspective of the overall situation in East Asia, we can no longer be stingy and should contribute everything to the Greater East Asia War, because saving East Asia is saving China. The above is the answer to the question of why China is participating in the war.

Next, I will report on the actual situation after participating in the war.

First, it is the change in public sentiment after participating in the war. Before participating in the war, there was inevitably a negative attitude towards various aspects of materials. However, due to the participation of the National Government in this war, the people's psychology has changed, and they all believe that the Greater East Asia War is our business. Participating in the Greater East Asia War is not only the natural task of a member of East Asia, but also the honor of a member of the East. Therefore, psychologically, they have all changed and believe that they should automatically take out materials for themselves.

Moreover, the participation of the National Government in the war did not only originate from the cadres of the National Government, but also solicited the opinions of the national economic circles, financial circles, and all classes. At that time, national public opinion was boiling, and everyone unanimously wanted to eliminate Britain and America through the Greater East Asia War, and believed that participating in the Greater East Asia War was a matter of course. Now, I will report on the current state of change in public sentiment.

After participating in the war, thanks to the establishment of various great policy changes in your country, public sentiment has become more inclined towards the Nanjing government. In particular, the problem of material control was resolved on the 16th of last month (March). As you know, in the past, materials were circulating piecemeal in various places, so blood was not circulating, but since the implementation of this new policy of material control, materials from various central locations have been concentrated in Shanghai. Of course, prices were soaring in the past, but now prices are gradually falling, and the lives of the people are showing a state of peace and joy. Taking Shanghai as an example, factories in Shanghai were unable to start production at all in the past. Why? Because the various items manufactured by the factories could not be transported anywhere due to material control, so the factories could not obtain profits, and the factories themselves could not stand. However, since the implementation of this new material control policy, all factories have recovered. Not only that, but an increase in production can also be realized. Recently, the Central Reserve Bank has released 500 million yuan in funds for the restoration and increased production of factories. I think everyone will be happy to hear this good news recently.

I will only talk about the issue of participating in the war up to this point. Now, let's listen to everyone's questions about the next topic.

### Zhang Jinhai Case: Attorney Files Petition in Capital; Peng Shuanglong's Family Requests Transfer to Hospital for Treatment

The central government and the city government are extremely concerned about the case of Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Hosiery Factory in the French Concession, who died from torture, and Peng Shuanglong, who was seriously injured. Minister Luo of the Ministry of Justice personally came to Shanghai to investigate the truth. The city government has also made serious representations to the French Concession's Municipal Council. The Western detective, Millet, has already been escorted and will be prosecuted by the French Consular Court. The other defendants have also been summoned by the Special No. 2 Court for prosecution. To redress the grievances of the Zhang Jinhai family, they entrusted attorney Shao Bao'san to represent them in a petition and appeal during Minister Luo's visit to Shanghai. It is reported that attorney Shao took the night train last night to travel to the capital and file petitions with various agencies in the capital, including the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, the Ministry of Justice, the Ministry of Propaganda, and the Ministry of Social Welfare.

Peng's Family Files Petition to Change Hospital

Peng Shuanglong, a 17-year-old apprentice who suffered serious injuries, has been receiving treatment at Guangci Hospital. His injuries are quite severe. Citizens from all walks of life in the city have visited the hospital to express their sympathy to Peng, but they have been refused by the hospital. Unexpectedly, the family of Peng brought dinner to the hospital the night before last to provide him with food, but they were also strongly refused and not allowed to see him. After the family politely requested, they were ignored. The Peng family then approached the French Concession police for assistance, but to no avail. Fearing that an accident might occur, the Peng family filed a petition with the Special No. 2 Court yesterday, requesting that the injured Peng Shuanglong be transferred to another hospital for treatment and that he be allowed to move to Nanyang Hospital for treatment.

According to a letter from the French Police Department: The report in various newspapers on the 8th of this month stated that Gu Shuo, Deputy Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Justice, accompanied by Secretary Lai and Peng Wangshi, a member of the Ministry of Justice, met with Fabre, the Superintendent of the French Concession Police Department, and that Fabre stated that "if any unexpected incidents occur, the police department still has the authority to take necessary measures to maintain security within the concession." However, this topic was not discussed during the meeting on that day. The Superintendent of the French Police only said: "The French police authorities are currently very busy with security issues such as Baojia, public security, food, and air defense. We hope that everyone will assist and guide us at any time. The Zhang case occurred due to individual negligence and violation of instructions. I guarantee that this matter will be handled seriously and impartially according to the law." It did not involve the talks reported in the newspapers. Please correct this.

### Jian Jianwu's Broadcast Last Night: A Plea for the Anti-British and American Association

Yesterday, from 9:30 PM to 10:00 PM, the Chinese National Anti-British and American Association specially invited Mr. Jian Jianwu, Deputy Minister of the Central Social Department, to give a radio speech at the Shanghai Radio Station in this city. The topic was "From Anti-British and American Work to the Greater East Asia War." He elaborated in detail on the significance of anti-British and American work and its relationship with the Greater East Asia War. The gist of his speech is as follows:

Speech

Fellow compatriots: Today, my topic is "From Anti-British and American Work to the Greater East Asia War." This is because anti-British and American work is closely related to the Greater East Asia War. The Greater East Asia War can be said to be the practice of anti-British and American work, and anti-British and American work can only fulfill its mission under the guarantee of victory in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, I will briefly explain the significance of anti-British and American work and its connection to the Greater East Asia War.

We know that the significance of anti-British and American work is not a narrow sense of xenophobia, but contains the revolutionary significance of oppressed nations. Britain and the United States are the two countries with the most colonies and the longest or most ingenious history of aggression in the world. From Africa to Europe, from Europe to Asia, we can see their acts of aggression everywhere. Although the United States' history of aggression is later than that of Britain, its methods of aggression are superior to those of Britain. China has been subjected to imperialist aggression for a century, leading to its decline into a semi-colonial status. Tracing back through history, the main culprit is Britain, and the one that intensified the situation is the United States. This is not only true in China, but also true for all nations in East Asia. Therefore, the history of China in the last hundred years can be said to be a history of aggression by British and American imperialists. The history of East Asia in the last two or three hundred years can be said to be a colonial history of British and American imperialism. The world history since the eighteenth century can be said to be a history of rampant British and American imperialists. Therefore, anti-British and American work is a revolutionary movement of the Chinese nation in China, an anti-Western aggression movement of East Asian nations in East Asia, and an anti-oppression movement of oppressed nations throughout the world. Anti-British and American work is not only work that China should do, but also work that the entire East Asian nations and even all nations oppressed by Britain and the United States should work together on. This is the first point that everyone should understand.

Since anti-British and American work is a revolutionary work of oppressed nations against British and American aggression, its non-xenophobic nature is very obvious. What we oppose are the colonial policies of British and American imperialists, the aggression of British and American imperialists, and the oppressive measures imposed on us by British and American imperialists. As for the British and American people who sympathize with us, we not only do not need to oppose them, but even need to join hands with them. As for the progressive science of Britain and the United States, we not only do not need to oppose it, but even need to adopt it. As for the excellent culture of Britain and the United States (excluding the culture of aggression), we not only do not need to oppose it, but even need to accept it. Therefore, our anti-British and American is anti-British and American aggression and oppression, not rejecting Britain and the United States. This is the second point that everyone should understand.

Secondly, we talk about the Greater East Asia War. We know that the Greater East Asia War is a war between the entire East Asian nation and British and American imperialists, and anti-British and American work is also the work of the entire East Asian nation resisting British and American imperialists. Therefore, the meanings of the two are one and two, and two and one. The Greater East Asia War can be said to be the practice of anti-British and American work, and anti-British and American work is also a part of the actual work of the Greater East Asia War. The biggest purpose of the Greater East Asia War is to establish permanent peace in East Asia, and it is British and American imperialists who are destroying this East Asian peace. Therefore, the target of the Greater East Asia War is British and American imperialists. This is undoubtedly certain, and it is undeniable that anti-British and American work has a common purpose and meaning with the Greater East Asia War.

Since we have already understood that the Greater East Asia War is the practice of anti-British and American work, in order to carry out the mission of anti-British and American work, we must work with friendly nations to strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and we must guarantee the success of anti-British and American work under the victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### The Fourth Installment of Rationed Cigarettes Immediately Available for Sale; Strict District Inspections to Prevent Abuses

The Huazhong Tobacco Rationing Association's fourth installment of goods is valued at 2,666.30 yuan for the Ding Card category. The goods allocated to the Bing, Yi, and Jia Card categories will increase proportionally. The allocated goods include products from Zhonghua, Hua, Nanyang, Rendong, Fuxin, and other brands. The goods have been withdrawn with payment since the 5th and are immediately available for sale. However, black market prices are still rampant. In order to effectively implement price limits and prevent reselling for profit, the Inspection Department of the Association has ordered all inspectors to conduct strict district inspections to prevent abuses. However, some cigarette merchants are suspected of refusing to sell and hoarding goods and have been warned separately. If they dare to re-offend, their rationing will be suspended, and the responsible persons will be prosecuted according to law. It is also reported that the registration of cigarette distribution companies has been closed since May 1st, and new applications for goods allocation are being rejected. At the same time, wholesale and retail merchants are strictly ordered to be courteous to cigarette purchasers and to pay special attention to the preservation of tobacco. If there are any dampness, aroma, odor, or easily dispersed powders, they must not be close to the tobacco. The retail prices of cigarettes and the signs issued by the Association should be hung in a place easily visible to cigarette purchasers. In addition, the fifth batch of cigarettes will be distributed after the 15th.

### Lianbao Chief in Nanshi Dismissed for Malpractice

After receiving the report, the Committee immediately sent personnel to thoroughly investigate the allegations, and all were found to be true.

### Xu Songyao's Coffin Approved by the Court for Opening; Case of Killing His Brother Concluded; Two Coffins to Be Transported to Their Hometown for Burial

The case of Xu Daquan, the young owner of the Huachang Pharmacy, who killed his brother Xu Songyao in the early winter of the previous year, caused a sensation in society. The murderer Xu Daquan has been executed, and the entire case has been concluded. However, Xu Songyao's coffin was previously seized by the Special Second Court, which sent personnel to open the coffin for inspection and then sealed it, temporarily storing it in the Shanghai Funeral Parlor. Now that the case has been concluded for three months and Daquan has been executed for one hundred days, the Xu family intends to transport both coffins back to their hometown in Jiading for burial. They specially requested the Special Second Court to open the seal and return the coffins. The court approved the request and sent personnel to the Shanghai Funeral Parlor to open Xu Songyao's coffin, which was then claimed by his family.

### Lianyi Cup Unveils with Exhibition Match: Xu Hui Lian Wins Against Shengyou 7-2, An Unexpected Outcome

The Lianyi Cup mini-football tournament kicked off yesterday with an exhibition match between Xu Hui Lian and Shengyou. Lin Kanghou performed the opening kick, with He Chunhui as the referee. The silver whistle signaled the start of the intense battle. Xu Hui Lian, boosted by the support of Lianyi players, showed great strength. Less than five minutes into the match, Wang Wenyi swept a goal from the right, but soon after, Xu Lian conceded a penalty, which H. Pantinson converted, making it 1-1. Unexpectedly, Xu Lian's Gao Baozheng was blessed with good fortune and scored three consecutive goals, each shot clear and beautiful, leaving Shengyou helpless. The first half ended with Xu Lian leading 4-1. In the second half, Gao Baozheng scored again with a header within minutes, adding to the excitement. Then, Fei Chunhua's excellent corner kick broke through the net, making it 6-1. A few minutes later, Gao Baozheng, single-handedly dribbling past three defenders, shot and scored, making it 7-1. Finally, Shengyou's H. Pantinson scored a goal to reduce the deficit, and the game ended. In conclusion, Xu Hui Lian defeated Shengyou 7-2, an unexpected outcome. The organizers of the match, Pan Sansheng and others, were present to watch the game. Xu Hui Lian's victory was largely due to Gao Baozheng's five goals. Fei Chunhua also performed well, and defenders Qu Yongfu, Wu Qixiang, and McPherson all fulfilled their duties. Goalkeeper Gao Jingwen's skills were also commendable. Shengyou's play lacked vigor.

This newspaper's broadcast time was 7:40 PM yesterday.

### President Yamamoto of Kaizo-sha Visits Shanghai; This Newspaper Hosts Tea Party to Welcome Him; Candid Discussions on the Current Situation and Paper Issues, Guests and Host Enjoyed Themselves

Mr. Yamamoto Jitsuhiko, President of the Japanese Kaizo-sha, visited Shanghai from North China. To show our welcome and introduce him to various circles in Shanghai, this newspaper held a tea party at the Kangle Restaurant yesterday afternoon at 4:00 PM. Attendees included: Kiyomasa Hidaka, Toyosuke Yoshida, Zhu Yongkang, Wu Kaisheng, Yoichi Osaka, Zhou Huarin, Zhou Yueran, Zhou Lianan, Li Quanshi, Eiichi Iwai, Hiroshi Kojima, Yusheng Liu, Jiancheng Xia, Riping Chen, Gaoyi Lu, Kangde Tao, Yipeng Zhang, Xuetao Zhang, Huiming Ye, Lanting Wen, Huilang Yang, Guangzheng Yang, Zhengping Zhao, Jinqing Zhao, Hongyan Zheng, Yunzhang Jiang, Yangyao Pan, Yuqie Pan, Liudai Pan, and reporters from this newspaper, totaling several dozen people (listed in order of surname stroke count).

President Chen's Speech

First, President Chen of this newspaper delivered a brief welcome speech, stating that Mr. Yamamoto is a renowned commentator, thinker, and publishing leader from our friendly neighbor, Japan. The "Kaizo" monthly magazine is one of the best-selling and most comprehensive magazines in Japan. This year marks the 25th anniversary of Kaizo-sha, and Mr. Yamamoto is traveling to China to observe the situation after China's entry into the war. For the past 30 years, Mr. Yamamoto has been a "friend of China" who is most concerned about Far Eastern issues and has done his best to promote friendship between China and Japan. Today, we are introducing him to everyone present, and many of you are old friends of Mr. Yamamoto. I believe you will all be very happy. We also celebrate the limitless future development of Kaizo-sha and wish Mr. Yamamoto good health.

Mr. Yamamoto's Speech

Next, Mr. Yamamoto (President) delivered a speech, saying: This is not my first visit to China. I have always had a deep affection for your country. I am very grateful for the invitation from President Chen of your newspaper to have this opportunity to speak with everyone here. The necessity of unity and cooperation between China and Japan

Unity and Cooperation

is not something that started today, especially with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. There is an even greater need for further cooperation. After arriving in your country this time, I am very pleased to see the progress of various facilities. However, in terms of politics, I am not satisfied with this and hope that further efforts will be made. I believe that this hope is not only mine personally, but also that the people of your country will strive for progress. Since Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, we have been working tirelessly to improve ourselves. Not only have we made progress in military affairs and achieved favorable results in the war, but we have also made progress in politics, step by step, along with the progress of the war. After your country entered the war, its mission to share the burden of the overall situation became heavier. I sincerely hope that you will continue to make unremitting efforts and continue to move forward. Moreover,

European War Tensions

at a time when the European war is tense, the German-Soviet war is in full swing, and the battle of Stalingrad in the last war is particularly noteworthy. I believe that the Chinese people have not ignored this point. The future development of the German-Soviet war is something that everyone must pay close attention to. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are land-based powers, each with its own advantages. In countries with equal strength, it will take a fierce battle to determine victory or defeat, and we must pay close attention to it. In this eventful time, it is not easy for China to deal with domestic and foreign problems. To deal with foreign affairs, we must first have a sound and strong political system and gain the support of the people. To strengthen political power, we must strive to improve politics. Once this point is achieved, not only will the people on one side be pleased, but also the people under the rule of the other side will gladly return. I believe that this point needs to be achieved, and I am even more convinced that it can be achieved. Finally, in my 30 years of experience in the cultural field, I would like to briefly describe the fundamentals of cultural undertakings.

The Paper Issue

Japan's paper-making capacity is not much different from before the war. Why, then, are Japan's publishing businesses, newspapers, and magazines seeking to reduce their size? This is because, in this long-term war, we must make preparations in advance so that the tools of the cultural war (paper) can be used endlessly and inexhaustibly, and advance alongside the long-term war, shattering the enemy's paper-based rumor offensive.

Mr. Liu Yusheng's Speech

I am not meeting Mr. Yamamoto for the first time today, and I recall that when I first met him half a year ago, it felt as if we had known each other for a long time. This is because Mr. Yamamoto is an old friend of China and is well-versed in China's various situations. He often regrets that China is not his hometown. We all know that he is an authority in the Japanese publishing and cultural circles, and the "Kaizo" magazine he presides over is a world-renowned magazine. His current affairs commentaries, writings, and travelogues are widely welcomed by readers in our country. Because Mr. Yamamoto is a thinker who truly understands China and sympathizes with the Chinese people, I believe that in addition to listening to his high opinions, we should also be open and honest, express our views frankly, and share our innermost feelings. From a political point of view, the future of Japan and China is one of shared destiny. We are fighting a war together with nations that are united in the world and treat us as equals. From a cultural and ideological point of view, the cooperation between China and Japan still needs the active establishment of various cooperative undertakings and efforts to move forward. Ideology is the source of all driving forces. Mr. Yamamoto is not only a proponent of Japanese thought, but also a keen observer of the current situation, and his views are naturally superior to others. I sincerely hope that Mr. Yamamoto's visit will be a long one so that he can observe and experience as much as possible the situation and trends in various aspects of China. The benefits will not only accrue to the Chinese people, but the happiness of the entire East Asia and the world will depend on it.

Mr. Zhou Huarin's Speech

I had the honor of meeting Mr. Yamamoto at the previous East Asian Literary Representatives Conference. I am very pleased to meet an old friend again today. I recall that when I last met Mr. Yamamoto, I said that I heard that Britain and the United States, in order to feign goodwill towards the Chongqing government, would abolish extraterritoriality and give up concessions in order to deceive the people of Chongqing. If so, why doesn't Japan take the lead in abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions to the National Government? Britain and the United States show goodwill in words, while Japan shows it in deeds. Then, the Chinese people will definitely feel Japan's sincerity in treating us as equals and rise up to cooperate. At that time, Mr. Yamamoto also agreed and asserted that the Japanese government would definitely do this, but it was only a matter of time. In a few days, the Japanese government did realize this. At this point, I realized that Mr. Yamamoto's vision was far-reaching and his observations were accurate. We are aware that our mission is arduous and we are willing to accept constructive criticism with all sincerity in order to achieve a solid foundation for Sino-Japanese cooperation. I also hope that Mr. Yamamoto will convey his observations and experiences from this trip to the people of your country after returning home in order to promote the unity of our two countries. Finally, Zhao Zhengping and others delivered speeches, and the gathering ended happily.

Comments from the Economic World

### Real Estate and People's Livelihood

People and land are inherently inseparable. From the perspective of China's private economy, China has been an agricultural country for thousands of years, and the livelihoods of most people depend entirely on the cultivation of land. Even when discussing agriculture and industry together, China has not yet been able to break away from the 19th-century household industry system. Most families rely on both manufacturing and cultivation for their livelihoods. In other words, they cannot break away from the land to maintain their livelihoods.

However, what this topic refers to is not the land relied upon for cultivation in rural areas, but the land in cities that is related to housing issues - it is better to say real estate. In theory, real estate transactions cannot be anything other than a form of investment. Looking at recent Shanghai, since it has been recognized that hoarding goods, especially goods related to people's daily lives, is speculative and illegal, a portion of so-called floating capital has changed its course and flocked to real estate transactions.

It was said above that real estate transactions are legitimate transactions. However, as they are legitimate transactions, one should firmly remember a legitimate principle, which is: in real estate transactions, do not forget the livelihood of the people. Because, as far as we know, some real estate operators, perhaps due to their high level of business skills, do not hesitate to (1) take the demolition of houses as the principle of buying real estate, because they can make a great profit from selling bricks, tiles, and wood; (2) take increasing rent as the motivation for buying real estate, because when real estate changes hands, the houses on the real estate can have new rents set. As a result, the former can directly leave people homeless, and the latter can also increase the burden of living. In addition, some real estate owners even use the power of their money and influence to, on the one hand, divide the unity among tenants, and on the other hand, ingratiate themselves with the powerful, in order to fulfill their desire to evict old tenants and collect new rent, disregarding the issue of people's peaceful and happy life. All of this is unacceptable and are improper and unreasonable behaviors that must be avoided by those engaged in real estate transactions and those who own real estate. In short, one must adhere to the sacred principle of "Do not do to others what you do not want done to yourself." Then, operators will operate, and people will live their lives, each not disturbing the other, and the world will be at peace. The Agricultural Economy Department will be established by Jiaotong Bank

### Finance and Food Ministries Strengthen Agricultural Economic Institutions to Increase Production; Jiaotong Bank Charged with Establishing Agricultural Economy Department

There are detailed plans for the adjustment of agricultural economic institutions, the promotion of various rural cooperatives, the establishment of cooperative banks, agricultural construction, the regulation of capital, and the increase of major agricultural products production, which will be implemented step by step. It is said that this undertaking is being actively carried out by the Agricultural Economy Department established by Jiaotong Bank.

Therefore, it ordered the National Commercial and Statistical Association to instruct all industries to report.

### Fundamental Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation (Part 1)

— Lin

Although there are many reasons for the soaring prices, speculation and hoarding are the main factors, especially this time. Hoarders refuse to sell, and those without goods desperately try to buy, leading to market chaos and rapid price increases. The impact is far-reaching and detrimental, and the National Government has therefore issued orders for strict investigation. If the investigation cannot be thorough, it will not only fail to suppress prices but will also lead to public disappointment and further fuel price increases. Therefore, it is hoped that the authorities will pay close attention, execute the orders fairly, and achieve the intended purpose. Although there have been one or two cases of punishment recently, this cannot be considered complete. It is still necessary to actively promote the investigation so that hoarding is completely unable to escape the law and continue to harm society and satisfy selfish desires. I recently read Mr. Yoshida Togo's "On the Seriousness of the Price Problem," in which he pointed out that speculation and hoarding have political implications. He said: "Shanghai is still the front line of the economic war with Chongqing, and the speculative market is its central battlefield. If the National Government can win this battle, the citizens of Shanghai will become sincere supporters of the National Government. If it fails, the future of the National Government will have significant consequences, and it will be a major blow to Japan's completion of the Greater East Asia War." From this, it can be seen that the seriousness of the problem of speculation and hoarding has reached an extreme point and cannot be ignored by us, and must be suppressed quickly. Moreover, the suppression of speculation and hoarding must not be half-hearted, nor can it be a one-time effort. That is to say, the suppression of speculation and hoarding must not only be thorough in the present but also seek a permanent and fundamental solution. We must not only seek appearance but also seek reality, so that it can be eradicated forever. Therefore, the way to eliminate speculation should be a fundamental solution. In view of this, the author respectfully offers a few countermeasures below in order to fundamentally eliminate speculation and hoarding:

(1) Clearly formulate laws to ban hoarding. The ban on hoarding is not temporary during wartime but permanent. If there are laws to ban hoarding, it will be easier to prevent speculation and hoarding before it happens than to stop it after it has already occurred. As for Mr. Yoshida Togo's proposal, "Punish offenders with death or imprisonment depending on the severity of the circumstances," the author fully agrees, because this is a necessary measure during rampant speculation and hoarding. Otherwise, it will not be enough to deter criminals.

(2) After the investigation, in addition to severely punishing large-scale speculators and hoarders, the remaining hoarded goods can be purchased by the authorities by issuing "commodity warehouse vouchers" at limited prices. This has been discussed in detail in the article "Review of Absorbing Surplus Purchasing Power" and will not be repeated. In short, the purchase of large stockpiles of goods is another heavy blow to hoarders, because hoarders lose the means to engage in speculation. Moreover, only the method of purchase is effective during rampant speculation and hoarding. Otherwise, the goods will remain in the hands of hoarders. Although there are laws and investigations to suppress them, hoarders can still use various tricks to evade them.

(3) Since there is a National Commercial Control Association, it can be used to handle the purchase of stockpiled goods with the government as a backing. After the purchase is completed, a distribution system should be established as soon as possible to transform the economic structure of Central China from a past state of free laissez-faire to a strict control system. The distribution of various daily necessities must be suitable for the wartime state. However, based on past distribution experiences, there are still several points that officials should pay attention to: First, the distribution quantity should be increased to meet the needs of each individual. Second, the amount needed varies greatly with age, so the distribution quantity must also be specified in detail and differently to show fairness. Third, laborers and mental workers have different levels of consumption and different quantities needed. Therefore, the materials and quantities distributed should also be increased or decreased separately to show appropriateness. Fourth, the stores selling distributed goods should be inspected from time to time to prevent fraud. Otherwise, if shortages cannot be adjusted, the black market will rise again. When the black market rises, it will create opportunities for speculators and weaken the effectiveness of the distribution system. This is because the black market arises because the needs of the people cannot be met.

### Commercial Control Association to Establish Wuhan Branch

Following the new policy toward China, the economy of the Wuhan area has also undergone considerable changes. Therefore, Lieutenant Colonel Ogawa of the General Command of the Dispatch Army, Military Attaché Kajiwara of the Embassy, Economic Advisor Fukuda of the National Government, Secretary Kiyo of the Embassy, and Secretary Kono of the Ministry of Finance jointly flew to Wuhan on the 5th to inspect the financial situation. On the 5th and 6th, they held a discussion meeting with those related to the Army, Navy, and the Ministry of Greater East Asia stationed in Wuhan at the Consulate General. As a result, it was decided to establish a branch of the National Commercial Control Association in Wuhan.

In the future, all controlled economic institutions that were previously under Japanese control will be handed over to the Chinese side and are currently under study and preparation. Furthermore, a discussion was held with the Chinese banking community on the issue of the Zhongjiang Industrial Bank, which will be registered with the National Government. The group flew back to Nanjing on the 7th. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 9th issue of the Continental News)

### Regulations on Registration of Major Commodities Under Study

According to Article 9 of the Regulations on Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities, if there is a situation as described in Article 3 of these regulations before the implementation of these regulations, the parties concerned shall register with the local competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of these regulations. Article 3 also stipulates that members of major commodity associations who violate orders from the competent authority or the association's rules by concealing and not reporting the commodities they have in stock shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than one year and not more than five years, and may also be fined not more than 30,000 yuan. It is heard that the Ministry of Industry and Commerce is currently studying the registration regulations, and once the review is completed, the National Government will issue a decree for public announcement.

### Brief News

The Shanghai Office of the Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales Management Office of the Ministry of Food has recently received an order from the Ministry to investigate the black market prices of various items from January to April for review. The office has distributed orders to the various food industry associations to prepare tables and submit them to the Ministry of Food for review.

The Nanshi Chamber of Commerce is taking measures to protect the interests of the business community and strengthen the power of the wartime associations. In addition to urging businesses that have not yet joined trade associations to quickly join, it has also sent letters to various trade associations in the city to request their articles of association, or to have each trade association designate a member in Nanshi to be contacted for application to join each trade association. Currently, the spring silkworms in Zhejiang Province have passed their major sleep stage and are about to spin cocoons. The cocoon market is expected to open in about twenty days. Due to later hatching in Jiangsu Province, the market will open at the end of the month. Silk factories in Shanghai, Wuxi, Jiaxing, and other places have already repaired their silk reeling machines and will resume reeling silk after the spring cocoons come onto the market. However, it is heard that the output of spring cocoons in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this spring will inevitably be less than before the war due to the conversion of mulberry fields to other agricultural products.

The New New Co., Ltd. held a shareholders' meeting at the Green Treasure Theater yesterday morning at 10 o'clock, chaired by Mr. Jin Zongcheng. In addition to reporting on the business situation, the meeting also discussed the distribution of this year's profits, resolving to distribute a dividend of 8% and a bonus of 1.1%, and setting May 15th as the date for distribution. The meeting also discussed the increase in capital, resolving to increase the total capital from 3.52 million yuan to 16 million yuan, and to begin the process of subscribing for shares on the 15th of this month.

### Mr. Gu's Sorrow

— Shi Ting

It was raining, a gloomy winter. Although it had been light for quite some time, the light filtering into the small house was still extremely dim. The children, fast asleep in the corner, were intermittently snoring. The air was thick with water vapor, mixed with the odor of feet, the smell of urine, and the heat radiating from the bedding.

At this moment, our protagonist, Mr. Gu, had just taken out a bowl and dipped it twice into a pot with a lead ladle when he suddenly realized it was completely empty. He couldn't help but feel slightly annoyed and muttered a quiet curse, "Damn it!" Then, as if struck by inspiration, thoughts flooded his mind: "If only I had five or six dan of rice stored at home..."

Not cooking porridge in the morning wasn't a one- or two-day occurrence, but he never got used to it... Now, after hesitating for a while, he picked up a small clock, exposing it to the faint light. It was already ten past nine. Maybe he should go buy some baked flatbread to eat!

Outside, the wind was howling fiercely, and the noise of people was even more chaotic. Waves of shouting and the sound of the wind shook the doors and windows of the small house. This sound could not but evoke a sense of intimacy in him, possessing great magic. He was gradually captivated by it. He listened carefully, distinguishing the sounds – it was the clamor of people vying to write down numbers… Then, a burst of intense jostling erupted, and suddenly, the back door of the small house burst open, followed by a string of his wife's scolding.

"The Bodhisattva truly ought to..." Opening the rice bag covered with purple handprints while wiping the soles of her shoes on the floor, "No umbrella, no galoshes, soaked in the rain... I must have committed sins in my past life to live such a life!"

The husband stared blankly at her rain-soaked, tangled hair plastered to her face, feeling a heaviness in his heart. He couldn't find words to comfort her for a moment. "What?!"

"Otherwise, he'd be serving you!" Her fiery anger flared at him.

"Don't take it out on me!... I'm asking you, is that old man across the way in? Go buy me some baked flatbread!" He fumbled, tossing her five jiao, a torn banknote.

"Hmmph!" This only fanned the flames of her anger even more. "Don't put on such airs! I'm not a servant girl. Squeezing rice, grinding flour, cooking meals... Now, even buying a piece of baked flatbread, I have to do it. Can't your feet move? Do they hurt? Are they swollen?"

"I'm telling you, I'm not wrong!" This time he became anxious, beginning to mutter incoherently. "Our family will never get better. Harmony brings wealth! But what about us? Arguing and fighting all day long..."

"Harmony!" his wife said sarcastically, a scornful smile appearing on her face. "Treating people like servants is harmony!" She spat.

"..." He mumbled a string of words, unable to think of a suitable retort. His heart was in turmoil, like boiling water in a teapot surging with angry waves. Yet, it was empty, unable to find anything. Finally, with a long sigh, he stepped out of the dark little house—his hunched back silhouette flickering.

Having reached the back door, he hesitated again. Outside, heavy rain was pouring down, and the water spout on the side was dripping loudly. The water flow was rapid, creating a forceful impact.

"I certainly need a coat; it's so cold!" Leaning against the door frame, he gazed at the trees lining the lane—the howling northwest wind violently shaking them, leaving their trunks bare. He involuntarily shivered and began to yearn for his coat, filled with endless emotion...

It was only four months ago when, by the machinations of some devil, a strange idea struck him and found a confidante. It seized his heart, holding on tightly and refusing to let go.

"Come... tell me, if I hide the coat in a trunk, will it produce money?" One evening, he called his wife over, his eyes gleaming strangely. He traced patterns on the table with his finger and asked:

"Hmm!" She stared blankly at his face. Why would her husband ask her such a strange question? How could a coat produce banknotes? What a joke!

"Then, will large copper coins produce small copper coins?" He drew two circles on the table, a small one close to a big one.

"..." His wife was stunned by his question.

"I'm telling you, do you understand hoarding goods?" Thus, he began to elaborate on the new theory recently incorporated into his life philosophy. Under the dim yellow light, a smile appeared on the corner of his mouth for the first time. Although it was still a bitter smile, it radiated immense ambition and hope! "Those who understand the times are exceptional individuals. In this day and age, muddleheadedness won't lead to success… A coat hidden in a trunk won't produce money, but if you exchange it for money to use as capital – after all, banks allow us to take out loans – and buy goods to hoard in the warehouse, in a few days, it will produce small copper coins... In short, I've decided to sell the coat! When winter comes and we need to wear it, we'll have already made money and can buy a new one!"

His wife was completely conquered by his grand theory. Initially, she listened quietly, allowing his theory and hope to gallop through her heart. Then, her own hopes began to stir and throb. Finally, she joined the charge into the vast plain: "But a coat can fetch five or six hundred, at most. Let's sell that big fur robe too! Anyway, with money, we can buy a new one!"

"In that case, you have to promise me!" She turned around, wiping the grime of coal dust off her face with a black hand, intending to make coal balls. Suddenly she remembered, she earnestly asked: "After we get the money, buy me a pair of galoshes. When it rains, my broken leather shoes always leak!"

"Ha..." The husband slammed his hand on the table and laughed loudly: "Why buy galoshes? I'll buy you a pair of leather shoes to wear as you please!"

Having made the decision, he sold the coat and fur robe to the director of the storage department, earning a thousand odd dollars. After much hardship, he persuaded the manager to agree to a two-thousand dollar loan! Thus, a consignment of white Vaseline was moved into the warehouse.

Reality is a cunning fox. As speculation soared, Mr. Gu's heart bloomed with flowers of hope. At that time, who would have guessed that the Pacific War would break out? A shocking storm swept through Shanghai, destroying the blooming flowers. Rumors flew through the streets, that the bank's warehouse had confiscated a lot of mercury, claiming it was military supplies, and that several consignments of Vaseline had been seized, also claiming it was military supplies.

"Just when we got our hands on it, such bad luck had to happen. Others eat the white of the belly, we can't even get the duck's ass!" Mr. Gu sighed and lamented, sinking into a dark abyss. He used all his skills, squeezing into circles of people he never approached, trying to gather information, desperately planning...

Thinking of this, as if grasping a strong root, he suddenly straightened his body, heading towards the house. The back door slammed shut, showing that this foundation was extremely solid.

"You're a servant! You complain all day! But what am I?" He stood tall at the doorway, speaking mournfully into the darkness, "I toil like a bull or a horse all day long, and for whose sake? I sold my coat, wearing only a thin silk robe, and for whose sake?..."

His wife, sitting on the chamber pot, leaned forward, staring at him with wide eyes—completely bewildered.

"I suffered so much for that consignment of Vaseline..."

"There you go again; go look in the mirror. Your eyes are already sunken, and your complexion looks terribly pale! Why do you always torture yourself! You should relax; wealth and life are linked..." This time, his wife suddenly changed her tone, pulling up her trousers and patting his shoulder to comfort him.

"Wealth and life are linked. Now we're going to lose our lives! Who can I turn to for a thousand dollars?!" His tone changed to a sob.

"Don't worry, the heavens and the Bodhisattva won't mistreat good-hearted people. So many people are hoarding goods, why would they pick on you? When the boat reaches the bridge, it will naturally straighten. There will be a way in the future!" His wife said softly, suddenly remembering something. She glanced at the small clock and exclaimed, "Oh dear! It's already half past nine! They must be writing down numbers now. You need to go to the office!"

"No... it's raining so hard; I'll wait a while!"

"I think you should borrow an umbrella from Grandma next door!" His wife took his arm, leading him out. "I'll accompany you to the tram stop, and I can buy some baked flatbread and squeeze rice along the way!"

Mr. Gu dragged his heavy steps towards the entrance of the office. He grasped the door handle, slowly pushing it open, as if the door was made of iron and required immense strength to open. He listlessly stared at the door, the "Document Section" sign hanging on it swinging, as if mockingly teasing him, laughing at his difficult fate.

"Who do we have here! It's the 'Coat Seller.' What's this, signing in last on the list today!" It was Section Clerk Fan's deep, coarse voice. He leaned against the corner of the writing desk, surrounded by five or six people, discussing some nonsense.

"Nothing much... it's raining." His voice was low, as if stifled.

"Mr. Gu! Your shoulders are wet; did it soak through?" Director Yang asked.

"I'm wearing a silk robe, Director, it won't soak through." Mr. Gu stood still, his tone and attitude completely deferential. After speaking, he carefully weighed his words.

He sat down at his own seat, aimlessly pulling out drawers, wetting his writing brush, at a loss for what to do... He yawned, bent over, and directed his gaze out the window. Above, a gray sky, and raindrops falling rapidly. On the road, four or five puddles, fleeting bubbles - how boring. Thus, he slumped back into his chair.

A series of whispers, mixed with drawn-out chuckles.

"Any news? Did you get ahold of Mr. Yuan?" Storage Section Chief Wu came over and stood behind him, asking.

"Oh! Chief Wu... you're joking," he turned around, whispering softly. The familiar coat flaunted before his eyes, piercing his heart.

"He gave you a big 'hamski,' didn't he? That's how he answered you. Can you tell us about it?" Someone with a clownish face refused to let him go.

"Ha..." ignited a burst of laughter, echoing through the room...

People always seem to enjoy remembering their neighbors' misfortunes. It was only two weeks ago when rumors were spreading that the warehouse was going to be inspected. Colleagues gathered in groups.

"I have a way; we just need to ask our old Mr. Yuan to go and speak a few words!" Mr. Gu lowered his buzzing voice, speaking with an assured tone.

"Why would he run errands for you for nothing? You've got a good plan." People disregarded his opinion, blowing their noses and twisting their mouths.

"We can send him a Jinhua ham, couldn't we?" After pondering for a moment, he spoke up boldly. A Jinhua ham was a heavy gift. Beads of sweat appeared on his forehead. He wondered: would others think the gift was too heavy and ridicule him? According to his original idea, he should have sent a basket of oranges.

"Ha... You want to ask the old man to make a trip for a consignment of Vaseline? You're giving him your entire fortune. At most, you'll just get a cold shoulder! A ham..." The laughter swelled like a wave... infecting everyone.

Now, the laughter rose again! He couldn't help but shudder!

"Malicious thoughts!" Strong jealousy stirred up his heart, and he felt an irresistible impulse within. That consignment of Vaseline was his life, not just worth a few thousand dollars. He had to get that consignment of Vaseline back no matter what, but how could he do it? People were so indifferent, so cruel; no one would pity this small, weak animal. Should he kowtow and beg? Heaven and earth would always be indifferent, indifferent… His world was beginning to shatter and collapse. The emptiness within him expanded infinitely... dissolving his entire being.

"Let me tell you!" Director Yang stood before him like a judge, "The warehouse has been unsealed! But don't get excited!..."

However, he had already jumped up suddenly. A shudder! Something welled up in his throat as if he was about to vomit, his heart about to burst out!

"Unsealed! Really?"

"Take it easy, dozens of consignments of white Vaseline have been moved out!"

"Then, what about mine? Where is it now?"

"It's been discarded somewhere, this is military supplies!" The judge proclaimed his sentence.

"..." He widened his bloodshot eyes, staring at the fat face opposite him. He simply couldn't understand what the sound coming from that big mouth meant.

"Just now, Director Liang asked me to inform you: after you come in, immediately go down to the bank. You have two days to clear the loan!" A large hand patted his shoulder, then swayed away, leaving behind a staggering figure...

Night, the rain drizzling...

The water spout moaned softly, a lonely moan...

The cold wind blowing from the northwest galloped through the air, the sharp corners of tall buildings scraped its wings, provoking angry roars.

These days were filled only with tears, sighs... tears, sighs...

Mr. Gu had just returned from outside, standing blankly in the middle of the small house, his comb drooping like a defeated rooster.

"What did Uncle say? Why are you so silent?" His wife stopped husking corn, asking.

"Only agreed to one thousand." The water droplets hanging on his tangled hair shimmered and fell, he let the rainwater slowly drip into his crooked mouth.

"Interest?"

"Three percent!" He spat out the two words bitterly. Then he resolutely walked to the small bed, knelt down, and pulled out the trunk. Rifling through it...

"What, you're planning to..." His wife stroked two cotton padded jackets: reluctant to part with them: "Aren't they still pretty good? I still want to wear them in the spring!"

"Do you want to live!" The husband rudely snatched the clothes over, "The manager said firmly that if I don't clear the debt in two days, I'll be fired!"

He mumbled and left! The sound of footsteps, stirring the soul, echoed!

"Clothes..." His wife's hoarse voice.

"What's the matter?" A look of angry and pleading shot over: "Why are you crying?"

"I'm saying, let's cut out the 'rice' in the future too! Just two meals of corn porridge! In this situation..."

"..." Silently shedding tears, but immediately turned around, clutching the clothes and left!

His wife followed, crying; she stared at his weak, hunched back! --Farther away! Blurred! Devoured by darkness! The dense rain curtain covered her eyes.

The wind roared, heavy rain pouring down, from the small house the children's sleep talk: "Bodhisattva! Where is the Bodhisattva? Mama! I'm unhappy..."

### Hope

— Lu Yang

Don't allow myself to be in my prime,

Life... ravages my youth,

Facing...

My own... face has weathered.

Exploring... the way forward,

A small boat,

...

Not... not...

Work cannot ignite the fire of my life,

Pain corrodes my...

Time drives my life,

Towards the... entrance of death.

Gathering my remaining strength,

Stirring up a mere... of life,

Asking the boatman on the river,

Where is the source of hope?

### The Popularization and Vernacular Nature of Poetry

— Dongfang

Having read Mr. Hu Mingyang's "Trends in New Poetry," which discusses the lack of development in new poetry, one of the main reasons being its lack of popularization, this is an undeniable fact.

To make new poetry universally developed, its language and writing must be as popular as possible. Poetry is learned and refined from the language of the masses. In the past, every great poet was forged and washed in the public. Therefore, a great poet is also a poet of the masses. Poetry is fundamentally for the masses, not just for a small number of scholars and literati. Therefore, it should return to the original path of poetry, which is to give poetry to the masses, convey the "heartfelt voice" of the masses, so that everyone can read and understand it, and finally spread it to every corner of the public, scattered into the hearts of every citizen.

What has Chinese new poetry done in the past twenty-odd years? Just having broken away from the five- and seven-character ancient poems, some jumped into writing sonnets and sestinas. Some advocated free verse and immediately entered the realm of writing obscure, difficult poetry. The biggest shortcoming of Chinese new poetry is the lack of popular language and writing, making it so difficult to understand, frightening people, or so bad that everyone dislikes it. There is no one willing to boldly, frankly, and candidly use popular language. Because the habit of elegance still persists, they end up playing with words. This is one of the biggest problems of Chinese new poetry.

The greatest contribution of the Russian poet Pushkin to his national literature was the use of the vulgar language of the Russian people in his poetry. This most vulgar language, after being selected and recorded by the poet, became a more refined language, and every person felt a deep interest and impression in the poems written in this language. Because of this one achievement, he became the father of Russian literature. The poets of the Renaissance were the same, and the poet Qu Yuan also used local language to write poetry.

Tolstoy once said that he was never satisfied with the performances of the music academy, but one time he happened to hear a peasant singing a folk song passing by his window, which moved him greatly. Gorky also wrote about the same experience. Every art form obtains materials from the public to enrich itself, especially music and poetry. Music takes phrases, while poetry takes language. The only language that is beautiful, refined, and can be used as poetry is the dialect. The resonance of sounds and the depth of content are unique to local languages. Often, when we hear a sentence in a local language, we immediately feel a three-dimensional, transparent power. However, many poets lightly overlook this.

Advocating dialect poetry can make Chinese new poetry spread to every corner. The recitation of poetry is the only way to put poetry on the right path. However, this recitation must be of dialect poetry, otherwise, everyone will not understand it. This loses the meaning of recitation. Therefore, we should not only not be afraid of writing poetry that is popular and easy to understand, but also not be afraid of it being translated into vulgar dialects. Thoroughly develop dialect poetry, local language poetry, until a national common language is produced due to communication, at which time, the poetry written by poets, Chinese new poetry, will be accepted by a wider audience.

Therefore, we must first translate national language poems into dialect poems, translated into Shanghai dialect, Nanjing dialect, Cantonese, Tianjin dialect, Hunan dialect, Hakka dialect, and other local dialect poems. Not only should we translate national language poems into dialect poems, but we must also thoroughly apply local languages, mix into the people, record local languages, select those refined languages, and write them down to create a good poem. We do not hope to be a creator of poetry, but only to be a recorder of poetry. That is to say, no poet dares to say that he can create, he is only recording. And from another perspective, the poetry of language recorded after being selected by the poet's mind is also the poet's great creation!
