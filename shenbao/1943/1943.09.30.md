### Securities Exchange Resumes Operations

The Chinese Securities Exchange held its reopening ceremony yesterday. It is said that the opening of trading is not far off. From now on, idle social capital will have a legitimate outlet, and the circulation of industrial securities will become smoother. The exchange directly helps the development of domestic enterprises and indirectly promotes national economic construction. The importance of its resumption of operations is self-evident.

The hardship of our people's livelihood is due to the underdeveloped domestic industries. The reason why industries cannot develop is the lack of capital, which seems to have become a universally recognized reason. But does China really lack capital? If we look at the capital market situation in Shanghai before the "Twenty-Sixth Year Incident," it is not the case. Every time the Public Works Bureau issued municipal bonds or foreign public utility companies issued company bonds, they were fully subscribed in less than five minutes, and most of the subscribers were Chinese. Furthermore, most of the British and American real estate companies in Shanghai were established by sucking the blood and sweat of the Chinese people. On the other hand, when starting a purely Chinese-funded enterprise or a Chinese joint-stock company needing to increase capital or issue corporate bonds, the situation is very different. Even if the promoters speak eloquently and persuasively, the investors only contribute a small amount out of consideration for their relationship. We have studied the psychology of general investors in Shanghai. Their reasons are: First, purely Chinese-funded enterprises do not receive legal protection, so there is no guarantee of investment returns, and even the capital may be completely sacrificed. Second, the Chinese stock market is still lacking. Once invested, it becomes stagnant. If there is an emergency, there is no way to turn it around. Even if one or two sellers are found, there is no public market price to rely on, and there is no way to investigate the asset content. It is inevitable to underestimate the value and suffer too much loss. It is better than foreign stocks, which can be circulated at any time and have a public market price to rely on.

According to the past situation, we cannot but admit that the above words have considerable reason. The law cannot guarantee, and stocks cannot circulate (at least not as easily as foreign stocks), which are indeed facts and the reasons why most people are reluctant to invest in Chinese stocks. Since we have identified the source of the problem, we should prescribe the right medicine. The first point is the responsibility of the government. We hope that the government recognizes the importance of national economic revitalization and should not only fulfill its responsibility to protect domestic industries legally but also further encourage and support them. The second point is the responsibility of the securities exchange. In the past, the securities exchange mainly traded various national securities, but now it is hoped that the focus will shift to industrial securities.

The role of the securities exchange, on the positive side, is to promote investment and promote the development of domestic enterprises. On the negative side, it can also encourage speculation. After the reopening of the securities exchange, it is stipulated that only spot transactions will be made and futures transactions will be stopped, which shows that the government authorities and the board of directors of the exchange have long paid attention to preventing speculation. However, stopping futures trading cannot completely eliminate speculation. It also relies on the government authorities, the dispatched inspectors, and the board of directors to closely monitor and prevent problems before they occur.

Secondly, what should be paid attention to is the qualification of listed stocks. Anyone familiar with the situation of Chinese stocks in Shanghai knows that the more hollow the content of the company, the more it will exaggerate and publicize it extensively. We advocate that the examination of the qualifications of listed stocks should be extremely strict in the future. Not only should the company's assets be thoroughly investigated and valued by experts, but also the company's business management should be included in the scope of examination standards. Because even if a business has extremely solid assets, if the business has no direction and the management is improper, the future of the business still has little hope of success and more chances of failure. Such a business is fundamentally not worth supporting. At least, one should not allow those who have not been deceived to be deceived again. There are also many factories whose equipment is crude and simple, and whose technology is stagnant. Their existence is only due to temporary opportunities. When the war ends and the world economy returns to normal, they will eventually be eliminated. Strictly speaking, their stocks should not be allowed to be listed and circulated. Because from the government's standpoint, it should not only use the capital market to guide people to invest in legitimate ways, but also use this to urge domestic industries to become more economically rational.

When examining the qualifications of listed stocks, another point that should be paid attention to is the issue of cross-shareholding. For example, Company A invests a certain amount of money in Company B, and at the same time, Company B also invests a certain amount of money in Company A. If a problem occurs in one place with this kind of fictitious method, the other place will be affected. We suggest that this kind of fictitious method should be strictly prohibited. The stocks of companies with this kind of situation should not be registered until the shares are adjusted and the funds are verified after examination.

The fact that Chinese stocks have become the target of people's investment is only a matter of the recent year. Of course, this is due to the change in people's psychology, knowing that if the Chinese economy is to have a way out, it must start with revitalizing Chinese industries. However, the strict control of foreign stock trading and the interruption of foreign stock sources are also related. How can we completely eliminate foreign stock trading from the Chinese market depends entirely on the efforts of the securities exchange? If the stocks traded on the securities exchange can gain the trust of investors, then it is not difficult to exclude foreign stocks from the Chinese market. Because at present, the Chinese industrial sector needs a lot of funds, and the interest rates are relatively generous, so there is no need to pursue foreign stocks any more. In the past, because of the failure of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, China had no shipping industry for decades; because of the failure of the Hanyeping Iron and Coal Company, China had no heavy industry for decades. Today, the Chinese capital market is just sprouting. Whether it can develop is too important for the future of Chinese industries. It is not just a matter for the securities exchange itself. We hope that the exchange authorities and the members of the review committee who are responsible for reviewing the listed stocks must recognize everyone's responsibility for the future of the country and the nation.

Finally, one more point that the securities exchange authorities should pay attention to is the issue of stock prices. The recent situation of various stocks rising and falling sharply makes genuine investors feel like they are in a fog. This phenomenon should be corrected as soon as possible. Of course, there is no reason for stock prices to remain unchanged, but they cannot rise and fall too sharply. Otherwise, it will only be used by speculators, and genuine investors will be deterred. The method of determining stock prices by the Japanese Securities Exchange is that the exchange can buy or sell securities to regulate the market price with the permission of the Ministry of Finance. Whether we can also adopt this method to balance the supply and demand of stocks and stabilize stock prices, it seems that it is also worth studying in advance. Soon, the securities will be traded. Regarding the evaluation of the prices of various stocks, we require the exchange to solve this problem with scientific methods and a fair attitude, and to be prepared to answer questions raised by all parties at any time. Do not compromise the facts, have no criteria, or evaluate at will based on the interests of a few people, resulting in the loss of social trust in the exchange.

In summary, there are three points that the exchange should pay attention to after resuming operations: Prevent speculation and manipulation, strictly review the qualifications of listed stocks, and rationalize stock values and prevent drastic fluctuations. This is the hope of the society for the exchange, and it is also the exchange.

### Japanese Army and Navy Aircraft Bombard Western Australian Coast, Exterminate Truscott Airfield Base

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 29th telegram: The enemy continues to launch a general counter-offensive against Japan in the South Pacific. While fighting in East New Guinea and the Solomon Islands, they are also preparing to establish a base in the Truscott area on the east coast of the Indian Ocean, about 500 kilometers west of Darwin, as the only forward base for the East Indies. After learning of this attempt, the Japanese Air Force also made all preparations to destroy it in one fell swoop. On the 27th, several large squadrons of army and navy aircraft jointly launched an attack. On that day, army and navy aircraft flew across a certain sea and reached the Torresdale airfield on the west coast of Australia. They carried out low-altitude bombing and completely destroyed the runway, barracks, enemy aircraft, and all other military facilities of the enemy airfield. At the same time, a fuel depot hidden in the forest near the airfield was also completely destroyed. The enemy's base, which had been painstakingly built over a long period of a year, was instantly turned into ashes. After reaping great results, all Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, 29th telegram: The Japanese Air Force attacked the Torresdale airfield near Albert Point, about 500 kilometers southwest of Darwin Port, Australia, at 9:30 am on the 27th, destroying the fuel and ammunition storage sites near the airfield. Two large fires broke out, and the airfield's ancillary facilities were completely destroyed. Other fires also broke out near the airfield. All Japanese aircraft have returned safely.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) A certain Japanese base in the Southwest Pacific, 29th telegram: On the night of the 27th, the Japanese Navy's seaplane squadron attacked the enemy positions at the southeastern end of Bielrabiera and Arundel Island. They braved enemy anti-aircraft fire and bombed fiercely, returning to base safely.

### Japanese "Ryusei" Aircraft Bombard Port Moresby, Australian Forces in New Guinea Suffer Setback

A certain Japanese base in the South, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) In the New Guinea area, Japanese army aircraft attacked the enemy airfields of Port Moresby and Fabuba on the 20th. It is reported that this Japanese aircraft squadron was composed of the new heavy bomber "Ryusei No. 1," and there was no fighter escort. They carried out a brave bombing. The details of the battle on that day have been reported by two petty officers who returned to the Japanese base. The main points are recorded as follows: On that day, it was raining suddenly and the weather was bad. However, after the order to attack the enemy base in Port Moresby was issued, the "Ryusei" unit took off from somewhere in the morning and proceeded towards the destination. The brave aviation fighters had completely disregarded life and death. At a certain time in the morning, they arrived over Port Moresby. The first shell of the enemy's anti-aircraft guns exploded in front of the squadron, followed by the sound of enemy shells exploding in the rear or west. The enemy's anti-aircraft guns were desperately firing. However, the Japanese aircraft were still able to maintain the squadron formation, brave the enemy's artillery fire, and accurately bomb important military facilities, causing them to catch fire. Under the fierce power of the "Ryusei" unit, a great chaos was revealed. After suffering heavy losses, the enemy had little strength to engage in fighter combat. The Japanese aircraft squadron returned victoriously. They also attacked the enemy airfield in Fabuba, destroying four enemy aircraft on the ground and severely damaging other facilities. There were no enemy fighters to engage here either. The enemy lost their courage to fight when they saw the "Ryusei" squadron approaching, because the "Ryusei" No. had sharp gun seats installed at the rear, so no matter how the enemy fighters attacked, they would be defeated. On that day, the entire "Ryusei" unit returned to base. Also, a Japanese light bomber squadron followed the "Ryusei" squadron and bombed the enemy airfield in Fabuba at 3:20 am. This surprise attack caught the enemy by surprise. When our light bombers arrived at the destination, it was just when the enemy fighters were preparing to take off and attack the "Ryusei" squadron, and the airfield was like daytime because of the night lights. The Japanese aircraft destroyed the enemy airfield in one fell swoop, causing fires everywhere and achieving great results. All aircraft then leisurely returned to base.

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telegram from New Golden Mountain, the anti-axis side also admitted that the Japanese military operations on the New Guinea front have gradually strengthened recently. The South Pacific anti-axis military headquarters announced on the 28th that the Australian army marching south towards Finshafen had been blocked due to fierce counterattacks by the Japanese army. The resistance of the Japanese army in that area was quite strong, and the anti-axis army attacking from three directions was frustrated and blocked.

### Japanese Colonel Kurihara Delivered a Speech Yesterday

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a telephone call from Osaka, Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, director of the Public Relations Department of the Japanese Naval Dispatch Department, gave a speech at the Osaka Nakanoshima Central Public Hall on the night of the 29th, entitled "The Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War." The main points are as follows: The Greater East Asia War has pacified the southern regions. The Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere is a treasure trove. With this treasure trove, it can become the world's largest power. The defense and construction of Greater East Asia will become more and more advantageous to us as time goes by. The desperate counterattacks of Britain and the United States are nothing more than a concern about this point. Supply power and transportation power can determine the current South Pacific war situation. It is not necessary for supply power to be equal to the production volume of the United States. We can win by only producing the amount required by the General Staff Headquarters. Our defense against submarines is gradually strengthening. In July and August, a total of 13 submarines were sunk. The production capacity of the United States is increasing, but there is also a certain limit. During the process of increasing its production capacity, we will crush the US military's counterattack attempts. Then, the time for us to counterattack will come.

### German Defenses Consolidated on the East Coast of the Adriatic Sea, Italian Rebels Annihilated

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) German authorities announced on the 28th on the defensive measures taken by the German army in the occupied areas of Corfu and the Adriatic coast as follows: The various measures taken by the German army to stabilize the Adriatic Sea have achieved great success in recent days. The General Command has taken rapid and effective measures in the islands of Corfu, which are now under German control, and in Dalmatia, northeastern Italy, and other places on the east coast of the Adriatic Sea. The Italian army under Patrio, stationed on the islands of Corfu, resisted the German landing operation, but the German army overwhelmed it immediately after landing. The remaining part also surrendered in the north of the island. By occupying the islands of Corfu, the German army has secured the Strait of Otranto. The city and port of Split, formerly belonging to Yugoslavia, have also been occupied by the German army. Many bandits who joined Patrio's army have been annihilated, and the main force of Patrio's army, which attempted to escape to the eastern mountainous area, has also been surrounded and annihilated. The mopping-up operation by the German army in Dalmatia and Italian Croatia near the former Austrian Reibach has been strengthened, and powerful units of the Patrio army and bandit groups have been surrounded and defeated.

### German Army in Southern Italy Adopts Elastic Defense Strategy

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) According to a report from Haitong News Agency: On the southern Italian front, the German army is still in a dominant position. In the past two years, the anti-axis army has not known when and where the war will break out, only in the western sea 30 to 40 kilometers away. The German front line has remained largely unchanged. On the remaining lines to the Adriatic coast, General Kesselring deliberately made the war tend to be fluid. The fast German rearguard serves as a shield for the advance of the British Eighth Army, from the northwest to the south along the line of Bari, Potenza, Altamura, and its eastern part slightly curves to the north and northwest, placing the entire Foggia Plain outside of it. Therefore, the British Eighth Army is constantly being forced to reorganize, unable to occupy a stronghold in order to concentrate infantry and artillery for a large-scale offensive. As a result, the right wing of the last Eighth Army in the south is now in the far north, while its center and left wing have fallen behind. This is the situation that the British side is most unwilling to see, and the German General Headquarters has deliberately created. Although the enemy may have known that the Salerno area is the key to the front line, the German elastic defense line is smoothly turning north and northwest, but it still does not know whether the shift of the German front line has stopped or will continue to shift. Since the enemy has failed to predict the future development in three-quarters of the southern Italian battlefield, it is increasing pressure again in the remaining one-quarter of the battlefield, namely the Salerno area. The enemy cannot stop the German army's rotation, so it is trying to destroy the key to this rotation. This is why the British and American armies are attacking north of Salerno and in the Besantini Mountains. This offensive has been expanding since the previous day, but there is not much achievement to speak of. As for the central and military units, there are only occasional small encounters. This situation is of most interest to military strategists.

### New Italian Ambassador to Germany, Anfuso, Arrives

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency telegram) Prime Minister Mussolini appointed Anfuso as the Italian Ambassador to Germany. Yesterday, Mr. Anfuso arrived in Berlin by plane. The German Foreign Minister sent the head of the Foreign Ministry to represent the welcome. Anfuso is currently the Minister to Hungary and is one of Italy's most capable diplomats. He has also gained the special favor of Mussolini and has participated in many meetings between Germany and Italy. Since Mussolini's rescue, Anbi has expressed his willingness to be directed. Former Ambassador Alfieri participated in the Fascist Congress held on July 25 and voted against Mussolini. He is still in Italy. However, General Beliani, appointed by Patrio as Ambassador to Germany, has never been published by Germany.

### Battles on Both Sides of the Dnieper River; German Troops Prepare Winter Defenses

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – News received here last night from the German warfront states that fighting continues on the central eastern bank of the Dnieper River and in a small part of the western bank. The fighting on the western bank is developing due to the crossing of a small number of Soviet troops, and the trend is towards further progress. Soviet forces east of Zhangbo River have renewed their offensive against the German bridgehead, but without any success. Soviet forces massed powerful troops on Sunday, attempting to break through east and southeast of 波羅齊. Although the Soviets used reinforcements newly arrived at the front, their offensive was repelled. A certain Soviet unit attempted to break through the German lines, but the gap has been filled, and the main lines have been re-established. On the central front, the Soviets launched fierce attacks, attempting to disrupt German troop movements, so defensive battles continue fiercely. There are only localized battles in the 古班 bridge area. Soviet transport ships were sunk by the German navy, totaling approximately 2,100 tons.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) – A Reuter's dispatch reports that military correspondent Setoris states that the Soviet attempts to repel German forces on the northern and southern flanks of the Zhangbo River front are becoming increasingly obvious. The Soviets are fighting with fresh troops southwest and west of Smolensk, attempting to break through the overall German lines towards Mogilev, but were repelled after fierce fighting. Soviet concentrated attacks on German positions east of 波 and Melitopol were also repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German special reserve troops fought tenaciously. In recent days, the Soviets have failed to achieve their goal of breaking through the German lines between Crimea and the lower Dnieper River. The Dnieper River battle, from Pripyat to the river bend, has largely remained unchanged. The Soviet offensive against the German bridgehead at the river bend has not yet succeeded. Most of the paratroopers who landed west of the Dnieper River over the weekend have been annihilated. The Soviets have been unable to reinforce the bridgehead pioneers who crossed the river, and the positions of the small enemy units on all four banks have been increasingly reduced after the German counterattacks the day before. Only near the mouth of the Pripyat River can the Soviet forces, with a larger number of troops, still stand, but in the swampy areas, there is little possibility of progress.

### Turkey Determined to Safeguard Sovereignty and Territorial Integrity: President İsmet İnönü’s Statement

Ankara, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuter’s dispatch: During his tour of Eastern Anatolia, Turkish President İsmet İnönü delivered a speech to the public in Erzurum, urging them to strive for self-defense with their existing spirit. The President said in his speech in Vilayet, on the Turkish-Soviet border, that Erzurum is an important town in Turkey's eastern frontier and will always be the center of Turkish culture and work. The people of the whole country should do their best to protect it, and so on. Political figures believe this is a statement of Turkey's determination to safeguard its sovereignty and territorial integrity.

### Mussolini’s Speech Elucidates National Policy Principles; New Constitution Being Drafted

Rome, 28th (Central News Agency) – At the first cabinet meeting of the new Italian cabinet held here today, Prime Minister Mussolini announced that Italian Fascism and the government are engaged in drafting Italy's new constitution. Mussolini's brief announcement was broadcast by Rome Radio. There were two important measures at the cabinet meeting: one was to dissolve the Senate appointed by the former King Emmanuel, and the other was to approve the relocation of the government away from Rome to preserve the city's undefended status. The name of the new capital has not yet been announced, but it is said to be close to the military headquarters.

Rome, 29th (Central News Agency) – Mussolini, in his capacity as the leader of the Republican Fascist government, delivered a speech last night in Rome to the new cabinet, stating that the new Fascist Republic should seek unity in politics, and the federal administration should concentrate on social problems, and workers will be made responsible for administrative affairs and hold important positions. Italy is now at a critical juncture in its history. Before July 25th, Italy was a country, and its territory, except for the eastern part of Sicily, had not been invaded and occupied. The Italian flag was still flying in 和四嘉 and other places. Now, one-third of the country has been occupied by the enemy, and all Italian overseas positions have been evacuated. This is all due to harsh armistice conditions and cunning. Never before seen in history. The current principles of national policy of the Fascist Republican government are as follows: Fascist Italy will remain loyal to its alliance and continue to fight alongside the German army, doing so calmly, in order to restore Italy's political independence and its position in the world. Although the current situation is extremely serious, it is not hopeless. Work has now begun on reconstruction, and it is hoped that the newly appointed cabinet members will work together to serve the country practically.

### US Army Generals Hold Special Meeting to Review World War Situation

Buenos Aires, 29th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Washington: The US Army Department convened a special meeting of domestic front leaders on the 27th. During the meeting, Chief of Staff Marshall and other Army generals gave detailed information on the recent war situation. After the meeting, the main points of the reports of the three generals were published as follows: General 巴德森 said that the coming year will be the most dangerous period in American history. Although the United States has experienced various difficulties since the start of the war, the greatest difficulties are only now beginning. He recently inspected the front lines of the Pacific theater and asked General MacArthur, the Supreme Commander of the Anti-Axis Forces in the Southwest Pacific, what was most needed at the moment. He replied, "Only aircraft are essential," so he believes that a large number of aircraft must be transported to the front line as much as possible. Deputy Chief of Staff of the Army, General 马库维屈, said: Germany now seems to have shifted its aircraft production target from bombers to fighters, which indicates that Germany's combat goal has changed to defense. Germany's defensive posture will therefore become more advantageous. The Anti-Axis forces are determined to promote the progress of the battle, which will be the main cause of disaster. General 斯條古, the director of the Army Intelligence Department, said: Germany's labor force is not slightly weaker than it was four years ago, and the strength of the German army is three times that when it invaded Poland. In addition, Japan's resources are also quite abundant, the morale of the army and the general public have not wavered, and it occupies a geographically advantageous strategic position.

Montgomery Encounters Difficulties

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) – According to news from the British capital: Londoners all agree that Lord Mountbatten's Southeast Asia Command is encountering unprecedented difficulties. These people point out that the political disputes are centered on three themes: the Chongqing battlefield led by Chiang Kai-shek, the western Pacific battlefield led by MacArthur, and the internal situation in India. It is said that since Montgomery's headquarters was first established in New Delhi, India is naturally the basic base for the war against Japan. The most serious and complex situation Montgomery's command is encountering is the result of India's political and economic situation. Montgomery's task is to obtain supplies and manpower from India to launch an offensive, but India is now politically unstable and suffering from a major famine. Although India's political problems are handled by the newly appointed Viceroy Wavell, and the military problems are the responsibility of General Auchinleck, these are not Mountbatten's affairs, but it is difficult to launch a large-scale offensive without first considering the impact of these problems. It is said that Montgomery believes that if he wants to implement a planned offensive against the Japanese positions in Burma, he must first rebuild the Burma Road. In the past nine months, American engineers have supervised black Indian and Chongqing laborers to build the "Second Burma Road" for the use of the Anti-Axis forces. The road has now started from the northeast of India and is said to connect with the old Burma Road somewhere between Chongqing and Lashio. The road construction is very difficult, so the progress is very slow, and only a few meters of mud can be removed every day. Workers are often plagued by malaria and other tropical diseases, and are threatened by wind, rain, and landslides.

### General Situation of Japan's Wartime Economy; Resources and Finances Are More Than Adequate

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) – The current war can be said to be a war of materials and money, so Japan's economic strength during the Greater East Asia War is of great concern to the world. The following is a brief introduction to the general situation of Japan's economic fears: Japan's military expenditure in the Sino-Japanese War was 200 million yuan, and it increased several times in the Russo-Japanese War to 1.51 billion yuan. However, in the current Greater East Asia War, Japan's war expenditure has reached 470 billion yuan. In terms of Japan's financial resources, public debt income and borrowing accounted for 58.26% of the total amount in the Sino-Japanese War, 97.67% in the Russo-Japanese War, and 76.89% in the Greater East Asia War. However, the war expenditure of the Greater East Asia War was not based on foreign prices, but was planned entirely with domestic funds. The following is a comparison of Japan's national income with that of the United Kingdom and the United States. In 1942, Japan's national income was 45 billion yen, the United Kingdom's was 16 billion pounds, and the United States' was 117 billion US dollars. The military expenditure of Japan in the same year was 18 billion yen, the United Kingdom's was 4.5 billion pounds, and the United States' was 77 billion US dollars. The amount of the Japanese problem is relatively small. However, in terms of the ratio of national income to military expenditure, Japan is 40%, the United Kingdom is 60%, and the United States is 64%. It is obvious that Japan's national income has a surplus of 20% more than that of the United Kingdom and the United States. In terms of the tax revenue of each country, from 1943 to 1944, Japan's tax revenue was 8.6911 billion yuan, the United Kingdom's was 2.91 billion pounds, and the United States' was 91 billion US dollars. The burden per citizen in Japan was 118.30 yuan, in the United Kingdom it was 67 pounds (equivalent to 1,040.40 Japanese yen), and in the United States it was 317.80 US dollars (equivalent to 1,655.60 Japanese yen).

The burden per Japanese citizen

Only accounts for 11% of the burden of each British citizen and 7% of the burden of each American citizen. To sum up the above figures, although Japan's finances are smaller in scale than those of the United States, its resources are more than adequate. If Japan has fully utilized this point to exert its power, it has achieved brilliant results since the Greater East Asia War. On the other hand, the United Kingdom and the United States rely solely on huge numbers to control themselves, and increase the burden on their citizens. In particular, the taxpaying power of American citizens has reached its limit. Senator George, the chairman of the Senate Revenue Committee, explained the tax increase problem half a month ago, saying that the US government requires a tax increase of 12 billion US dollars this year, but in reality, it may be reduced by 3 billion to 5 billion US dollars, because the current income tax rate has reached a considerable height in the past, so it is difficult to increase it further. It is estimated that the total annual war expenditure for next year will reach 90 billion US dollars, a slight decrease from the 100 billion US dollars this year. This implies that the wartime finances of the United States have begun to show cracks.

Minister Lin's Speech

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch): To make the general public understand the significance of collecting radio broadcasting fees, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department gave a special speech, the text of which is recorded below: In addition to bearing the important mission of promoting government policies, the broadcasting industry also makes great contributions to the public's knowledge cultivation and spiritual nourishment. The development of this industry depends on the government's overall support and assistance, but even more so on the love and cooperation of compatriots across the country. The broadcasting industries of advanced countries mostly rely on radio listening fees for operation and development. Our friendly neighbor Japan has long implemented the collection of listening fees with remarkable results, and many other countries also have similar methods. Since the establishment of the China Broadcasting Association, China's broadcasting industry has relied on the cooperation of friendly Japan, and the foundation in terms of economic resources and management has been continuously established. However, there is still a regret that the collection of listening fees has not yet been implemented. In order to adapt to the needs of wartime broadcasting, and to promote the improvement of broadcasting equipment and programs, and the widespread availability of radio manufacturing and supply, the government should strengthen cooperation with friendly countries and promote the high-level development of the broadcasting industry. The people nationwide should deeply recognize the sacred mission of the broadcasting industry and enthusiastically support the government's broadcasting policies. The collection of listening fees is not only beneficial to the future of the broadcasting industry, but also of great significance in guaranteeing the legitimate broadcasting interests of the people nationwide. Recently, this department drafted the "Provisional Measures for Installing Wireless Radios for Listening to Broadcasts," which was submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation. According to the provisions of these provisional measures, anyone who registers a wireless radio must apply to the government for a permit and sign a listening agreement with the China Broadcasting Association, paying a monthly listening fee of ten yuan in national currency. However, for the convenience of implementation, starting from October 1st, collection will begin first in Nanjing and Shanghai. All matters related to radio installation permits, fee collection, and inspection will be entrusted to the China Broadcasting Association. Implementation in other areas will be postponed. From this day forward, the "Provisional Measures for Installing Wireless Radios for Listening to Broadcasts" promulgated by the Executive Yuan, this department's order announcing the effective date of these provisional measures, and the measures for entrusting the China Broadcasting Association to handle wireless radio installation permits and other matters will be published in various newspapers. All radio users in Beijing and Shanghai should pay attention to the matters to be handled, which are specified in the respective measures and orders. This matter concerns the promotion of the national broadcasting industry and the protection of the people's listening to broadcasts. The monthly cost to each individual is minimal, but by accumulating small amounts, the broadcasting equipment can be enriched, and the broadcasting programs can be improved. It is believed that the people will be happy to cooperate and contribute to the public good.

### Grain Control Committee to Purchase Rice; Implementation Begins Next Month; October Rice Rations Distributed by Original Agencies

Since the Grain Control Committee was actively prepared, the internal organization of one secretariat, four sections, four offices, and thirteen sub-sections has been fully completed. From October 1st, it can begin full-scale operations in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce. The committee's future work on grain control and purchase will be advanced step-by-step according to the established grain purchase plan. According to a Central News Agency reporter's investigation, the committee's work on purchasing rice will begin in early next month, purchased by the Rice Purchasing Trade Association composed of the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two special municipal districts of Nanjing and Shanghai, in preparation for the need for rice rations in November. As for the rice rations needed by the Shanghai urban area in October, more than 160,000 bags have already been purchased by the original grain management agencies and distributed to the first and other districts, as well as to the southwestern cotton cloth and other household rice rations. Whether the quantity of household rice will be increased is currently uncertain. In general, the problem of civilian food can be solved under the new system of rice and grain control. It is also understood that the joint operation of rice and grain cooperatives in various regions has ended since the 20th of this month. All files have been transferred to the Grain Control Committee for receipt.

Close Consideration of Purchase Funds

The Grain Control Committee, which is responsible by the Executive Yuan for promoting the new plan for the production and sales of rice and grain, has been publishing the "Essential Guidelines for the Establishment of Rice Purchase Trade Associations." Since the Ministry of Food and the Japanese military authorities have respectively issued statements expressing their support, rice merchants from the three provinces have been enthusiastically applying to participate in the conference. Concrete methods and implementation details are being carefully studied. As for the quantity of rice and grain purchased and the amount of funds, the attention paid to this is greater than to anything else. In particular, the price of rice and grain should be considered as necessary under the principle of maintaining the most appropriate standard. Various relevant plans are being carefully discussed with all parties by the Grain Control Committee. Regardless of whether there is any degree of determination, the timing of its implementation must still be thoroughly selected.

### After Air Raid Alerts Are Issued, Office Work Should Proceed as Usual; Employees Should Perform Their Duties and Not Leave Without Authorization

The Shanghai Municipal Government believes that the public's air defense installations and the development of skills have gradually become proficient. In order to further improve the city's air defense measures, it has specially ordered all bureaus, departments, and associations under its jurisdiction to continue to work as usual in their original locations after air raid alerts are issued during office hours. Each shall perform their duties and not leave their posts without authorization, and must wait until the air raid alert is lifted before they can leave work. All should take heed and not disregard this.

### Investigation in District One: Artesian Wells

Datong News Agency dispatch: In order to strengthen the necessary measures for air defense and firefighting, the Baojia offices in various Baojia districts in the First District have recently notified each Bao to submit detailed reports on the location, water flow, and installation style of each artesian well (or earth well) within the Bao within the recent period. It is reported by the Standing Bureau for statistics. According to a reporter's investigation, the Baojia offices have already handled this order and relayed the order to each Jia, and the Jia heads are actively investigating and reporting the artesian wells (or earth wells) in their respective Jia. The situation also applies to those belonging to private individuals, but the name and household number of the owner of the well must be noted so that the authorities can borrow it from them when necessary.

### Air Defense Training for Police Officers in District One

Datong News Agency dispatch: The six-day air defense training, lectures, and exercises of the First Police Bureau, which began on Monday, concluded its first part of the program yesterday (29th). The venue was inside the First Police Bureau. Starting today (30th), the first day of air defense exercises will begin at the Hongkou Fire Training Association. At 1:00 PM yesterday, the First Police Bureau gave those who attended the lectures the opportunity to ask questions about air defense issues, and at the same time summarized the latest air defense methods that were discussed in the previous two days. Mr. Ogawa, the director of air defense supervision, attended to answer various questions, so that the police officers could understand the various measures to be taken during emergency air defense periods.

### Rice Ration Coupons to Be Issued Today

Datong News Agency says that the rice ration coupons for the 48th period and the rice flour procurement materials can be issued today, and payments can be made tomorrow to exchange for warehouse receipts to pick up the rice, which can be sold within days. According to a Datong News Agency reporter, the rice rations for this period are still allocated by the Central China Rice and Grain Allocation Association.

### Black Market for Tickets to Ningbo Discovered; China Navigation Company Retakes Direct Sales

The Wansheng and Wanji ships of the China Navigation Company, which travel the Shanghai-Ningbo line, have had their tickets sold by travel agencies commissioned by the company. This has often led to various malpractices, and ship tickets have also appeared on the black market, causing difficulties for travelers. According to a Datong News Agency reporter's investigation, the China Navigation Company has now decided to directly sell first, second, and third class (i.e., large dining room cabins) tickets through the Shanghai branch starting tomorrow (1st). Fourth class (i.e., general cabins) tickets are sold at the ticket booth at No. 6, the Bund, in the company's First District. As for the transportation of goods, it will also be handled directly by the company's Shanghai branch.

### National Day Sports Performance; Schools in District One Hold Celebrations

### Welcoming the Return of Scholars' Representatives; The Great East Asia Literary Award; Pan Yuqie Has Been Elected

The Chinese representatives to the Second East Asia Scholars' Conference have returned to China and have made great contributions to the communication of Chinese and Japanese cultures and the creation of new East Asian cultures.

### The School for the Unfortunate - A Record of the Blind Children's School (3)

Admirable Life

The Blind Children's School resembles a military camp with its organization, discipline, and spirit; it also resembles a large family filled with the natural love between parents, children, siblings. The faculty and staff certainly regard each class of students as their own children, and the male and female students rely on the faculty and staff as their parents, elder brothers, and elder sisters. The founder, Dr. Fou Kwan-nga, passed away long ago, and the old principal and his capable assistant, Mr. and Mrs. Chuan Bu-kai, have now also left their positions, but their concern and care for the teachers and students of the school are probably even more earnest than before. The current principal, Wang Shu-shi, is a philanthropist enthusiastic about the education of the blind and deaf, and the vice-principal, He Zhi-zeng (Zi-jian), is an old "family member" who has served in the school for twenty-nine years. The half-blind Dean of Studies, Fan Fu-bao, has served for more than twenty years, and the talented blind music director, Chang Lie-qing, has also served for more than twenty-seven years. Others, such as Zheng Yi-ru and several blind teachers, have a service history of one or two decades and have made teaching and nurturing blind students into talented individuals their lifelong career. This is completely different from the high turnover rate of faculty and staff in general schools.

The good relationship between teachers and students is not only due to the length of time they spend together, but also to the understanding of each other's personalities. In ordinary schools, each grade or class often has dozens of students, and teachers often cannot know the names of all the students. The turnover rate is also high, so there is no talk of teacher-student affection. However, in the blind school, each class has at most ten students. Usually, boys and girls work and play in separate groups. The need for mutual reliance between teachers and students and among students is extremely high, and the understanding and recognition of each other is also more genuine. Not only in teaching but also in daily life, a new family is formed.

The Blind Children's School places equal emphasis on education and upbringing of students. Although there are only 97 male and female students in total (one-quarter were sent by the former Shanghai Municipal Council's Child Protection Section, one-third are older students, and only four pay tuition, and four or five have someone specifically donating for their tuition), in order to ensure the perfection of education and upbringing, the number of teaching staff cannot be too small. There are currently eight people, and they are really busy to the point of being unable to breathe. Also, because the school is too far from the city center and transportation is inconvenient, it cannot accommodate day students. All students board at the school, so special care is taken in daily life. Each dormitory has a supervisor. Needless to say, the dormitories for boys and girls in grades five and six to junior high school are very clean. Ms. Zhang Hua, the nanny and management officer, led [us] to see the dormitories of the first and second-grade blind students under her charge. Ms. Ye Zhong-hua led [us] to see the dormitory of the female students under her charge, and they were all tidied up and beautified. In addition, the building and other aspects are particularly emphasized. Each room has windows on three sides, fitted with beautiful curtains. Outside the curtains is a grove of trees that can be turned on and off. The interior is uniformly furnished with iron beds, white blankets, and white quilts, folded neatly and evenly. The floor is as smooth as if it had been waxed in the sky. This should be the ideal bedroom for the luckiest people!

The daily lives of the students are regulated. After getting up early in the morning to clean, they go to the sports ground for appropriate exercise. Do not guess that educators cannot do group exercises or collective sports. Unexpectedly, both male and female blind children love sports, especially group sports. They even participated in the Jiangsu Provincial School Joint Sports Meet and won a certificate for excellent group sports performance!

Outside of class, some blind children are resting and chatting, and some are walking in the grove, but the music room and the library are never too deserted. Therefore, the school often overflows with harmonious piano sounds. The library's collection of books can truly be considered magnificent. Most of them are books, tools, charts, and histories specially designed for educators. There is also a relatively new type of Braille, which is shorthand and also raised letters printed on special paper, specifically for older blind people with weaker memory. There are also many musical scores for the blind. Many people are truly "studying them carefully," because only after studying them thoroughly can they be transferred to musical instruments. Blind people cannot perform by reading music!

The Future of Blind Children's Education

The impression that the Blind Children's School gives is so beautiful and admirable! However, the superficial grandeur ultimately cannot conceal the internal panic and difficulties!

Of course, the most important issue at present is the funding issue. In peacetime, it has always relied on donations from all walks of life. It has been operating miserably for several years, but the internal situation is extremely difficult, because the original sources of funding have been completely cut off, and prices are constantly soaring, but expenses cannot be controlled! Teachers bear heavy responsibilities and have many tasks, but the monthly salary is at most only two hundred and fifty yuan, and the ten workers receive only fifty to seventy yuan. The words "sacrificial service" can be applied to them without shame. However, other expenses cannot be saved! According to a statistic from the school in the first semester of this year, the total expenditure was 356,174.82 yuan, of which food alone accounted for 295,827 yuan. It can be said that this is the biggest difficulty at present. In reality, all teachers and students in the school eat only three meals of porridge a day, so the reason why such a large amount of money is spent is: (1) The school's address is between the outer security zone and the "purification zone," and there is no household ration of rice. All rice must be purchased at high prices on the black market; (2) 400 bags of donated crushed wheat were stored last year and have already been eaten. Someone said that the most urgent thing at present is the grain problem. If the authorities allow special households to be rationed rice, then the problem can be solved for the most part. Secondly, any material assistance is also highly anticipated, such as books and paper for the blind, which are now completely unavailable. They have switched to using old magazines (thick paper) to print Braille and compile textbooks. They hope that all walks of life will donate these old books and magazines. Now they only seek to maintain this only large-scale blind education and training undertaking in China, and are preparing to restore crafts, printing, newspapers and other departments in the near future, to become the leader of the national blind education and training movement, and to build a free and happy new world for the unfortunate blind men and women in the country. The realization of this ideal is awaiting the assistance of truly enthusiastic philanthropists in society (End)

### Eight District Finance Office Strictly Prohibits Impersonation

Datong News Agency reports: The Finance Office of the Eighth District Public Office issued a notice stating that investigators of the Finance Office must carry the investigation certificate issued by the office in order to perform their duties outside. This has already been announced. However, it has been reported that recently some people have been impersonating Finance Office staff members outside, which is illegal and extremely bad. In addition to ordering the Third Police Station to pay attention to this at all times, all merchants and people are requested to ask for the investigation certificate from Finance Office staff members when they perform investigation duties. If there is no investigation certificate to prove their identity, they should immediately be sent to the nearest police station for custody and report to this office for investigation and punishment.

### Central Market Vegetable Price Evaluation

The Central Market Price Evaluation Committee has decided on the following highest prices for vegetables from September 22nd to October 2nd (5 days) (Wholesale price per catty): Leeks, green vegetables, and garlic heads: 2.49 yuan. Small greens: 1.53 yuan. Eggplant: 1.70 yuan. Spinach: 4.87 yuan. Leek sprouts: 5.66 yuan. Red sweet potatoes: 1.58 yuan. Onions: 5.55 yuan. Chicken feathers: 1.64 yuan. Pickled vegetables: 2.83 yuan. Edamame: 2.94 yuan. Yixing taro: 2.26 yuan.

### Shop Illegally Profiteering - Subject to Suspension

The Economic Office of the First District Public Office of the Special Municipality has strictly managed the selling prices of shops in various industries by assessing and setting price limits, and has sent people to secretly investigate. If there are cases of exceeding the price limits, they are often investigated and punished with suspension of business. Previously, Huali Store at No. 239, Gongping Road, and Helai Tobacco Store at No. 167, Shandong Road, violated the economic regulations of the office and were subject to suspension. They were officially sealed by the First Police Station after the Economic Office requested them the day before yesterday. The former was suspended for three days, and the latter was suspended for five days. The sealing report stated: "After investigating that the store violated the economic regulations of this office, it is ordered to suspend business for several days. If citizens discover hoarding, speculation, illegal profiteering, and other violations of the regulations of the Economic Office of this office, they should immediately report to the Economic Office of this office for investigation and handling."

### Salt Still Not Universally Sold - Eagerly Awaiting Prompt Sale

The supply of salt has not yet been universally available, and ordinary consumers have no choice but to turn to the black market to purchase it at high prices, which has a significant impact on daily expenses.

### Those Who Install Wireless Radios Must Conclude Listening Contracts Starting Today and Pay a Monthly Listening Fee of Ten Yuan - Japanese Consul-General in Shanghai Notifies Japanese Residents to Comply

Central News Agency Shanghai Dispatch: The Ministry of Propaganda has announced the implementation of a licensing system for the installation of radios and has authorized the China Broadcasting Association to conclude listening contracts with radio owners starting October 1st and collect a monthly listening fee of ten yuan. The implementation area is temporarily limited to the two special cities of Shanghai and Nanjing, and then gradually expanded to general areas. In addition, North China implemented the same measures as early as June last year, and Japanese residents in the area also paid the listening fee. Central China will also take the same measures. The Japanese Consulate-General in Shanghai issued Notice No. 39 on the 29th, and the Consulate-General authorities issued a statement. The details are as follows:

Notice

Within the special area of Shanghai, those who have wireless radios installed for the purpose of listening to radio broadcasts should conclude a listening contract with the China Broadcasting Association, a financial organization, during the period from October 1st to October 14th. Those who wish to install new radios from October 1st onwards should conclude the above contract before installation. September 29th, Showa 18th year. Yano Seiki, Consul-General in Shanghai

Statement

The Japanese Consulate-General authorities also issued a statement saying: The National Government authorities have announced the implementation of a licensing system for the installation of radios by the Ministry of Propaganda this time. At the same time, they have authorized the Broadcasting Association to collect a monthly listening fee of ten yuan from those who install wireless radios. The implementation will begin on October 1st, and the implementation area will be the Shanghai and Nanjing special city areas. In the future, it will gradually expand to other areas. The Broadcasting Association is a financial cooperative organization that is not for profit. All listening fees are used to enrich and improve the broadcasting business. It goes without saying that the broadcasting business has a major mission in the ideological war and cultural war during wartime. In order to actively assist the Association in completing its mission, the Japanese side believes that Japanese residents in the Shanghai special city area should also bear this listening fee. The Consulate has separately stipulated in Notice No. 39 of this Consulate that listening contracts should be concluded. North China implemented a licensing system for the installation of wireless radios and collected a listening fee in May last year. Local Japanese residents also pay the listening fee. Those who currently hold wireless radios in the area designated in this notice should conclude a listening contract with the Broadcasting Association during the period from October 1st to October 14th and must not miss this. Also, those who wish to install new wireless radios from October 1st onwards should first conclude a contract before installation, and be sure to comply with the contract contents one by one. Also, if there are those who avoid concluding a contract or do not comply with the contract contents, they will be subject to appropriate punishment.

### Hua Shang Securities Exchange Held Reopening Ceremony Yesterday; Trading Expected to Begin Around the Double Tenth Festival

The Shanghai Hua Shang Securities Exchange, since receiving orders from the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry to prepare for its reopening, has completed all necessary facilities. It is tentatively scheduled to officially begin trading on the 10th of October. In case preparations are slightly delayed, it will only be postponed for about two days until around the Double Tenth Festival. Therefore, the exchange held a reopening ceremony at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 29th). It is estimated that representatives from the Ministry of Finance, the Ministry of Industry, various government agencies, as well as financial and industrial guests attending the ceremony numbered no fewer than four to five hundred. Details are recorded as follows:

Representatives of Guests Attending the Ceremony

Representatives from various government agencies included Vice Minister Yuan Yuquan of the Ministry of Industry, Director Zhang Jun of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Industry, Director Chen Zhong of the Bureau of Commodity Inspection, Director Xiang Xun of the Bureau of Trademarks, Director Sun Zuji of the Insurance Management Bureau, Director Li Cheng of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Finance, Director Chen Riping of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office, various supervisory committee members, and prominent figures from the financial and industrial sectors such as Wen Kai, Ting Linkang, Hou Pan, Yang Yao, Wu Yunqi, Xu Guanqun, and Jin Zongcheng.

Report on the Progress of Preparing for Reopening

After Chairman Zhang Weiru delivered the opening remarks, he reported on the progress of preparing for the reopening. He mentioned that the exchange had been closed for more than six years since the incident. This reopening was not a simple matter. Between February and March of this year, over one hundred securities firms were sanctioned by the former Municipal Council due to unfair trading practices that violated regulations. After two months, the necessity of an exchange became apparent. Later, the government, recognizing Shanghai as the economic center of the country, believed that an exchange was indispensable for circulating securities and adjusting finances under the wartime economic system. Furthermore, since the exchange had been established in Shanghai for about twenty years, it had made considerable achievements for society. Based on this historical relationship, the Ministry of Finance and the Ministry of Industry jointly issued an order in July to reopen the exchange. After the shareholders' meeting on July 24th, preparations were actively undertaken. However, the exchange bears a significant mission and must handle matters cautiously. Therefore, it has taken until now to be substantially ready. Today's reopening ceremony marks the imminent official opening. He requested everyone's guidance to correct any shortcomings.

Instructional Remarks by Vice Minister Yuan of the Ministry of Industry

Vice Minister Yuan delivered instructional remarks, stating that under the current wartime economic system, the national policy adopts economic control. Under normal circumstances, it seems contradictory to use the principle of free trade, making the reopening of the exchange unnecessary. However, the government believes that various economic controls, except for those with a significant relationship to national policy, need not apply to the securities trading of the people. Furthermore, recognizing that securities circulation has an impact on the national economy and the people's livelihood and is an indispensable institution for finance, the government ordered the reopening of the exchange in July of this year. However, since the government has adopted a national controlled economic policy, it should apply appropriate supervision and intervention to the future operations of the exchange, making it different from the previous exchange. Moreover, the previous exchange specialized in government bonds, while now it mainly deals in stocks. With the development of stocks, it is hoped that there will be a formal exchange to oversee and prevent other malpractices.

Instructional Remarks by Representative Li Cheng of the Ministry of Finance

Director Li, representative of the Ministry of Finance, stated that the primary task of business is to engage in trading and comply with the law. All rules and regulations must be meticulously stipulated and consistently adhered to. On one hand, it can guide idle funds into the right track, supporting the development of various industrial and commercial enterprises; on the other hand, it can smooth the circulation of funds and stabilize finance, benefiting the national economy and the people's livelihood. The reopening of the exchange to engage in legitimate transactions is expected to be even more active than before, which is greatly anticipated.

Remarks by Guest Representative Lin Kanghou

Finally, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Secretary-General of the Bankers' Association, delivered congratulatory remarks on behalf of the guests, stating that the reopening of the exchange today is like the restoration of a railway destroyed after the incident, which has been well-managed by the government. In the future, all business will be on track. In this extraordinary period, it is hoped that the exchange and its brokers will take their business as their responsibility and not focus solely on profits.

Official Trading to Begin in Early Next Month

Finally, when reporters inquired with Chairman Zhang of the exchange, he stated that the number of confirmed brokers at the exchange is 200, with a security deposit of 500,000 yuan required from each broker. Various title deeds, securities, bank deposit slips, and bank guarantees are accepted as collateral. Currently, the number of listed stocks for trading exceeds 160. It was originally intended to implement trading immediately, but due to incomplete installation of brokers' telephone lines and the need for the Supervisory Committee to review and approve the names of listed stocks, the official start of trading will be delayed until around October 10th (the current tentative date for opening is October 8th, but this is not fully confirmed). The trading rules specify spot transactions with settlements every seven days. The primary securities for trading will be shares of cotton mills, banks, and other securities, but only those that have been approved by the government, registered, and obtained a business license will be traded. Trading hours will be from 9:30 AM to 12:00 PM and from 2:30 PM to 4:30 PM for opening and closing sessions.

### Economic Department Holds a Symposium on the Sauce Industry

The Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Department of the First District of Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to connect with various industries, investigate prices, and discuss various issues, has been convening symposiums for the persons in charge of various industries since this month to exchange opinions, thereby stabilizing people's livelihood. This afternoon (the 30th) at 3:00 PM, at the conference room of the department, representatives from the sauce industry, the seasoning powder manufacturing industry, the seasoning sauce industry, and the guild will be gathered to discuss the production and sales of soy sauce, seasoning sauces, and other matters in detail.

Economic Commentary

### Two Resolutions Passed by the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

Among the various important resolutions passed by the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce at its annual member representative conference, two are particularly worthy of everyone's support: one is that silk and silk products should be allowed to be freely transported, and the other is that the price deposit slips for yarn and cloth should be discounted without interest. The former is a request for the implementation of government orders, and the latter is a request for the remedy of government orders, and the expression of their meaning is consistent with what has been expressed in this newspaper's editorial. We have emphasized regarding local administration that there should not be different political facilities within the same jurisdiction; we have frankly expressed that there may have been insufficient consideration in advance for the purchase of yarn and cloth, so subsequent remedies are necessary.

In terms of the free transportation of silk and silk products, it is clearly based on the "Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement" and the "General Rules for the Registration of Essential Commodities," which are beyond doubt. Moreover, the highest authority for material control—the National General Association for Commercial Control—has already informed the Silk Industry Association that the movement of silk cocoons, silk fabrics, and silk textiles within the three provinces and two cities or within the province does not require permission from the association, according to the Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Material Movement. Therefore, the competent authorities in other regions, even within their jurisdiction, seem to be able only to follow the current central laws and regulations and cannot create their own.

In terms of the interest-free discounting of price deposit slips for yarn and cloth, although we cannot determine how the central government will respond to the request for interest-free discounting, we still advocate that financial assistance, no matter what form it takes, is absolutely necessary in the purchase of yarn and cloth today. All firms have a duty to perform this responsibility, but the cooperation of the firms still relies on the Central Reserve Bank to act as their most powerful backing in its position as the "bank of banks."

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the generally upward trend suddenly declined sharply. The downward trend continued in the afternoon. Around 3:00 PM, it suddenly turned upward again. In the end, most stocks returned to their previous gains, though slightly less. The trading volume was brisk. The trends in various industries are recorded as follows:

Textiles: Yong'an Textile's new shares opened high. After opening in the morning, they soared. Around 10:00 AM, sell orders flooded in. In the afternoon, they once fell close to a level only half a grade away from a loss. Finally, they rose again. The price of old shares also saw an increase. Dasheng One, Three, and Two Mills also rose. Zhongfang's losses were covered. Jiangya and Xinnuo rose sharply but ultimately declined slightly. Rongfeng Textile was firm due to news of capital increase. Small denomination Dagong Dyeing and Weaving shares exceeded their face value by 80%. Tianlun Silk Weaving, Hongsheng, Hongxing, and Da Zhonghua Weaving shares also rose. Jingfu Shirt Machine opened at par. Jinglun Shirt and Socks showed sharp increases.

Department Stores: Yong'an Company once again reached a new high price, but then declined due to scattered sell orders. It fell further in the afternoon, but finally stabilized. Xinxin's losses were immediately evident after opening in the morning, but later recovered slightly. The fluctuations in Jianhuo were narrow, and the decline was small. China Underwear rose sharply but also saw a decline, with the greatest change on the day, ranging over × points.

Pharmaceuticals: Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory initially rose significantly. Around noon, it fluctuated around × points. It declined in the afternoon. Although it later rose again, both it and Sino-French Pharmacy saw a decline. Wuzhou, Zhongsi, and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factory were still stable.

Bao'an Glass, Dahua Planting, and Sanyou Industrial were all stable. Standard Paper Products attracted buyers.

### Commercial News Summary

Government Bonds: Yesterday suddenly turned soft and weak, with a relatively severe trend. Category C initially saw good market conditions, but later due to unfavorable circumstances, the result was a significant decline. Categories A, B, D, and E also fell across the board.

Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Trade Association remained unchanged at 1%.

Rice and Grain: The arrival of rice in the market was scarce, and trading was slow and unenthusiastic. Scattered households had limited holdings, but public sentiment was upward, and the market rose gradually. Soybean cake and corn arrivals were scarce, and prices remained unchanged.

Tea: Trading remained sparse. However, public sentiment against the grain showed signs of improvement. Even though trading was quiet, the market situation gradually shifted from stagnant to stable and promising. The entire city saw only Wan Sheng Tea House take in ten boxes of black tea, with a transaction price of over customs per dan, according to Yong Shun Tea House. There were no transactions for other varieties.

Woolen Fabrics: The downward trend of fine wool fabrics has come to a halt. The existing stock in the city's factories and stores is limited. Production has only decreased and not increased. Based on the recent market prices, the total costs have exceeded the new costs. In the past month, Tongle and other stores have been selling off fine wool fabrics at low prices. Medium-grade Chinese clothing and four-piece suits have been sold in real terms, and approximately tens of thousands of yards have been sold by breaking them down into smaller lots.

### Another Letter to the Business and Industrial Circles

To all gentlemen in the business and industrial circles:

Our newspaper, in view of the many changes in Shanghai's industry and commerce in recent years, plans to compile a "Shanghai Industry and Commerce Directory" to facilitate inspection and reference. We have received information from various industry associations. We recently sent an open letter to the gentlemen in the business and industrial circles, requesting them to provide accurate survey data. In recent days, we have received letters from various companies and factories, detailing the contents, which we greatly appreciate. In order to further broaden the survey, we have specially made a form (the form is shown on page two of this newspaper on September 20th; if you need a letter or a form, you can request it). We hope that gentlemen in the business and industrial circles will fill out the form in detail according to the items and send it to us so that it can be corrected during printing. Whether you have joined an association or not, regardless of the size of your capital or the scope of your business, all Shanghai industrialists and businessmen are welcome.

Sincerely,

Shen Bao

### Difficulties in Funding for Cloth Factories; Petitioning the Authorities for Relief

Cloth factories in this city have experienced some difficulties in the turnover of funds due to the government's explicit order to purchase yarn and cloth. Therefore, they plan to request relief from the authorities and allow the special fixed-term deposit slips for yarn and cloth to be discounted. The Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce, on behalf of the fabric factory industry, will submit a petition to the Executive Yuan and the Ministry of Finance, detailing the difficult situation of various industries after the purchase of yarn and cloth, and requesting financial relief. The reasons for the cloth factories' request to be forwarded by the Chamber of Commerce are recorded below: "It is found that most of our country's industries and businesses have meager financial resources. Most of the capital, in addition to being used for machinery and equipment, is used for working capital. Therefore, taking the cloth factory industry as an example, almost all of the industry are debtors to banks. Since the government promulgated the explicit order to purchase yarn and cloth, the banks have uniformly stopped lending and urged repayment. In particular, repayments are frequently requested for maturing loans, which is extremely urgent. The government's payment for the purchase of yarn and cloth is subject to the regulations and is scheduled to take as long as three years. The distant water cannot quench the present thirst, and there is suffering in having to cope with this. As a result, the turnover of funds in various factories is inflexible, and production facilities are on the verge of bankruptcy. It is known that the recent payment for the purchase of yarn and cloth must wait three months. During this period, the daily expenses and workers' salaries of the various factories will be impossible to pay. It is common to hear that factory owners are pawning their clothes to maintain the workers' food. These difficulties that have occurred in reality were not anticipated by the authorities when they initially purchased the yarn and cloth. It seems that they are not fully in line with the economic national policy of maintaining production facilities and promoting increased production. Although the various musical guilds have petitioned the Executive Yuan for relief, there has been no clear approval. Our Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the leading organization in Shanghai's industry and commerce. At this time, the crisis of the yarn and cloth production and sales industries is pressing. The attending representatives have great foresight and will certainly help resolve difficulties and stabilize finance. Therefore, we dare to request that the competent authorities be approached with relief and allow the special fixed-term deposit slips to be discounted and the interest to be exempted, so as to use them for circulation, so that the production facilities still have a chance to survive and can fulfill their inherent responsibilities."

### Dynamics of Various Industry Associations

Liquor: After the Shanghai Municipal Liquor Retail Industry Association was approved by the Municipal Grain Bureau and formally announced its establishment, the Grain Bureau ordered the old seals of the association to be handed over for cancellation, and the new seals have now been put into use. Other similar associations in the city should all cease their activities.

Ramie Products Industry: The Commercial Control Association has long listed hemp and its ramie products as important controlled materials. Since the Japanese side already has the organization of the Ramie Industry Federation, it was previously requested from the Ministry of Industry to check whether the Chinese side should be allowed to establish a similar organization. The Ministry of Industry replied that ramie is indeed an important material. According to the industry association, there are more than 300 companies in Shanghai, and there are many other companies in Zhejiang, Anhui, Fujian, Guangdong, and other places. The Ramie Industry Federation should be allowed to be added to unify the distribution and facilitate supervision and management.

### Brief News

China Sewing Machine Factory was founded in the autumn of the 31st year, specializing in the manufacture of various sewing machines, comparable to imported products. Its product, the Model 1001 electric sewing machine (the same as the Singer Company's 95 sewing machine), is especially known to various weaving factories and companies.

### City Government to Hold a Food Production Forum Today to Discuss Wartime Food Production

Since the city's food agency was adjusted by the City Food Bureau in accordance with the regulations of the City Government and the Ministry of Grain, it has now fully complied with the wartime organization. The municipal authorities, in order to actively increase food production, use resources to increase people's food supply, and revive the prosperity of rural areas, have scheduled to hold a city food production forum at 6:00 PM today (the 30th) in the City Government Auditorium. The City Food Bureau has already issued notices in advance, and all relevant district governments, agricultural improvement zones, and agricultural and forestry experiment stations are expected to attend on time in order to jointly explore solutions to increase food production.

### New Cotton Arrives

This year's cotton crop was affected by strong winds during the flowering period, so the yield is not abundant. In addition, farmers in the interior are less motivated to grow cotton because grain prices are high and cotton profits are low. Therefore, the planting area is not as large as in the past. In the past week, new cotton has arrived in the suburbs of Nanjing and in Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Sha, and other places. Due to limited planting in the suburbs of Nanjing, the harvest is less than last year. Changshu, Taicang, Jiangyin, Changyinsha, and other places, which are cotton-producing areas, have a relatively abundant yield this year. As for the current price of new cotton, it has declined due to the purchase of yarn and cloth.

### Two Years After the Start of the War: The Political Power of the Soviet Union – Analysis of Soviet War Potential, Part 2

Two years after the start of the German-Soviet war, no one can deny that Stalin's regime is not only unshaken, but has become even stronger. It used to be said that the collapse of the Stalin regime would mean the end of the Soviet Union, and the collapse of the Soviet Union would mean the demise of the Stalin regime. This relationship has become even closer since the start of the German-Soviet war.

As for Stalin himself, he has recently not only been promoted to Marshal, further strengthening his position as the Supreme Commander of the Soviet Army, but also concurrently serves as Chairman of the State Defense Committee, Chairman of the Council of People's Commissars of the Soviet Union, People's Commissar of Defense, and Secretary-General of the Central Committee of the Communist Party of the Soviet Union, holding the most important positions in wartime Soviet Union, wielding supreme command over both military and political affairs.

Especially since the first and second winter counter-offensives, Stalin's guidance of the Soviet Army's counter-offensive and the recovery of many lost territories occupied by the German army have led to a growing faith in Stalin among the people. "Motherland" and "Stalin" can be said to be synonymous, and "For Stalin" and "For the Motherland" are equally effective slogans to inspire the morale of the front and the rear.

The Soviet people believe that Stalin is the motherland, the defender and savior of the motherland, which has laid a solid foundation for his personal status. In short, Stalin is a loyal successor to Lenin's policies, a faithful implementer of Bolshevik policies, and also a genius politician and strategist. Because Stalin is a communist and the Soviet Union is a socialist country, his position is unshakable. The so-called dictator Stalin is also a pillar of the communist regime. Therefore, we must understand that the Stalin regime means the communist regime.

Therefore, to talk about the movements of the Stalin regime, we must observe the activities of the Communist Party. The following attempts to examine how the Communist Party has been active in the two years since the start of the German-Soviet war.

Full-Scale Activities of the Communist Party

Since its founding, the Soviet Union has organized all institutions based on the principle of "nation first," and the people have engaged in labor under the same principle. This situation has not changed in any way since the start of the German-Soviet war. The principle of "nation first" remains the foundation for the war against Germany, but the so-called "nation" has become the "motherland."

Before the war, the Communist Party was the central hub of the state. This relationship has not changed at all since the start of the German-Soviet war. The Communist Party continues to promote the war against Germany in the front and the rear, and the policies of the Communist Party determine the policies of the government. Moreover, there have been no changes in the members of the Central Executive Committee of the Party, so the Communist Party continues to adopt unchanged policies.

Stalin stipulated that the activities of the Party organs after the start of the war should be directed in two ways: first, to expand peaceful construction and organize a strong rear; and second, to carry out offensive and defensive battles by the Soviet Army. The Communist Party has been fully active on the two fronts stipulated by Stalin, becoming a driving force for increasing military production and increasing agricultural production in the rear, and playing a huge role in improving the Soviet Army's combat effectiveness, boosting morale, and enforcing military discipline on the front lines.

According to the Red Star newspaper: "War is a school for party members, a testing ground." The Soviet Union has enhanced the political consciousness of party members through the war, taught non-party members through the war, and strengthened the Communist Party. This is what Stalin called the elevation of political consciousness, which is immediately reflected in the war resistance, and the increase in war resistance also leads to the elevation of political consciousness, with each interacting with the other.

In his May 1st Labor Day proclamation this year, Stalin pointed out the importance of popularizing the sense of war, and that to popularize the sense of war, it is necessary to first elevate the people's political consciousness, that is, the sense of war resistance, and devote all efforts to political propaganda.

As a result, the number of party members is bound to increase greatly, but this is hampered by the complicated procedures for joining the party, so Soviet newspapers have called for simplifying the procedures for joining the party. Especially on the front lines, the procedures for joining the party have a significant impact because of the daily battles.

As a result, the procedures for joining the party have been greatly relaxed, and the number of party members in the army has increased sharply. At the same time, with the easing of the procedures for joining the party, it is expected that the quality of party members will decline and other malpractices will occur. The Communist Party is taking various appropriate measures to prevent the above-mentioned malpractices.

Also, the main area of activity for the Communist Party in the rear is to improve labor productivity, strengthen labor discipline, increase production, and cultivate the spirit of selflessness among workers and farmers. For example, a local party organ is responsible for increasing agricultural production. During the harvest season, it sends many party member pioneers to various places to guide farmers, lead by example, and serve as models for farmers. This kind of political education of labor has the same great effect as the political education through combat on the front lines. According to the Pravda newspaper, when the Caucasus republics were under the threat of the German army last year, Stalin sent Beria to organize the defense of the Caucasus. It is said that Beria combined the defense forces of the Georgian, Azerbaijani, and Armenian republics, and organized a solid defense force in the rear. This kind of example is not just Beria. For example, Zhdanov on the Leningrad front, Voroshilov on the southern front, Zhgadzhin on the northwestern front, and Mekhlis on the Volkhov front, etc., cannot be enumerated one by one.

Political Propaganda Further Strengthened

Soviet political propaganda cannot be separated from the Party and examined independently, especially during wartime. It used to be said: "Party organs must know that political propaganda is as necessary to the people as air," or "Political propaganda is to party members what blood transfusions are." Since the start of the German-Soviet war, the need for political propaganda has been particularly keenly felt, so the number of propagandists and agitators has greatly increased.

What has become a prominent issue is that since the start of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has devoted all its efforts to elevating the people's patriotism, putting forward the term "Motherland" that was not often used before, adding the name "Great Patriotic War" to the war against Germany, further stimulating the worship of heroes in the front and rear, and deepening the impression that the people have abandoned communist propaganda. However, the Soviet Union will never abandon communist propaganda, but will strengthen it even more.

The Soviet Union followed the example of Napoleon's invasion of Moscow and stipulated that the "Defense of the Motherland" should be the purpose of this war. This clearly hints at Stalin's clever intentions. Apart from his own country, he said that the war aims of other countries stemmed from imperialist intentions. On this point, Soviet propaganda remains unchanged.

Especially regarding the war aims of the United Kingdom and the United States, they were defined as imperialist wars before the start of the German-Soviet war. Since the start of the war, because of the relationship with the Soviet Union, they have been called wars for democracy and wars for freedom, showing a flattering attitude. But this is undoubtedly based on extreme realism. After the end of the First Five-Year Plan, when the crisis of the Second World War became increasingly mature due to the encirclement policy of various countries against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union used to stir up the patriotic feelings of the people. Of course, in the event of a crusade against the Soviet Union, the Soviet Union believes that patriotism is indeed the most important factor in strengthening the war resistance of the Soviet people.

Therefore, since the start of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet Union has of course also been engaged in stirring up the people's patriotism, propagating the preservation of the tradition of Russia, which has never been bullied by foreign enemies. In the eyes of the Soviet authorities, that is just a policy necessary for carrying out the war. In short, the motherland is none other than the socialist motherland.

However, the Soviet Union is now allied with the United Kingdom and the United States. In order to fight against Germany, it has to use the strength of the United Kingdom and the United States, so it calls the United Kingdom and the United States defenders of democracy and friends of freedom. But because of the demands of the unpredictable world war situation, once there is a dispute with the United Kingdom and the United States, the "defenders of democracy and friends of freedom" will immediately become "imperialists."

In short, the Soviet Union is only engaged in trying to strengthen the war resistance of the Soviet Union through communist propaganda, and this point has not changed in any way. As mentioned above, the Soviet Union's strengthening of political propaganda is not a departure from reality, and its activities are not in abstract terms, but through activities on the actual battlefield and on the war wounds. Moreover, in the Soviet Union, the weapon of political propaganda is communist propaganda, which is an undeniable fact.

All in all, the elevation of patriotism and hatred of the enemy in the front and rear can be expected through communist propaganda, which is a unique method of the Soviet Union, and the slogan "Everything for the war" is also realized in this form.

### Countermeasures to Prevent Illegal Price Increases and Black Market Trading

— Chen Naichao

Methods of suppressing prices, countermeasures to eliminate speculation and hoarding, etc.—this type of writing has been common in newspapers and magazines, but most of them are extremely general and broad methods. This article is limited to illegal price increases and black market trading by shops and manufacturers. Because all price increases are affected by the black market trading of shops, and they use various cunning tricks to escape the authorities' net. As far as the author's limited knowledge goes, the following suggestions are offered:

The previous price limits of the Shanghai Municipal Council could only be implemented in larger companies and shops. As for small shops, they often overcharge people who "don't understand the market," or they just say "out of stock." They have no invoices and no proof, so even if the authorities know it, they have no way to catch them "red-handed." Even larger shops often do not sell goods with price limits at the retail level because they have invoices, but wholesale them to small shops at black market prices. In this way, the price limits become ineffective. Another point is that the price limits are often used as a basis by a group of unscrupulous merchants. "The Municipal Council's price limit is already this much." The black market price is of course one or two times higher. At the same time, the Municipal Council's price limits are constantly increasing, so the black market price of goods is also constantly rising. If you want to limit prices, you must stipulate fair and realistic prices. Once stipulated, you cannot increase them at will, and you would rather sell out. If it is found that the price limit has been exceeded, the strictest punishment must be imposed, and the matter cannot be settled by asking for a substitute. According to a friend from Japan, Japanese department stores cannot raise prices even if they sell out.

Many factories have now been handed over to our country. In the future, the products will be divided into several grades, A, B, C, and D, based on their materials, and the prices will be fixed. It is not allowed to manufacture a variety of products, so as to implement a unified wartime production system, and investigation will also be more convenient.

In addition to unifying factory manufacturing, the name, number, price, and sample of each product must also be submitted to the authorities for record-keeping. At the same time, each time a new item is produced, it must also be registered and approved by the authorities before it can be sold on the market. This way, the authorities will have a basis and samples, and the investigation will be much simpler. It is not allowed to sell anything that has not been registered and approved. For example, last year, there was a type of grape wine that sold for more than thirty yuan at the time. Later, it was replaced with another brand and cost sixty yuan, and now it has been replaced with another brand and sells for more than one hundred yuan.

In addition, the date of manufacture must be marked on the products of the factory. If there is trademark paper, it should be written on it. If it is a woven product, the date of manufacture should be clearly marked on the edge. If it is a hardware product, the date of manufacture should be stamped on the body or bottom. Once the price is fixed in this way, the products of this period will never be allowed to rise by even a penny. In this way, hoarders will not be able to move.

All retail stores must issue invoices to buyers. The invoice must clearly state the name of the goods, the item number, the name of the factory, and the price. If one item is missing, it will not work. If there is no invoice or vague terms, it is an example of punishment. Stores often write vaguely on the invoices when selling goods that exceed the price limit. For example, "one foot of cloth, one foot of silk," or "A tea, B tea" and other secret codes. This kind of trick often deceives everyone.

Rationed goods such as cigarettes and matches are often taken by the rationed retailers for more than 70% of the profit and sold on the black market. Only a small amount is sold at the door, about 30%. If you say he doesn't sell it, he actually has it to sell. If you say he sells it, he only sells a little bit. In this way, it is extremely difficult for the authorities to investigate. Preventing this kind of method is extremely difficult. If you issue invoices, cigarettes are so small and the price is so expensive that you can't even earn the price of the paper. The only way is to prohibit transportation at all times (free transportation of beer, which the patrolmen do not deal with, leads to the convenience of black market trading, so the black market is extremely popular). After daily sales, officials from the bureau are sent to check the inventory.

All inventories, whether in shops, private individuals, factories, etc., should be registered in detail. The authorities should issue a registration certificate, stating the owner's name, the name of the goods, the quantity, and the location. The sale or transfer of the goods must also be registered with the authorities and the price must be stated. This is also a way to prevent the black market. This method has already been implemented, but it is not thorough. It only covers some goods, food, and controlled products. The number of hoarded goods in private residences and retail stores is indeed quite large. If you want to eliminate hoarding, no matter what kind of goods, no matter how much the quantity, you must register in detail and implement it thoroughly.

There is a group of speculative merchants who open so-called firms, companies, western medicine stores, etc., which specialize in speculating on the black market or buying and selling black market goods for others. The authorities must register this type of shop and conduct an investigation to determine whether its business is legitimate, otherwise it will be ordered to close down in order to reduce the nests of the black market.

In wartime, the supply of materials cannot meet the demand, which is a certain truth. Therefore, a group of unscrupulous merchants take advantage of this opportunity to monopolize prices, causing them to rise endlessly, which affects the lives of the people on a small scale, and the future of the nation and the country on a large scale. Now that the concessions have been taken over, proceeding is relatively direct, and eliminating speculation, hoarding, and the black market is an urgent task today. They are like parasites in the human body in the country and society. We must prescribe the right medicine and give injections to eliminate them.

### Privately Contracted Hospitals – Benefiting Impoverished and Sick Teachers – This Newspaper Distributes Subsidies to Express Gratitude

Since the Water Conservancy Bureau began handling medical subsidies for primary school teachers, a large number of people have applied to the Bureau for free treatment, especially those who are both pregnant and suffering from lung disease. They have been introduced to the following hospitals for examination, and these hospitals, in the spirit of serving the people, have cooperated with the Bureau. The teachers who were introduced to the hospitals for treatment have been given careful treatment and have recovered. In particular, they have been given preferential treatment in terms of medical expenses and hospitalization. The Bureau deeply admires their spirit of service and sacrifice. Because medical expenses are very high, the Bureau has specially subsidized these hospitals. Although it is only a drop in the bucket, it is only to show the gratitude of the colleagues of this newspaper.

The amounts are as follows: Yuzhu Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Chinese Health Association, 1,000 yuan; Yongjun Eye Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Hongren Hospital, 10,000 yuan; Foguang Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Chinese Dental Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Cash subsidies to five teachers suffering from lung disease, 1,000 yuan; Xi's Hospital, 10,000 yuan; Tongren Hospital, 5,000 yuan; Pingmin Infant Hospital, 1,000 yuan; Anti-Tuberculosis Association, 1,000 yuan. The Bureau originally subsidized Nanyang Hospital with 3,000 yuan, but President Xian repeatedly declined, saying that the hospital would give preferential treatment to primary school teachers suffering from illness in the spirit of service, so it was unwilling to accept the Bureau's donation. This is specially noted to praise his benevolence.

### A Self-Abusing Youth

— Zhu

Although the heavy rain has stopped, the sky is white and foggy, and there is still a hint of rain. At this time, the air is very dull. I stepped onto the sun deck to relieve my boredom. This is a common thing: because below the sun deck is a vast mountain, on windy and sunny days, many people roam in it like a flower garden, and I can see pairs of people leaning on each other or holding hands, as well as all kinds of people and square tombstones. But what I saw today was something that made me very sad, and it can also be said to be a painful thing in society.

A young man of about twenty years old, wearing a raincoat, hid on one side of the dense woods, furtively looking out. When he saw that no one was near, he began to engage in his suicidal behavior – self-pleasuring – unaware that I was watching him. The wind blew the leaves, making a rustling sound. He may have been fumbling for several minutes, and then straightened his clothes and left. The sky gradually turned dark, and a hazy drizzle fell. His figure also disappeared from my sight.

Even if it is a young man, he is consuming his energy, and is also subjected to the impact of wind and rain, so how can he not be sick. No wonder in recent years, there have been an unusual number of young people suffering from tuberculosis. Naturally, it is because the body is weak and easily susceptible to germs. Young people are the foundation of the country and the backbone of society. If the foundations are dilapidated, what hope is there for the future? I am truly saddened by it. Shanghai is indeed an evil city; the easy availability of pornographic books and the enticements of the surrounding area, and the extravagant customs often tempt young people with weak wills, who cannot resist external enticements, and become addicted to various bad habits, to the point of destruction. This is a truly painful thing!

I hope that parents can thoroughly explain the advantages and disadvantages of this to their beloved sons, so that they know that such behavior is equivalent to suicide, leading to destruction. I also hope that the authorities can confiscate all pornographic books, improve urban customs, and ban bad enticements. This will truly benefit the country and society.

### Lianyi Charity School – Hosting a Tea Party for All Walks of Life

The Lianyi Primary School on Meizhou Road was founded by Ms. Gao Daying. It currently has six classes of primary school students, totaling 300 people. In order to help out-of-school children, it has set up many free places and provides books. It now plans to add a branch school on the western section of Jing'an Temple Road. Yesterday, Lan Shishi, the former school director, Fan Huichun, the finance director, Cheng Zhiliang, and Huang Jingwan, the headmaster, hosted a tea party for all walks of life at the Huamei, with more than 40 people in attendance. They specially invited Sun Xiangzhong, the headmaster of the Patriotic Girls' School, to speak about the essentials of virtue and Confucius' teaching without discrimination, as a pioneer in eliminating the class system in education. They also hoped that all districts would set up more public charity schools to eradicate illiteracy. The district chiefs all expressed their willingness to promote ethical slogans, such as loyalty and forbearance.
