### Expectations for the New Shanghai Grain Organization

Yesterday, in our discussion of political responsibility, we listed the recent failures in grain administration and pointed out where the responsibility lies. We believe that such important matters of public welfare must not be treated irresponsibly as child's play. If responsibility is not pursued today for A, and rewards and punishments are not clearly defined, how can we hold B accountable tomorrow, to warn them of right and wrong, and expect them to handle things perfectly? Currently, the procurement and allocation of rice and grain are being handled by a newly established Grain Control Committee. This new organization is about to be established and begin its work. Our expectations for this new organization are even more earnest than for any previous one!

Why do we discuss the grain problem repeatedly without tiring? The reason is simple: the grain problem is the problem of the people's livelihood; the price of grain is related to the general price level. If the problem is solved reasonably, the people's livelihood will be largely stabilized; conversely, if the problem develops abnormally, the people's livelihood will suffer more and more. These are not theories, but complete facts, common sense that everyone understands. Since our duty in the press is to be the voice of the people, we naturally cannot abandon our responsibility to criticize and advise on this most important issue of people's livelihood, the grain problem. Therefore, the meaning of our repeated and urgent appeals lies in this.

The ancients said, "Do not forget the past, for it is a teacher for the future." They also said, "The overturned cart in front is a warning to the cart behind." We expect the new organization to handle things perfectly, and it must review the reasons for the failure of the old organization, study where the crux of the problem lies, and decide on measures for improvement. We have found that the cause of the old organization's failure was neither the organization itself being insensitive or incomplete, nor the laws and regulations being imperfect or not strict enough. The crux of the matter was the wrongdoing of some bad elements, who used their positions for personal gain, as we pointed out yesterday in a way that makes people's hair stand on end. Therefore, we can say with certainty that the crux of the old organization's failure was not in the organization or the laws, but entirely in the poor quality of personnel.

Now that we understand that poor personnel was the crux of past failures in grain administration, we hope that the new organization will pay special attention to this. At the same time, we would like to offer the following suggestions:

The leading figures of the new organization certainly need to be absolutely fair, honest, decisive, and resolute. However, middle-level and lower-level cadres especially need to be loyal and devoted to their duties. Every employee must understand that participating in the grain administration is to serve the public and regulate the people's food supply, not to engage in business for profit. When the National General Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control was first established, the chairman told the staff to take "fairness and honesty" as their service motto. Now, the new grain management organization also belongs to the Chamber of Commerce for Trade Control system, and we hope that the motto will be thoroughly observed. The leaders must especially recognize the importance of personnel at the middle and lower levels. With the future of grain administration in mind, the employment of personnel must be absolutely open, and no private individuals must be appointed. At the same time, people from all walks of life should also recognize the seriousness and importance of the grain administration and not casually recommend people, which would lead to mistakes and harm others. It is best to adopt a system of examination and screening, with strict selection. At the very least, a selection committee should be organized by senior cadres, inviting fair-minded people and experts from society to participate. All employees should undergo individual oral interviews, and a joint decision should be made on whether or not to employ them, to ensure that bad elements have no chance to get involved. We believe that the government reorganized the old organization and selected leading figures because the old organization was not well-managed. The expectations are high, and it is easy to imagine. The people have long suffered from the problems with grain administration, and their anticipation for this new organization and new people is even more evident. Those who have been entrusted with the task of leading this new organization are also aware of the expectations from all sides and are eager to present a new image. Personnel issues are the main key to future success or failure, and this is something the new organization should reflect on first.

Once the foundation of personnel is established, the procurement and transportation of rice and grain will naturally be easier to get on track. The amount of rations must be gradually increased to at least the minimum adequate amount, and there should absolutely be no more reductions, lest the public lose faith and the mistakes of the old organization be repeated. As for transportation problems, one should not be afraid to speak up, or shy away from hardship, but negotiate reasonably and fight for what is right, rather than shirking responsibility. This is the second thing the new organization should pay attention to.

The length of the ration period is related to the amount of the ration. If the amount of the ration is barely maintained and the ration period is extended, it is no different from reducing the amount of the ration. Therefore, the ration period should be shortened, not extended.

The composition of rations must be clearly stipulated and strictly enforced. The public notice should clearly state how much white rice, how much red rice, and how much broken rice there is, and the word "or" should not be used. The word "or" is ambiguous and gives those who handle the rations an opportunity to cheat. For example, if the notice says "one liter of white rice or one liter of broken rice," the recipients will definitely get all broken rice, and no white rice at all. Those who handle the rations will use the word "or" as an excuse to justify giving broken rice to the ration recipients, while selling the white rice on the black market for profit. On the one hand, they exploit the psychology of the so-called "du mi jie ji" (a class of people who wouldn't eat the lower quality 'du mi' rice) who do not eat broken rice, and on the other hand, they buy it back at a low price and sell it again, switching things around. To eliminate this kind of trickery and fraud, the type of rice sold must be clearly stipulated, with no ambiguity allowed.

The amount of rations for factory workers in production units, the working class, and the education sector should be specially increased, or special rations should be given.

Finally, we emphasize and point out that repeatedly changing the management organization is ultimately a passive solution. Only by renewing personnel, assigning responsibility, and clearly defining rewards and punishments can we take a proactive approach and achieve effective results. The rational adjustment of the people's food supply has reached a stage of utmost urgency. We hope that the government authorities and the new Shanghai grain organization will take immediate action to address it!

Jian'ou is the only base for the U.S. air force stationed in Chongqing to attack Japan, and it is currently working hard to prepare for resupply. The Japanese air force launches surprise attacks whenever it discovers that the enemy is about to move, completely thwarting the enemy's plans.

### Food Ministry Authorities Answer Grain Questions; Public Rice Price Expected to Decrease

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - A Central News Agency reporter visited the Food Ministry authorities on the 3rd and received answers to the current questions raised by the visitors. The main contents are as follows: (Question) Now that the new grain has been harvested, can the price of public rice be expected to decrease? (Answer) The Ministry is responsible for the overall planning of rice and grain allocation. Regardless of the rice price, the purchase has not stopped for a single day. The allocation price cannot but take into account the cost and limit the increase in the state treasury's responsibilities. The public rice sold on the market was allocated in early August. Because the original purchase price was at its peak, it was changed to 700 yuan per shi. However, according to cost calculations, there is still a loss of more than 200 yuan per shi. All the public rice allocated in August and September is old grain stored previously. The Ministry has not yet shipped large quantities of new rice, nor has it been added to the allocation. As the new grain enters the market, the price is not yet normal. If the source is abundant, the purchase price will naturally be leveled out, and the price of public rice will of course be adjusted accordingly. As for the occasional delay in allocation, it is due to various procedures. Or it may not be fully smooth, but the relevant agencies have made practical adjustments. The Ministry has always allocated on schedule and has not interrupted. (Question) The food problem in the north this year is serious, so southern rice and wheat are transported north to adjust. Is there a certain limit to the amount of northern transport? (Answer) There is a certain limit to the amount of southern rice and wheat transported to help the northern people's food supply. Each time, the quantity is determined first and then shipped separately.

### The Balkans Become a Strong Fortress of Europe; Impossible for Anti-Axis Attempts to Invade

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The Borsen Zeitung discussed the issue of invading the Balkans in its essay, stating that it has become the strongest stronghold of the European fortress. German workers have made the fortress an impregnable fortress. Germany cooperates with Romania, Croatia, Slovakia, Hungary, and other countries, so it will definitely be able to defend it. There are four gates for enemy troops to invade the area. One is the gate of Bessarabia, which is now closed; the other is defended by Turkey in the Dardanelles, and Turkey is now in strict neutrality; the third way is further south, and it is impossible to invade from Thessaloniki due to the protection of the islands; the fourth way, the Strait of Otranto, is also impassable, and the coastal area is firmly defended by German troops; therefore, there is no way for the anti-Axis powers to enter the Balkan Peninsula. Invading from all four sides requires the occupation of most of Italy. "The anti-Axis powers may have troops, air forces, and ships to invade Southeastern Europe, but realizing this invasion is more difficult than invading Sicily, because the distance is greater and there are fewer places to land. If local residents are used, the Balkan people support Europe, and the power of the guerrillas is no longer important. The power of united strength is invincible.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Military authorities here maintained complete silence regarding the reported British landing in southern Italy. It is understood that the British forces landed with approximately one division. As to whether more British troops continue to land, it is still unknown.

### Goebbels States: German Unity is Ever Stronger; Victory is Inevitable

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Reuter: German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Weekly" on the anniversary of the outbreak of the war, stating that the German people and their leaders cannot bear the responsibility for this war. Germany was forced to do this. Our intentions are all within the scope of peace. Our enemies had no internal difficulties before this war. Germany is now stronger than ever in all aspects, and Germany's position is also better than it was when the war broke out. All of this is due to the excellent strategy of the Führer. Today, we will never be forced to death by a lack of food or other supplies. We now have the conditions for victory. The war is full of changes, and although the development has its twists and turns, the favorable situation will eventually belong to us. We represent the ideals of a new era, and the enemy represents the old consciousness. The enemy actually wants to repeat the mistakes of Versailles, and even wants to intensify them, but we want to correct them. For this reason, in recent weeks, the British and American people have begun to doubt the continued conduct of the war. The terrorist air raids launched by the enemy have not been effective, and the enemy has made one mistake after another. Its every move is enough to strengthen our will to fight, so victory will belong to us.

### Roosevelt and Churchill Hold Day-Long Talks Yesterday; Adjusting Relations with the Soviet Union is the Main Topic

Lisbon, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt and Prime Minister Churchill held talks at the White House for almost the entire day yesterday. It is believed that they discussed relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, especially regarding the Soviet Union's criticism of the Anti-Axis military situation in Sicily. The news acknowledged that there had been political discord between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and the British and American leaders are now trying to eliminate it.

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from Washington, Churchill met with U.S. Army Chief of Staff Marshall after arriving in Washington. In his speech in Quebec, Churchill repeatedly explained the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The media circles of the United States and Britain have also been strongly advocating that it is necessary to adjust the relationship between the three countries. American news reports have discussed the reasons for the difficulties in the three-nation talks, saying that there is no other way to adjust the relationship between the three countries except for the Soviet Union to cooperate in Europe. Instead of promoting permanent peace or seeking group security, it is better to explore the common points of interest between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union in Europe and East Asia. If the three countries can conclude an agreement in advance, then talks can be convened. Otherwise, it is a mistake to attempt to adjust the relationship between the three countries in the talks.

### Hopkins Observes the War Situation; It Will Take Two Years to End

Buenos Aires, 3rd (Central News Agency) - Recently, the anti-Axis camp has become increasingly optimistic about the development of the war in Europe, especially the United States. Hopkins, who has always styled himself as Roosevelt's strategist, recently wrote an article in an American magazine, discussing that the joint operations of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not be expected to end until 1945. If the cooperation of the Soviet Union cannot be obtained, it may take another nine years. It is said that when U.S. Secretary of State Hull met with reporters on the 2nd, reporters asked what Hopkins meant by saying that the war would take at least two more years. Hull expressed his difficulty in answering this question, only saying that the friendship between the United States and the Soviet Union is cordial, and such small problems will never have any impact on the relationship between the United States and the Soviet Union.

### German Forces in the Donbas Region Adopt Elastic Tactics; Fierce Fighting Southeast of Smolensk

Stockholm, 3rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Eastern Front, the German forces in the Donbas region are adopting extremely elastic defensive tactics, breaking the Soviet army's encirclement attempts and immediately launching fierce counterattacks to annihilate the Soviet army's remaining combat power, and are now gradually achieving their goals. On the 2nd, the German forces launched a forward defense battle on the 140-kilometer area from Lisichansk through Krasnoluti to Kchanikovo. The counterattack in the Lisichansk area was the fiercest. The Soviet army's operation to break through westward along the northern side of the Donbas has now completely stopped. The Soviet Information Bureau reported that the Soviet army had recaptured Lisichansk on the night of the 2nd, but there is no confirmed news from the German side. Even if the German army withdrew from the city to shorten the front line, it would not have much impact on the overall situation of the Donbas front. Reuters also reported that the Soviet army advancing westward from Taganrog had reached an area 40 kilometers west of Mariupol, but the German army seemed to have built a solid new position there. In addition, the German forces southeast of Smolensk completely stopped the Soviet army's advance, and launched a counterattack on the morning of the 2nd, launching a large-scale mechanized battle. The subsequent battle situation has not yet been determined.

Berlin, 3rd (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 2nd as follows: The situation on the Eastern Front has not changed in essence. Although the Soviet army used a large number of personnel and equipment to break through the German army's positions, every inch of land they gained came at a great sacrifice. In the Isom region, the Soviet army has mobilized strong mechanized units and restarted the attack. The fighting between the two armies is extremely fierce. The Soviet army has carried out breakthrough attacks with tank and infantry units on a narrow front line, but they have been repelled by the German army. The Soviet army west of Kharkov has launched a general offensive on a wide front line, but they have been repelled by the German army with a small number of troops, and one of the Soviet army's breakthroughs has been blocked off, destroying 56 of their tanks. The Soviet army has restarted the attack, but they were defeated with heavy losses before reaching the new German positions. At the Bolhov fortress, after fierce shelling on the 1st, the Soviet army attacked the German army with a regiment, and they were counterattacked by the German army, losing 352 men and retreating.

### Former Fascist Leaders' Assets Confiscated

Diplomatic circles in Rome declare that Carinci's trip to Lisbon is in his capacity as a Vatican administrative officer, to bring back a large sum of money. His mission is to secure favorable terms for the Vatican and to transfer foreign deposits to the Vatican.

Soviet Demands

### Launch Attack on Europe Within Ten Weeks, Using Britain as a Base

Soviet news magazines have recently begun to vigorously discuss the Second Front issue again. The Soviet view on when and where to open the anti-Axis Second Front against Germany is becoming clearer. A recent issue of the "War and the Working Class" magazine explicitly stated that the Second Front should be successfully opened this year. The "Pravda" newspaper of the 20th stated: "Judging from Britain's economic situation and strategic position, Britain is the best foothold for attacking Europe. To attack the European continent from Britain, it is only necessary to break through the 33-kilometer-wide English Channel."

Soviet Reasons

The Soviet Union argues that the Second Front must be opened this year for the following reasons:

Due to the progress of the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front and the Axis retreat from Sicily, the current international situation presents an excellent opportunity to open the Second Front.

The Soviet army is resisting the entire pressure of the German army and launching a major war against Germany without rest. The delayed opening of the Second Front increases the burden on the Soviet army.

The delay of the Second Front contributes to the strengthening of the German defense capabilities.

Autumn is coming soon, and the autumn climate is not conducive to landing operations, making them extremely difficult. The favorable period for landing operations is only ten weeks.

Launch Attack on Europe Within Ten Weeks, Using Britain as a Base

Judging from what is said in the Soviet newspapers, the attitudes of Britain and the United States toward the Second Front issue seem to be different. First, regarding the timing of opening the Second Front, according to a recent issue of "War and the Working Class," some British politicians do not consider it such an imminent and urgent issue, but the Soviet Union believes that this is precisely an extremely urgent issue.

Second, regarding the location of opening the Second Front, judging from the recent operations of the anti-Axis forces, it seems that the Mediterranean has the possibility of becoming the main battlefield, but the aforementioned "Pravda" report believes that attacking Western Europe with Britain as a base can achieve greater results than operations in the Mediterranean. The newspaper pointed out that in Mediterranean operations, the transportation and replenishment of troops require more than twenty times the ship tonnage, and therefore advocated attacking Western Europe.

Future Developments Worth Watching

During the Quebec Conference, various discussions were apparently held regarding when and where to open the Second Front. The Soviet Union is watching the future of the conference with deep concern and awaiting its outcome. However, at this important moment, the Soviet government replaced its ambassadors to both Britain and the United States, which is extremely noteworthy.

### Chairman Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce Discusses Purchasing Cotton Yarn and Cloth

Seeking Legal and Proper Solutions for Merchants and Citizens Within the Scope of Not Violating the Spirit of Control

(Central News Agency) - The National General Chamber of Commerce has been ordered to handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. A separate office has been established and is continuing to actively carry out this task. September 6th is the deadline for applications, and those who apply after the deadline will be subject to legal penalties. On the one hand, experts in the yarn and cloth industry have been hired to be responsible for assessing the quality of the goods, in order to clarify the purchase process and the future distribution situation. Our reporter was specially dispatched to interview Chairman Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce to inquire about everything. He gave the following statement:

Purchase Will Not Be Extended, Do Not Delay and Mislead Yourself

This time, our association has been ordered by the government to purchase cotton yarn and cloth. An office has been organized to handle this matter. Regarding the assessment of the quality of the goods, because we are afraid that people outside the industry will not be able to identify and assess them properly, we have hired people from the yarn and cloth industry to be responsible for the assessment. The nature of our association is a commercial collective. We have a duty to protect the legitimate interests of merchants, and we always take this as our purpose. The deadline for purchase is September 6th, as ordered by the government. There will be no further extensions. Our association believes that merchants and citizens who have not applied after the deadline will be subject to legal penalties, so we have repeatedly notified everyone that they must not have the same mentality as the previous registration, thinking that it can be supplemented repeatedly, which would be a self-inflicted mistake.

The Authorities Have Already Explained Future Handling Methods

There are rumors outside that there are doubts about the handling of the yarn and cloth after the purchase. The government authorities in Shanghai have already invited yarn and cloth industry leaders to explain that after the purchase, distribution methods will be formulated and announced for implementation to meet the needs of the people. If there is any movement out, it must be on the principle of exchanging goods. The distribution methods are said to be under investigation and planning, and will be announced and implemented soon. The distribution of cotton yarn and cloth to factories that use them as raw materials has also been considered, but it is necessary to first investigate the inventory of finished products and estimate the amount needed by the people before making regulations, so that finished products do not flood the market and cause overproduction, which would cause losses to manufacturing factories. Our association, standing in the position of a commercial collective, is always thinking about the interests of merchants, but because of our responsibilities, we can only seek legal and proper solutions for merchants within the scope of not violating the spirit of control. Beyond this, it is beyond our ability. This point should be understood by all business leaders.

It Is Absolutely Impossible to Pay the Price in One Lump Sum

Furthermore, it has also been mentioned that regarding the price of the purchase in accordance with government regulations, we are currently discussing with the Central Trust of China on how to make it convenient for the people based on government orders. As for the delivery of gold, it is all handled by the Central Trust, and of course it can be done in accordance with government regulations, so there is no need to worry. There is also a general discussion that the price should be paid in one lump sum to the yarn and cloth holders. This matter is closely related to preventing malignant currency inflation and is for the sake of people's livelihood and commodity prices, so it is absolutely impossible. Moreover, since the announcement of the purchase of yarn and cloth, up to now, no one has made a formal request to our association, which shows that the general public can also deeply understand this meaning.

Furthermore, the office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in this city has been established and has begun operations, and a deadline has been set for supplementary registration, which ends on the 6th. Therefore, all large and small cotton yarn and cloth shops and stores in this city have uniformly stopped selling cloth from the 1st of this month to sort out their inventory in order to report the facts truthfully and comply with the law. The Shanghai Cloth Industry Association issued a special notice yesterday stating, "Those who hold stack receipts issued by dyeing and weaving factories that are members of this association should apply for purchase within the deadline in accordance with the notice of the General Chamber of Commerce's office for the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Those who have not yet registered should also go to register and apply for purchase within the deadline. The removal permit issued by the purchase office, together with the stack receipt issued by the factory, should be presented to the factory to pick up the goods and transport them to the designated warehouse, and handle all procedures after applying for purchase. For the convenience of the receipt holders and the factory, receipt holders who have already registered or are supplementing registration should contact the factories that issued the stack receipts to avoid delays." The Yarn Shop Industry Association and the Cotton Products Industry Joint Association have also issued notices urging their members to apply for sale in accordance with the law, and must not have a wait-and-see attitude, so as not to be penalized for delay. If there are any acts of evasion, once discovered by the investigation agencies separately designated by the Executive Yuan, they will be punished in accordance with the law.

### No Changes to the Jurisdiction of the Eighth District

The Shanghai Special Municipal Government, in order to establish the future prosperity of Greater Shanghai, has re-determined the scope of jurisdiction of the First District Public Office. Recently, there have been rumors that the jurisdiction of the Eighth District will also be changed, and that half of the walled city area of Nanshi will be划入管辖 Eighth District's jurisdiction, etc. A reporter from the Central News Agency specially visited the authorities concerned yesterday. According to them: The re-determination of the First District's jurisdiction is an established policy of the municipal government, to help promote the vigorous development of various industries. The rumors of changes in the jurisdiction of the Eighth District are purely speculations by the general public and are not reliable. So far, there has been no talk of any changes in the territory of the Nanshi District.

### Students Selected for Gu's Entrusted Scholarship Fund Determined: Yao Zhaobin and Four Others

Gu Xinyi, Cheng Yi, and Zhong Qian specially established a middle school student scholarship fund for impoverished students in memory of their late father, Mr. Gu Ding, with five scholarships. All school fees, miscellaneous fees, and book fees stipulated by the school will be borne. If the academic performance is excellent, the funding will continue until graduation from high school. They previously sent a letter entrusting this newspaper to select and recommend students. After the preliminary examination of the middle school group for the previous scholarship fund, the five students who ranked at the top were Quan Jinkun, Liu Yiquan, Xi Dekai, Wu Bichang, and Zhang Lizhen. After individual investigations of impoverished families, they were recommended to the Gu family for funding. In this session, Quan Jinkun, Pei Dekai, and Zhang Lizhen, who are still performing well in school, will continue to be recommended. The two students, Liu Yiquan and Wu Bichang, gave up learning for business due to the hardships of their family environment. After the Scholarship Fund Committee decided, the two students who ranked at the top in the second group of the junior high school section in this session were selected to fill the vacancies, so that the academic programs would be consistent. After investigating the students' family conditions and confirming that they were truly impoverished, Yao Zhaoxiao and Jin Gan were selected. The Gu family has been notified for review. Other cases entrusted by various circles are also being processed.

Students who submitted letters yesterday requesting to cancel the scholarship that had already been approved include Chen Zhongshi, Wang Shide of the junior high school section, Zhang Guangyin of the university section, and Cui Jintang of the industry and commerce section.

The press bears the mission of cultural ambassadors, and the exchange of Chinese and Japanese cultures is not only essential for building the new Shanghai, but also necessary for building Greater East Asia. What efforts should the Sino-Japanese press make in this regard? Wu Chengzhi of the Xin Zhongguo Bao and Hiroshi Kojima of the Tairiku Shinpo expressed their views.

### Factories Applying to Restore Special Rice Rationing

After the Rice and Flour Purchasing and Preparation Section of the Economic Department of the First District Public Office reduced the special rice ration for factories to half a liter in order to centralize the rationing of rice for households, the factories are now requesting an increase from the section, as it is not enough for the factory workers to eat.

Correction

To the editor:

I recently saw a news item in your newspaper titled "Fire in Dongxinqiao Street Kills Eight." The article stated that "two barrels of highly flammable paint raw materials were stored in the writing room of the Xinhua Paint Factory on the second floor of No. 20, Yuzang Lane, Dongxinqiao Street, Eighth District. At 5:00 PM on the 29th, the fire suddenly broke out due to excessive weather." After investigation, our factory office moved to No. 50, Kangrong Village, Foch Road in October of last year. There is a registered household there. The second floor is the writing room of the Huasheng Guohuo Department Store. The report does not conform to the facts. I am writing to request that you correct the error.

Sincerely,

Xinhua Paint Manufacturing Co., Ltd.

Brief Commentary

### Reading Commander Kamata's Farewell Speech and Welcoming the New Commander Matsushima

Commander Kamata, the Public Relations Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, has been ordered to take up an important position in Korea. He will soon leave office and has issued a farewell speech expressing his sorrow at parting. We were deeply moved after reading it.

Commander Kamata has been in China for more than ten years, spending the most time in Shanghai. He is quite familiar with the situation in China and has made the greatest efforts to promote Sino-Japanese relations. He is of a kind disposition and is truly a "friend of China." Since taking up the position of Public Relations Officer of the Fleet, and especially since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, he has devoted himself to the responsibility of protecting Chinese cultural propaganda work and guiding and promoting the significance of Sino-Japanese cooperation in joint operations. His contributions have been outstanding.

In addition, from the standpoint of this newspaper, it is particularly worth mentioning that Commander Kamata is the supervisor in charge of this newspaper. He has been very respectful and supportive of the past history and characteristics of this newspaper, so that it has been able to fully play its role as a civil forum and promote the significance of the Greater East Asia War. This great vision of valuing Chinese civil forums is truly admirable.

On the occasion of Commander Kamata's triumphant return to his country, we wish him a bright future and good health.

At the same time, we welcome Commander Matsushima to take over. Commander Matsushima is a well-known writer in the Japanese Navy and is even more concerned about cultural undertakings. We sincerely hope that Commander Matsushima will carry forward the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, assist the development of Chinese cultural undertakings, and work together for the victory of the Greater East Asia War!

Track and field sports in Shanghai have been declining in recent years.

### Press Conference by Kamada of the Japanese Fleet Public Relations Department, Mr. Matsushima's Address to the Press Corps

Central News Agency Dispatch: The Public Relations Officer of the Japanese Fleet in China, Colonel Masaichi Kamada, has been ordered to transfer and will be succeeded by Colonel Keizo Matsushima. The two Public Relations Officers, yesterday at 3 p.m. at the regular meeting of the Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs authorities, hosted reporters from various Chinese newspapers in the city. In addition to the personal attendance of the two Public Relations Officers, Lieutenant Tanaka, Trustee Sakazume, Information Director Hirota of the Shanghai Office of the Embassy, and Vice Consul Fukuma were also present. During the meeting, Colonel Kamada introduced the new Public Relations Officer, Colonel Matsushima, and Mr. Matsushima gave a speech. The meeting concluded at around 5 p.m.

Address by the New Public Relations Officer, Mr. Matsushima

"I am deeply honored to be appointed to the important post of Public Relations Officer of the Fleet in China following Colonel Kamada, and to be able to engage in the task of reporting under the decisive battle with the cooperation of all of you. I am of meager virtue and talent, and deeply feel the weight of responsibility, but I am determined to strive to avoid disgracing the illustrious achievements built by my predecessor. However, I am unfamiliar with the local situation. Moreover, I have little experience in reporting and hope that you will not hesitate to provide guidance and cooperation. The war situation has shown an increasingly fierce decisive battle, and the fighting on the Pacific front is becoming more and more self-evident. Our loyal Japanese soldiers are day and night annihilating stubborn enemies on land, sea, and air. At the same time, on the mainland, they are even busier with operational preparations and construction. During this period, under the consolidation of solidarity between China and Japan, the total strength is exerted for the completion of the Greater East Asia Holy War to continue the cause of the new East Asian nations, and to march toward the path of defeating the Anglo-Americans in a shared destiny of life and death. However, from now on, it is even more necessary to thoroughly understand the great righteousness of the Holy War, to shatter the enemy's violent aggression with the true value of Oriental culture, and to seek the final victory. We, who bear the important responsibility of reporting, should especially realize that our responsibility is becoming increasingly important. Unyielding and unwavering, this is our creed. I hope to work with you, with the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, to invigorate the reporting front and complete the important task."

Brief Biography of Colonel Matsushima

Colonel Keizo Matsushima, who succeeds the outgoing Fleet Public Relations Officer, is also an expert on China, with talent no less than that of Colonel Kamada. Mr. Matsushima graduated from the Naval Academy in Showa 6 (1931). From the summer of Showa 7 to the end of Showa 8, he served as a staff officer in the Shanghai Marine Corps. In August of Showa 12, he was dispatched to the Shanghai Military Attaché Office with a propaganda mission. In September of Showa 14, he served as the Executive Officer of the Izumo warship, protecting the Yangtze River, with outstanding achievements. This appointment as Public Relations Officer marks his fifth visit to Shanghai. Although Colonel Matsushima is a military man, he is also skilled in writing, with a well-known literary reputation. He has written famous works such as "Controlling the Sea, Real Victory," which describes the first phase of naval operations after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and has received much praise, truly a man of both literary and military talent.

Farewell Address by Colonel Kamada

"On the occasion of my ordered transfer, I would like to say a few words to bid farewell. Having been involved with China for more than ten years, I feel infinite emotion at leaving China. What I cannot forget most during my tenure is that the National Government has taken up the construction of a new order in Greater East Asia as one of its tasks, and has announced a declaration of war against Britain and the United States with firm belief and enthusiasm. This is an unprecedented historical spectacle, and I am delighted that the National Government has resolutely participated in the Greater East Asia War and has made its strong will and implementation known both internally and externally. This is the expression of an enthusiasm that cannot be suppressed, aiming to unlock the common destiny of Asia for eternity. Japan has no ambition in Asia as the enemy propagates, as is evident from the handover of the concessions, and there is no need for further explanation. However, Britain and the United States have exhausted all their schemes to monopolize Asia and disregard the demands and development posture of this Greater East Asian cooperation for survival. Under their instigation, the Chiang Kai-shek regime, which has misinterpreted the meaning of Greater East Asian coexistence and co-prosperity, has adopted an anti-Japanese policy, truly creating contradictions in East Asia. These contradictions cannot be resolved by ordinary means, and I sincerely hope that Chongqing will soon gain awareness of Greater East Asia. Today's Greater East Asia War, due to the unprecedented results of our war in history, has completely placed the Philippines, the East Indies, Malaya, Burma, and other Pacific islands under our control, laying the foundation for the establishment of the so-called Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. We can say that the decisive battle will be from today onwards. Therefore, in order to eliminate the brutality of Britain and the United States and to achieve the common goal of building East Asia, the National Government must realize that there are still many hardships. On the occasion of my departure, I would like to urge our friendly nation, China, to rise up."

Brief Biography of Colonel Kamada

Colonel Kamada graduated from the Military Academy in Taisho 5 (1916) and was commissioned as a naval ensign in December of the same year. In Showa 6, he served as an adjutant and staff officer in the Shanghai Special Marine Corps. In Showa 9, he served as the captain of a warship. In Showa 13, he served as the executive officer. In Showa 14, he was appointed as a naval colonel and was ordered to be the military attaché in Shantou. On the 15th day of the 10th month of Showa 15, he served as an assistant to the naval attaché in Shanghai and as a staff officer of the China Area Fleet, and as a member of the Shanghai Naval Route Department, and made special efforts in customs countermeasures and the renovation of the Port of Shanghai. On September 1, he served as an assistant to the naval attaché in Shanghai and as a staff officer of the China Area Fleet, and has been in charge of internal and external publicity and reporting for the China Area Fleet since then. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and the entry of the Japanese army into the concessions, he immediately began to take over and handle the news agencies used by the news agencies together with the implementing troops. At the same time, he also took on the task of forming and strengthening Japanese newspapers, dealing with and cracking down on prohibited radios, and preparing Chinese communications, guiding the creation of public opinion circles, and striving to promote Sino-Japanese cooperation.

Commentary

### The Future of the Commercial Control Association

The National Commercial Control Association three months ago was in an era when its internal structure was not yet complete. Today's National Commercial Control Association is not only fully equipped in scale, but also holds full control. - It is not only the organization that handles the purchase and distribution of cotton yarn, but also the organization that manages food.

Speaking of commercial control which is vested with major problems relating to people's clothing and food, it is already the case that they are not talking about issues regarding the distribution of cotton yarn and food, otherwise, they have an unshirkable responsibility. We believe that the Commercial Control Association will value its distribution responsibilities as much as it values its purchase responsibilities, in other words, it will handle distribution with the same spirit and power as it handles purchasing. At the same time, we believe that after the Commercial Control Bureau promulgates the distribution methods formulated by the government, it will be able to publicly announce to the public the process of its execution of distribution from time to time. It must be known that the reason why the people welcome purchasing is none other than because they welcome distribution.

Therefore, we earnestly hope that the future Commercial Control Association will have close contact with the press to avoid the truth being unknown to the outside world.

### Industry Associations Establish Purchasing and Distribution Groups, Statistical Needs, and Proportional Distribution

Since April of this year, industry associations in this city have successively implemented reorganization in accordance with the orders of the relevant authorities. In addition to revising the original articles of association, they have also changed the directors and supervisors. To date, the major industry associations have been completely reorganized, and the secondary associations have also completed 70% to 80% of the reorganization work. In order to adapt to the government's economic policies, the persons in charge of the various associations have strived to renovate the association's organization and have established close ties with the competent authorities, hoping that officials and merchants can fully cooperate. Summarizing the key points of the work after the reorganization of the various associations' organizations, it is nothing more than concentrating on purchasing and distribution. In order to strengthen work efficiency, the various associations have specially established two specialized groups for the purchase and distribution of materials, so that materials can circulate smoothly in the current wartime situation to enrich people's livelihoods.

Appeal to the Authorities for Assistance in Procurement

The shortage of wartime materials is originally an inevitable phenomenon, but if no measures are taken to remedy it, the materials needed for people's daily life will easily be insufficient, and the price of such materials will inevitably soar. As a result, people's livelihoods will be insecure. In view of the fact that it is extremely difficult for members to purchase raw materials individually, and the transportation costs are also quite large, the various associations have decided to collect the materials needed by their members on a monthly basis. The various associations have compiled the various materials used by their members each month into a table, and plan to purchase them on a large scale from the producing areas on a monthly basis according to this standard. In order to make the purchase smooth, it is necessary to ask the relevant authorities for full assistance. The various associations have already submitted a request to the competent authorities, and on the one hand, they are allocating funds, sending purchasing agents, and considering transportation methods.

Collected Materials Are Distributed to Members

After the original materials are collected by the association in one day, they will be distributed to the members in full according to the purchase price. However, the scale of the members' stores varies, and the raw materials needed each month are also different. Therefore, the association will divide all the members into four levels: A, B, C, and D, and distribute them according to the level ratio. However, once a member obtains materials, they must all be used for legitimate purposes, and they are absolutely not allowed to sell them privately. Moreover, the finished products of the materials should be sold to legitimate users in full compliance with the price limit set by the association's evaluation committee. In view of the fact that if members engage in malpractice after the implementation of material distribution, its impact on the market will be significant, the various associations will first conduct credit investigations, examine the history of the members' stores, as well as the reputation and morality of the persons in charge, and then decide whether they can enjoy the right of distribution.

### Bumper Harvest Expected for Agricultural Products in Central China

The Times reports: According to local business circles with access to informed sources, the collection and distribution of important agricultural products in Central China is quite satisfactory. The Wheat Professional Committee has already started collecting 200,000 tons of wheat. Although it is still far from the 800,000 tons projected for this year, it is widely reported that at least 450,000 tons of wheat may be obtained as it was last year. By the end of July, the committee had purchased 146,009 tons of wheat. According to a survey by relevant parties, the output of cotton in the amount of the year has increased greatly, and it is estimated that it will reach about 200,000 dans. This year's corn and other crops can also be harvested in Central China, and it is expected that the authorities can purchase 390,000 dans in various places.

### National Economic Survey Institute to Begin Work

(Central News Agency Dispatch) In order to expand the wartime economic policy system, the National Economic Commission decided to establish the National Economic Survey Institute through the second plenary session of the committee. Mr. Tang Junbo was appointed as the director of the institute (Mr. Tang is a member of the National Economic Commission and the president of Huazhong Hydroelectric Power). After active preparations, the institute will be formally established in the near future and will begin to conduct various economic surveys across the country.

### Industries Handling Year-End Settlements Before the Festival

The 9th and 14th are the Mid-Autumn Festival, and various industries are following the usual practice of handling year-end settlements. For the goods released in the past, lists will be distributed and personnel will be sent to collect them. During this Mid-Autumn Festival settlement, all transactions are limited to cash. As for the funds for the Mid-Autumn Festival of various silver and money industries, they will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations, and the credit of the borrowers will be considered. In order to support the production industry, legitimate funds needed by various factories and firms will continue to be released, but the examination of the use will be particularly cautious, so as to prevent the use of funds from colluding with speculators.

### Strict Prohibition of Transactions by Non-Industry People in the Firewood and Charcoal Industry

Although the firewood and charcoal market situation has been slightly calmer, the selling price is still high. It is reported that the leaders in the industry, in view of the fact that firewood and charcoal are essential necessities for daily cooking of residents, allowing their prices to remain high will inevitably harm the livelihoods of ordinary people. Therefore, they have adopted a symptomatic and radical approach to the entire firewood and charcoal market situation, striving to balance the supply of firewood and charcoal spot goods. In addition to notifying the industry to comply with the association's regulations for buying and selling, and not to pass on a large number of spot goods to non-industry merchants, so as to prevent the evil practice of illegal hoarding, they also ask the authorities to dredge the sources and assist in transportation in order to increase inventory.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks first reported a rebound, and then, after a long period of decline, there was bound to be an aftermath. However, by noon, all stocks rose in unison. In general, people's hearts have been greatly strengthened. Wing On Company of the Department Store rose strongly, and the news of the second capital increase spread widely. Sellers held on to their shares, and the price moved toward a higher level in the midst of fluctuations, and finally rose significantly. Sincere Company followed suit and rose sharply. National Goods rose less. China Underwear and Sundries Company also saw a slight increase. In the textile industry, Da Sheng No. 1 and No. 3 factories still stood at the original price, and Wing On Textile rose slightly. Mei Ya Weaving rose the most sharply. Small denomination stocks such as Xinyi, Hongsheng, and Dachung Textiles all stopped their decline and turned firm. The new medicine industry rose, and new Asia, Sino-French, Five Continents, and Xinyi all made significant progress. China was flat alone, and New Star, Scientific Chemical, and Star Perfume also stood firm. In the cultural industry, the World Bureau is still striving to improve. Commercial Press and Zhonghua in the buying momentum to return upward. Yongxiang, Qungong, Jin Feng, and other paper products all have buying activities. Shanghai Public Utilities is relatively stable. Zhabei Water and Electricity and Public Utility Appliances, Shanghai and Xiangsheng Third Transportation also opened around the previous day's price. Real estate stocks are still stable, and Xin Yi and Yongxing are also slightly higher. Industrial stocks were more sluggish. Jiu An, Xingye, Dachung Industrial, and New Asia Construction, China and National Investment were all slightly down in a sluggish and flat market. Great China Match pulled a higher stock at noon, and rose sharply. Nanyang Tobacco Company showed a tired attitude. Family Industries still stood at the original price. Fumin Dairy was quite active, with a 30% real increase. Standard MSG was particularly firm, and Guanshengyuan and Mei Lin cans all rose. Sanyou Industrial, Anbao Glass, Zhonghua Film, Zhongxing Timber, Defeng Needle, and Dahua Planting all stopped their decline and turned firm.

### Summary of Commercial Situation

Government bonds first weakened and then strengthened yesterday. The middle was more or less exciting, but the trend still cannot be said to have escaped the fluctuating situation. Class C initial trades once rebounded slightly, and then gradually became firmer. By noon, there were buyers, and the situation seemed to have turned around. Class A, B, E, and D were also quietly firm.

Rice and grains: Very few goods arrived from the South Port Gang, and there were not many scattered transactions. Retailers still made purchases, and the price rose compared with the previous market. Northern japonica rice was also firm, and late rice fluctuated.

Miscellaneous grains: Because the Oil and Grain Professional Committee has formulated a purchasing and distribution plan, the implementation period is not up to par, so buyers are not active. Both soybeans and green broad beans have scarce arrivals and sales, and prices have fallen. There is no market for the rest.

Medicinal materials: Sales remained stagnant, foreign and Tianjin Huai goods were all sluggish, and Sichuan goods and Hongqiu were both quiet. The market is tending to be flat and tired.

Woolen fabrics: Industry peers are all holding the view of not entering or exiting for the time being. The prices in this city and other places are mostly inverted, so customers also lack needs. The sales of factories and stores and shops are all weak, and the retail prices are all in accordance with the authorities' limited price range. Due to sluggish sales, the money market is obviously loose and secretly tight, and they have all turned flat and tired.

### Shanghai Office of the Materials Control Deliberation Council Established, Chen Guangzhong Talks About Striving to Complete the Task

In order to control wartime materials, the National Government has separately established the Materials Control Deliberation Council and the National Commercial Control Association. Our country's wartime material control work is progressing step by step. Since the Deliberation Council belongs to the Executive Yuan, in order to facilitate work, an office was established in Shanghai. After active preparations, it was established on the 1st and started office work. A Central News Agency reporter specially visited the office yesterday, and Mr. Chen Guangzhong received him and made the following statement: "The Materials Control Deliberation Council is the highest body for deliberating wartime material control, and the council is located in Nanjing. However, Shanghai is the industrial and economic center of our country. Agricultural products must be transported to be manufactured, and industrial products are transported from Shanghai to various places for manufacturing and sale. This cycle is endless. All of these activities are active in the Shanghai area, which is also the spleen and stomach of the country's destiny. Therefore, the executive body of material control, the National Commercial Control Association, is located in Shanghai, and its intention lies in this. The establishment of this office is to seek close contact with all relevant parties in Shanghai, or to report the opinions of all parties to the General Assembly. Those that can be solved locally due to local conditions can be contacted by this office and the committee members and cadres without missing the opportunity to complete the mission of material control. Since I was ordered to prepare, I was fortunate to have the assistance of all parties, so that I could start working first. The internal organization has also been prepared, and the organizational aspects include a secretariat and two groups, the first and the second, which officially started work on September 1. At the beginning of the opening of this office, in addition to following the order of Chairman Zhou of this council to strive to complete the task of this office, there is nothing else to say. I consider myself to be of meager ability, and I am deeply ashamed. I hope that all parties involved in Sino-Japanese relations will not hesitate to provide guidance and assistance, and I am looking forward to it very much."

### Chinese People and Chinese Language

— Shaosheng

"Chinese language" is the language of the country. All cultured countries have their own languages. Since Chinese is the language of the country, then all citizens of the country should be proficient in the language of the country, that goes without saying.

But regrettably, many young people in our country, under the control of the mentality that "everything foreign is good," must use foreign goods for things needed in life. Therefore, for language, only foreign languages will do. According to them, understanding a few sentences of foreign language is very remarkable and can be used to boast about peers! And those who do not understand foreign languages also have the same mentality of admiration and worship, and feel ashamed and regrettable for not knowing foreign languages! Due to the control of this mentality, Chinese language is discarded like worn-out shoes. We are not against learning foreign languages, and in order to understand foreign things, learning foreign languages is still very necessary. We are only against that kind of blind worship of foreign languages - this is simply a slave mentality - "spiritual subjugation"!

In addition, there is another group of people who, although they do not have the same mentality as the people mentioned above, still do not pay attention to Chinese language, especially the young people who spend money on writing schools. When attending Chinese language class, they often feel bored and disgusted. They are often seen stealing peeks at other books or imitating Zai Yu napping, in order to muddle through this "annoying homework." When the teacher assigns compositions, they often do it perfunctorily, either randomly copying or writing a few words and that's it. This kind of practice is also not acceptable. In the past, the "mediocrity of Chinese language skills" and "unclear thinking" in the preliminary examination of the higher examination were not necessarily the evil consequences of this reason.

We only feel that the attitude of the first type of people towards Chinese language is "too servile," and there is nothing else to say. If they can suddenly wake up, it may not be a great thing. They all do not understand the importance of Chinese language to them, so they have some erroneous mentality. We are willing to contribute some opinions to them.

Let's not talk about how the citizens of a country should be proficient in their language. The effectiveness of Chinese language is multifaceted. No matter what kind of learning you like or what kind of person you hope to be, for example, if you like literature and hope to be a literary writer, then at least you must be proficient in Chinese language in order to write good works, which goes without saying. It is the same if you hope to be a secretary or clerk. If you hope to be a translator, then in addition to being proficient in foreign languages, you must also be equally proficient in Chinese language in order to translate something decent, and achieve the level of Yan Fu's so-called "faithfulness," "elegance," and "expressiveness." As for the narrative texts of news reporters, the texts of political claims by politicians, the creation of complaints by lawyers for clients, the narrative experiment reports of scientists, the prescriptions of doctors, the creation and review reports of accountants, and the making of advertisements by businessmen, all require a proficient level of Chinese language.

In short, Chinese language is something that every citizen must be familiar with and must not be ignored. If you think that Chinese language is not worth learning or that Chinese language can be casual and does not need attention, then this kind of person is not worthy of doing any career, let alone talking about any learning. In fact, Chinese language is the foundation of all learning and all careers, and it should be worked hard to improve. I hope that the general public, especially young people, will be ashamed of not being proficient in Chinese language, and adopt the attitude of "correcting it if we have it, and encouraging ourselves if we don't," and earnestly engage in it!

### Establish Public Education Halls

— Hu Ruoliu

Recently, there have been many articles suggesting to clear the gambling dens and pornographic pamphlets, and the news that the authorities have started to close the gambling dens has also been seen in the newspapers. I think this is a very gratifying phenomenon. However, clearing these places is indeed a difficult task, because the impression in the minds of Shanghai people is too deep. Therefore, to clear these places, we must have public welfare places to replace these places. Therefore, I believe that the widespread establishment of public education halls is necessary.

As for the content of establishing public education halls, my personal opinion is that there are the following points:

Reading rooms and reading rooms should promote normal reading materials, so reading rooms and reading rooms are a good way to promote legitimate reading materials and clear up illegitimate reading materials.

Hold beneficial propaganda to wake up numb people and tell them about all aspects of knowledge

Promote beneficial entertainment and clear up entertainment venues that harm the public, such as song halls, etc. On the other hand, promote entertainment that is beneficial to the public.

Open sports grounds. Shanghai is so big, but there are no places for citizens to exercise. Therefore, I think it is necessary to open sports grounds and promote sports.

In the public opinion section of September 1, someone suggested that the racecourse be rebuilt into a public park. I think there are already as many as seven parks, but there are no sports grounds - public sports grounds, that is - so I think it is better to rebuild the racecourse into a sports ground.
