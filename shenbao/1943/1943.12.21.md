### Combating Smuggling and Eliminating the Black Market

The Rice and Grain Control Committee was established amidst the enthusiastic anticipation of the citizens and the urgent needs of the objective environment. It was in preparation since the end of August, lasting a full month. Having been established not quite four months ago, with over 270 internal staff and nearly a thousand in other locations, spending tens of millions of dollars, how are the achievements of the committee so far? What contributions has it made to the people's food supply? We are willing to conduct a faithful and objective review to discuss it with the committee and the public.

On September 8th, Chairman Yuan told a reporter from the New China Daily: "The procurement of rice and grain is originally an extremely difficult task. Regardless of the past performance of the United Rice and Grain Cooperative, we should reform it from now on. I will, based on the principle of serving the society and benefiting the people, lead my colleagues to work together on this important issue of people's livelihood, so that our citizens will have no worry about food, to live up to the earnest expectations of the citizens."

On October 9th, Chairman Yuan said: "...If we want the control to succeed, personnel issues are also extremely important. The rice and grain control is still in its infancy, and we should establish a good reputation and set an example. As the leader, I must strictly supervise all staff to eliminate corruption and maintain integrity. I also hope that people in society will pay attention and report any issues at any time, so that we can listen to all sides and complete our mission."

On November 6th, the New China Daily reported, according to the Rice Control Committee, each rice district can find ways to transport 270,000 bags of rice to Shanghai each month, which is double the 150,000 bags per month by the previous United Rice and Grain Cooperative. Rationing per household can hopefully increase to between two and two and a half liters per month.

On November 26th, the Central News Agency reported that the procurement work is progressing smoothly. The rice and grain collected by the committee's procurement merchants in various regions has reached a considerable amount and will soon be transported to Shanghai in large quantities to relieve the people's food shortage.

On November 27th, the Central News Agency reported that the Rice Control Committee recently found that rice and grain smuggling in the two urban districts is becoming increasingly rampant, affecting the grain policy. In addition to instructing its offices in various regions to strengthen control and procurement, it has also requested the assistance of the municipal police to crack down on smuggling in order to protect the grain policy.

On December 8th, it was reported that the Grain Control Committee is actively procuring rice. A large amount of rice and grain has been collected in various regions, but due to slight inconvenience in transportation, the rationing of rice per household in the city has been slightly delayed. After working hard to adjust, 100,000 dan of civilian rice has recently been transported, and it has been decided to use this rice for rationing to households. It is also heard that a large batch of rice is being transported to Shanghai in a continuous stream, and it is expected that it can be rationed by the head before the 20th.

The above excerpts are public news after the establishment of the Rice Control Committee. Some were released by the committee itself, and some were approved by the committee. In short, these are the credit guarantees that the Rice Control Committee provided to the public, and the public must demand that they be honored. Because the issue of people's food is important, it is by no means a child's play.

Now, we further review the work of the Rice Control Committee. Apart from other things, in terms of household rice rationing alone, only eight rations totaling eight liters have been provided in the past four months. Compared to expectations, the two shortcomings of "reduced quantity" and "missed deadlines" are already ironclad facts. Moreover, these rations were not directly handled by the Rice Control Committee, but were from previous reserves. All of these show that the Rice Control Committee has failed to honor its credit guarantees and failed to fulfill its responsibilities.

Controlled economy is still a pioneering undertaking in our country. Whether the promotion in the future is smooth or not depends entirely on the public's understanding and cooperation. To gain the public's understanding and cooperation, we must first establish the credibility of the controlled economy. Rice and grain control is the main livelihood item in the controlled economy, and it is particularly important to establish credibility. However, the impression that the Rice Control Committee has given to the public in the past four months is repeated breach of trust, the consequence of which is to weaken the effectiveness of promoting the controlled economy, and at the same time, the people's food is more seriously threatened.

Secondly, as the amount of household rice rationed becomes less and less, the price of black market rice becomes increasingly higher, currently reaching 2,450 yuan per stone. We cannot help but ask:

If the reduction in household rice rations is due to a shortage of rice and grain, where does the continuous supply of black market rice come from?

If the reduction in household rice rations is due to transportation difficulties, how can the black market rice come in?

Since rice and grain have been controlled, why is there still smuggling? Since rice and grain are rationed at official prices, why is there still a black market? With smuggling and a black market, who should the controller blame?

Since it cannot control procurement, crack down on smuggling, provide sufficient rations, or eliminate the black market, why does it passively delay matters, only causing suffering to the people's livelihood? How can it explain itself?

In conclusion, according to the current facts, there is no fear of rice and grain shortage, and transportation is not too difficult, because black market rice can come in continuously. The focus of the problem is the huge difference between the official price of household rice and the underground price of black market rice, so people are blinded by profit and are not on the right track. There are a lot of complaints about the Rice Control Committee issuing procurement certificates fraudulently, for example. Recently, staff of the Cotton Management Office of the Business Control Committee committed fraud. The committee immediately thoroughly investigated and severely punished them without any leniency, which is a very realistic example for the Rice Control Committee. I hope it will conduct a thorough investigation and severe punishment. At the same time, all levels of personnel of the Rice Control Committee must thoroughly self-discipline, promote the sense of responsibility for serving the people's food, and absolutely achieve no smuggling, no black market, sufficient rations, and on-time rations, otherwise, passively delaying matters and failing to act cannot allow the dereliction of duty of a few people to harm the lives of the public.

### The Japanese Garrison on Tarawa and Makin Islands Heroically Sacrificed Themselves, Fighting Bravely for Six Days and Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Superior Enemy Forces

Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 3:15 PM on the 20th: The Imperial Marines defending Tarawa Island and Makin Island have, since November 21st, engaged the enemy landing forces of over 50,000 with only 3,000 troops, resisting the enemy's fierce bombing and naval gunfire. As a result of days of fierce fighting, the enemy suffered heavy losses several times greater than ours, and restrained the enemy's powerful mobile units, making many contributions to the naval and air operations of our forces. On November 25th, they carried out a final charge, and the entire unit was honorably annihilated. The commander was Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki. In addition, approximately 1,500 military personnel who had cooperated with the garrison in defending the two islands were also honorably annihilated.

Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - Regarding the honorable annihilation of the Japanese Marines and military personnel defending Tarawa Island and Makin Island, the General Headquarters has announced that the Japanese forces honorably annihilated this time included 3,000 Marines and 1,500 military personnel engaged in facility management and other duties. The commander was Rear Admiral Keiji Shibasaki. "The Marines were widely known throughout the world for their heroic battles in Shanghai in 1932 and 1937, and now a glorious page has been added to their history. The great tasks completed by these Marines and military personnel on the front lines, and the impact on the overall war situation, are beyond description. Because the communication equipment was destroyed too early, the battle history of the garrisons on both islands cannot be fully known, but judging from the foreign news reports, it is clear that they fought bravely. This is a page in world war history that will be remembered forever. What we should pay particular attention to is the fact that 1,500 military personnel also fought alongside the Marines to the end and were honorably annihilated. So many military personnel were needed on the front-line islands in order to make these islands the first line of defense for protecting the Japanese mainland and preventing enemy invasion, so it was necessary to greatly strengthen the various facilities in the area. These military personnel cooperated with the troops in carrying out their missions at all times before their honorable annihilation. Remembering the words of Marshal Togo, 'Enemies coming from the sea should be defended against', the first line of island nation Japan is in the Pacific. The current situation is becoming increasingly tense, and it has reached the point of decisive battle and is entering a long-term war. At this time of decisive battle, following the 4,500 heroic spirits who were honorably annihilated is the way to win the long-term war. The 4,500 heroic spirits are also an alarm bell for the total struggle of 100 million Japanese people."

### Situation of Fierce Fighting by Japanese Marines

Colonel Kurihara Broadcast Last Night

Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - Colonel Eizo Kurihara, head of the Naval Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, broadcasted at 7:20 PM on the 20th on the situation of fierce fighting by the Japanese Marines and military personnel who cooperated in the operation of defending Tarawa and Makin Islands. The gist is revised as follows: The General Headquarters announced today that the 3,000 Marines and 1,500 military personnel defending Tarawa and Makin Islands have been fighting with all their might since November 19th, valiantly sacrificing themselves after heavily damaging the enemy forces of about 50,000 troops who attacked the Gilbert Islands, fully demonstrating the glorious tradition of the Navy. The United States, fearing that our country would increasingly strengthen the invincible and undefeated attitude established by the illustrious battle results in the war and the increasingly advanced great cause of establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, recently shouted "Don't give Japan time" and launched a large-scale counterattack as soon as possible. For example, on November 1st, the enemy attempted to land on Bougainville Island in the Solomon Islands with many aircraft carriers and battleships. Our troops and air force immediately launched a counterattack upon receiving the report, repeatedly defeating the enemy forces in the sea near the island, sinking and destroying 11 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, transport ships, etc., and shooting down 576 enemy aircraft. After the enemy's counterattack was frustrated in the Solomon Islands, they launched a powerful mobile unit (based on aircraft carriers and battleships) on November 19th to escort transport convoys to Tarawa and Makin Islands, our advanced bases in the Gilbert Islands. Our Marines immediately engaged them. On that day, approximately 900 enemy aircraft attacked Tarawa Island, dropping bombs like rain, so some of the defense facilities were destroyed.

The garrison troops suffered slight casualties, but the morale of the garrison troops became more vigorous. In the midst of heavy enemy bombing, they shot down 31 enemy aircraft. On the morning of the 20th, another 200 enemy aircraft bombed the island again and shelled the island with five battleships, cruisers, and destroyers for twelve hours. Our Marines immediately launched a counterattack, shooting down 23 enemy aircraft. At the same time, approximately 300 enemy aircraft attacked Makin Island, and the Marines on the island immediately repelled them, shooting down 12 enemy aircraft. At dawn on the 20th, the enemy approached the two islands with approximately 150 amphibious tanks and hundreds of landing craft and began landing, engaging in fierce ground combat with our guard troops. The enemy bombed and shelled the islands for two days, spending approximately 2,200 tons of artillery shells and 700 tons of bombs. The enemy thought that the resistance of our Marines had been exhausted, but our Marines, who were waiting for an opportunity, began firing when the enemy landing craft approached the shore, causing most of them to sink into the sea. The enemy forces were immediately thrown into chaos. The enemy's vanguard tank force was trapped by our solid tank trenches and heavy firepower positions, or caught fire and stalled, or was overturned by bullets. The enemy's landing craft were either blown to pieces or overturned in the sea. The enemy landing force was annihilated on the water's edge at that time, but the enemy relied on its large number of troops and sent additional reinforcements to attack, and at dawn, they dispatched a large number of fighters and bombers to bombard our military positions, causing the strength of our Marines to gradually weaken. Finally, the enemy landed in a corner of the island, but the morale of our army became even more vigorous. According to the official report on the 21st, after fierce fighting, although our army suffered considerable losses, it still drove more than 5,000 landing enemy troops to the coast and planned to encircle and annihilate them from three sides in the evening. Since the 19th, our army had been fighting continuously, sleepless and without food or drink for days, so the enemy army suffered heavy losses after the fierce attack by the Japanese Marines on the night of the 21st and did not dare to land for a while, but the enemy army finally saw through that our army was outnumbered and transferred a large number of reinforcements, beginning to land on the morning of the 22nd, attempting to resolve our Marines in one fell swoop, but our army had made up its mind to defend to the death, and under the enemy's heavy bombing and shelling, they resisted the large enemy forces with few troops and did not retreat an inch. According to the report at 1:00 PM that day, "The battle situation has not changed." However, after this telegram was sent, communication between Tarawa Island and Makin Island was interrupted because the wireless telegraph machine was destroyed, so the situation of the fierce fighting of the Japanese Marines on the national islands could not be known afterwards. However, according to the reconnaissance by friendly aircraft cooperating in the operation and the enemy's announcement, it can be inferred that the general situation is as follows: The members of our Marines received the Emperor's decree in the late night of the 22nd,

The entire team became more courageous.

According to the reconnaissance of the friendly aircraft sent to rescue on the 23rd, it was confirmed that our army was firmly defending the position of the previous day and had not retreated a step, but the army and combat team felt that the strength was becoming weaker and weaker, and the enemy army was constantly deploying new troops to land, so our commander Major General Shibasaki saw this urgent situation and personally led his troops into the enemy's position. The US Navy authorities also said, "The Tarawa Island operation was the greatest sacrifice made by the US military since the start of the war. The number of deaths in such a short period of time is unprecedented in the history of war." At that time, naval air squadrons and submarine units also attacked the enemy's aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, destroyers, and other enemy ships at sea, because the enemy army attempted to capture Tarawa Island and Makin Island in one fell swoop. After several attacks, 11 enemy aircraft carriers, battleships, cruisers, and other ships were sunk, resulting in great victories. The 3,000 soldiers of our Marines on Tarawa and Makin Islands were trapped on a lonely island in the Pacific Ocean, fighting against the enemy's 50,000 troops, heavily damaging the enemy forces, and stubbornly defending the two islands until the last soldier. Taking advantage of the enemy's carelessness, they achieved brilliant battle results. Even the United States, which is known for its strong productivity, has suffered a major blow and cannot recover in a long time. The 3,000 soldiers of our Marines shed blood on the coral reefs under the equator, making great sacrifices and enabling our entire army to carry out powerful operations. This is truly worthy of praise. Commander Major General Shibasaki served as the Chief of Staff of the Shanghai Naval Special Landing Force for a year and a half. He was particularly brave and decisive in land combat, was extremely sensitive to opportunities, and always took the lead in facing difficulties, fulfilling his ambition to share the joys and sorrows with his subordinates. He was a typical military commander. Now the enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, are launching a counterattack against us with all their strength, but the countless islands in the Pacific Ocean are our army's advanced bases, and together with our naval forces, they form

An Iron Wall of Defense.

The soldiers of the garrison are determined to die. The enemy, the United Kingdom and the United States, rely on their abundant resources and huge production capacity to carry out counterattacks steadily, but in front of our army, they will ultimately be in vain.

### Japan Faces a Critical Period, Determined to Promote Strong Politics. The 84th Session of Parliament is Scheduled to Convene on Friday.

Tokyo, 20th, Central News Agency - The 84th regular session of the Japanese Parliament is scheduled to convene as scheduled on the 24th of this month. The government has prepared the budget bill to be submitted to this parliament, and the Political Affairs Association is also conducting meticulous investigations. The government, during this critical period, has decided to make consolidating political power the only important task, concentrating the labor of all aspects of the country, and promoting decisive politics. The parliament's main task is to stimulate the people's strong fighting spirit and adhere to the attitude of supporting the government. The main issues of this parliament will be to enhance the belief in victory and strengthen productivity measures. In his policy speech at this parliament, Prime Minister Tojo will explain the battle situation in Bougainville Island, Gilbert Island, Burma, and China, as well as the war situation in Europe, and frankly state the magnificent operations of the Japanese army and the future trend, in order to arouse the people to rise up unanimously. He will also elaborate on the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere centered on the Greater East Asia Conference. The government will also take this opportunity to announce to the people to work hard to achieve the above goals. In addition, issues such as increasing the production of aircraft and ships and securing food will also become the central issues of this parliament. Various meticulous plans will also be made regarding the decisive tax increase bill to be submitted to this parliament. It is foreseeable that a historically significant great statement will be made during this parliament. It is expected that a considerable number of questioners will also be present in this parliament to question the policy speech. In every parliament, there is the issue of shortening the deliberation time. Rather than shortening the time, it is better to focus the discussion on key points, and some say that extending the session is harmless. The long-term convening of the parliament is because the Japanese government and the parliament are completely connected as one. Under this circumstance, it can enhance the effect. There are also many who advocate that the parliament should be fully utilized as one wing of the decisive system. This truly implies the characteristics of this parliament.

### US Violates International Law: Blindly Bombs Hospital Ship, Japan Lodges Strong Protest

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – The enemy's intensification of the war has led to repeated illegal acts. Since the naval hospital ship Takasago Maru was illegally attacked by an enemy submarine on April 26th of last year, there have been as many as eleven incidents of enemy submarines and aircraft attacking Japanese naval hospital ships. Japan has twice lodged strong protests with the enemy through its protecting power, demanding that the enemy reflect on its actions and warning them to exercise caution in the future. However, the enemy not only disregarded these protests, but also, at 8:10 AM on November 27th, illegally bombed the Japanese military hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru with a single B-24 Liberator aircraft in the sea 200 kilometers north of Kavieng, New Ireland, sinking the ship. Despite strenuous rescue efforts by the Japanese military, the dead, injured, and missing still numbered as many as 174 (including wounded soldiers being transported to the rear, medical personnel, nurses, and crew). The enemy aircraft, ignoring the clear Red Cross markings, even strafed lifeboats and survivors with machine guns. Afterwards, the Japanese side conducted a detailed investigation of the survivors and the circumstances of the incident. Only recently has the truth been ascertained. Now, the enemy's illegal behavior can no longer be concealed, and Japanese officials and citizens are exceptionally indignant. The head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese Imperial Headquarters also pointed out these facts in a speech on December 10th, strongly denouncing the enemy's illegal actions. The Japanese Foreign Ministry has decided to formally lodge a protest, detailing the truth of the incident as determined by Japanese investigation, pursuing the enemy's responsibility, and demanding guarantees that similar incidents will not occur in the future. If the enemy does not take sincere measures, Japan will also take decisive action. The protest has been delivered to the United States by Spain, Japan's protecting power. All procedures have been completed by the Japanese Minister to Spain, Suma.

Contents of the Protest

After releasing a statement on the 20th, the Japanese diplomatic authorities also published the protest as follows: The Imperial hospital ship Buenos Aires Maru, while sailing at 8:10 AM on November 27th at 2 degrees 40 minutes south latitude and 149 degrees 20 minutes east longitude, was suddenly attacked by a single B-24 Liberator aircraft of the American military, which dropped bombs, and sank approximately 40 minutes later. The aircraft approached the ship's stern from the direction opposite the sun at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters, dropped one bomb, and then disappeared into the clouds ahead. After the ship was attacked, approximately eighteen lifeboats and small motorboats were immediately launched. Almost all of the wounded, sick, and other passengers were rescued onto lifeboats or rafts before the ship sank. However, approximately thirty severely wounded and sick soldiers and other personnel in the No. 4 hold were crushed to death or injured by the hatch beams that fell due to the bombing and sank with the ship. The communication equipment of the boats filled with the wounded and sick soldiers was destroyed, making it impossible to communicate. While drifting at sea from November 27th to December 2nd, they were repeatedly spotted by American patrol aircraft. Each time they were spotted, a Red Cross was made of red cloth and placed in the center of the boat as a marking. The patrol aircraft also recognized these markings at low altitude. However, on December 1st, a patrol aircraft strafed a drifting boat filled with wounded and sick soldiers at an extremely low altitude of about 100 meters, resulting in two deaths and one injury. Finally, on the afternoon of December 2nd, some of the drifting boats spotted an Imperial ship sailing nearby. Based on its report, Imperial aircraft and boats completely rescued the remaining survivors between the 2nd and 3rd, resulting in a total of 174 deaths and missing, including nurses. When the Hague Convention was concluded in 1907, it stipulated that the principles of the Geneva Convention should apply to naval warfare. In accordance with Article 1 of that treaty, the Japanese government notified the United States government of the name of the Buenos Aires Maru through its protecting power, the Spanish government, on December 7th of last year. In addition to the legally required markings under Article 5 of the treaty, it was also equipped with specially made easily recognizable aerial and nighttime Red Cross markings researched by the Imperial military authorities, which had also been notified to the United States government. Furthermore, at the time of the incident, the weather was clear, the sun was at the aircraft's back, and the aircraft was flying at an altitude of approximately 1,000 meters, making these markings fully visible. The American aircraft's blind bombing was not only a deliberate violation of the Hague Convention and the fundamental principles of international law but was also inhumane. Moreover, it caused the tragic death of innocent nurses and strafed wounded and sick soldiers drifting in the water. This can truly be described as a barbaric and despicable act of murder. Regarding this incident, the Imperial government has lodged a strong protest with the United States government, urging it to reflect on its actions so that the United States government can conduct a thorough investigation of the truth in good faith and respond accordingly, punish those responsible, guarantee that such incidents will not occur in the future, and also declared that it reserves all rights to rectify this illegal act. The Imperial government had previously lodged a strong protest with the United States government through its protecting power, Spain, on June 28th due to the illegal attacks on six hospital ships, including the Arab Maru, but has not yet received a reply. Since then, such illegal attacks have continued to occur. Recently, the attacks on four hospital ships, including the Takasago Maru, were also communicated to the United States government through its protecting power. Now, the sinking of the Buenos Aires Maru has occurred again, so the Imperial government is once again carefully calling the United States government's deep attention.

Colonel Oshio Issues Statement

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – Since the Japanese government announced its protest against the American bombing and sinking of the Japanese hospital ship, the entire nation has been filled with deep grief and indignation. Recalling the beginning of the war, the Japanese Navy attacked all warships and vessels within Pearl Harbor, sinking or damaging them, but did not attack enemy hospital ships. This spirit of Bushido on the part of Japan caused the local Japanese residents to weep with emotion. However, the United States and Britain have repeatedly attacked Japanese hospital ships in return, which is truly outrageous to both gods and men. Furthermore, Air Force personnel reported sinking a fleet of excellent Japanese transport ships, and at the same time, the American authorities included it in their war record in order to deceive the people. The shamelessness of the world is truly unsurpassed in this case. Now, Colonel Oshio, a key figure at the Japanese Red Cross Hospital, has issued a special statement on this matter, saying in brief, "The enemy's illegal behavior is truly unexpected. We, the 100 million people of Japan, can only further strengthen our resolve to destroy the American enemy. The United States has destroyed the Red Cross Law and is not ashamed of it, having removed its mask of humanity and revealed its barbaric form. In reality, they are suffering from frustration due to repeated defeats. The spiritual battle line of the United States and Britain has been broken through by Japan. We are determined to pursue world peace, regardless of right or wrong, and persist in our determination to fight the United States."

### Japanese Army in Burma Border Adopts Encirclement Tactics, Enemy's Counterattack Artery Severed

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain base on the Burmese front, the Japanese army on the Burmese front launched a fierce attack on the Indian 38th New Division of the Chongqing forces in the Fuguai area and the Allied forces in the Hammie area from late October, defeating them everywhere and achieving significant battle results. Judging from the enemy's movements, it can be seen that after their defeat in the Nujiang operation and the loss of key strongholds for retaking Burma, they are obviously trying to find a second stronghold. Therefore, since late October, they have been very active in the Fuguai area. At the same time, the American Air Force stationed in India has also strengthened its strength, reinforcing military facilities around the Tinsukia airfield and relying on air transport routes to vigorously transport important military supplies. The Chongqing forces placed on the front line, threatened by the Japanese army's attack on India, have seen deserters. The 112th and 114th Regiments of the 38th New Division of the Indian forces, using the motor road that runs through Ledo-Tagap Ga, crossed the border line, the Patkai Mountains, and gathered in Tagap Ga. Using this as a dividing point, part of the force infiltrated the west bank area of the upper reaches of the Talun Der River, engaging in suspicious activities along various aspects of the riverbank. The main force is active in front of Xinburo. Another part of the force is observing opportunities for counterattack in Tamin. In late November, the 38th Division deployed the 113th Regiment to the dividing point, and transferred the main force of the 22nd New Division south from Ledo, using it as a reserve force, and moved the Allied forces headquarters, located approximately 300 kilometers northwest of Calcutta, to the Ledo area, gradually adopting an offensive posture. As for the Japanese army, it overcame all unfavorable conditions and implemented encirclement tactics in the area, or took advantage of the enemy's weakness to cut off the enemy's counterattack artery, increasing the offensive posture toward Hammie. At that time, did the Japanese army's aircraft attacks on the Tinsukia airfield, which achieved glorious battle results, cause the military in that area to be greatly frightened? At the same time, the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing also suffered great damage and threats, and was further fiercely attacked by Japanese ground troops. Therefore, the enemy forces on the Burmese-Indian border are in a state of chaos. If they do not retreat, they risk being annihilated.

### Fierce Battles Continue in Finschhafen and Bougainville Island

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, fierce battles continue in the Finschhafen area of New Guinea. On the north bank of the Zongu River, a superior enemy force with six or seven tanks came to attack. The Japanese tank force immediately counterattacked, achieving the following battle results: A Japanese sergeant led two soldiers to infiltrate the enemy's position at 2:00 AM on the 13th, destroying one mortar, one machine gun, and one tent (containing ten enemy soldiers). Furthermore, a Japanese private first class led a close-quarters combat team of three soldiers to attack the enemy tanks that came to attack at 6:00 AM on the 13th, destroying the enemy's lead tank and preventing other tanks from advancing. At 11:00 AM on the 14th, they attacked the right flank of the enemy force that was advancing, destroying one enemy machine gun and killing twenty enemy soldiers. One Japanese soldier was injured.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific, on December 12th, a Japanese army maritime transport unit engaged three large enemy torpedo boats near Finschhafen, New Guinea, and repelled them. In this engagement, one enemy boat caught fire, and one was hit. There were no Japanese losses.

Tokyo, 20th (Central News Agency) – A dispatch from a certain Japanese base in the South Pacific states: The Japanese army is engaged in fierce battles at Torokina Point on Bougainville Island. From the 7th to the 11th of this month, the battle results obtained near Bibaia, seven kilometers northeast of the point, are as follows: 178 American corpses were left behind. The Japanese army seized one heavy machine gun, eight light machine guns, nineteen pistols, and 1,400 rounds of ammunition.

### Director Shi Receives Reporters, Explains Work Overview, Striving for Increased Production

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Ministry of Industry and Commerce yesterday hosted Chinese and foreign reporters, with Vice Minister Zuo Xuan receiving them on behalf of the Minister. The details are recorded below: It has been three months since Minister Chen took office. We have implemented controls over materials and set prices. We are conducting investigations into agriculture, industry, commerce, and mining. Production management zones have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and northern Jiangsu. This year, we plan to promote more than 1,200 strains of cotton seeds and expand cotton fields by more than 11,000 mu. The twelve Lin Sheng demonstration farms originally established by the Ministry can gradually enter the path of economic farms. To commemorate the anniversary of the death of the Father of the Nation next year, we will plant 1.4 million trees near Zijin Mountain in the suburbs of Nanjing. After the dissolution of the Central China Sericulture Company, we are formulating plans to create sericulture-related businesses. Military-affiliated factories that have been taken over in the past have been returned to the original owners for operation. In order to increase production today, we are bravely manufacturing essential industrial goods and finding ways to solve problems. The supervision of industrial and commercial organizations, the smooth allocation of materials, and the curbing of rising prices should all be properly handled. The trend of increasing capital in companies and factories has been extremely strong for a time. The Ministry is formulating measures to restrict capital increases and ensure that funds are used for legitimate purposes. The insurance company's capital increase plan has been submitted to the Executive Yuan and will be announced and implemented as soon as it is approved. The fuel problem is becoming increasingly serious, and increasing coal production is an urgent task. Tou Shan Coal Mine Company produces 25 to 30 tons of coal per day, and after January next year, it will be able to produce about 100 to 150 tons per day. The coal reserves of Anhui Lieshan Coal Mine Company and Zhejiang Changxing Coal Mine Company are extremely rich, and development plans have been formulated and preparations are underway. Approximately 32 large mining areas, covering an area of approximately 200,000 hectares, have been approved and licensed for private mining operations. In the future, the Ministry's work will focus on increasing production and stabilizing people's livelihoods within its jurisdiction.

### Guangdong Rural Affairs Bureau Begins Operations

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) – The Guangdong Provincial Government previously established the Guangdong Rural Affairs Bureau in order to establish security in the Guangdong region and increase production. The bureau has already begun operations on the 17th and has been formally established, but still awaits the arrival of spring. The bureau is the central organization for guiding rural work. Basic organizations for security and construction will soon be established, and efforts will begin to advance toward establishing security, increasing production, and completing construction.

### Beijing Correspondence: The Publishing Industry in North China

The modern news industry bears the responsibility of propaganda, and each era has its own propaganda guidelines and policies, which are closely related to the political situation at the time. The North China News Association held its second chief editors' meeting on the 3rd of this month at the Beijing Hotel to discuss these guidelines and policies.

Controlling the Cotton Textile Industry

North China is a cotton-producing area. However, due to the relationship between cotton and the military industry, the price of cotton fabrics has risen to unimaginable levels. A foot of ordinary white or blue cloth now sells for more than five yuan in legal tender. The general public is unable to purchase it, resulting in a phenomenon where broken cotton, old cotton, and other mixed cotton are selling very well. The impact of this is that the listing of raw cotton is greatly hindered. Therefore, the North China Textile Industry Association has decided to place all cotton textile manufacturers and their trading partners, the mixed cotton processors, under the control of the association. Recently, it has also prepared a control outline to integrate all cotton textile factories in North China into five cotton textile groups: Beijing Area Cotton Textile Group, Tianjin Area Cotton Textile Group, Jinan Area Cotton Textile Group, Qingdao Area Cotton Textile Group, and Shimen Area Cotton Textile Group. These cotton textile groups are in the process of being organized and are expected to be completed in the middle of this month. As for the allocation of raw cotton, it has been decided to establish production plans for each period and allocate it to the cotton textile groups accordingly. The groups will then allocate it to their members. In addition, it is stipulated that mixed cotton processors must obtain permission from the Textile Industry Association to purchase mixed cotton and conduct external transactions. This is also a method of controlled economy in a time of war.

Punishing Illegal Merchants

This spring, partly due to the manipulation of unscrupulous merchants, grain prices soared like runaway horses, causing people to starve to death everywhere in Beijing. The North China authorities made every effort to overcome this difficulty, and the Nanjing government also passed a law to punish unscrupulous merchants with military law. At the end of June, the North China authorities also vigorously investigated unscrupulous merchants, and a considerable number of them were "caught and sent to the authorities." Recently, the North China authorities publicly announced all the cases that have been handled, stating that a total of 61 people were sentenced to seven years of imprisonment or less, 43 people were fined 700,000 yuan or less, and 78 companies were fined 8 million yuan or less. Economic saboteurs and illegal merchants have finally been severely punished. (From Man, December 12!)

### Japanese Invent Magnesium Hydroxide Manufacturing Method

Metallic "magnesium metal" is an important material for manufacturing aircraft. Now, a certain Japanese magnesium manufacturing factory has invented a "magnesium hydroxide manufacturing method" for extracting it from seawater, which can be extracted from seawater without relying on alkali, in order to meet the needs of mass production of aircraft. The United States is also researching this magnesium hydroxide manufacturing method. A certain Japanese magnesium manufacturing factory, in view of the large demand for magnesium, began practical research last year. However, because there were many difficulties in actual manufacturing, it took a year to move from the experimental stage to the formal growth stage. As soon as the construction of the factory is completed, mass production will begin immediately. It is said that one cubic meter of seawater contains about one gram of magnesium. The factory's seawater treatment capacity, special large tanks, and sedimentation tanks have also been strengthened, so its future increase in production is truly promising.

### The Darling of the Skies: Wooden Airplanes

Since the advent of radio detection devices, the nature of aerial warfare has undergone a transformation. To counter this modern weapon, wooden airplanes have emerged. These wooden airplanes are made of "reinforced wood." Manufacturing this reinforced wood requires pressing machinery, which the Japanese government has recently requested all owners throughout the country to contribute. It is truly intriguing that manufacturing airplanes from wood requires pressing machinery used to extract oil from rice bran, soybeans, peanuts, rapeseed, and the like.

However, this type of machinery is also crucial in the food industry, so the Ministry of Munitions is quite cautious about requesting its contribution. Mr. Yozo Yokoo, a farmer from Yono, Saitama Prefecture, heard about this and, on November 25th, visited Mr. Endo, the Director-General of the Aeronautical Weapons Bureau of the Ministry of Munitions, to offer three excellent pressing machines used in his facility for airplane production, stating, "If necessary, you don't have to wait for slow business arrangements; please use them immediately." The Director-General was deeply moved by this selfless offer, saying, "The spirit of personally requesting to contribute what the military authorities deem necessary is what creates true Japanese fighting power." He then discussed the future darling of the skies, wooden airplanes, and their production as follows:

Wooden Airplanes Have a Long History

"Speaking of manufacturing airplanes from wood is nothing new; it has been done before. In the fifteenth year of the Taisho era [1926], when I was a captain, I was sent to Europe to gather preliminary knowledge about the state of the Japanese aircraft industry. I inspected a certain factory in Nagoya. At that time, they were inspecting a board as large as a table. If there was even one knot in the board, it was rejected. It was rare to find a three-by-six-foot board without knots, which made mass production impossible. What if we made it from metal?" He then laughed and said, "The military might only know about war and not about science. Metal is heavy and cannot fly..." The following year, I went to Europe and saw that Germany and France were using metal, which is why we now have active metal airplanes. However, metal has drawbacks. Due to the new weapon of ultra-shortwave radar, they are detected before reaching their destination, making the element of surprise, which is vital to airplanes, quite difficult. Thus, we researched wooden airplanes that could avoid detection. We cut the wood into thin sheets, overlapping the grains in alternating directions, and gluing them together with resin. We then compressed them with a pressing machine to create reinforced wood as strong as metal. We use this to manufacture airplanes. These airplanes are not being manufactured because of a shortage of airplanes but because of tactical requirements. (Pressing machines are necessary when manufacturing reinforced wood.)"

He later discussed wooden airplanes in various countries.

"The best wood must have the strength and flexibility of metal, able to bend without breaking. Britain has even created Mosquito-type twin-engine bomber aircraft, which have appeared in the Burma region. They may have been used in the bombing of Berlin this time. The United States also has them. Japan is gradually catching up, manufacturing propellers, fuselages, wings—everything."

At this point, he shifted his focus to hopes for contributors and airplane factories.

Production is Limitless

"We in the Ministry of Munitions do not believe in the so-called limits of production. From all perspectives, if we focus and dedicate ourselves to it, there is nothing we cannot achieve. The issues of fuel, manpower, and wages are all the same. Many people say that things that are unprofitable cannot be achieved even with full effort, and that spirit alone cannot succeed. Even in the aircraft industry, many people cannot shake off money-worship when it comes to decisive battles. What the world's science cannot match are Japanese temples and Shinto shrines, such as the Ise Grand Shrine. They are flawless buildings, which the whole world has acknowledged. But these buildings were all created by the spirit of Japanese people without any thought of money. If we use this spirit to manufacture all weapons, we can certainly surpass Britain and America in quality and quantity. What the front-line soldiers need most now is weapons, but spirit is especially essential. I came from the artillery corps, and I was taught, and taught others, about names, death, shame, and cannons. Seeing the patriotic soldiers in Malaya and other seas, who blow themselves up with their airplanes and perish with their crew and ships as soon as the guns are ready to fire, and the spirit of naval officers who love their weapons, those working in munitions factories will naturally understand that they must work every day. Since the air battles of Bougainville Island, aircraft production has gradually increased. Whether there are battle results or not, we must continue to do so. I hope that those involved will further exert themselves. I also hope that those who contribute pressing machines will quickly contribute their excellent machinery currently in use for increased aircraft production." (From the Daily News, November 27th)

### Business and Industry Association Hosts Farewell Tea Party for Mr. Komuro of Japan Yesterday's Grand Tea Party

(Central News Agency) Mr. Takeo Komuro, Chairman of the Shanghai Business and Industry Association, is currently the General Manager of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. in Shanghai and has also served as the Deputy Director-General of the former Shanghai Municipal Council for many years. He has made many contributions to the welfare of the citizens and the economic sector of Shanghai, and he has especially contributed to the promotion of close cooperation between the Chinese and Japanese business and industry sectors. The establishment of the Shanghai Business and Industry Association, enabling the united efforts of business and industry figures from both countries to engage in cooperative endeavors for the Greater East Asia War, owes much to Mr. Komuro's efforts. Recently, Mr. Komuro was ordered to return to his country with honors and will reportedly assume an important position in the Tokyo headquarters of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. He will soon leave Shanghai. To express their farewell, the Chinese and Japanese members of the Business and Industry Association held a grand tea party yesterday at 5:00 PM in the conference hall of the Asia Building.

Attendees

In addition to Chairman Takeo Komuro, who was invited to attend, Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting and Chinese members Lin Kanghou, Shi Fudeng, Chen Shaoma, Chen Binru, Guo Shun, Wang Boyuan, Jin Zongcheng, Xiang Kangyuan, Gu Nanping, Zheng Hongyan, and Allied members Takeuchi, Kurimoto, Washio, Tsutomu, Yamanaka, and guest President Takashima, among others, totaling over sixty individuals, were present. During the event, Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting delivered a farewell speech, followed by a thank-you speech by Chairman Komuro. The association then presented Mr. Komuro with a large silver cup, presented by Wen Lanting and Chen Binru on behalf of the association. Finally, everyone enjoyed tea and refreshments, and the event concluded with a group photo.

Mr. Wen's Speech

Deputy Chairman Wen Lanting said: "Mr. Komuro and fellow gentlemen, today we are holding this tea party to bid farewell to Mr. Takeo Komuro, the Chairman of our association, as Mr. Komuro will soon return to Tokyo with honors to assume an important position in the headquarters of Mitsui & Co., Ltd. He will soon leave Shanghai. The establishment of this association entirely relied on Mr. Komuro's strong support, leading to its current scale. Before the recovery of the concessions, Mr. Komuro was the Deputy Director-General of the Shanghai Municipal Council and devoted much effort to the return of the concessions. Now that he is leaving Shanghai, not only will this association lose a guide, but the business and industry sector of this city will also lose a wise leader. I hope that after Mr. Komuro returns with honors, he will not forget us in the distance and will continue to provide guidance from time to time so that we may have something to follow. Today, we are presenting him with a silver cup as a keepsake and wish Mr. Komuro a boundless future."

Mr. Komuro's Reply

Mr. Komuro briefly replied: "I am deeply grateful for the grand banquet you have held today and express my sincere thanks. I am even more deeply moved by the sincere speech just delivered by Mr. Wen Lanting. Over the past two years, I have received your generous guidance and enthusiastic assistance, which has allowed my work to develop smoothly. I must express my gratitude on this occasion. This time, I have been ordered to return to my country, and I will constantly think of your enthusiasm and am reluctant to leave. I hope you will continue to provide guidance so that my future work can also unfold smoothly. I wish you all good health and extend my sincere thanks."

### Unified Vehicle Licenses to be Implemented Starting Next Year

Since the recovery of the two concessions, the administration of this city has been unified, and the licenses for all types of vehicles should also be unified. Previously, the Municipal Bureau of Public Utilities convened a joint meeting with the Finance Departments of the First and Eighth District Offices and the First Police Administrative Department to discuss the unification of vehicle licenses. According to reporters' inquiries, after several consultations, the results were quite satisfactory, and it was decided that starting next year, the licenses for all types of military vehicles would be unified. The design has also been decided. The size will still be the same as the previous vehicle licenses, but on the left side, there will be a circular "沪" (Hu, short for Shanghai) character, followed by the number. Public and private vehicles will still be distinguished by black and white colors. As for the license application procedure, vehicle owners should still apply for licenses from the authorities in charge of their place of residence.

### Huashan Branch Designated as a Model Police District

Fifty police officers who graduated from the first class of the Shanghai Special Municipality First Police Bureau Model Police Training Institute have been assigned to the Huashan Road Branch to begin their service.

### Teenagers and Students Respond to the Campaign to Ban Smoking and Gambling

Representatives Petition the Municipal Government

(Central News Agency) Following the launch of a campaign to ban smoking, gambling, and dance halls by teenagers and students in the capital, teenagers and students in this city immediately responded. They believe that the harm of smoking and gambling is worse than that of poisonous snakes and fierce beasts. If they are not eliminated, the nation will not be able to embark on the road to revival. Dance halls are dens of extravagance and indulgence, violating the principles of thrift and hindering the development of the national spirit. Therefore, yesterday, teenagers and students from various districts of Shanghai issued telegrams and declarations, organized propaganda teams, and went to gambling dens and public places to conduct guidance and propaganda. They also sent representatives to the Municipal Government and the New Life Movement branch to request the complete banning of smoking, gambling, and dance halls to eliminate the harm and ensure the well-being of the people.

### Passengers at the North Station Must Queue to Buy Tickets

(Central News Agency) The Times reports: According to informed sources, the North Railway Station has recently made great improvements in its treatment of passengers. The most important of these is a newly promulgated rule prohibiting the sale of tickets in the station, thereby strictly controlling the activities of ticket scalpers. In the past, this created a black market for tickets. Every day, large numbers of passengers went to the interior from the North Station. Because they were unwilling to be squeezed while buying tickets, they bought them from these scalpers at black market prices. According to the new regulations, passengers must queue up in order to buy tickets, which not only avoids congestion but also increases the speed of ticket sales. The black market for tickets will naturally disappear. The phenomenon of passengers rushing to board the train to grab seats has also disappeared, as they must now also queue up to board the train. The authorities have now dispatched special personnel to monitor the implementation of these new measures.

### First District Spring Property Tax Should be Paid Directly

Economic Commentary

### Investigation of Essential Goods

Because the Material Investigation Committee has observed a resurgence of rampant phenomena in the city's material resources, it plans to request the Executive Yuan to promptly conduct an investigation into essential goods for the people's livelihood, hoping to curb and stabilize prices. Furthermore, the local authorities of this city, noting that the prices of all goods have been raised by an average of eighty to ninety percent in the recent month, have convened symposiums with various industries to study how to stabilize the prices of various goods in order to understand the truth. From all of this, it can be seen that the severity of commodity prices in this city is increasing daily and cannot be ignored.

In just a week, prices can be raised by an average of eighty to ninety percent. In contrast, considering the neighboring country of Japan, which has adopted a rationing system for daily necessities for nearly two years and where prices have not changed, the difference is truly like heaven and earth. No wonder Mr. Toyoshima, a famous Japanese writer who visited China not long ago, was greatly astonished by the prices displayed everywhere in Shanghai. We believe that the fundamental issue of price policy cannot be solved by piecemeal work. The key to investigating essential goods lies not only in thoroughly investigating speculative manipulation but also in studying the root causes of shortages. Therefore, how to increase the source of materials and how to facilitate the transportation of materials are the most fundamental tasks in the investigation process. After a thorough investigation of the root causes at the grassroots level, strengthening price controls seems more likely to succeed in practice, because the success of price controls requires thorough control from production to consumption, and the price management agency must also be particularly sound.

### Establishment of Price Investigation Committees in Major Cities to Thoroughly Investigate Illegal Hoarding by Merchants

In order to thoroughly investigate the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants in major cities within the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the authorities have specially established local Material Investigation Committees in the locations of the provincial governments or special municipal governments, and branches of the local Material Investigation Committees in the locations of the county governments and municipal governments. A reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday that the Material Investigation Committees in major cities within the three provinces have been organized under the leadership of the highest local administrative officials and are actively launching work. Their tasks mainly involve two aspects: matters related to the investigation of hoarding of major materials and matters related to proposing countermeasures to prevent hoarding.

### All Banks and Firms Handling Year-End Closing of Accounts

The thirty-second year of the Republic of China is coming to an end. All banks and firms in the city have followed the usual practice of closing their accounts. Yesterday (the 20th), interest was settled for all current account deposits in the commercial and savings departments. All outstanding loans from current account holders must be repaid in full by the end of this year. The Central Savings Bank and the Bankers' Association Joint Reserve will generously supply funds for interbank lending in order to ensure a smooth passage through the end of the year. It is reported that all financial institutions have profits this year.

### Suspension of Trading at the Stock Exchange Due to Settlement Leads to Active Over-the-Counter Trading; Most Stocks See Squeezes

### Brief News

China Chemical Industrial Company: The company's factories include the Sino-American, Sino-Southern, and Wah Fung factories, which have been established for over three years, specializing in the production of hydrochloric acid, caustic soda, sodium sulfide, bleaching powder, soda ash, and other chemicals, as well as various condiments and raw materials. Previously, the various factories required a large amount of raw materials, and due to transportation issues, they could not be purchased at the same time, resulting in the inability to fully operate. It is reported that the company has already purchased all the raw materials, such as tax-exempt industrial salt and allocated sulfuric acid and coal, so the company's three factories will all start full production on December 1st to meet market demand. It is also reported that the company is scheduled to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 29th of this month to increase capital.

### National Forum: Points to Improve on the Purchase of Yarn and Cloth

— A Commoner

In order to address the speculative national sentiment, curb price increases, and stabilize the people's livelihood, the government has launched a comprehensive purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in the Shanghai area. Law-abiding and legitimate yarn and cloth merchants, deeply aware of complying with national policies, immediately ceased operations and applied to sell all their inventory in accordance with the deadlines, daring not to conceal anything. Now, as April approaches, rice, coal, and other supplies are increasingly expensive, and yarn and cloth merchants, as well as merchants connected to the yarn and cloth industry, are in dire straits, facing immense hardship. Speculators have shifted their focus, and hoarders have moved from one item to another. Prices have not been curbed, and the people's livelihood has become even more difficult to stabilize. This is something that the government did not anticipate when it ordered the purchase of yarn and cloth! The suffering experienced by legitimate yarn and cloth merchants, as well as the key points for improving the purchase of yarn and cloth, are listed below:

Legitimate merchants have limited capital and usually rely on transactions with banks and firms and deposits from relatives and friends to make adjustments. Now that business has been suspended, banks and firms cannot add to their debts, and depositors are also demanding withdrawals, exhausting all resources and making it difficult to cope. The prices set in the "Outline for the Implementation of Yarn and Cloth Purchase" are already very low compared to the cost (about a quarter of the market price at the time of purchase), and the earliest installment payments are required to be made in three months, while the later ones require waiting for three years. If a business has an inventory of one million yuan (calculated at the market price at the time of purchase) but only owes 250,000 yuan (excluding capital), even if it receives half of the bid deposit, the accumulated interest (3% monthly interest on bank debts) and increased expenses will make it impossible to cover the price, and bankruptcy will be inevitable.

The price for the purchase of yarn and cloth has been set, but since the payment cannot be obtained in one lump sum, the prices of various commodities will no longer be at the level of August 10, 1943, when the first installment is paid on January 1, 1944. There is even less certainty about the future. If merchants use the proceeds from the purchase to buy rice, coal, and daily necessities, the ratio will be out of balance, and even maintaining operations will be difficult. It is hoped that the government will follow the example of the amnesty for criminals after the Greater East Asia Alliance, opening a way out and discounting half of the special fixed-term deposit certificates without interest, paying the bid deposit in one lump sum.

Goods are the lifeline of merchants, so merchants cherish their goods as they would innocent children. Original items are placed in boxes or packages, and unpacked items are placed on shelves, neatly arranged and managed by designated personnel. Once moved after purchase, they become easily damaged, stained, and shortages occur, which is only one of the problems. Now, the Bureau of Commerce and Trade has taken this into consideration and has included unpacked yarn and cloth as specially managed items. The unpacked yarn and cloth that has already been transported should be returned to the original applicants for sale, properly sorted, and placed on shelves to facilitate distribution.

In a wartime economy, increasing production is always the top priority. Since the purchase of yarn and cloth, factories have shut down, and merchants have been idle. Not only is there no production, but expenses are being wasted. According to statistics from the Cloth Merchants Association, there are over 2,600 member firms, with monthly expenses of approximately 78 million yuan. The number of yarn factories, cloth factories, yarn firms, and cotton and miscellaneous goods umbrella factories connected to yarn and cloth is unknown. It is requested that allocations be made as soon as possible so that workers can fulfill their abilities and merchants can secure their businesses. This will not only stabilize the people's livelihood but also increase production, which is essential for curbing price increases.

The allocation process is divided into general wholesalers, wholesalers, and retailers. Before the control of yarn and cloth, yarn and cloth merchants from other areas purchased from wholesalers in Shanghai. The general wholesale stage in other areas should follow the example of Japanese trading companies and be undertaken by wholesalers in Shanghai. If it has been stipulated that it should be handled by the local branches of the Cotton Products Federation, then a certain amount of this profit should also be extracted and distributed proportionally to the amount of inventory sold by the Shanghai wholesalers, in order to be fair. (Wholesalers have no monthly retention amount, and the suffering they have endured after the purchase is the deepest. There are 700 retail member firms of the Cloth Merchants Association, while there are over 1,900 wholesale firms.) The work of purchasing yarn and cloth has been going on for three months. Although the names have been changed frequently and the inspection and acceptance have been time-consuming, there should be a budget for handling the matter. Although the deadline of September 6th has been changed to October 1st, the Bureau of Commerce and Trade has issued a notice to all applicants for sale to collect storage certificates in order, so that merchants can obtain the payments on time, which is a very kind intention. However, when merchants apply for storage, they must fill in prices, find guarantors, and submit them. The Cotton Industry Administration must verify the prices, calculate the payments, verify the guarantors, and distribute storage certificates and exchange certificates. It is difficult to predict whether all the procedures can be completed before the first payment date. It is requested that the process be expedited as soon as possible so that merchants are not disappointed.

Youth (2)

"After all, Second Middle School is better!"

A student wearing a newly made school cap and a bright school badge exclaimed. It was Taguchi Takao speaking to Masato.

"That's natural!"

Masato, wearing a standard uniform, smiled as usual.

Both had successfully entered the prefectural Second Middle School. To thank the gods, they went to worship at the Showa Shrine and the Arata Hachiman Shrine.

Neither had a devout belief. However, it was the local custom to visit the tutelary deity's shrine, the local temple, and then the ancestors' graves whenever something happened. Now, they were walking home.

"It's such a beautiful day! Let's go play by the sea!"

Masato looked up at the strong sunlight, sweat streaming down his face. Although it was the Enthronement Day of Emperor Jinmu on April 3rd, the cherry blossoms had already fallen.

"No, aren't you coming to my house today? My mother and the others are waiting!"

Takao remembered his mother's words when he left. She was preparing lunch to celebrate her son's and friends' entrance into school.

"It's fine to go, but I feel constrained being with your family."

Masato seemed reluctant. Finally, on the condition that he wouldn't have to meet the family, he agreed to wait.

Although they didn't see the sea, the sea breeze blowing from that direction brushed against them. The two strode towards the Arata residential area.

"I always want to join the navy."

Takao said loudly, revealing his ambition. He had only just entered middle school but was already dreaming of taking the entrance exam for the Naval Academy.

He had been fascinated by the navy since the fifth grade of elementary school. Because of that fascination, he had originally wanted to attend First Middle School when entering middle school. First Middle School was a school for talented students, and graduates had a high chance of entering the Higher Normal School, Naval Academy, or Military Academy. The pristine white uniforms of First Middle School students became the object of envy for young boys. At the same time, Second Middle School was considered a haven for mischievous children. Recently, the general criticism seemed to have changed since Professor Kawada from the Tokyo Gakushuin was appointed as the new principal, but it still couldn't compare to First Middle School. Takao gave up his long-held desire to attend First Middle School and entered Second Middle School because he didn't want to be separated from his close friend Masato. The friendship at Second Middle School was that close.

As for Masato, it didn't matter whether it was First Middle School or Second Middle School. However, he listened to his older brother Masajiro's advice and passed Second Middle School. He already felt beyond expectations to be able to enter middle school. (Wasn't his older brother Yoshikazu going to drop out of commercial school midway?)? It was questionable whether he would continue to a higher-level school after graduating from there. His mother was already fifty-six years old. Seeing her tireless efforts day and night, he really wanted to be able to go out into society and work to ease her burden as soon as possible.

Before they knew it, the two had arrived in front of Taguchi's house.

### Our Newspaper's Social Services Department Distributes Warm Clothing to Hidden Poverty

Recently, the prices of all goods in the city have been expensive, and the people's livelihood is difficult, with a great sense of unsustainability. Poor people lack adequate clothing and food, and cannot afford cotton cloth. The colleagues of this newspaper, being concerned about this, launched a campaign to make warm clothing on behalf of others at the beginning of last month. Thanks to the enthusiastic contributions from all sectors, benefiting the poor, over two hundred sets have been distributed successively in recent days. During this severe winter climate, the generally thinly dressed hidden poor (poor teachers, civil servants, cultural figures, artists, low-paid workers) who received warm clothing benefited greatly. Our department is currently rushing to produce more, and the Clothing Donation Committee has formulated the following measures:

The distribution targets are limited to hidden poverty in all sectors. The distribution procedure requires first coming to this department to obtain an application form, filling it out, and obtaining certification from a legitimate professional or store with a seal. After sending it to this department, it will be investigated and verified, and then the applicant must bring their citizen ID card to this department to receive a warm clothing voucher, stamped upon receipt. It cannot be received again next year. Charitable organizations entrusted this department to make a large number of warm clothing on their behalf and are not allowed to raise the price of Korean donations. To make warm clothing on behalf of others, one must register at this department and collect it from the clothing production department in installments. The acceptance of large-scale warm clothing donation funds will be stopped from today.

### Electricity Consumption Counter Distributed to Users

The Shanghai Electric Power Company has notified all users to implement conservation measures starting from the first of this month.
