### The Urgent North China Disaster Relief

The provinces of North China have suffered from prolonged drought, resulting in a vast disaster area, a large number of victims, and unprecedented devastation. We have appealed twice, requesting government leadership and coordination, joint efforts from charitable organizations, and enthusiastic contributions from all sectors of society to combine our collective strength to handle urgent disaster relief matters. What is particularly important is to "treat disaster relief as fighting a fire," acting swiftly and promptly to alleviate the suffering of the compatriots in the disaster area as soon as possible.

Although only three short days have passed since we issued our appeal, the response we have received is enough to deeply move us and further encourage us. In the meantime, we have received numerous donations from readers, totaling more than 50,000 yuan. We are deeply grateful. At the same time, we have also received valuable opinions from all sectors regarding disaster relief, which demonstrates the compassion and enthusiastic contributions of all sectors.

Yesterday afternoon, Shanghai Special Municipal Government Mayor Chen and Minister Ding of the Social Welfare Department jointly convened leaders from all sectors of the city to solicit opinions and discuss implementation methods for disaster relief. This represents the leadership and coordination of the responsible government agencies.

Representatives from Shanghai's charitable organizations, civic welfare organizations, and North China native place associations attended the meeting convened by Mayor Chen and Minister Ding, reporting on the disaster situation and expressing their opinions. This represents the joint cooperation of the relevant organizations.

We would like to elaborate on the suggestions made by leaders from all sectors at yesterday's meeting as follows:

Mr. Lin Kanghou suggested: "In order to respond quickly to the situation and expedite disaster relief, the responsible government agencies should first borrow tens of millions of yuan from the Central Reserve Bank to handle urgent disaster relief, and then repay it with funds raised from all sectors. If we wait until after all sectors have raised donations before taking action, the timing will inevitably be slower than expected and will not meet the needs of urgent relief." We fully agree with Mr. Lin's timely suggestion. In order to respond to the "urgency," we must take expedient measures. We hope that the relevant authorities will adopt and deliberate on this suggestion so that urgent relief work can be implemented as soon as possible.

Mr. Zhang Yipeng suggested two points: "(1) Issue 'Disaster Relief Public Bonds,' with two-thirds purchased by all sectors in Central and South China and one-third purchased by the North China financial community. (2) Exchange surplus resources in North China, such as coal, for coarse grains from Central China." We agree with Mr. Zhang's suggestions in principle. For the first point, the government should issue disaster relief public bonds, draft regulations, and print bond certificates. After a reasonable period, to enrich the foundation of disaster relief funds, the government should bear the responsibility, which is reasonable. However, to address the current "urgency," borrowing funds from the Central Reserve Bank should be prioritized, followed by issuing public bonds, or using the proceeds from the public bonds in the future to repay the shortfall of the loan. For the second point, resource exchange should be listed as an important matter in disaster relief efforts, and concrete measures should be planned and implemented as soon as possible.

Mr. Yuan Ludeng wishes to donate fifty boxes of high-quality cigars, usually gifted by friends, not for personal consumption, but to be sold as donations for disaster relief. This demonstrates the compassion of "changing goods for disaster relief" from the perspective of a donor. We regard these fifty boxes of cigars as Mr. Yuan's private property, and using them for disaster relief through sale has the same meaning as selling other private property. If every compatriot can contribute money if they have money, and contribute goods if they have goods, then, although the disaster situation in North China is severe, it can certainly be resolved satisfactorily, and the lives of the affected compatriots will be safe.

In addition, Minister Ding also advocated "thrifty relief." Mr. Yuan can be said to be the first to respond. The scope of thrift is quite broad, and we also hope that all "gentlemen" who frequent Shanghai's aristocratic restaurants, hotels, and entertainment venues, after enjoying their meals and leisure, will take a moment to recall the picture of refugees in the disaster area of North China. Not to mention sympathy, but out of charity, they can allocate the remaining part of their lavish meals and leisure to make donations for disaster relief. Then, this amount will certainly be more than the hard-working class donating their hard-earned money. Therefore, the focus of "thrifty relief" still relies on the rich class to show great compassion in practice.

What has been said above focuses on the preliminary work we should do, urgently do, and hope to do in launching disaster relief. In addition, there are many pressing issues, and the most important one is to hope that our friendly neighbor, the Japanese authorities, will sympathize with the severe disaster situation of our compatriots in North China and provide full convenience for implementing disaster relief work. First, all disaster relief food and supplies should be treated as exceptions to controlled materials and absolutely guaranteed convenience in transportation. Also, surplus soybeans from Manchuria and coarse grains from the Central China region should be allowed to be freely purchased or exchanged and transported to the disaster area for distribution. This is the most fundamental point of disaster relief work. Otherwise, any relief funds will not get relief goods; any relief goods will not be distributed in the field, and the result will still be drawing cakes to satisfy hunger. We firmly believe that the friendly authorities will be happy to assist, and we offer our sincere prayers for the victims of the disaster in North China.

Finally, we must solemnly point out that the effectiveness of this relief effort for the victims of the disaster in North China has significant political implications. The Chongqing regime and the enemy British and American sides have been vigorously publicizing various emergency relief measures for the drought in Henan Province two months ago. In the disaster area of North China, including parts of Hebei, Henan, Shandong, and Shanxi provinces, the population is at least one-third of the total population of 100 million in the four provinces. The centripetal force of the victims in this area lies in whoever can save them from starvation, and whoever is the savior they appreciate. Therefore, today, when the National Government is strengthening its political position with the cooperation of friendly nations, it must closely monitor the importance of the centripetal force of these vast victims and strive to win it. The way to win is to ensure that disaster relief is handled with "urgency," "sincerity," and "practicality." We respectfully offer this to the authorities and hope they will act quickly.

### British Member Straphogie Claims Japanese Army Has Knocked on the Door of India. Ainami Discusses the Defeat of British Troops in Arakan, The Attempt to Counterattack Burma Has Been Completely Shattered.

Lisbon, 19th, Central News Agency - News received from Melbourne today, General McWhorter's headquarters issued a public announcement stating: The Japanese Air Force recently bombed an important base of the anti-Axis forces in the Wai Ai area of New Guinea again, the extent of the damage is unknown.

Geneva, 15th, Central News Agency - London News, British Member of Parliament Lord Straphogie recently declared: The British army's counterattack against Akyab has failed, which has enabled the Japanese army to knock on the door of India. He went on to say that Chongqing's position is very dangerous, and Chiang Kai-shek does not have sufficient weapons and military rations to block the advance of the Japanese army.

Lisbon, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from London: Ainami, a war correspondent for the Chronicle, published an article in the newspaper on the 17th, titled "The Reasons for the Failure of British Troops in Arakan," which stated that the reasons for the failure of the British army in Arakan were roughly five: (1) The Japanese army gained valuable experience in jungle warfare during the previous battles in Malaya and Burma. This time, they fully applied this experience, making it impossible for the British army to cope. (2) The British and Indian army officers and soldiers are not familiar with jungle warfare tactics. (3) The British army field commander still adopts the consistent tactics or desert warfare tactics used in the northwestern border area of India, and did not adopt jungle warfare tactics. (4) Due to the jungle, the supply to the British army is very difficult, so it was unable to outflank the Japanese army from the side. (5) The supply and transportation did not utilize inland rivers, etc. In short, the failure of the Arakan campaign was due to unsound strategy and tactics. The British army was far inferior to the Japanese army in terms of quantity and attack power. At the beginning of the operation, the British army's goal was to recapture Hile, repel the Japanese army from the Arakan coast, so that the army, navy and air force could counterattack Burma in the future, and try their best to drive the Japanese army out of the border area of India, and try to prevent the Japanese army from attacking the Calcutta military industrial area, etc. As a result, because the ships and landing craft did not arrive, the attack on Hile failed, and instead of capturing the mouth of the Mayu River, it attacked the Dumberkula Taideng area first, which was a big mistake. After the Japanese army cut off the retreat between Mongdora and Kiton, the British army was forced to retreat backward.

Germans Praise Japanese Soldiers' Bravery

Berlin, 19th, Central News Agency - Since Major General Tanikawachi, the head of the news department of the Japanese General Headquarters, explained the battle of Attu Island on the 17th, the German people have understood the details of the battle situation in that area, and all praised the spirit of the Japanese army's brave defense. The Nazi Party's organ newspaper "People's Observer" published an opinion on the 18th using the battle in New Guinea as an example, stating the views on the development of the battle of Attu Island, and said that recently, American newspapers have published reports from war correspondents about the battle situation between the Japanese and American forces in New Guinea, and the description of this report is also very interesting for the battle of Attu Island. At present, the US military plans to completely expel the Japanese army from New Guinea Island, but the Japanese army's combat power is strong, and the US military has no chance to take advantage of it. Land battles have been at a standstill for several months. According to news from the Times Weekly, the anti-Axis forces launched an offensive in order to obtain a jungle on New Guinea Island. As a result, 6,212 Australian soldiers and 4,118 American soldiers were killed in battle, but they still did not achieve their goal. These casualties are 50% more than the number announced by General White Leimi, the commander of the anti-Axis ground forces in the Southwest Pacific, which is really incomprehensible. From these facts, to interpret the battle situation of Attu Island, no matter how it evolves, it is believed that the Japanese army will launch a brave and desperate defense, and the US military's attempt will be shattered.

### Japanese General Headquarters Officially Announces That the United States Attacked Japanese Hospital Ships As Many As Nine Times

Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 11:00 on the 19th that from the beginning of this year to April, seven imperial army hospital ships were attacked by American aircraft and submarines, for a total of nine times. Among them, the "Arabia" Maru, the "Ural" Maru, and the "Buenos Aires" Maru were bombed and injured, with slight casualties. Note: The main items such as the ship name, ship type, tonnage, and loading method of the above ships have been notified to the enemy by the country that manages Japanese rights.

### Director Hori Issues Statement

Tokyo, 19th, Central News Agency - Hori Koichi, the director of the Third Department of the Japanese Information Bureau, issued a statement on the 19th regarding the British and American illegal attacks on Japanese hospital ships, which stated that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and American authorities and their troops have repeatedly resolved to take despicable and shameless inhuman acts against our military and civilians. We have pointed out and protested against each resolution, but because the development of the war situation is becoming more and more unfavorable to Britain and the United States, the illegal acts of Britain and the United States against our non-military facilities are becoming more and more fierce, and it is almost impossible to know where they will end. Especially since the beginning of this year, there have been several incidents of enemy aircraft and submarines attacking our country's hospital ships. The enemy's deliberate and barbaric actions are truly inexcusable. Judging from the following facts, it can be clearly understood that the names of these hospital ships were notified to the enemy with sufficient time before sailing and through proper national procedures, and according to international regulations, each ship has extremely obvious markings, so it can be seen at a glance that it is a ship with a humanitarian mission. However, the enemy knows that this is a hospital ship, but deliberately attacks it. Afterwards, they cunningly claimed that they did not recognize it as a hospital ship, or that they had instructed their troops not to attack hospital ships in a one-sided excuse, attempting to shirk their responsibility. This kind of behavior of Britain and the United States not only violates the Geneva Naval Warfare Treaty, but also tramples on humanitarianism, which is an evil deed that is not allowed by both gods and humans. Moreover, Britain and the United States often shouted to uphold humanitarianism and advocate respect for international obligations, as if they would never do any illegal acts. However, the falsity of their words and the shamelessness of their actions have been proven by facts, and the contradiction between their words and deeds has been completely exposed. Our government has repeatedly protested to the governments of the United States and Britain through the country representing its interests regarding the enemy's atrocities. Now, the names of the hospital ships that have been attacked, the situation at the time, and the damage are recorded as follows: (1) The Arabia Maru was sailing at low speed in the port when it was entering Yangon on January 4th. It was suddenly bombed by three enemy Unified-type aircraft. The enemy aircraft repeatedly bombed at low altitude, dropping more than ten bombs, but all of them fell about ten meters away from the ship, causing slight damage. At that time, the weather was clear, the cloud height was above 5,000 meters, and the visibility was extremely good. (2) The Ameili Maru was attacked by an enemy aircraft at 4:20 AM on January 30th while sailing outside the port of Rabaul (4 degrees 12 minutes 38 seconds south latitude, 152 degrees 17 minutes 45 seconds east longitude). The enemy aircraft first dropped four bombs, all of which fell behind the ship, and then strafed with machine guns. We suffered no damage. At that time, the ship's night markings were fully lit with lights and were extremely obvious. (3) The Mani Cila Maru was attacked by torpedoes (two shots) at 11:20 AM on March 4th at 136 degrees 17 minutes east longitude and 5 degrees 36 minutes north latitude. It immediately turned the rudder, so it was not damaged. (4) The Ural Maru was sailing to Rabaul on April 3rd. At 2:59 PM on that afternoon, it was dive-bombed by enemy aircraft at 2 degrees 47 minutes south latitude and 150 degrees 7 minutes east longitude. It was directly hit by one bomb, and several bombs exploded nearby, causing considerable damage. Six members of the medical team and one crew member were killed, and six members of the medical team and four crew members were injured. At that time, there were slight thin clouds in the air. (5) The Fusang Maru was bombed by enemy aircraft three times on April 15th while sailing to St. Trent Island, but suffered no damage. The situation is as follows: (a) The enemy aircraft dropped a flare and two bombs from an altitude of 2,500 meters in front of the bow of the ship. The bombs fell 500 meters away from the bow of the ship. (b) The enemy aircraft dropped a flare and a bomb from an altitude of 1,500 meters in front of the bow of the ship on the starboard side. The bomb fell into the sea 400 meters away from the port side (35 degrees angle). (c) The enemy aircraft finally dropped a flare and a bomb from an altitude of 2,000 meters in the middle of the port side. The bomb fell into the sea 200 meters away from the middle of the port side. Also, on the 16th, after the Ural Maru accommodated patients on the island, it was bombed by enemy aircraft four times and strafed with machine guns twice from 6:13 PM to 8:22 PM on its return voyage. Although there were no casualties, the hull was slightly damaged. It was found that the moonlight was bright and the ship's night markings were fully lit with lights when the enemy aircraft bombed on those two days. (6) The Buenos Aires Maru was sailing on the Hong Kong sea on April 15th. It was suddenly attacked by a torpedo from an enemy submarine at 3:45 PM on that afternoon. The hull was slightly damaged and seven people were injured. (7) In addition, the hospital ship Ruide Maru, which was notified to the enemy as a hospital ship on October 28th of last year, was also bombed by enemy aircraft at 10:30 PM on April 27th on the Gogo Sea, and was hit by 20 machine gun bullets. In addition, it should be noted that recently, German critics have pointed out that the American army on the North African front has no discipline at all. American intellectuals are also deeply dissatisfied with the American army's lack of discipline. For example, Paul Baldwin, a military commentator for the New York Times, recently inspected the North African front and said: "Americans, whether they are citizens or will be soldiers in the future, must strictly abide by discipline." He also sighed and said: "The American army still lacks the technology of commanders." Moreover, the enemy's atrocities are too numerous to mention. I still remember that when American aircraft bombed Tokyo on April 18th last year, they even strafed innocent schoolchildren with machine guns and blindly bombed civilian houses. Only the British and American troops can commit such barbaric and shameless acts. The enemy troops have no discipline and lack morality, so they take such illegal actions. If they are allowed to exist, there will never be peace, justice, and humanity in the world.

### Japanese Army Air Force Bombs Jian'ou Airport Again All Military Facilities Destroyed Air Combat Occurs Over Hunan Province

Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from a Japanese military base on a certain war front, the Japanese Army Air Force today attacked the frontline base of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Jian'ou Airport. The Japanese bomb squadron departed from the base at a certain time and advanced towards the airspace of Jian'ou Airport. They braved the fierce anti-aircraft fire of the Chongqing army and bombed the airport fiercely. The runway under repair in the airport was hit by bombs again and completely shattered. Japanese aircraft also bombed military facilities of the Chongqing army outside the city, and fires broke out in various places. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to the defense area. It is reported that the Chongqing airport in Jian'ou is the frontline base for the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing to attempt to bomb Japan. It has been actively prepared and expanded before. It was severely bombed by Japanese aircraft twice on the 4th and 8th of this month. All military facilities and runways were destroyed. Afterwards, the Chongqing army actively rushed to repair it, but this time it was bombed again and completely destroyed, and it cannot be used again.

Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to a telegram from a certain place in Hunan, two Chongqing aircraft of type P-40 flew to the front line of Hunan Province on the afternoon of the 19th. They attempted to counterattack in the sky at an altitude of more than 7,000 meters. The Japanese army aircraft immediately cooperated with the ground troops and took off to intercept them. As a result, one of them was shot down, and the other fled in panic.

### Japanese Army War Results on the Junji Pass Side

Taiyuan, 19th, Central News Agency - The Japanese army units on the Shanxi front are constantly besieging the Chongqing "18th Army" in the steep area north of the Taihang Mountains. On the 6th, they again attacked about 500 people of the Chongqing "Pinghan Guerrilla" and an "Xingtai Independent Brigade" entrenched in Shuimatou (20 kilometers east of Junji Pass), and continued to clear the remaining Chongqing army around the area and north of Junji Pass. The Japanese army, which was also carrying out a mop-up operation near Songyan Town, is also gradually expanding the war results. So far, the Chongqing army has suffered many casualties and captures in both places, and the Japanese army has seized countless military supplies.

### Chu Minyi, Member of the Reception of the French Concession, Hosts Tea Party

Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency - The delegation of plenipotentiary representatives of France for the return of the special concession in China gave a banquet at Longmen Restaurant at noon on the 19th to entertain our Foreign Minister Chu and all the members of the reception committee and their entourages. At 4:00 PM, Foreign Minister Chu, in the name of the chairman of the Franco-Belgian Alumni Association, hosted tea and refreshments at the association's headquarters at No. 48 Beiping Road for the Chinese and French members. During the meeting, Chairman Chu and Counselor Bospan, the plenipotentiary representative of the French side, gave sincere speeches, and the atmosphere was harmonious. It did not end until after 5:00 PM.

### Pang Bingxun Participates in the Peace Movement Chongqing's Internal Shake-up

Nanjing, 19th, Central News Agency - Since General Pang Bingxun joined the peace camp, Chongqing's internal situation has suddenly shaken, especially the old Northwest Army formerly led by Feng Yuxiang and the old Northeast Army currently wandering in remote areas. It is reported that Yu Xuezhong, Tang Enbo, Feng Zhi'an, and Ma Zhanshan are now quite regretful of their past behavior. It is also said that Ma Zhanshan is stationed with tens of thousands of miscellaneous troops in the harsh and hot Ordos, and is only under the supervision of Fu Zuoyi's army to maintain his remaining breath, and Ma's lung disease is gradually becoming serious, so he seems to be extremely painful.

Guangzhou, 19th, Central News Agency - According to news from Chongqing, the Chongqing "Military Affairs Committee" spokesman did not admit the matter of General Pang Bingxun's participation in the peace movement until the 18th. He deliberately distorted the facts about General Pang's decisive participation in the peace movement, and gave a perverse interpretation to the fact that more than 70,000 officers and soldiers participated in the peace movement. Looking at their intention, it is obvious that they are trying to suppress the activity psychology of the Chongqing army and the general public. This can explain the embarrassing situation of Chongqing.

Hankou, 19th, Central News Agency - The Hunan Front reported that the summer offensive operation launched by the Japanese army this time has caused fatal blows to all aspects of Chongqing's military, economic, and political affairs. Now Chongqing is also afraid of the Japanese army continuing to advance into its inland areas. In this new operation of the Japanese army, Chongqing's greatest weakness of lacking the power to resist the war has been fully exposed. For example, in the annihilation battle on the Dongting Lake, Sun Lianzhong, the acting commander of the 6th War Zone of Chongqing, actively promoted the implementation of a counterattack with all forces in order to reverse the situation, and seemed to have considerable confidence. However, since the start of this operation, the Chongqing army's judgment on the operation has been completely wrong because the Japanese army has taken the initiative. If the Chongqing army really wants to stop the Japanese army's advance, it needs at least several divisions of troops. However, the Chongqing army only used a certain division of troops to engage in the operation. This kind of operational guidance is tantamount to suicide. Therefore, Peng Weiren, the commander of the 73rd Army under Sun Lianzhong, first fled after issuing a war order to the troops under his command with the decision of the heads of various army commanders and division commanders. His irresponsibility and the ugly state of losing confidence in the war of resistance have been completely exposed.

### Qingwei Public Anhui Office Starts Work Today

Wuhu, 19th, Central News Agency - Gao Guanwu, the governor of Anhui Province and the director of the Qingwei Committee's office in Anhui, stated that the preparations for the office are largely completed, and it is scheduled to start work on the 20th of this month. It is reported that the internal organizational structure of the office is divided into two rooms, the Secretariat and the Supervision Room, each with a director and a number of clerks, and the First, Second, and Third Divisions, each with a division chief and a number of clerks and staff. It is said that the office address is located in Guangyi Elementary School, but because the relocation of the school has not yet been completed, it must be postponed. The temporary office is temporarily located in the cadre training center in Tiesuo Lane.

### Ambassador Gu Visits Diplomatic Envoys to China

Ambassador Lu of Manchuria also led Secretary Tian and others to visit the Japanese Embassy in return in the afternoon.

### Japanese Ministry of Education to Hold First Conference of Association for Education of International Students

Tokyo, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of Education authorities have noted that the number of young people from various parts of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere coming to Japan to study has been increasing daily. However, there are no comprehensive and unified policies regarding the assessment, education policies, and goals of international students. To establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to establish a guidance plan for international students. Therefore, they have discussed specific plans with the Greater East Asia Ministry and related ministries. On the 18th and 19th, they held the first Conference of the Association for Education of International Students. Attendees included Mr. Nagai, Director of Specialized Education Bureau from the Ministry of Education, Mr. Nishizaki, Head of University Education Section, and representatives (all heads of discipline) from 23 schools including Tokyo Imperial University, Kyoto Imperial University, and national universities, higher vocational schools, and middle schools with the most international students. The discussion items were: (1) Matters concerning the educational policy for international students in universities and higher vocational schools; (2) Matters concerning the admission of international students in universities and higher vocational schools; (3) Other explanations. School representatives also put forward the following opinions: 1. Establish guidance principles for the education of international students; 2. Matters concerning methods for providing sufficient preparatory education, especially learning Japanese, for international students receiving university or higher vocational education; 3. Establish and improve preparatory education institutions; 4. Stipulate the number of international students in universities and higher vocational schools, and distribute international students in a planned manner to avoid concentrating them in a few schools, especially in Tokyo; 5. Concerning the admission standards for students; 6. Regarding the dormitory issue for international students, efforts should be made to ensure that they live in good families or dormitories and live together with Japanese students; 7. Employ dedicated educators who are capable of educating international students, and pay attention to cultivating dedicated teachers; 8. Seek to increase the number of female international students, hoping that they will understand the true intentions of Japan and help develop friendship and cooperation. In addition to coordinating with relevant ministries in the future to realize this as soon as possible, the Ministry of Education has also appointed representatives from six schools including Tokyo Higher Normal School, First High School, and Tokyo Women's Medical College as special committee members to prepare a draft of a new plan to guide international students. The special committee is scheduled to meet on June 3 to review specific plans.

### Italian Air Force Bomber Squadrons Attack and Reconnoiter African Coastline; Difficulties and Dangers of Anti-Axis Transportation in the Mediterranean Sea Have Not Yet Been Reduced

Rome, 19th (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters announced the following battle situation on the 18th: (1) Italian Air Force bomber squadrons carried out attacks and reconnaissance along the African coast, and attacked anti-Axis light cruisers and medium-sized cargo ships at the port of Bougie, 113 kilometers east of Algiers. (2) Anti-Axis air force bomber squadrons carried out air raids on the western coast of Sardinia. (3) The Anti-Axis air force attacked Axis ships in the Strait of Messina and was shot down one plane by German escorts. In addition, one plane was shot down by anti-aircraft fire along the coast of the Strait.

Geneva, 19th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: The London Standard Evening News solemnly stated yesterday that it is still difficult to say that the United States has controlled the Mediterranean. The general opinion that anti-Axis convoys can now sail from Gibraltar to Suez without further disturbance is not entirely accurate. Lord Winster, Secretary of the British Admiralty, told a reporter from the Standard Evening News that he believes the Mediterranean has become a "no man's sea" and that fierce naval and air battles will still occur. Anti-Axis countries may be able to dispatch emergency convoys through the Mediterranean, but all actions will be large-scale military operations, and slow and essential convoys will be rerouted around the Cape of Good Hope. We must not forget that in addition to the efficient Axis air force, Italy still possesses a strong navy. Therefore, every anti-Axis convoy will require a strong escort. Moreover, the continued threat of German submarines to anti-Axis ships goes without saying. In short, anti-Axis transportation in the Mediterranean is still difficult and dangerous.

Rome, 18th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: Italian Daily editor Gueda wrote that after the end of the North African campaign, the war between Britain and the United States against Italy has begun a new phase. Currently, Britain and the United States are doing their best to intensify the psychological warfare against the Italian nation, and their purpose is clearly to end the war against Italy as soon as possible. Britain and the United States are indiscriminately bombing Italian towns, hoping to coerce the Italian people and shake their morale, and thus drop various leaflets and issue radio appeals to the Italian people to make a separate peace with Britain and the United States, but the enemy's propaganda has not explained to the Italian people that this "peace" is the total destruction of the Italian nation. Gueda concluded that the psychological warfare of Britain and the United States will certainly fail this time.

### Washington Conference Interrupted Due to Waiting for Stalin's Reply; Churchill Reviews War Situation in US Congress; Canadian Prime Minister Arrives in US to Participate in Consultations

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency) - Haitong News Agency special correspondent Lintman said today that the current interruption of the Washington Conference is because President Roosevelt has invited Stalin to hold a meeting of the leaders of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, and is now waiting for Stalin's reply. Not only political circles in Washington make such judgments, but also observers in neutral countries hold the same view, and President Roosevelt also said that the interruption of the anti-Axis conference was not due to his discussions with his special envoy to India, Phillips. At the same time, the arrival of President Roosevelt's special envoy Davies in Kuibyshev has caused a great stir in the US Congress and the offices of various exiled governments in London. According to neutral journalists, whether Stalin accepts the invitation to meet with Roosevelt and Churchill and the issue of whether the promise to the European policy is binding not only caused the political conference to stop, but also the military conference was suspended before Stalin's reply was clear. President Roosevelt's concern for Stalin's reply is due to two reasons. Based on domestic political reasons, President Roosevelt must strictly abide by his own nation's policy of self-determination, which President Roosevelt has repeatedly mentioned recently. Regarding this point, the London Times reported yesterday that American public opinion has gradually approved an international agreement and expects to establish principles for the determination of land and borders, but Roosevelt and Congress dare not start on this issue before receiving a reply from Moscow. On the other hand, the exiled governments demanded clarification on what the fate of the countries they represent will be after the anti-Axis countries win. They argued that if they cannot obtain guarantees that they will not be sacrificed for the Soviet Union's ambitions, they cannot convince the public of the need for anti-Axis armed intervention and sabotage. The Washington Conference has been hindered by this issue since its beginning, and the problem is even more significant on the eve of awaiting Moscow's reply. American leaders seem to want to attribute the stagnation of the anti-Axis political and military plans in Europe to the Soviet Union. The anti-Axis side believes that the Katyn Forest incident made the small countries realize the fate that the Soviet Union left to them, which is one of the difficult reasons. Another reason is Stalin's stubborn attitude and his non-participation in the Casablanca Conference and the Washington Conference. The anti-Axis side said that this fact has caused the initiative of the small countries to stagnate, but without the active cooperation of the small countries, the success of the anti-Axis offensive in Europe is doubtful.

### A Great Tragedy in World History (7)

— Tokutomi Iichirō

(7) Monarchy in England

Every Englishman is concerned only with his own convenience. In any situation, they first plan for themselves and then handle matters arbitrarily. Even if the king is dissatisfied, they arbitrarily expel him from the country. If it encounters a colony of the British Empire that wants to separate and become independent, it immediately uses loyalty to the king to reverse its collapse.

If the crown is so important, why haven't they established the fundamental principles of the crown? As the saying goes, "Make the rope after seeing the thief." The rope that the English are using here is almost rotten. This responsibility lies not with the British royal family but with the British constitution. Anatole France once said:

"No Englishman is as superficial and vulgar as he appears. In their subconscious, they are actually extremely subtle and profound, and not easily discerned."

No matter how unreasonable and illogical such English people are, they will proceed with a iron heart, regardless of everything, if necessary.

The British constitution compares the king to the chairman of a limited liability company. Loyalty to the king is the rope that maintains Australia, Canada, South Africa, and even India.

The British monarchy was quite strange after the mid-Victorian era. Queen Victoria wore mourning clothes for the death of her husband, Prince Albert, and did not enter or leave public places, living a widowed life. However, among the English, there were still people who were unhappy, and thus republicanism became a practical issue and was brought up in Parliament. Chamberlain, Dilke, and Fawcett were staunch advocates of republicanism.

At this time, Crown Prince Edward appeared in social situations and was praised by people, and the situation eased somewhat. But the Queen regained some popularity in her later years. The Queen's virtue can be said to be that she was a self-disciplined person. The Queen's political documents are extremely vast. How the Queen communicated with the politicians of the time can be seen from this.

For example, she directly pointed out to Gladstone, an old politician who was nearly eighty years old, that his speeches were too激进. In the selection of cabinet members, it was quite difficult to pass the list proposed by the Prime Minister without any changes. Also, in the selection of the Prime Minister, because there are many leaders of political parties, it is not easy to order someone to form a cabinet quickly and often goes through many twists and turns. How did the Queen exercise her power? Crang and Hart published a book entitled "Queen Victoria's Political Power" from the Oxford University Press in 1935, which explains it very clearly:

"She was quite strong in her likes and dislikes, especially in the middle of her reign, she played with the Jewish Prime Minister Disraeli. She was also firm and strong, and the most clean in the British court. Some people in the world say that she treated the strong Scottish man, John Brown, as a servant and pampered him too much, but this is just a joke and cannot become a reason for criticism."

In short, during the Queen's more than sixty years in the world, it was the golden age of monarchical politics in England, and the British throne became more and more firmly consolidated here.

Succeeding the Queen was Edward VII. Edward VII was still the Crown Prince before the age of sixty. However, during these many years, he had considerable activity in social aspects on behalf of the royal family, but he was not allowed to participate in political matters. Gladstone once suggested to the Queen:

"Why not show him slightly important political documents now?"

The Queen refused:

"National secrets should not be treated carelessly."

Originally, Edward VII was given extremely strict education under the strict supervision and regulations of the Queen and her husband. Even the color scheme and patterns of the Crown Prince's lapel decorations had to be selected by the Queen during his student days. However, that strict education produced the opposite effect, creating such a completely bad young man.

The three tricks of heavy drinking, fighting, and extravagance in the world were all prepared for the Crown Prince! When he grew up and became the Crown Prince, he did not speak of England but of the European continent. The work done by the Crown Prince was sometimes as a judge in fraud gambling cases, and sometimes as a witness or reference in divorce cases. The Times issued a warning about the Crown Prince's actions, and the Queen specially expressed her gratitude to the editor Taylor. The Crown Prince also made a statement to the Archbishop of Canterbury that, regardless of what had happened before, he would never cause problems related to gambling in the future.

But Edward was by no means just a profligate and playful person. On the one hand, he indulged in horse racing, gambling, speculation, and other bad hobbies, but he also paid close attention to the movement of world diplomacy and was very concerned about what the public liked. In any situation, he did not forget to do his best for the country.

Some say that the British Crown Prince learned about the secrets of the political world from the mouth of a French prostitute and changed the relationship of opposition with France, and Britain and France became allies. Before long, even Russia joined their group, which may not have been his power. However, Balfour and others felt that his efforts were not enough and hoped for even greater effects.

The same is true of the Anglo-Japanese alliance. When Prince Ito was in Russia and discussed cooperation with Witte without success, he said on his way back to the country that he wanted to pass through London. At that time, it was the pleasant time near Christmas, which according to custom was not suitable for receiving foreign guests, but he didn't care. He said to the Prime Minister Salisbury at the time: "How about hosting at the Prime Minister's residence?" And he himself promised a formal audience. It can be seen that his attention was meticulous.

Also, during the Russo-Japanese War, Japan raised funds in New York and London, promising Japan to pay a certain amount of interest, and even though they are now enemy countries, we deeply remember this. Also, in the 40th year of Meiji (1907), when Prince Fushimi Sadanaru visited England, Edward VII specially ordered the play "The Mikado" to be suspended during the Prince's stay. That was naturally to show respect to the Japanese royal family and to the Japanese prince.

He ascended the throne at the age of over sixty and died after ten years in power. British society, during the Edwardian era, became increasingly decadent. However, in political terms, it cannot be said that it has reached a dead end of no plans.

Even if Edward VII had faults, or even sins, as the head of state, he was firm and unwavering in his guidance of national policy. Even if the strategy of managing the country cannot be said to be without regrets, it can also be said to be somewhat satisfactory.

George V had neither the bad reputation of his father nor the popularity of his father. He was a monarch with no achievements and no faults. Now we want to talk about Edward VIII. (翔: Translated from the May 5th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### North China Disaster Victims Await Assistance: Chief Executives Chen and Ding Urge All Sectors to Exert Utmost Efforts in Fundraising and Promote Thrift to Aid Disaster Relief

In order to provide relief to the famine in various provinces of North China, Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, made a special trip to Shanghai and, jointly with Mayor Chen, invited leaders from the city's gentry, merchants, and other sectors to a tea party held at the International Hotel yesterday (the 19th) at 4:00 PM. More than one hundred people attended. Minister Ding personally delivered a speech, instructing all sectors to promote a thrifty disaster relief movement. Mayor Chen, due to illness, was unable to attend in person and was represented by Secretary-General Zhao Zunyue. Representatives from the North China Sojourners' Association in Beijing gave an on-the-spot report on the disaster situation in North China. The tragic conditions deeply moved all who heard it, and they unanimously expressed their sympathy and willingness to fully assist the government in raising donations to aid the affected compatriots. All parties anticipate that Shanghai alone can raise 100 million yuan in donations. Details are as follows:

Attending Guests

Those invited to attend yesterday included Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Qin Runqing, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Guo Shun, Huang Jiangquan, Jiang Shangda, Jin Zongcheng, Xu Xiaochu, Zhang Lianfang, Xu Langxi, Li Sihao, Li Ze, Shen Siliang, Zhou Zuomin, Lin Kanghou, Wu Yunzhai, Ye Fuxiao, Pan Sansheng, Xu Guanqun, Xiang Kangyuan, Cai Shengbai, Zhao Jinqing, Kui Yanfang, Zhu Boquan, Chen Shaowei, Feng Jie, Zhang Yipeng, Zheng Hongyan, Shao Shuhua, and others, as well as foreign friends such as Kiyomasa Hikogo and others. Representatives from North China included the Hebei Sojourners' Association, the Henan Sojourners' Association, the Tianjin Sojourners' Association, etc. Representatives from the North China Sojourners' Associations in Beijing and Shanghai included Zhang Yingjun, Li Zifeng, Guo Xianru, Li Bojiu, Jing Yaosan, and Wang Fansen.

Tea Party Proceedings

At precisely 4:00 PM, the guests arrived one after another. First, Minister Ding delivered a speech, followed by Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen. Subsequently, representatives from the North China Sojourners' Association in Beijing, including Zhang Yinghua, Guo [...], and Li Zifeng, reported on the disaster situation in various provinces of North China. Finally, speeches were given by Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Yipeng. The event concluded at approximately 5:00 PM. During the proceedings, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, deeply moved by the severity of the disaster in North China, expressed his sympathy and generously donated fifty boxes of the most valuable imported cigars he had in storage. These cigars are currently unavailable on the market, with each box valued at over 1,000 yuan, making the fifty boxes worth a total of 50,000 yuan. He offered to donate them for charity sale to aid disaster relief in North China.

Minister Ding's Speech

"Today, Mayor Chen and I have organized this gathering, providing light refreshments, to await the leaders from all sectors of the city in order to raise funds for the disaster in North China. I am deeply grateful to all of you for taking time out of your busy schedules to attend. Mayor Chen is unable to attend in person due to illness and has specially appointed Secretary-General Zhao to represent him. Regarding the disaster in North China, I, in my capacity as the head of the responsible ministry, have a few suggestions to offer to the leaders of all sectors in Shanghai:

Importance of Shanghai's Cooperation

This disaster in North China is exceptionally severe. The extent of the disaster area and the number of victims are truly rare. Chairman Wang is extremely concerned and has already ordered the allocation of a portion of relief funds, and has instructed the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food, among others, to handle relief efforts separately. However, the disaster area is vast, and relying solely on the government's efforts is not enough. It is necessary for powerful forces in the private sector to jointly plan and coordinate in order to achieve significant results. Shanghai, as the economic center of the country, has a greater concentration of human and material resources than the inland areas. If the people of Shanghai can fully assist, the results will be more easily achieved. Therefore, we attach particular importance to this fundraising effort in Shanghai and have particularly high expectations.

Promoting Thrift to Aid Disaster Relief

However, in recent years, due to rising prices, the lives of Shanghai citizens have also been quite difficult, leaving them with a sense of being overwhelmed and stretched thin. Therefore, we do not expect them to give everything they have. However, there are still many people in Shanghai with means, and their consumption on entertainment and lavish spending is also very high. Therefore, we do not ask them to give everything they have, but we urgently need to promote thrift to aid disaster relief. If each person can save a penny from non-essential consumption and donate a penny, the collective power of the majority can yield a large sum that can save many disaster victims. This method of thrifty disaster relief only requires donors to reduce a little unnecessary enjoyment, without feeling any pain, but it will provide immeasurable benefits to the victims of the disaster, who will be endlessly grateful. Therefore, I hope that the citizens of Shanghai, especially those with means in the private sector, will promote the movement of thrifty disaster relief to extend a hand of sympathy to the victims of the disaster in North China.

Three Fundraising Methods

Secondly, the fundraising methods we have planned for Shanghai include grand opera performances, charity football matches, charity horse races, and so on. What I have just asked everyone to do is to reduce consumption, asking you to save money from reduced consumption to aid the disaster victims. What I am asking you now is to actively support these entertainment programs being held for fundraising, such as opera, football, and horse racing, and to set aside some of the money you originally intended to spend elsewhere to spend on these three areas. This will not only provide entertainment but also aid disaster victims, which can be said to be killing two birds with one stone.

Establishing Fundraising Organizations

Finally, we should not be discouraged by the large number of disaster victims and the vastness of the disaster area. We should do our best with whatever strength we have. As for the organization handling disaster relief, in addition to the North China Emergency Relief Association already organized by the North China Sojourners' Association, some gentlemen have suggested that an organization be formed voluntarily by people from all sectors. This is a good idea, and the detailed methods will be announced after further study. In short, the government will take a leading and supervisory role, while the actual work is hoped to be undertaken by people from all sectors, ensuring that every drop of water flows into the public good and does not lead to any abuses.

All of you present today are leaders from all sectors of Shanghai and are powerful members of society. I hope that you will promote and assist in raising relief funds for the disaster victims in North China. I believe that Shanghai alone can certainly raise a large sum of money in the shortest possible time to aid the disaster victims in North China."

Secretary Zhao's Speech

Secretary-General Zhao delivered a speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, saying in brief: "North China has suffered a severe disaster at a time when the nation is facing many difficulties. We should all feel particularly touched and show sympathy. Especially in this environment, the people of Shanghai should provide the greatest possible assistance. In his speech just now, Minister Ding indicated the key points: (1) the government should come forward to provide relief, (2) the people of society should spontaneously initiate [activities], and (3) [everyone should] contribute donations, especially to aid our starving and freezing compatriots. This is a matter of utmost urgency, otherwise tens of millions of people will be difficult to rescue. This city is the economic center of the country, and there should be no shortage of warm-hearted people who are eager to help others. In the past, Shanghai has been enthusiastic in donating to disaster relief efforts, demonstrating a good performance in fundraising. Therefore, given the widespread suffering and unbearable misery of the disaster victims in North China, we must resolutely carry out widespread fundraising. Moreover, the central authorities currently have concrete plans for fundraising in Shanghai. In order to fulfill the expectations of the central government, all sectors of the city should work together to achieve complete success, especially in this era, paying particular attention to this and making special efforts. The Shanghai Municipal Government will uphold the intentions of the central government and strive to promote this in the short term."

Speeches from All Sectors

(1) Mr. Yuan Ludeng, in addition to expressing great sympathy for the disaster in North China, universally hoped that all sectors of the city would contribute according to their abilities and, at the same time, hoped that this extensive fundraising would involve division of labor and cooperation in order to achieve significant results and complete it as soon as possible. (2) Mr. Lin Kanghou said: "Relief is like fighting a fire. The disaster in North China is severe, and this city must fully mobilize for relief. Now that the government is leading the way, relief should be swift. I urge the central government to advance funds for relief first, followed by donations from the people, which is the most important way to provide emergency relief." (3) Mr. Zhang Yipeng's speech mainly stated: "The disaster situation in North China is severe, and the people's government is sincerely providing relief to the affected compatriots. We should also assist each other. In addition to praying for the government to advance funds first, we also hope to issue disaster relief public bonds. Furthermore, Central China should prepare and transport grain, and we further hope that North China will exchange goods that are scarce in Central and Southern China. In this way, not only will the resources of the North and South be exchanged, but they can also be greatly circulated."

### A Glimpse of Letters Received

Regarding the fundraising for the disaster in North China, this newspaper has been receiving enthusiastic responses from all parties in recent days. Extracts of the main points are provided below to give a glimpse. (1) "Having read the editorial in your newspaper on the 17th, which detailed the disaster situation in North China, the situation is vividly portrayed. I recall that there is no lack of generous donors among my colleagues. Humanity should have compassion, and with your newspaper taking the lead, the results will certainly be considerable. However, remembering that relief is like fighting a fire, we hope to not only donate enthusiastically but also [act quickly] [...]. I think that among the five million citizens of Shanghai, at least one-fifth have the means to donate. There are over a thousand rice shops in Shanghai, let's say one thousand, and if each shop donates a minimum of one hundred yuan, the total will be 100,000 yuan. I hope to exceed this number, and I will offer sincere prayers." – Liu Zhaofei (2) "Your newspaper has been thinking of the millions of disaster victims in North China, embracing the spirit of saving those who are hungry and drowning, and making a call for help. Your noble character is admired and praised. Mencius said, 'All men have a mind which cannot bear to see the suffering of others.' How can I, Fu Sheng, lag behind others? I hereby respectfully offer one thousand yuan in Joint Reserve Bank notes and ask you to kindly forward them. I am endlessly grateful." – Yang Fusheng

### Shanghai Clearing Association Smashes Drug Manufacturing Organization; Morphin King Zhu Ming Arrested

Since the commencement of the Rural Clearing Campaign in Shanghai, every effort has been made to investigate and suppress the opium and drug epidemic in the clearing areas. At 9:00 AM the day before yesterday, the Fourth Division of the Association received a report from investigators that the Mabiao Maoji Company in Xinzhen, Nanhui District, Pudong, had a large-scale drug manufacturing organization.

The headquarters will be in Shanghai, and branches will be established in other necessary locations. Minister Shanghai Tadajiri will serve as the chairman, with two vice-chairmen, and a number of advisors, councilors, and committee members below him. After the establishment of the organization, the Shanghai Total Power Patriotic Association, the Shanghai Asia Development Association, and the Shanghai Women's Association for the Current Situation will all be abolished. Other related ideological and cultural groups will be integrated as subordinate organizations. Preparations are largely completed, and it is expected to be formally established in June.

Also, two Group B matches starting at 7:00 PM

Starting tonight, the Shanghai Volleyball League has only three matches. The first match starts at 7:00 PM, Group B1: Peide vs. Gulian.

Following that, Group B2: Huoqing vs. Huafeng. The highlight will be the Group A match between Donghua and the Soviet Union.

Economic Commentary

### "Economic Police"

Yesterday's newspapers reported that the Economic Police of the Central Police Academy are about to complete their training and will be assigned to service. Generally speaking, although police administration in our country has been carried out for many years, the lack of active improvement in the past has resulted in the public lacking a good impression. Economic police is a new undertaking, and it is sincerely hoped that they can invigorate their spirit and bring a fresh perspective.

This newspaper has repeatedly commented on improving police administration. Economic police is an important part of police administration and an important tool for promoting wartime economic policies. The general points to be noted are the same as for ordinary police, but from an economic point of view, the following three points deserve special attention:

(1) Economic Knowledge: Economic police, as the name implies, should focus their work especially on economics. The police officers themselves should strive to enrich their knowledge of basic economics. For example, they should have clear judgments and quick decisions when inspecting goods and investigating prices. If they are slow, negligent, or indecisive, both the public and private sectors will suffer losses.

(2) Service Spirit: Economic police should avoid negative fault-finding and punishment and instead provide positive guidance and persuasion to the general public. Some people often do not intentionally break the law, but simply do not know the rules or procedures. In such cases, they should adopt a sincere guiding attitude and provide as much advice and correction as possible within the legal scope to reduce the public's confusion.

(3) Integrity and Honesty: The integrity of police officers is paramount, and the integrity of economic police is especially important. Otherwise, they will find fault in everything, make things difficult for everyone, and even "frame up" people to achieve the purpose of unwarranted extortion. As a result, they will only disturb the people. This is a bad habit that economic police must avoid the most, and it is a point that the police administration authorities must be most wary of.

At this initial stage of economic police, it is deeply hoped that everyone serving as economic police will be able to demonstrate their rich knowledge, excellent spirit, and noble character to advocate for the improvement of general police affairs and set an example for general police officers.

### Ministry of Industries Approves Resignations of Sixteen Industry Supervisors; All Control Work to Be Authorized to the General Association of Commerce

The sixteen trade associations under the National General Association of Commerce, after being designated by the Ministry of Industries to form a preparatory committee and organizers within a limited time, are now actively preparing for their organization. The soap and candle industry, chemical industry, and leather industry have completed preparations and are scheduling founding conferences. The remaining thirteen trade associations are to be established this month. To supervise and guide the smooth organization of these trade associations, the Ministry of Industries designated Zhang Jun, Deputy Director of the Ministry's Shanghai Office, Sun Zuji, Director of the Insurance Supervisory Bureau, Xiang Xun, Director of the Trademark Bureau, and Chen Zhong, Director of the Commodity Inspection Bureau, as supervisors of the associations. It is now learned that Supervisor Zhang and others, believing that the organization of the associations is nearing completion and their tasks are nearing an end, and due to the heavy workload of their respective bureaus and departments, making it difficult to serve concurrently, have requested and been approved by Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industries to resign from their supervisory positions. All future affairs of these trade associations, as well as the control, allocation, procurement, and other matters related to various materials to be carried out by these associations, will be authorized by the Ministry of Industries to the National General Association of Commerce. However, the overall authority for material control still requires deliberation by the Material Control Review Committee.

### General Association of Commerce to Handle Material Investigation Committee

To stabilize prices and ensure the livelihood of the people, the National Government, through the Supreme National Defense Council, approved the organization of a Material Investigation Committee, with sixteen members each from China and Japan responsible for material investigation. Based on this decision, efforts will be made to investigate the hoarding of materials in Shanghai. It is learned that the Material Investigation Committee will be handled by the General Association of Commerce, which will fully cooperate with the sixteen Chinese and Japanese members to thoroughly investigate the hoarding of materials. The National General Association of Commerce held a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday (the 19th), though no official announcement was made, it is believed that the association had a detailed discussion on this issue.

### Ministry of Industries Defines Material Control Boundaries for this City

Regarding the boundaries of the control line in the Dinghai area as stipulated in Article 4, Paragraph 2 of the National Government's "Provisional Regulations for the Suppression of Wartime Materials," the National General Association of Commerce previously requested the Ministry of Industries to issue a map specifying the scope for compliance. The Ministry of Industries has now issued a sketch map of the Shanghai area's material entry and exit boundary areas. The control line boundaries are: North to Xiangyin Road and Shuidaian Road, West to Zhongshan Road, South to Shangnan Bus Station, and East to Xin Pudong Road and Pudong Road. It is reported that the General Association of Commerce has notified the Material Movement Permit Office to comply.

### Central Reserve Bank Plans to Adjust Loans to Same Industry

The National Government, recognizing that the practice of hoarding in Shanghai was becoming increasingly serious, affecting rising prices and hindering financial stability, in addition to dispatching personnel to investigate the hoarding of materials, also instructed the Central Reserve Bank to adjust loans to the same industry, in order to strictly regulate the business of banks and money houses in lending to industry and commerce. It is now learned that the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has been ordered to reduce loans to the same industry. At the same time, various banks and money houses, under pressure from the Central Reserve Bank to recover loans and tighten credit, and to assist the government in suppressing speculative activities, are carefully reviewing industrial and commercial lending, considering actual circumstances, and recovering unnecessary loans. According to reporters' inquiries with financial sources, the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank has reduced loans to the same industry by tens of millions of yuan to date. It will continue to recover unnecessary loans to the same industry, and is studying plans to readjust the loaning system, and, with the status of a national bank, to lead the same industries to be cautious in industrial and commercial loans. It is reported that the overall specific plan for this adjustment is currently being considered and planned by the head office.

### Central Reserve Bank and Joint Reserve Bank Exchange Rate Stable, Restrictions on Carrying Funds Aimed at Suppressing Speculation

According to Central News Agency reporters' interviews with financial authorities, there is no intention to change the exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank notes and Joint Reserve Bank notes, and the Shanghai exchange rate will remain as it is. The new standard for restricting the amount of funds carried between Nanjing and Xuzhou, which began last month, is due to the fact that speculators were often using small amounts of materials to carry out speculative activities for profit, and the measure is aimed at suppressing speculation.

### Chinese Stocks Resume Trading Yesterday Morning, Municipal Council Sends Personnel for Inspection

Yesterday marked the official resumption of business for fifteen Chinese stock companies, including Yongchang, Xingye, and Zhongguo, after obtaining business licenses from the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau. The industrial and commercial sectors of the port city have long anticipated the resumption of business of these fifteen stock companies, believing that stock trading is not only a legitimate transaction for businessmen, but also a great help to the development of industrial and commercial enterprises. However, after the opening of the market by various Chinese stock firms yesterday, the Material Control Office of the Municipal Council dispatched personnel to various companies for inspection for a week to supervise the stock market. The market trends yesterday are described below.

The opening market prices of various stocks in the morning were generally weak, lacking enthusiasm, and trading was not brisk. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, the Sino-French Pharmacy withdrew to the Concession at noon, while the trading of the Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory was still not deserted. In the department store sector, the Guohuo Company was stable, the Yong'an Company saw a few buyers, the new shares of the Xinxin Company were sparsely traded, and China Underwear stood firm. In the textile sector, Yong'an Textile Factory and Meiya Silk Factory were both firm, with prices rising slightly. The small denomination Sino-American Worsted Wool was uniquely strong, while the rest were flat. In the cultural sector, there were many seekers for the Shijie Bookstore, while the Shangwu and Zhonghua were both selling prices with few buyers. There was no lack of interest in public utilities, and the prices of Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Gas were slightly firm. The new shares of the Da Zhonghua Match Company were actively traded, and Nanyang Tobacco was no different from the previous day. It is also heard that the Zhongfang and Xinhe Two Silk Factories, among the foreign stocks, were actually founded by Chinese businessmen, so there is news that they will be traded on the Chinese stock market.

### Soap Prices Continue to Fall

During the spring of this year, household soap, a product of the chemical industry, was subject to hoarding, causing prices to soar to a peak, but there was no significant actual sales, so it soon fell back. Currently, the market is in a state of irreversible decline. Last month, when soap prices were falling, the China Chemical Industry Society implemented a flat sale of 3,000 boxes of "Save Money" brand soap, stabilizing the rapidly declining black market. Recently, the black market price of soap has been lower than the publicly sold price. The National General Association of Commerce has approved the second batch of goods from the China Chemical Industry Society, amounting to 2,500 boxes, and to facilitate citizen purchase, it has been stipulated that each large peer receives four boxes and each small peer receives two boxes, for widespread distribution. The selling price remains the same as last time, and distribution will begin once all procedures are completed.

### Authorities to Conserve Materials, New Businesses to Be Restricted

According to sources, the authorities, recognizing the need to conserve materials during wartime, will prohibit the manufacture of unnecessary goods. At the same time, the establishment of new businesses and factories that are deemed unnecessary will not be permitted. It is learned that the following new factories and businesses were established from January to March of this year: 70 banks and money houses, 18 grocery stores, 18 transportation and trade companies, 26 trust enterprises, 15 manufacturing factories, 9 insurance companies, 13 food and entertainment establishments, and 5 others, totaling 174. Among these, in addition to some unsound establishments being inspected by the authorities, some are also related to consumables.

### Prohibition of Trading in Enemy Currency; Ministry of Finance Consults Municipal Government for Dissemination and Compliance

The Ministry of Finance, noting that there are still trading activities in enemy currencies such as U.S. dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars on the market, which is inappropriate, has stipulated that from now on, all sales, transactions, or remittances involving U.S. dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and promissory notes and checks denominated in these currencies shall be strictly prohibited. Any possession or storage of the above currencies should also be strictly suppressed, and those who deliberately violate this will be punished upon verification. The Ministry has specifically consulted the Municipal Government for dissemination and compliance and to forward the notice for posting.

Commentary

### Hope for Thorough Investigation

The Material Investigation Committee, after being approved by the Supreme National Defense Council, will convene its first decision-making committee in the coming days. Beforehand, relevant agencies will separately conduct thorough investigations into the hoarding activities of banks, money houses, insurance companies, and warehouses, and will carry out work to prevent hoarding. Once the first decision-making committee is held, these efforts are expected to be promoted in a more planned and forceful manner. The current work to investigate and prevent hoarding is generally as follows:

Banks and Money Houses: The Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau has drafted a "Survey Form for Commodity-Secured Loans of Banks and Money Houses," instructing members of the Bankers' Association and Money Houses' Association to fill out the form and stipulating that the loan period shall not exceed three months. In addition, unregistered commodities, firms, and non-members of trade associations shall not be used as collateral. The contents of the survey form are as follows:

(1) Company registration number, date; (2) Borrower's name, occupation, company name, representative name; (3) Address; (4) Loan amount; (5) Term; (6) Name of collateral commodity; (7) Unit quantity; (8) Storage location; (9) Remarks.

Insurance Industry: The Insurance Supervisory Bureau has instructed all insurance companies to report in detail the names, addresses, and storage locations of policyholders with insurance amounts of 500,000 yuan or more, starting from April 1. However, hoarders are cunning and avoid detection by taking out separate insurance policies, for example, dividing a 500,000 yuan policy into five insurance policies with each insurer covering only 100,000 yuan. Therefore, the Insurance Supervisory Bureau is still preparing for a more thorough investigation method.

Warehouse Industry: The Municipal Council has implemented material investigations on the 175 commercial warehouses within its jurisdiction, and is preparing to investigate non-commercial warehouses and small storage facilities owned by individuals. If the above investigation work is completed, it will be very useful for preventing hoarding. Summarizing the above developments, the Material Investigation Committee will base its investigations on the Municipal Economic Bureau, Police Bureau, Municipal Council Material Control Bureau, police stations, and other agencies. It is hoped that these agencies must conduct thorough investigations. (Yun Peng: Translated from the May 19th Dalu Xinbao)

### A Young Man's Lament

— Ji Chang

Jie:

When you receive this letter from me, you must be surprised at first, and then vaguely search for my shadow in your mind, right? Indeed, we've been apart for too long.

You must still remember when the graduation ceremony ended, some people were loudly discussing the problem of further education: "Yanjing is too aristocratic!" "And Zhijiang is like this and that!" Some were ecstatic, singing songs loudly: while still using a toothbrush handle desperately beating a washbasin to keep time. Some were quietly busy applying Stan Cain and polishing leather shoes, tidying up their beautiful suits, preparing to meet their lovers. Some were packing their luggage, ready to return to their sweet hometown to comfort their mother who was waiting at the door. The spacious dormitory was in a mess, truly a scene of upheaval. What about me at this time? I had already quietly slipped out of the dormitory, walking back and forth in the quiet campus, my mind full of question marks. Further education? Of course, that would be great. Mr. Wu once invited me to his small room on the night of the graduation exam, very solemnly inquired about my future direction, and repeatedly told me in a solemn and benevolent tone: "You must continue your studies! With your superior aptitude and hard work, you have already completed middle school. You should think about how difficult it is for the country and society to cultivate you. It would be inexcusable not to pursue further studies!" Continue studying, who wouldn't want to, but… but, where would so much money come from to support me?

Finally, I succumbed to economic realities, leaving the school I had spent several years with, holding a stomach full of sorrow, and began to enter society with my youthful enthusiasm. It took an immense amount of effort, and I don't know how much time I wasted, before I was introduced by a distant relative to work as a clerk in a foreign firm. During this period, I suffered setbacks and tasted the bitter cup of life. Every day I went to the firm and lived a cramped life, enduring the disdainful glances and ridicule of others, which was unavoidable. Finally, I was affected by the war, the foreign firm dissolved, and I began my wandering life. Although I tried my best to find a job, in this society where I had no relatives or friends, no matter what job it was, it wouldn't land on me; so I submitted articles, did copywriting for others… Every day I sat in a narrow, dark亭子间, the floor was full of dirt, and on the small table was a mix of everything Chinese and Western. With great difficulty, I kept a small patch of clean space, and I sat there, filling white paper with black words with my right hand that hadn't yet lost its nerves. Everything else that could keep me alive, I had done. Sadly, a pair of shoes with their mouths open were still following me, this unpromising master, and if I didn't get a job one day, I would go hungry that day. And there was no way to do manual labor. I often held that broken diploma, silently shedding tears at that silver shield that had already rusted.

Whenever I had a little money, I always liked to go to a small restaurant to gorge myself, letting alcohol anesthetize my nerves, making me seem to leave this turbid world. Although I would feel sad that I was still lingering in this world when I woke up from the alcohol, I still liked to drink and let it control me. Because of my depression and my erratic crying and laughing after getting drunk, my cohabitants thought I was an incurable madman and were determined to throw me out with the landlord, but the kind landlord, a woman nearing fifty years old, understood my background, sympathized with me, pitied me, and often came to comfort me in her spare time, but what was the use? My empty little heart could never be filled.

I even wanted to commit suicide, ran to the banks of the Huangpu River, staring blankly at the torrential waters, but every time at the critical moment, I suddenly remembered what the principal said loudly on the stage at graduation: "Young people's way out is to struggle through thorns. Don't be discouraged by setbacks…". My courage to commit suicide disappeared, and I had to drag my heavy body home.

After living this irregular life for more than a year, I finally found blood in my phlegm, and the evening fever and cough told me that the terrible demon of "pulmonary disease" had come upon me. I seemed to see him stretching out his ugly hands and hear him laughing triumphantly.

Jie, please come once, for the sake of our three years as classmates, you wouldn't refuse, right? You used to have great hope for me, now please come and see a young man like me! Sincerely.

### What is Genius?

— Zhang Xian

People always attribute success to his exceptional talent.

A thirteen- or fourteen-year-old child writes beautiful calligraphy; mathematics, physics, and chemistry, the younger classmates in the class are the best, isn't that genius?

Moreover, if it weren't for the difference of genius, how could some things that you can do, I can't do?

Indeed, genius is the key element to success.

However, what is genius?

Children don't have many worries, they will put all their attention to answering a question if they find it interesting or if they will be rewarded; genius, is this great attention.

Edison said: "Ninety-nine percent of a genius is the sweat of work." Previous degree of self-cultivation can strengthen and determine when you do it if you can do it or not. Therefore, genius, is work. The accumulation of self-cultivation.

Always see and hear more, study hard, be calm in case of an emergency, you will be able to cope with everything. You will be the greatest genius?

### Advice to the Downhearted

— Yun Fu

Recently, many people have embraced a negative attitude. Not only the elderly, but even the young. Especially those who have just come out of school. Young people, as long as we pay a little attention, we can always hear many of their pessimistic arguments. When walking on the road, if we happen to meet acquaintances, we often sigh as soon as we open our mouths. They have mostly been full of enthusiasm and pursued sweet dreams, but when their ideals are shattered by the dark reality of the environment, they begin to become negative and decadent. They disregard whether this attitude is appropriate, and also forget the importance of their own responsibilities and their impact on society and the country, and thus lose interest in everything and become despondent.

Decadence is the cause of all failure. If a person succumbs to the environment and becomes negative, then he will certainly not have a successful day. Only those with perseverance and courage can overcome all difficulties without becoming decadent. Because the success of a thing is never a matter of chance. It requires a person with perseverance to fight unyieldingly for a long period of time, removing many difficulties before reaching the goal. Look at the many heroes and great men of ancient and modern times, which of them did not reach their goals after countless failures in adverse environments? So the environment is only an obstacle. It only hinders our progress, and whether or not we succeed depends on whether or not we become decadent.

The adversity of the past few years cannot be denied. But we should not be decadent, because human desires are endless, and therefore the environment will never be completely ideal. We should fully use our own strength to try our best to destroy all the obstacles in our path.

### Random Jottings

— Qian Fu

The purpose of diligence and thrift is originally to maintain and develop life. If one is too diligent and thrifty and damages or harms life, that is not the way of diligence and thrift, but the thief of miserliness.

Only cares about his own face and never says a word of justice or fairness. Although such a person can earn small profits, he cannot gain great benefits; although he will not offend anyone, he also has no true friends.

In reading, it is not so important to memorize the words, but to be able to understand the main points. Because memorization can only get the outer form, or serve as the basis for plagiarism and quotation. Only by being able to understand the main points can one appreciate the essence and expound the truth. (Yet Paid)

### I Am a Pawnshop Clerk

— Gao Jun

I, dragging my weakened body, have to wait by the counter every day, writing the same old things like "Cloth vs. Short Jacket"! "Clapboard Inside"! "Same Watch" etc. From 7 am to 11 pm writing tickets, banding bundles, auditing accounts, … I spent three years like this, and then I was promoted to counter clerk, or what the Shanghainese call "Chaofeng" (Pawnshop Clerk).

I still remember, several years ago, I saw some articles about "Chaofeng" in a newspaper supplement, vividly painting a portrait of Mr. Chaofeng. Looking at it, I certainly felt the same hatred, but also some different feelings. I thought that the majority of the reason was caused by the social environment. Chaofeng are just tools for the boss to make a fortune. Many are squeezed by life, or mistreated by the boss… so their accumulated grievances are only vented on customers.

Among the general trades, it is not easy for apprentices to successfully become bookkeepers, and then promoted to counter clerks. I, who was quite willing to study hard in this industry, was fortunate to get the title of "Chaofeng", but I was still locked in a birdcage-style store. I took on more "wind and fire". The price in front of the counter was still too low, and I was scolded by the main customer. They didn't think so, the business was not good, and my own income was also reduced, and the boss would blame me again. It's the same if it comes in too expensive, it's a loss.

Since I had taken on such a job, my life also took a turn. I did things to apprentices as if I was getting revenge. When it was time to eat, I pushed my empty bowl into the hands of the apprentices, and they naturally brought over the second and third bowls…

After the Incident, paper money depreciated, and prices underwent great changes. Speculators used their skills to further stimulate prices upward. In this way, we pawnshop business, which many people considered to be exploiting the poor, suffered a not small blow from the depreciation of paper money. The shrewd bosses had already changed their business, scattering the employees. Maybe some people thought that our employees could get a severance payment, but they were very disappointed. The boss must have made a fortune, a Chaofeng with no other skills got a few hundred yuan, using the money from our "deposit box" (the same as the small account of the conscience store is a split account), but broke a rice bowl.

My old boss closed down last summer, and I felt the fear of unemployment for the first time.

In this kind of society, no one can resist the scourge of life! I, who was called "Chaofeng", had no other skills besides the pawnshop business. In this situation, I was just waiting to starve to death. Even if I was lucky enough to find another employee, getting a few hundred yuan in salary, excluding my own board and lodging, there probably wouldn't be enough left over for other expenses. There was no source for the burden of my family, and no one wanted to starve to death. So I still ran to the familiar industry, but the days became more and more tense, from the hall of a large shikumen store to a single-room store to serve, and then drifting to the entrance of a general so-called "hotel", "tea room" also known as "legitimate entertainment venue", like a toilet-like small, outside hanging the old goods dealership Pawnshop working there, at this time is adding a "old goods ghost" title.

Due to the rise of "legitimate entertainment venues", the pawnshop business has developed in a distorted way, and it is also the golden age for employees, but it has instead caused some employees to go down the road to corruption and live a dissolute life.

The old boss earned money, changed his business, and made more money. Now the emerging small boss assets are increasing, me? Fortunately, my "luck" is a little better, I have no debts, but the wrinkles on my forehead have increased a lot, Chaofeng is still a Chaofeng, living a worried life in the current society!

### Driven by Hardship, Teacher Temporarily Works as Cook, Hoping for Sympathy and Assistance from Society

Mr. Ying Qijun writes: I am no longer young, having previously served in my native Guangdong as a Chinese language teacher and a clerk-secretary. After coming to Shanghai, I switched to commerce, but my business failed after the incident. To save expenses, I sent my family back home and remained alone in Shanghai. Coincidentally, a certain residence advertised for a cook. Because I have a natural interest in cooking and have experience with Cantonese cuisine, I catered to the need for a livelihood and took on the role of head chef, which lasted for several years. In recent years, I have been unemployed again, moving between Beijing and Shanghai, finding it difficult to make a living. In addition, with frequent illnesses, I often find myself with an empty stomach and no means to survive. The reason, I believe, is partly due to my aloof personality and lack of close friends, but also my shyness to compromise, which is my inexperience in the world. Recently, I have been under immense pressure from the high cost of living, driving me to manual labor, where I am exhausted and dizzy. One day of work requires two days of rest, and even then, I cannot recover. Moreover, the wages earned from a day's labor are not enough to cover the cost of three days of thin porridge. This situation is truly the most difficult stage I have ever experienced in my life. Ziyou governed Wucheng with music and song, using a great talent for a small task. I, with my weak physique, perform manual labor, like using a razor to cut an ox. How different are these two situations! Should I continue to struggle? Then this life of hard labor is like cutting flesh to cure hunger. Should I simply resign myself to fate? Then this is passive and irresponsible, betraying the ambitions of a man. It is truly a dilemma, like a ram caught in a fence. Alas! In this bustling world, there are many cold stares, but on this weary journey, there may be someone who understands. Therefore, I humbly submit this letter, hoping to reach a sympathetic ear. Firstly, for my own sake, I seek sympathy from society. Whether as a clerk or a cook, I ask for a place to stay, so that I can first solve the immediate problem of food and have a place to stay to dedicate myself to the country and society in the future. Secondly, for the sake of the public, I hope that those who share my plight and misfortune (as reported in the newspapers a few years ago, there was a university graduate pulling a rickshaw) will have even stronger determination than I do, and that they will receive more sympathetic assistance and have a brighter and more promising future than I do. As the saying goes, "Help others succeed, so that you may succeed", that is the intention behind my words. (Note: This gentleman is an unrecognized talent. If he receives assistance from society and is given a job, such as copying documents or teaching, he would gladly accept, regardless of the salary. He can also provide a guarantor. Letters can be forwarded through this newspaper office.)

### Eating Brown Rice and Its Cooking Method

— Huang Haoyou

At a time when food is scarce and flour prices are high, reducing consumption is as important as increasing production. Therefore, when we eat rice, the first thing we should do is choose the most nutritious variety. In terms of rice available to the population of this city, most of it is brown rice. However, due to habits, many citizens dislike it and often mill brown rice into white rice, and the bran layer is only used for animal feed, resulting in the loss of valuable Vitamin B, which is both uneconomical and regrettable. Although pure white rice is easy to digest and makes you feel full, its nutritional value is lower than that of brown rice. According to Dr. Inoue Kaneo, a Japanese nutritionist, in his book "The Science of Nutrition": "Eating too much meat can lead to unhealthy conditions, such as arteriosclerosis, and the nutritional value is not as high as that of plant-based foods." This illustrates that plant-based foods are economical and nutritious. Recently, the Food Department believes that in this time of war, it is inappropriate to waste food, and is actively promoting the consumption of brown rice, in order to secure the people's food supply.

The cooking method of brown rice is different from that of white rice, because it has hard and soft varieties. The following is a brief description of the cooking method of brown rice for reference: Brown rice must be washed gently, not rubbed hard, to avoid loss of nutrients and vitamins. It is best to wash it the day before cooking. When cooking brown rice, the standard for adding water is generally one and a half to two liters of water for every liter of brown rice. The lid of the rice cooker should be heavy to prevent steam from escaping during boiling. Firewood, charcoal, or coal briquettes can be used as fuel, but the cooking time should be slightly longer than that of white rice. First, cook it over low heat, and after five to twenty minutes, it will boil, and steam will escape from the edge of the lid. After four to five minutes, gradually reduce the heat until all the steam dissipates, and let it stand for thirty to forty minutes. At this time, the rice grains absorb water and expand to their full size. Then, cook it over high heat until the rice juice is dried up, which takes ten to twenty minutes. The cooked brown rice is not only soft and palatable, but also very nutritious. However, one point is often overlooked: brown rice needs to be chewed thoroughly, more than thirty times for each mouthful, to aid digestion."
