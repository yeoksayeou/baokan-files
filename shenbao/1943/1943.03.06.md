### The Problem of Organizations for Controlling Prices

The price issue is currently the most important issue. Not only the price issue in this city awaits the concerted efforts of the Bureau of Commerce and citizens to seek a solution, but also it is very serious for the entire country. Currently, the authorities have a complete policy for the wartime economy, and have considerable countermeasures and methods for price controls. However, from the perspective of our national conditions, especially from the perspective of the current actual environment, if the distance between "governing methods" and "governing people" cannot be closely coordinated, then the effect of all policies will be difficult to meet the ideal. For this reason, we specifically raise the issue of organizations for controlling prices for a little discussion, which may arouse research from relevant parties.

First, let's talk about the central organization. According to wartime principles, a unified economy must be implemented during wartime, and an agency with supreme power must be established to control it. For example, although the work of stabilizing prices is not the entirety of a unified economy in name, in fact, to achieve the effect of price stabilization work, a comprehensive unification is necessary. We have always believed that this is the only principle, otherwise, even if it does not trouble the people and harm businesses, it will inevitably be counterproductive. Today, the authorities must have greater determination and perseverance to earnestly and practically control prices. In terms of matters, they must double their efforts to seek appropriateness. In terms of people, they must double their efforts to carefully select and appoint those who are loyal to the country and love the people and have expertise, so that they can shoulder the mission of comprehensive price stabilization. The central organization needs absolute power and concentrated strength to guide all organizations related to prices. The Japanese and German central price stabilization organizations' systems of being able to direct relevant departments are worth our country's reference.

The importance of local organizations is actually no less than that of central organizations, and even has a decisive effect on the entire policy. Therefore, it must be valued and not neglected. If the provincial authorities can personally preside over and truly engage in practical work, there is no problem with power, and the central government should select the virtuous and the capable to assist. With unified personnel and clear responsibilities, then it can be effective. Otherwise, if the personnel are fragmented and entangled, without full power to execute, I am afraid that even the virtuous and capable will not be able to exert their talents, and unscrupulous people can manipulate things for their own benefit and engage in corruption. To be more clear, the highest authorities of the province and special municipalities in a province's organization have important political and even military responsibilities. It is not necessary to require them to be all-knowing and all-powerful in economics and even price stabilization technology. He must give the person who actually presides over price control in a province support in terms of power, empower him with the power of personnel administration and all measures, strengthen his command power, expand his command ability, enhance his economic and political authority, and not recommend personnel to him, and not interfere with his legitimate work, so that he can exert his full ability. Only in this way can we expect him to exert his ability to achieve success.

As for county-level organizations, the scope is relatively small, and if the actual person in charge of the provincial organization is relatively capable, the work of the county organization will certainly not have many problems in terms of technology. Although the work of the county authorities today is very busy, adding price control work is still barely manageable. However, the county should also fully contact local impartial people, and at the same time, the party department should expand its efforts in the actual work process and provide continuous assistance to the county government. Then the county organization can also exert its considerable power and consolidate the foundation of the national price control policy.

Finally, we want to solemnly point out that the implementation of price control policies is not enough to rely on the independent soundness of government agencies at all levels. On the one hand, it is necessary to require the vertical unity of agencies at all levels, with no gaps between top and bottom; on the other hand, they should take care of each other and cooperate with each other horizontally. On the other hand, whether it is the price control work in this city or in various provinces, cities, and counties, it is necessary to pay attention to close cooperation with civil organizations, so that civil organizations have the right to speak to the government and the right to supervise price stabilization agencies at all levels, so as to truly harvest the effectiveness of their assistance. Otherwise, if there is only a name for requiring civil cooperation, or only allowing them to say yes, then it is to lose the original intention of official-civilian cooperation.

### The Effect of the New Policy Towards China

The National Government of China resolutely joined the war on January 9th. The Japanese government responded by implementing a major transformation in its policy towards China with a far-sighted perspective. We expect this epoch-making measure to have a significant effect on strengthening the National Government and tightening the relationship between Japan and China. Subsequently, we have been quietly observing the changes in China's internal situation and the movements of the general public. Within a short period of two months, our belief that our expectations will not be in vain has been largely confirmed, which is very gratifying.

There are countless sources of evidence to prove this, and the most obvious ones are the reports and talks of military officers Imai and Tanaka, who returned home after conducting an inspection and investigation of the situation in China after the National Government joined the war. The two military officers first stated: "Due to the participation in the war, the banner of the National Government has become clear, and it has been able to gather the people under the banner. The people have also welcomed it with joy, giving a very good impression in general, and their attitude is quite clear." This is indeed the most important point. If the National Government is to be rapidly strengthened, the first thing to do is to firmly grasp the hearts of the people under its rule. This is undeniable. Therefore, it is absolutely necessary for the National Government itself to first clarify its character and reveal the banner of its advancement. However, it was only due to the National Government's participation in the war and the Japanese government's shift in its policy towards China that the National Government was able to realize this.

It goes without saying that the reason why the general public in China is delighted to support the National Government's participation in the war is because the significance of the National Government's participation in the war is guaranteed by the Japanese government's shift in its policy towards China. If there were no such guarantee from the Japanese government, it is quite questionable whether the National Government's participation in the war would immediately receive the support of the general public. The section in the two military officers' talks that "due to the promotion of Sino-Japanese cooperation, some of the people who have been holding a wait-and-see attitude have also awakened and are moving towards the National Government" is indeed worth pondering. The report also stated that in addition to the general public, powerful figures in the financial community are also successively joining the National Government. The participation of people in the financial community has a very effective effect on the substantial strengthening of the National Government, which is an undeniable fact. However, the biggest reason why the National Government has been able to absorb people in the financial community in this way is undoubtedly because the Japanese government has adopted a new policy towards China. This goes without saying. (Ding: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 27)

### The Central Front in Soviet Territory Will Become the Main Battlefield The Soviet Army in Rzhev Continues to Advance The Target is Obviously Smolensk The German Army in the Donets Basin is Currently Advancing Northward

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: Today's German military report stated that our army has occupied several more places in the Donets region, the most notable of which is the city of Lysychansk. Several Soviet troops that were defeated have been cleared. In recent days, the strong Soviet force that attempted to encircle the northern flank of the German army's Kupyansk bridgehead was severely attacked by the German army and retreated towards the shallow lake area. Hundreds of enemies were captured, and a lot of military equipment and supplies were seized. The Third Corps of the Soviet tank column was trapped south of Kharkov, and its area of activity has shrunk. It will soon be annihilated. Attempts to break out of the encirclement have failed. West of Kursk and northwest of Orel, the Soviet army repeatedly attacked, suffering heavy losses and retreating without success. Between Shatsk and Lake Ilmen, the Soviet army launched several attacks, but was eventually repelled by German artillery fire. Soviet tanks and planes assisted the army in attacking Staraya Russa on both sides, and the battle lasted for a long time. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses and retreated. The air force made a great contribution to this battle.

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: Well-informed sources here said that the focus of the Eastern Front has shifted to Staraya Russa, south of Lake Ilmen. Yesterday, a Soviet tank column launched a massive attack after heavy shelling, but was still repelled. After the Soviet army stopped its advance on the southern route, the Soviet army on the northern route adopted a winter warfare plan before the weather warmed up and tried to move.

Agence France-Presse, Stockholm, 5th: The German army continued its offensive in the Donets Basin yesterday and occupied the two towns of Proletarskaya and Lysychansk. According to Berlin Radio last night, after the German army occupied Slavyansk (southeast of Kharkov), it advanced towards Izyum and has captured the two towns. The German army is now holding a 160-mile-long front in the middle and lower reaches of the Donets River and is currently advancing northward, with fierce fighting all the way. After the Soviet army that is advancing north recovered Rzhev, it continued to press on Smolensk, the main base of the German army on the central front. Moscow news acknowledged that the German army launched a fierce counterattack in this area. The Red Army took a fierce air offensive while advancing on land, but the German air force also launched a counterattack, vying for air supremacy. The planes of both sides constantly bombed the enemy's front lines and rear transportation lines. The new Soviet offensive is clearly aimed at Smolensk, bypassing Vyazma, in an attempt to flank a corner of this salient of the German army in front of Moscow. Smolensk was once the location of Hitler's headquarters and the concentration point of the axis forces on the central front. As for the offensive of the Soviet army in the Taganrog Bay area, it is still blocked by the German army that is stubbornly holding out east of Taganrog.

Agence Havas, Soviet Border, 5th: The ice and snow in the southern part of the Eastern Front are melting, and the fighting has eased as a result. Military operations are more intense between Lake Ilmen and Kursk. There are only local conflicts in the Caucasus, combined with artillery battles. The climate near Rostov and Taganrog is harsh, making combat particularly difficult. The two armies are digging trenches and holding fast. In the Donets River Basin, the German army is consolidating its occupied territories in the Slavyansk and Izyum areas and clearing out the remaining enemies nearby. The Red Army has taken a defensive posture in the Kharkov area. West of Kursk, the Red Army is still launching an offensive towards the Desna River. The Red Army is intensifying its pressure in the Orel area. Semi-official German sources acknowledge that the German defense line has been breached, but the Red Army's advance has been contained, and its penetrating units have been surrounded and are being annihilated. There is no news about the situation between Rzhev and Lake Ladoga. It is only known that the two armies are reinforcing their forces, and this area will be the main battlefield on the Eastern Front within the month.

### The German Army in the Orel Area Adopts a Flexible and Mobile Strategy

Haitong News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The German army's withdrawal from the Tynyanysk bridgehead and Rzhev was completely unexpected by the Soviet side, and even the Soviet command did not dare to immediately acknowledge it. At the same time, Britain and the United States are speculating about the significance of the German army's adoption of this strategy. Recently, the enemy army has become increasingly active in the Orel area, but it has been repelled by the German army in the northern part of the area. At the same time, the German army has adopted a flexible and mobile strategy and launched an offensive in the southern part of the area. The enemy army in the southwestern part of Orel encountered a German surprise attack and more than a thousand of them were killed and 42 artillery pieces were destroyed. The German army suffered very heavy losses. The enemy army is continuing to exert pressure on the northwestern part of Kursk. Although it has made progress, it has paid a heavy price. The fighting is still fierce in that area. The German army is making smooth progress on the Mius front. The enemy army has been forced to withdraw from the city of Akhtyrka, northwest of Kharkov. The German army is pursuing the victory, and the enemy army is collapsing to the east. A Soviet tank army south of Kharkov has been heavily encircled by the German army and has little hope of breaking out. After the German army occupied Slavyansk, it approached the Donets front of Voroshilovgrad and has now stabilized it.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 5th: The weather in the southern part of the Eastern Front has recently warmed up slightly, and the frozen areas are gradually thawing, resulting in mud that is knee-deep, making it difficult for both the German and Soviet armies to launch large-scale operations. The German authorities also announced that the German army counterattacking the Donets area is still the previous combat unit. As for the reserve force, it remains behind and has not been mobilized, in preparation for launching a summer offensive.

### The Seventh Meeting of the National Defense Council Passed the Regulations on Awarding the Tongguang Medal

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th: The Supreme National Defense Council held its seventh meeting yesterday (5th) and resolved the following important cases: (1) The Chairman submitted for discussion a proposal by Committee Member and Minister of Industry Mei Siping that the government implement control over major materials and manage and stabilize prices, and that industrial and commercial organizations be purely economic institutions and not participate in political movements and training matters, in order to facilitate work and stabilize people's livelihoods. The resolution was passed and submitted to the Executive Yuan for compliance. The reasons for the proposal are attached as follows: "I humbly submit that stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening economic power are the primary urgent tasks of the government's administration under the wartime system. Now the government should implement control over major materials in order to seek the adjustment and rationalization of production, distribution, and consumption. The price of materials and the supply and demand of materials are closely related and should also be managed at the same time to prevent speculation and hoarding, so that prices are not easily stabilized. All kinds of industrial and commercial organizations are the main body for implementing material control and maintaining price balance. It seems that they should be designated as purely economic institutions so that they can concentrate on assisting the government in carrying out the above-mentioned economic policies. From now on, any political movements and training should target the Baojia system and should no longer be active within the scope of industrial and commercial organizations, in order to improve the organization of industrial and commercial organizations, which will be conducive to the promotion of material control and price stabilization policies. (2) The draft regulations on the awarding of the Tongguang Medal were amended and passed. The awarding regulations are attached separately. (3) Huang Ziqiang was specially appointed as a member of the Military Affairs Commission. (Attached report) Huang Ziqiang, Deputy Chief of Staff and Director of the General Affairs Office of the Military Affairs Commission, resigned from his concurrent position as Deputy Chief of Staff, which was approved. Xiang Zhizhuang was appointed as Deputy Chief of Staff. (4) Zhang Yilie, Deputy Director of the Committee for Blocking the Zhongmou Breach in the Yellow River, has another assignment and is relieved of his current position. Yin Zhi was specially appointed as Deputy Director of the Committee for Blocking the Zhongmou Breach in the Yellow River.

### War Results of Japanese Army in Ji-Lu Controlled Area

Jinan, 5th Central News Agency - In order to annihilate the Yu-Communist forces around Wuding in northern Shandong Province, the Japanese army has launched sweeping operations since January 9, scoring successive victories and killing Xu Shangwu, commander of the 2nd Military Sub-district of the Ji-Lu Border Region, with great gains. Since February 21, new operations have been launched again. Near Baheijiang in Yangxin County, about 600 troops of Wang Fugong's Yu-affiliated army were wiped out. Near Dasangshu in Leling County, about 500 Communist troops of the 3rd Military Sub-district of the Ji-Lu Border Region were wiped out. Near Zhongjia in Huimin, about 400 troops of Zhang Shengong's bandits were wiped out. Near Buzhuang in Wenxian, Zhou Zhizhong's troops of the 20th Security Brigade of the Yu-affiliated Shandong Province were defeated with great results. Currently, the Japanese army is continuing to expand the battlefield. It is calculated that since the Japanese army began operations on January 9, until March 4, the comprehensive battle results ascertained are as follows: 2,265 Yu-Communist corpses were abandoned, 1,304 were captured, 1,665 Yu-Communist rifles were seized, 1 heavy machine gun, 16 light machine guns, 109 pistols, 124 military horses, and a large number of other kinds of ammunition.

### Weekly War Report of Japanese Army in China

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th - The Japanese China Expeditionary Force announced its war report for the past week today as follows: The Japanese China Expeditionary Force's spring offensive operations have achieved their expected goals, and they are currently continuing to mop up the remnants of the defeated Yu-Communist forces. Among the operations, what is particularly commendable is that the Chinese military and government officials and people in the Su-Huai and Wuhan areas actively cooperated and participated in the operations, ensuring a large area of grain-producing areas. This has made a great contribution to politics and war. Also, in the Wuhan area, Yu general Wang Jinzai was captured, and about 7,600 of his subordinates were annihilated, and about 18,500 people were captured. This has greatly hit the Yu side's camp. The mop-up operations against the Communist army launched in North China are still echoing those in Central China, and they are actively continuing to be active in various places. The battles in Hebei and Shanxi provinces have become increasingly fierce and are expanding the battlefield. Also, the Japanese army's air force has closely cooperated in the operations in various regions, bombing the Yu air force at any time. Therefore, the Yu air force's guerrilla warfare has been crushed, and there is no possibility of attacking. Since peacefully entering Guangzhou Bay from the air on the 21st of last month, it has bombed the Yu army's military facilities in the surrounding areas and repeatedly attacked key points in the Hu-Gui provinces, such as Guilin, Liuzhou, Lingling, and Daoxian. On the 27th, at the Liuzhou Yu Airport, a Yu fighter plane that was about to escape was bombed. The plane was hit by a bullet and caught fire. On the 28th, the ships of the Yu remnants were bombed downstream of Shashi on the Yangtze River, achieving great results.

It is also expected that price cooperation conferences in various parts of China will be established soon.

### Axis Forces Make Progress on the Northern Coast of Tunisia, British Forces Suffer Damage Near Benghazi, Gafsa Area Held by French Forces

Tai City, 5th (Domei News Agency) - According to recent reports from here, the activities in the coastal area of the Tunisian front, from the area south of Cape Serrat along the road to Dabaqa in the east, are mostly limited to air bombings by German and Italian air forces on Allied troop concentrations and transport convoys. In the northern front, there is infantry combat north and south of Xurte Erqulit, while only minor skirmishes have occurred in the coastal area. German mechanized units have made some advances. A British infantry company with artillery support northeast of Béja attempted to prevent the slow advance of a large German infantry force, but failed. In the eastern part of the central front, British forces continued reconnaissance activities without major contact. The German air force launched a fierce attack on the northern flank of the British First Army, inflicting heavy damage. British artillery units and military equipment along the coast were heavily bombed by German and Italian aircraft. Port facilities in Algiers were attacked on Wednesday at midnight.

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from North Africa, Axis forces in northern Tunisia launched a fierce attack on the British First Army and gradually expanded their gains. On the central and southern fronts, the two armies did not launch large-scale battles. In the past few days, the anti-Axis side had widely publicized that British forces on the central front were carrying out counter-offensives, but they fell silent on the 4th. Mechanized reconnaissance units of the British Eighth Army entered Axis positions but were quickly repelled.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities issued a detailed report on the northern Tunisian front on the 4th, stating that Axis attacking units in northern Tunisia are currently strengthening their positions along the coastline and adjacent areas, crushing British resistance south of Cape Serrat, and advancing westward.

The Allied headquarters in North Africa issued a statement today, acknowledging that German forces have made progress near Cape Serrat, in the area of Sant Jina, a small station on the Dabaqa to Ma railway line. However, the Axis forces encountered fierce resistance from the Allies and suffered heavy losses. The German army is now reinforcing infantry with tanks in the area. British and American light railway units have been successful in repelling Axis offensives on other routes. The Berlin communique only announced that Axis forces were attacking enemy positions in Tunisia.

The famous Reich Museum has also been reduced to rubble. On March 1st, Berlin was attacked by enemy aircraft. The Hedwig Catholic Church, built in the 18th century, caught fire and burned down. Many hospitals and ancient buildings were also destroyed.

Vichy, 4th (Havas) - The recent British bombing of major cities in France is inhumane. The German occupation authorities in Paris expressed deep sympathy for the victims and donated 100,000 francs for relief efforts in the hardest-hit areas of Brest, Lorient, and Saint-Nazaire.

Ambassador Kuriyama and Governor-General Decoux have been negotiating repeatedly since the beginning of this year, aiming to consolidate the economic relationship between the two countries on a new foundation adapted to new developments.

### British Reporter Praises Japanese Military Strength

Stockholm, Sweden, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from London, British reporter Wittich, who is quite knowledgeable about East Asian affairs, published an article in the Manchester Guardian on the 3rd, discussing East Asian issues and urging the British people not to underestimate the strength of the Japanese military. He stated, "Many British people still believe that defeating Japan will be easy once the European war ends. This is a dangerous idea. The Japanese are far superior to us in courage and endurance. Former ambassador to Japan, Grew, has also taken every opportunity since returning to his country to repeatedly explain the difficulties of fighting Japan to the Americans, emphasizing that it will be difficult to subdue Japan unless it is completely defeated. He also pointed out the unity of the Japanese people. All of this is true. The Japanese military has absolute faith and possesses modern weapons and strict military discipline, so it is able to overcome all obstacles and win every battle. Even if their food rations are reduced, they can endure months of combat, which the British and American armies would not be able to tolerate."

### Several British Paratroopers Captured in Burma

Rangoon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Although the British and Indian armies are clamoring to retake Burma, they are powerless before the Japanese army and resort to espionage tactics. However, they have been thwarted due to the cooperation of the Burmese people with the Japanese army. On the afternoon of February 14, around 5:00 PM, British aircraft flew low over the northwestern plateau of Xi Yangzhou, Dahuinji, covering up the Japanese army's ears and eyes, and allowed six spies to descend by parachute. The British army believed that all places were safe where there were no Japanese soldiers guarding them, so they descended. However, the residents, who were full of defensive spirit, discovered them and immediately rushed to the landing site with shovels, surrounding the six men. Seeing the situation was not good, the British opened fire, causing anger among the Burmese, who killed three of them with shovels. The remaining three escaped the encirclement but were soon captured. The residents imprisoned them in the village chief's house and handed them over to the Japanese military police the next morning.

### Today's Internal and External Situation in Germany: Abundant Resources Not Obscured by Anglo-American Propaganda; Axis Unity Advances Towards Victory; Interview with Japanese Military Attaché to Germany, Lieutenant General Sakaishi Ichiro

Lieutenant General Sakaishi Ichiro, after spending three years in Germany, returned to Japan on January 19th. During a press conference held at the Army Ministry on February 25th, he spoke at length about the current situation in Germany. Lieutenant General Sakaishi first mentioned: (1) Exposing the deceptive propaganda and schemes of the Anglo-American side regarding the world war situation; (2) The situation of the German-Soviet war; (3) Germany's domestic preparations; (4) Securing human resources and important war materials such as iron, coal, and oil; (5) The tendency of small countries surrounding Germany and Italy; (6) Negating talks of German-British peace. He concluded by saying, "Mutual trust among the Axis powers is the path to achieving final victory." The Lieutenant General has been stationed in Germany three times, and was already the military attaché to Germany at the beginning of the German-Soviet war. He has personally observed the national conditions of Germany, and frankly exchanged opinions with the leaders of the German Wehrmacht, making him one of the Army Ministry's leading experts on Germany.

When I left Germany in early December of last year, I personally met with the leaders of the German Wehrmacht, at which time I said, "After returning home, I will introduce the great German spirit to Japan." The propaganda of the Anglo-Americans is completely different from the propaganda of the Axis powers. The Anglo-Americans' so-called warfare is not a genuine war fought with their own strength; their fundamental strategy is to use the power of gold to buy off others and to deceive through propaganda. We, on the other hand, fight with real strength. We do not say a word before attacking or landing anywhere; once a decision is made, we immediately carry it out. This is what sets us apart from the Anglo-Americans.

Anglo-American Exaggerated Propaganda

The Anglo-American method is to often use big words to scare away the enemy, speaking in flowery language to confuse the whole world. But the Axis powers, after concluding some kind of agreement, often keep it hidden and do not announce it. For example, after the Casablanca Conference, Churchill suddenly flew to Ankara (the capital of Turkey) to conclude a military alliance! And then there was a meeting with Stalin! And then Chiang Kai-shek flew to America! These are all tricks of propaganda-firstism.

The Soviet Union is not like that either. When taking action, they always bury their heads and work hard silently, so it is easy to cause misunderstandings and difficult to know the truth. Making falsehoods into truth only breeds suspicion, and naturally leads to a war of nerves. As a result of nervous breakdowns leading to being at a loss, actions become erratic. Therefore, we must ask, is the German war situation good or bad? The front line on the European continent has indeed retreated slightly, but Germany is engaged in the war with nearly one thousand divisions. From such a large force, the number of ten divisions is equal to scouting troops of another star. Even using seven divisions to deal with the enemy in North Africa is less than one percent, far from the decisive battleground in Europe, and is simply equal to zero. However, the Germans used the Battle of Stalingrad to create a big propaganda, saying that 200,000 German troops were surrounded. In fact, from the perspective of 20 million people in a thousand divisions, 200,000 people is only one percent of them. From a global perspective, that's not a big deal.

Germany's Domestic Situation

Germany has no fear of external enemies, but what is the domestic situation like? The rumors of infighting between the Nazi Party and the military are really boring. There is no such thing as party, army, officials, or people in Germany. The resignation of German Army Commander Gatter and the resignation of Chief of Staff Halder are regarded by the Anglo-Americans as the most gratifying propaganda materials, but in Germany, it is to prepare for a long-term war and replace older people with younger people. This time, the replacement of Admiral Raeder did not hear of any disputes. The intention of using younger people on the front line is to make the army more full of vigor. At present, the party, the army, and all aspects are safe and sound.

Germany's War Resources

Next, regarding food, the food situation in Berlin does not seem to be so bad, and there is no starvation. Naturally, the average person does not get as much food as usual. Although it feels a bit lacking, it is not felt to be difficult. The food rationed in Germany now is probably the worst, and it will gradually improve in the future. There are no mountains in Ukraine, only vast farmland, and most of the farmers have returned to the land. Germany's food problem will be solved by Ukraine's granary.

Iron, coal, and oil are not a problem either. There is still oil to spare, and a large oil field has recently been discovered. Every effort is made to secure it, so there is no need to worry. There is also a considerable amount of inventory now. Berlin almost does not use charcoal automobiles.

Again, manpower is also a very important issue. Last November, Hitler gave a speech on the population issue. Now Germany has 24.5 million laborers, including French prisoners of war, volunteer laborers, and many laborers from Italy. There is now about one division of Spanish volunteers, and many are also joining the labor volunteer army. German male laborers are now being replaced by women and prisoners of war, greatly increasing the mobilization capacity.

To say that the future is very optimistic is not entirely true. Daily life is not very happy. There are some things that are not very satisfactory in terms of human resources and food distribution. Labor has also been maximized in the deployment of war, so the people who remain are working quite hard.

The Combination of Allied Nations

The German people naturally have a deep trust in Hitler, and Mussolini and Hitler also deeply trust each other without any barriers. Regarding Romania, Prime Minister Antonescu's trust in President Hitler is also unshakable. Now Yugoslavia has also joined the Anti-Comintern Pact. On the day after the signing with Ambassador Oshima and others, the Yugoslav cabinet was reorganized, and Hitler solved the Yugoslav problem with extremely steady means. Bulgarian troops will also soon be stationed in Bulgaria. In addition, the German army adopts a steady and solid tactic in the way the war is conducted, taking Ukraine and trapping the Caucasus. Ordinary armies would never do this so easily. The fall of Moscow is only a matter of time, and it will be realized when the time comes.

German-British Peace Talks

Recently, there has been a rumor that Britain and Germany will make peace separately, which is very surprising. The main actors in this war are Britain and Germany. Britain stationed its ambassadors in France and the Soviet Union to fight for Britain. The most foolish thing is the Soviet Union, which was fooled. What will happen to the United States if Britain and Germany shake hands? If the armistice between Britain and Germany is agreed to by the United States, then the war can be declared over. What will happen to the Soviet Union then? What plan will Germany propose in the peace negotiations, and what plan will Britain propose in the peace negotiations? The United States will be busy boasting and propagandizing, Japan will take action in Siberia, and everyone will be engaged in the division of spheres of influence in the post-war world. It is true that Britain might be willing to stop the war as long as Germany is willing to do so. But is it not possible?

German-Soviet Peace Talks Are Also Impossible

It is also very interesting to study whether Germany and the Soviet Union will make peace separately. Studying its diplomatic tactics in the study of diplomatic history will be a good reference for the future. In fact, if it is possible, unless one side admits defeat and expresses submission, then that is another matter. But under Stalin's command, the Soviet Union will never admit defeat, so it is impossible in conclusion.

Just as Hitler trusts Mussolini and Antonescu, we should trust our allies even more and move towards the road to victory. Finally, when I returned home, the German people and dignitaries hoped that I would convey the real situation in Germany to Japan. At present, the only way to contact the Axis countries in Japan and Europe is by radio. On the other hand, the Anglo-Americans can exchange information by plane via Lisbon, so it is very difficult to transmit news between the Axis powers. My return to Japan this time provides a good opportunity to explain the real situation in Germany. I hope that this will lead to mutual trust and cooperation, and not be confused by rumors. Mutual trust among the Axis countries is the greatest key to achieving final victory. Without mutual trust, it is absolutely impossible to fight to the end together.

### Formation of the New Finnish Cabinet: Professor Linkomies Appointed Prime Minister; Only Foreign and Interior Ministers Changed Among Cabinet Members

Helsinki, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — Professor Linkomies, an important figure in the Finnish Conservative Party, has formed a new cabinet. It includes five members of the Social Democratic Party, four members of the Agrarian League, two members of the Conservative Party, one member each from the People's Party and the Liberal Progressive Party, and three non-partisan cabinet members. Nine members of the previous cabinet remain in their positions. New cabinet members include the Prime Minister, the Foreign Minister, the Interior Minister, the Vice Minister of Finance, and the Vice Minister of Agriculture. The new Foreign Minister is former Welfare Minister Ramsay, who does not belong to any party. Former Foreign Minister and Trade Minister Ainola is now the Interior Minister. Defense Minister Lieutenant General Walden, although not affiliated with any party, tends to lean towards the Conservative Party. In addition to the aforementioned ministers, the Minister of Justice is Rytökönen, the Minister of Finance is Donner, the Minister of Agriculture is Kalliojärvi, the Minister of Construction is Salovaara, the Minister of Industry and Commerce is Takki, and the Minister of Social Affairs is Fagerholm.

Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — Professor Linkomies was ordered to form a cabinet the day before yesterday. Apart from the change in Prime Minister, the most important changes in the cabinet are the Foreign Minister and the Interior Minister. The general policy direction of the new government has been declared by President Ryti during his re-election as President, concentrating all efforts to achieve the goal of defending the security of the eastern border, which is also the goal of Finland's war effort. Professor Linkomies has always been known for his clear mind and should be able to accomplish his mission as Prime Minister. In terms of international relations, the formation of the new cabinet brings the relationship between Germany and Finland, fighting side by side, closer together. The attempts of Britain and the United States to undermine the relationship between Finland and Germany can be said to have been in vain.

Helsinki, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — The new Prime Minister of the Finnish Cabinet, Linkomies, is the leader of the Conservative Coalition Party. Since 1936, he has been not only the Vice President of the Coalition Party, but also the Deputy Speaker of the Parliament. He was born in Viipuri in 1894 and studied ancient texts, having served as a professor of Roman literature at the University of Helsinki. As for 1921 and 1923, he set up lectures at the school. He traveled to countries such as Germany, Italy, and Greece to conduct research. He joined the Finnish Academy of Science in 1931 and is also a member of other foreign academies of science. There have been rumors of him taking on the role of Prime Minister several times before.

### German Propaganda Minister Writes Article Refuting Peace Overtures, Saying That If We Can Navigate Danger as If on Flat Ground and Remain Calm in the Face of Crisis, We Will Be Able to Overcome Today's Difficulties

Berlin, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — German Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "Das Reich" refuting the interpretation of "German peace overtures," saying that it is unwise to think that German leaders have recently repeatedly stated that the crisis of Bolshevism for Europe is a peace overture. Anyone who knows a little about the situation in Germany knows that the German people have no intention of surrendering. We are extremely optimistic about the future of the war, but we would rather underestimate our opportunities, because people will surely welcome sudden good fortune and hate sudden disasters. Although the Bolsheviks are still far from our country's border, we must foresee its danger and rather have a plan to resist it, otherwise we will regret it too late. Today's war is a war of survival for us. In the course of the war, there will naturally be unpleasant and suspicious things coming together. Even if we are fools, we also know that countries in Europe that have not yet joined our side will never come to our side resolutely because of someone's speech or a newspaper's article. The appeals we have recently issued are exclusively for the German people or Germany's allies. Although other parts of the world can also hear these appeals, it is not out of Germany's original intention. Our belief in victory is becoming stronger today. If we can navigate danger as if on flat ground and remain calm in the face of crisis, then we will be able to overcome today's difficulties.

### The Muslim Problem in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere: Japan Rescues Muslims from the Shackles of Britain and America

At the House of Representatives session on February 23rd, regarding the Japanese government's policy towards Muslims around the world, Mr. Shiōten Nobutaka (Representative of Tokyo) raised a question. Foreign Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia responded that Japan will spare no effort to assist Muslims in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, respect their freedom of belief, and cooperate with each other to build a new order. Mr. Shiōten also asked what measures will be taken to popularize Islamic knowledge in Japan. The Director-General of the Ministry of Education responded that Islamic lectures will be opened at various imperial universities and private universities, and Islamic teaching materials will be prepared in secondary schools. At the same time, various plans will be formulated to make the general public have a deep understanding of Islam. The Japanese government's great concern for Muslims can be seen from this. The response is recorded below:

Foreign Minister Aoki of the Greater East Asia

Muslims have always been the victims of the British and American ambitions to dominate the world, which is worthy of sympathy. I will use the spirit of the founding of the country, where all people can live in their own way, to inform Muslims around the world, and I will make them fully understand the meaning of this war.

There are currently many Muslims living in the Greater East Asia region, especially in the northwest of China, with about 30 million Muslims. Japan is extremely concerned about these Muslims. The Muslims in Mongolia and North China are intended to make them realize the mission of building the Co-Prosperity Sphere and participate in the anti-communist movement and other construction movements. Especially in North China, local groups have been established in various places under the organization of the Muslim General Federation to promote various tasks. The Muslims in Manchuria, with Fengtian Province as the center, are also scattered in various places. They are law-abiding citizens of Manchuria. The Manchurian Muslim Association, established under the guidance of the government of that country, is also well-organized.

As a result of the Greater East Asia War, Muslims in the southern region have been freed from the shackles of Britain, America, and the Netherlands for many years and have expressed their cooperation with Japan.

In order to make these Muslims understand the actual situation in Japan, it is planned to invite their representatives and international students. We will strive to realize this plan in the future. In short, we hope that the Muslims in each region will realize the world situation, and as law-abiding citizens of the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, cooperate with us to build the Greater East Asia. Japan will provide strong support to make the Greater East Asia a place where they can live and work in peace and contentment.

Director-General Fujino

Regarding the Ministry of Education's facilities for Islamic affairs, in terms of education, religious lectures in various universities will pay special attention to research in this area. In terms of social education, in order to make existing religious teachers have a deep understanding of religious affairs in the southern regions, a southern religious lecture will be opened, which will focus on Islamic affairs. Furthermore, in order to popularize Islamic knowledge among the general public, it is planned to issue a series of religious cultures. Research on Islam will not be limited to various imperial universities, and Islamic research departments will also be established in various private universities. Furthermore, appropriate consideration will also be given to Islamic teaching materials in secondary education.

Regarding the Jewish nation, it is hoped that research will be conducted in the research institute in the future. Secondly, the issue of Muslim international students is a major measure to build the Greater East Asia by attracting international students from various regions of the Greater East Asia, so Muslims are very welcome to study in Japan. The government will do its best to support them to study in Japan. As for the guidance of life and the selection of schools, due to differences in customs and other aspects, it is necessary to give full consideration.

Foreign Minister Tani

I express my deep sympathy for the current situation of hundreds of millions of Muslims around the world. At the same time, I am extremely indignant at the attitude of the British and Americans towards Muslims. The Muslims in the Greater East Asia Sphere are now in a state of freedom of belief and living and working in peace and contentment. However, the Muslims under the rule of the Chongqing regime and in India and Africa are still being oppressed. Rescuing these Muslims in adversity is also one of the tasks of the Greater East Asia War. Japan does not engage in deceptive propaganda like the British and Americans. The people of Indonesia have already been given freedom. Muslims around the world all know that Japan is faithfully fulfilling the liberation of other nations.

### Submarine Threat Causes Worry for US and UK

Lisbon, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — According to Washington, US Propaganda Director Davis said yesterday that the activities of German submarines are cause for concern. The number of American ships sunk by German submarines in February was more than in January. Due to the harsh winter weather, submarine activity has been hampered. German submarines may sink more ships in the spring and summer.

Stockholm, 5th (Haitong News Agency) — A dispatch from a London correspondent states that British political figures have different views on the recent speech by British Naval Minister Alexander in the House of Commons. A group of optimists can remain calm about what he said, while a part of political figures expressed great dissatisfaction with Alexander's statement that German submarines are being produced rapidly and that the Allied forces cannot destroy them in time. However, informed British circles also admit that the outcome of the future war will be determined at sea. If the Allied forces fail to overcome the submarine threat, the future is not optimistic.

### Spanish Officials Deny Foreign Troops Crossing the Border

### British House of Lords Leader Says Allied Aid to Chongqing Depends on Air Transport, the Cutting Off of the Burma Road Has a Significant Impact, and US-Chongqing Negotiations in Washington Are Deadlocked

Lisbon, 5th (Domei News Agency) — Lord Cranborne, Leader of the British House of Lords, declared in the House of Lords yesterday that if the Burma Road remains closed for a long time, the United Nations' supply to Chongqing will be "unsatisfactory." Although aid is now being transported by air and efforts are being made to open up land routes, they ultimately cannot replace the Burma Road. After the main route for free aid to Chongqing, the Burma Road, was cut off, the Allied forces' aid to Chongqing was drastically reduced. This air transport is now the responsibility of the United States, but the total amount transported is inevitably limited, and certain bulky items cannot be transported. At this point, Lord Strabolgi suggested that one thousand transport planes would be sufficient. Lord Cranborne said that this might be the case, but he expressed doubt as to whether there are these one thousand transport planes.

Nanjing, 5th (Domei News Agency) — According to reliable sources here, the Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen's negotiations with the Washington authorities have reached a stalemate. These negotiations are based on the following three requirements proposed by Chongqing: (1) transport war equipment to Chongqing in accordance with the previously agreed-upon Lend-Lease Agreement; (2) convene an anti-Axis military conference centered on the United States and Chongqing to cancel the "Europe First" strategy currently advocated by Britain and the United States; (3) the United States and Chongqing conclude a loan agreement to develop the northwest of China. It is reported that the only result of the negotiations so far is that the Washington authorities have agreed to set up a Chinese Department in the Lend-Lease Bureau. Chongqing hopes that the establishment of this department will curb Washington's tendency to abandon aid to Chongqing. It is also said that Song Ziwen is quite dissatisfied with the Lend-Lease aid, because the United States has failed to immediately increase its aircraft stationed in China to 500. Regarding the convening of an anti-Axis military conference, the United States opposed Chiang Kai-shek's proposal to establish a European-Asian adjustment strategy. Song Ziwen failed to overcome this opposition from the United States, and the loan negotiations are also progressing slowly. At the same time, reliable sources from Chongqing said that more than half of the military supplies to Chongqing are stockpiled in India due to transportation difficulties. From this, it can be seen that even if Chongqing obtains a loan to develop the northwest, the necessary machinery cannot be transported to Chongqing.

### A Letter from America

— Qi Han

New York Correspondence

Forwarded from Macau, January 10, 1943

Half a year has passed in the blink of an eye since I left the motherland. Every time I think of my many old friends, I can't express the longing in my heart. However, because communication is too difficult, what way is there to convey my sincerity one by one? Consider this rambling piece as a letter, although its poverty of content may disappoint my friends. In this letter, I would first like to report on the journey I took to come to America. Next, following the order of the Middle East and South America, I will briefly inform you about the situations in the Middle East and the political situation in South America. Finally, I will talk about the various conditions in America.

(1) A Sixteen Thousand Mile Flight

War has changed everything. In peacetime, it was about six thousand miles to fly from Hong Kong to America. But this time, I flew through India, Africa, South America, and other places, flying more than ten thousand miles more. It took eleven days of flight from Dianqing, passing through Myanmar, India, Balochistan, Iran, Iraq, Egypt, Anglo-Egyptian Sudan, French Equatorial Africa, British Nigeria, and flying across the Atlantic Ocean to Miami, USA, via Brazil and Guyana. However, I stayed along the way for more than ten days, especially in Calcutta, India, where I was delayed the longest. I changed planes four times, and the trouble of those transfers still gives me a headache when I think about it.

(2) A Bird's-Eye View of the Middle East

In the Middle East, the larger regions and ethnic units, excluding Turkey, include Iran, the Arabian Peninsula, Iraq, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, etc., covering an area of ​​more than two million square miles and a population of nearly fifty million. Most of the people speak Arabic, with minor variations. In terms of faith, almost all belong to Islam. In terms of resources, the Nile River basin and Iran, Iraq, and other places produce large quantities of grains, cotton, sugar, wool, and various fertilizers. The reserves of petroleum are particularly abundant. It is said that 350,000 barrels of kerosene can be produced every day. The terrain of the Middle East is particularly strategically important in this world war. Because the connection between Britain, America, China, and India all relies on the Middle East as a hub. Even the aid to the Soviet Union mostly passes through the Persian Gulf, enters Iran, and then enters the Caspian Sea. Moreover, Egypt is also a military base for Britain and America in the Mediterranean. If the Middle East is not defended, the entire Mediterranean Sea, Black Sea, and Indian Ocean will be controlled by the Axis powers, and the entire African continent will suffer the same fate. At that time, not only would Hitler obtain more resources and cut off the connection between the Soviet Union, India, and America, but he could also threaten South America from the West African coast. Therefore, when Churchill and Roosevelt met for the second time in June, the main focus was on how to strengthen the defense of the Middle East. In the following months, the British and American armies, air forces, and supply trains have massively reinforced the Middle East. However, in Iran, Iraq, Egypt, the Arabian Peninsula, and other places, they loudly proclaimed "Hitler is the protector of Muslims" and shouted "Arabs want to be liberated from British enslavement." As recently as last spring, Iraq had a coup d'état under the direction of the Nazis, and the protagonist of that coup, Sasser, is still in Berlin. The Iranian King, Shah, who was extremely pro-Nazi, was forced to abdicate last September, but his potential influence still exists.

(3) A Glimpse of South America

The most noteworthy countries in South America are Argentina and Brazil. Among the South American countries, they are the largest in scale, and their political and economic attitudes have always been between the Axis powers and Britain and America, pleasing both sides. However, under the strong encouragement of the United States, the Brazilian government declared war on Germany and Italy on August 22. However, Argentina still maintains neutrality to this day. According to Argentina's new President Castillo, he is the most conservative and pro-Axis leader in Argentina. In the past, during his tenure as Vice President, he strongly opposed the Pan-American policy of the former President Cortes. In June of this year, Cortes was forced to step down, and Castillo succeeded him, holding great power, and his pro-German tendencies became even more obvious. Recently, the Radical Party and the Socialist Party jointly criticized Castillo in the House of Representatives for maintaining neutrality and strived to obtain the consent of the House of Representatives to re-examine foreign policy publicly. Finally, they passed a resolution to sever diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. However, the opposition party only won by a margin of three votes in passing this resolution, and the ruling party still has the Senate as its backing, so this resolution still cannot shake Castillo's consistent policy. Moreover, Castillo's insistence on a neutral policy has its own historical and economic reasons. Originally, Argentina's largest exports were livestock, wheat, leather, wool, etc., among which meat was the most important. However, in recent years, because the United States itself is very rich in livestock and wheat, Argentina's surplus meat has had to be sold to Germany. Since 1939, 50,000 tons of meat have been shipped to Germany every year in exchange for machinery, airplanes, guns, and artillery. Therefore, economically, Argentina has long been inextricably linked with the Nazis. Not only that, but German engineers and military advisors have also arrived one after another, so it is no accident that Argentina has its current neutral situation. The continued existence of this situation undoubtedly poses a great threat to the United States. Because Castillo is ambitious and is currently training new soldiers on a large scale, if he is ever used by Germany, Argentina will become a springboard for Germany to attack the Americas. Therefore, in recent months, American newspapers and radio stations have frequently broadcast and discussed the dynamics of Argentina. Obviously, this is a very serious political problem. As for the situation in Brazil, it is quite different, because Brazil's products are mainly coffee and cotton. In particular, coffee accounts for 70 million US dollars a year, accounting for almost half of Brazil's total exports, almost all of which are sold to the United States. In 1937, the United States lent Brazil 120 million US dollars to stabilize Brazil's currency. Therefore, although Germany absorbed a lot of cotton in Brazil with machinery and industrial goods, the economic relationship has always been dominated by the United States. In fact, the United States has long controlled Brazil. Although some people in Brazil have not forgotten Germany, it is a matter of taste that Brazil declared war on Germany and Italy but did not mention Japan. According to the Brazilian government's informal explanation, it is said that "because 250,000 Japanese people reside in Brazil, it is feared that it will cause adverse reactions." However, they forgot that there are nearly 500,000 German expatriates left in Brazil. Obviously, this measure of the Brazilian government shows that its determination to oppose the Axis powers is not strong enough.

(4) Thoughts on Stepping into American Territory

Stepping into American territory and seeing the high degree of material civilization, I deeply feel the backwardness of the motherland's industry. Especially when I arrived in New York, facing the towering skyscrapers, the trains and tunnels passing through the riverbed, the large iron bridges, the large factories... All of this made me feel how many years it would take for us to catch up with them? I also thought about the post-war problems, with a thousand and one threads, and my heart was even more uneasy. Sometimes I really doubted the usefulness of what I had learned. "Why didn't I study engineering or other technologies and contribute to the motherland in industry in the future?" But thinking back, if a country does not have a good political environment and order, is it possible to build any industry? At the same time, I heard that many middle-class citizens who have lived in New York for thirty or forty years have never been to the 102-story "Empire Building" which is 1,250 feet high. Although it only costs a dollar to go up to the "Empire Building", among the more than eight million New Yorkers, there are indeed not many who have a direct relationship with this world's tallest building. Most people just walk past its entrance, look up and sigh with admiration! China does not need such an "Empire Building" in the future. What China needs is a "Building for the Masses."

I lived in New York for three months and went to Washington and Boston in between. Now I am living again as a student in a university in Guangdong Province, a life I abandoned ten years ago. In the past six months, I have been in contact with American journalists, middle-class businessmen, workers, citizens, professors, university students, civil servants, and all kinds of people, but their understanding of China is indeed too superficial, which they themselves admit. Therefore, I encountered many questions, including what are the living habits of the general Chinese people, is China a democracy, what is the Chinese Communist Party like, will there be a civil war in China after the war, and does China have ice cream? These large and small questions all show that they know too little about China. As such, I feel that we have not done enough in the past for international propaganda, and the current situation does not seem to have improved much. For example, the so-called Chinese newsreels seen in New York cinemas are all old films from more than ten years ago. Not long ago, when the overseas Chinese here participated in the New York Grand Parade, they were still banging on gongs and drums, performing lion dances, and wearing the painted faces of stage operas and girls in big red skirts... This kind of thing does not show the spirit of modern China at all. At the World Youth Federation held in Washington in early September, the British and Soviet representatives were organized and planned to carry out publicity activities at this conference. The Soviet representatives, in particular, were the most prominent, but the Chinese representatives were temporarily cobbled together without any prior planning, and their speeches afterward were haphazard. Moreover, Soviet picture albums and photographs could be seen everywhere, but it was difficult to see a single Chinese one. A professor who leads students in publicity work at the school asked me to find some Chinese picture albums to borrow and hang for a few days. This question troubled me, because although I had seen several Chinese painters' exhibitions in New York, they were all painting landscapes, chickens, and ducks. Considering all of these things, I feel that there is still much work to be done to improve international publicity in the future.

(5) The American War Mentality

It is difficult to give a general definition of the American war mentality, because the people here are very diverse. According to the Census Bureau, there are nearly ten million people of German and Italian descent alone. I dare not say that Americans completely hate war, but I dare not say that Americans are really excited about this war. In short, they are passive. The government's entry into the war is passive, the people's enlistment is passive, and the capitalists' conversion of factories into military factories is also passive. My Vice President, Mr. Alexander, said to me: "Americans have never been interested in war, so all war actions are only just beginning now."

Furthermore, when it comes to whether Americans value the European theater or the Far East theater more, that is, whether they plan to defeat Japan first or defeat Germany first, we must look at this issue from three aspects. First, emotionally speaking, Americans can be said to complain more about Japan. The reasons are (1) the Pearl Harbor incident, which they consider to be a great humiliation in American history, (2) since entering the war, their direct opponent has been Japan, such as the heavy losses suffered in the Battle of Midway and the Battle of the Solomon Islands. This is very obvious in newspapers, magazines, movies, and people's conversations. At the same time, the government treats people of German and Japanese origin very differently. That is, Germans are very free, while Japanese are concentrated in certain locations and are closely monitored. Second, in terms of interests, emotion is one thing, and interests are another. Eighty percent of the American people come from Europe, such as Britain, France, Spain, the Netherlands... and other small countries. It is inevitable that they are more concerned about their motherland. Secondly, from an economic point of view, European countries account for nearly 60% of the United States' foreign trade, and many people, especially those in power, dream that as long as Germany is defeated, Japan will naturally not be a problem. Third, in fact, the United States needs to rely mainly on the navy to defeat Japan, and mainly on the army to defeat Germany (both must be assisted by a strong air force). Judging from the current situation, the preparation of the navy and army is still at a pitifully naive stage. Therefore, whether to defeat Japan first or defeat Germany first is not even a question that can be discussed at all. Under such circumstances, the United States can only passively pay attention to Europe if the European theater is tight, and pay attention to Asia if Asia is tight. For example, when Japan attacked Zhejiang and Jiangxi in June, the newspapers almost daily saw accusations against the government for not stepping up aid to China. However, in the past two months, the war in China has been slightly quiet, and people have forgotten to mention it. But if both Europe and Asia are in crisis at the same time, there is no doubt that they will pay more attention to Europe, especially to the safety of Britain. (6) There Will Still Be a Long Struggle

The production problem is related to the lack of raw materials. The lack of raw materials in the United States is mainly steel and rubber. According to a United Press report on July 1, the US government is re-planning a scrap metal collection campaign to prevent the iron smelters from shutting down and requires people across the country to seriously collect scrap iron and send it to the government. According to a report from the War Production Board, fifteen iron smelters have been shut down due to a lack of raw materials. According to a report on July 28, Senator Land, chairman of the Naval Affairs Committee, said that due to the lack of steel, the production of naval shipyards has been reduced by half.

As for the rubber problem, according to Hershey in the recent "Outlook Weekly," the United States usually consumes more than 700,000 tons of rubber every year, 98% of which comes from Southeast Asia. After the outbreak of the Pacific War, the source was cut off. Although the United States still has a total of 700,000 tons of raw rubber and possibly manufactured synthetic rubber, it is estimated that 800,000 tons of military rubber will be used in two years. If preparations are not made early, a rubber panic will occur next year. Therefore, the United States is now planning to invest 600 million yuan to complete a plan to produce 870,000 tons of synthetic rubber annually, which is scheduled to be fully realized before 1944. In addition, it will invest 5 million yuan in Brazil and 2.12 million yuan in Peru. This year, it may obtain 45,000 tons of rubber in South America, and it hopes to harvest 100,000 tons by 1944. However, it is still a big question whether this hope can be realized!

### Various Industry Associations Select Staff to Secretly Investigate the Prices of Goods Sold in Stores and Cooperate with the Authorities to Strictly Implement Evaluation; Violating Stores Will Be Dealt with by the Association

Hundreds of industry associations in this city, such as woodworking factories, cloth industry, hardware parts industry, department stores, tea industry, and north-south goods industry, have established their respective "Commodity Evaluation Committees" and "Commodity Distribution Groups" under the leadership of the competent authorities in order to assist the authorities' policies. The aim is to adapt to the current economic control. Since its implementation, it has been progressing smoothly. Recently, reporters have learned that the Commodity Evaluation Committees of various industries have received reports from various parties that the retail prices of goods in the member stores of each association have not been followed, and at the same time, the prices on the labels are often vague, and the goods displayed in the display windows cannot be purchased according to the style. This is not without betraying the original intention of the authorities and the industry associations to suppress and stabilize commodity prices, so they are required to send staff to secretly investigate the truth as soon as possible. Now, the industry associations are determined to maintain their original intention and stop this situation as soon as possible. They have decided to select staff to closely investigate the door sales of the member stores of their respective industries. The main items of investigation are approximately divided into (1) whether the prices marked for various door sales goods comply with the limited price evaluated by the order, (2) whether they refuse to sell any goods, (3) whether they sell a large amount of goods to various brokers at high prices, (4) whether they issue invoices in accordance with regulations when selling goods, and (5) whether the inch-foot measurement instruments they use meet the standards. If any of the investigators find one of the above-mentioned situations, they should fill in a list and report it to the industry association, and then the industry association will publicly deal with it and report it to the relevant authorities for verification and judgment.

### The Central Reserve Bank Increases Interest Rates on Interbank Deposits, Changing to 2% Weekly Interest from the 1st of This Month

Since the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank adjusted its internal organizational structure last year and changed the business department into a deposit department and a loan department to specialize in their respective responsibilities, the deposit and loan business has been developing and the deposits have been increasing day by day, providing convenience to the silver, money, industrial, and commercial industries. Regarding interest payments on deposits, fixed deposits are paid at a weekly interest rate of 4%, and demand deposits and interbank deposits are paid at a weekly interest rate of 1%. Now, in order to increase the benefits of interbank deposits, the bank has specially increased the weekly interest rate on interbank deposits by 1% from March 1, changing it to 2% weekly interest. The weekly interest rates on fixed deposits and demand deposits remain the same.

### Stores in the French Concession that Violate the Law Should Be Sent to Court

The National Government has specially formulated the Provisional Regulations on Suppressing Price Gouging to Stabilize Society and the People's Livelihood, which were officially promulgated and implemented on December 26 last year. It has been found that the regulations clearly stipulate the methods for punishing stores that violate the law. The competent authorities in the special zones of this city should be the local courts in the special zones. The Ministry of Justice has long ordered the two special zone courts in Shanghai to strictly comply with the regulations in order to stop them. For stores that violate the regulations, the Public Concession has already transferred them to the local court of the First Special Zone for handling. The French Concession is still enforced by the Chinese police. According to the regulations, store price gouging is purely an improper profit-making behavior, which clearly violates the criminal law and should be subject to legal sanctions.

### The French Concession Adjusts Electricity Prices and Notifies Users to Conserve Electricity; Meters Read Last Month Will Be Calculated According to the New Electricity Prices

The Shanghai French Electricity and Tramway Company has adjusted the new conditions for supplying electricity to the French Concession and the new prices have been submitted to the French Consul General for approval and promulgation for implementation. They are as follows: (1) Electricity for lighting is 1.57 yuan per kilowatt-hour, (2) Electricity for power is 8.8 jiao per kilowatt-hour, and electricity for heating is 8.8 jiao per kilowatt-hour. The above-mentioned new electricity prices will be implemented starting from the degree used on February 1, 1943. In addition, the company has notified each user in writing to save electricity consumption as much as possible in order to save electricity.

### The Youth Corps Prepares for a Review; Uniforms and Costumes Have Been Determined

Other badges and military registration badges will be made and issued by the preparatory committee. Flags will be arranged by the preparatory committee, and each school must prepare the price to collect them before the event.

### The Thirty-Third Evacuation of Coffins Left in Shanghai; The Next Period is Scheduled for the 10th of This Month

Since the Guohua Coffin Transportation Department was ordered to evacuate coffins left in this city, it has been done 32 times. The coffins of the poor have also been transported in 15 batches. It is now learned that the 33rd evacuation of coffins and the 16th batch of coffins of the poor, totaling 170 coffins, will be loaded onto the Xinning Shao wheel this afternoon (6th) and transported to Ningbo. It is heard that the Coffin Transportation Department has expanded its transportation organization and increased the transportation capacity in response to the urgent needs of the coffin relatives in this city, and a large number of coffins left in Shanghai can be continuously transported out before the Qingming Festival. It is also heard that the date of the next evacuation has been set for the 10th of this month, so all coffin relatives in this city can quickly go to No. 2, Lane 96, Jing'an Temple Road to apply for registration in preparation for transporting them to their hometowns before the festival. In order to help the poor, the department has a fee reduction method that can be contacted.

### For the First Time in the Urban Area, Sugar is Distributed According to the Number of People; Each Person Gets Half a Catty Per Month at 4.74 Yuan Per Catty

In order to adapt to the wartime food policy, Zhang Xianzhi, director of the Municipal Grain Management Bureau, has decided after discussing with the relevant authorities that the supply of sugar in the urban area will be coordinated and distributed by the bureau from this month, and he has ordered Yang Wenshou, a specialist from the bureau, to prepare separately. The work has now been completed. According to a report by a Central News Agency reporter, the scope of the first phase of sugar distribution in the urban area is temporarily limited to the Nanshi, Huxi, Xuhua Fang, Zhabei Central District, Pudong South District, and Pudong North District within the blockade line. The number of people receiving the distribution is also temporarily based on the number of people receiving grain from the Grain Bureau in February. Each person, regardless of age, is allocated half a catty per month, and the price is set at 85.25 cents per catty of military tickets, which is equivalent to 4.74 yuan in Central Reserve Bonds. All sugar distribution certificates have also been printed and affixed with the seal of the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office, and they will be distributed immediately. At that time, citizens can bring sugar containers to designated retail sugar stores to purchase sugar with the certificate.

### All Faucets in Nanshi and Zhabei Have Been Repaired

Since the incident, Nanshi, Zhabei, and other districts have suffered severely from the war, and local losses have been heavy. Rubble still remains today. Although the municipal authorities have actively rebuilt, it is still difficult to restore the original state for a while. In order to assist the municipal authorities in rebuilding the prosperity of the area, the Huazhong Water and Electricity Company has specially ordered workers to repair all the public faucets in the two districts. The work has now been completed. The company believes that the public faucets are directly and indirectly related to the lives and property of the citizens in the two districts, so it has formulated protection measures and submitted them to the Municipal Police Bureau for maintenance.

### The 20th Symphony Orchestra of the Shanghai Music Association

The 20th symphony orchestra organized by the Shanghai Music Association is scheduled to be held at the Lyceum Theatre on Miller Road in the French Concession at 5:30 pm tomorrow. At that time, the president of the association, Mr. Di Xiaohui, will be present to preside over the event, and musician Mei Baiqi will be invited to conduct the orchestra. The program is quite wonderful.

### Chairman of the Huazhong Revitalization Company, Kenji Kodama, Resigns Due to Illness; Reorganization of National Policy Companies Overworked; The Common Prosperity Association Plans Industrial Movement

Kenji Kodama, chairman of the Huazhong Revitalization Company, has now resigned due to illness. It is reported that Kodama previously came to Shanghai by plane from Military Kyoto and discussed with relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities the reorganization of various Japanese national policy companies, that is, to find a way for the Huazhong Revitalization Company to take over the 13 Japanese national policy companies in China, such as the Huazhong Railway Company, Water and Electricity Company, Bus Company, and Trust Company. At the same time, he tried his best to use Chinese business funds to strengthen the cooperation between China and Japan in business. Kodama planned and managed meticulously and overworked himself, resulting in his resignation. It is also reported that the Sino-Japanese Industrial Common Prosperity Association, which was recently established, will soon launch an industrial movement to promote the welfare of Chinese and Japanese workers, transform Chinese industry, and increase productivity.

### Alleviating Students' Financial Burden for Books

— Elementary School Students

Schools have already started, and the rising cost of books is indeed a serious problem facing students today. The cost of books for one semester is now almost equal to, or even greater than, the tuition fees of the past. Examining the reasons for such soaring prices, it is nothing more than the scarcity of editions, increased costs, and supply falling short of demand, creating the sole reason for the price increase. However, the price of the same book will vary significantly due to factors such as the time, the number of buyers, and whether the buyer is shrewd. This is because there is no fixed standard for the prices set by bookstores, especially small bookstores and second-hand bookstores. They take advantage of the start of the school year and the needs of the buyers to arbitrarily raise prices. Therefore, I would like to offer a few suggestions here for school authorities to consider in order to alleviate some of the students' burdens!

(1) Most schools only announce the textbooks to be used when school starts. I believe that it is best to announce the books to be used in the next semester as early as possible during the current semester, so that students can buy them earlier (new students are of course not included in this case). This will prevent bookstores from taking advantage of the timing to raise prices and reduce the occurrence of students attending classes for several days without having their books yet.

(2) It is best for the school authorities to purchase books directly from large bookstores at wholesale prices and then sell them to the students, reducing the profit-taking by retailers at each level. Although this may make the schools busier, I believe that they would not refuse to fulfill this responsibility for the sake of the students!

(3) Students should organize a second-hand book cooperative. If students from various schools have books to sell, they can mark the price and entrust the cooperative to sell them on their behalf, with a small tax deducted. If they want to purchase books, they can also entrust the cooperative to purchase them (it would be even better if each school could organize its own cooperative). In this way, students can save on transportation costs, eliminate the pain of buying books, and not waste time. It can truly be said to be a win-win-win situation.

### Banning Slot Machines

— Xin Wen

Slot machines, commonly known as "one-armed bandits," are now prevalent in every corner, especially in stores near schools. Many of them place several machines to lure students. Often, children under the age of ten spend their parents' hard-earned money into the "tiger's" mouth in their spare time. The harm not only makes children and young people addicted to gambling, but also wastes money. Furthermore, it affects national morality. The ban should be implemented without delay, and the methods are: (1) School authorities should report to the authorities for punishment as soon as they find "one-armed bandits" nearby. (2) Parents or teachers should severely punish students who are playing "one-armed bandits." They themselves should also set an example of not gambling, and hope that the authorities will actively ban them.

### Japanese Embassy Spokesperson Hirota Talks About India's Current Status: Extremely Important in the Allied Military Plan; Japan Decides to Fully Promote India's Independence

Tongmeng News Agency, This Port: Japanese Embassy spokesperson Hirota stated yesterday at a reception for journalists that although the Chongqing side outwardly expresses sympathy for India, it does not want to see India's independence realized. This is because if India quickly gains independence, the Allied countries will have to withdraw from India, and the Chongqing side will not be able to obtain assistance.

The Point of Military Relations

India's current status is extremely important in the Allied plan to counterattack Japan. Therefore, the British government is still unwilling to grant India independence. The Chongqing side knows very well that since the Burma Road has been cut off, only through the India route can it obtain supplies from the Allied countries. The Allied countries and Chongqing are working together to maintain India. The India issue must be observed not only from a political perspective, but also from a military perspective. The reason is that India's position is related to the two possible fronts from which Japan can be attacked: one is launching an offensive east towards Japan from the Pacific Ocean, and the other is launching an offensive west towards Japan. This front starts from Mongolia in the west, is managed by the Chinese Communists, extends to the Chongqing military front in central China, and reaches British-held India, even extending to Iran and Iraq. The reason why the Chongqing side attaches so much importance to maintaining contact between its jurisdiction and India is clear from this.

Restoring the Original Face of East Asia

The recent remarks by Allied spokespersons confirm that all Allied countries harbor ambitions to undermine the independence of the Indian people. Britain's current attitude towards India is that if India participates in the war against Japan, it will be granted dominion status after the war. However, what Gandhi and all of India are striving for is immediate independence. Japan is determined to fully support the Indian people in achieving this goal. The spokesperson concluded by saying that Japan's war aims include expelling British forces from India, promoting India's independence, and, with the cooperation of the Chinese, completely restoring the original face of East Asia.

### Fu You Orphanage: Raising Funds and Recruiting; 200 Disaster-Stricken Children Cry Out for Food; Eagerly Awaiting Generous Donations from All Sectors

Since its establishment, the Shanghai Fu You Orphanage has been operating vigorously due to the planning and management of its director. It has a large scale and remarkable achievements. It houses more than 200 male and female orphaned children affected by disaster. It hires teachers to divide them into classes for basic education or to teach them productive skills based on their age, combining education and upbringing, and promoting intelligence. It is preserving vitality for the country and cultivating talents for society, with painstaking efforts for the past two years. However, due to the recent rise in the cost of living and the continuous increase in prices, the cost of supplies is around 40,000 to 50,000 yuan per month. Fortunately, the existing food reserves can temporarily alleviate the panic. However, if this continues, the risk of running out of supplies is alarming. Therefore, it is urgent to find ways to provide relief. The orphanage's board of directors has decided to launch a fundraising campaign in the shortest possible time. They sincerely hope that enthusiastic people from all walks of life will generously donate, which will benefit society and not only the disaster-stricken children. The orphanage is located at Dongjiadu in the Nanshi area, and the office is located at 432 Cishu Building on Nanjing Road. The chairman and director is Mr. Ding Fubao.

### Public Concession Self-Defense Duty Must Be Performed in Person; Investigation Will Be Conducted

The previous article on the Nanshi civil servants serving in self-defense and being allowed to substitute was published in yesterday's newspaper. It has now been investigated that the Public Concession Baojia authorities have repeatedly sought ways to improve the self-defense corps members' duty matters and have agreed on methods to be followed by the heads of each Baojia district. According to a Shanghai News Agency reporter, the Central Baojia District recently received an order from Director Dakawa that all self-defense corps members must perform their duties in person and must not seek substitutes. Otherwise, once discovered, both the individual and the responsible personnel will be subject to appropriate punishment. This matter has been conveyed by the Baojia heads to the heads of each household.

### Residents Moving Furniture Must Have a Movement Permit with the Seals of the Baojia Head and the Police Station

If residents of this port want to move their residence and are unsure of the procedures for moving furniture, according to a Datong News Agency reporter, residents who want to move furniture should first obtain a movement permit from the local police station. After the permit has been stamped by the Baojia head and the police station, residents can move furniture and suitcases without having to go through other procedures. However, if the amount of rice exceeds two dou, a separate movement permit must be obtained.

### Authorities Strive for Local Municipal Administration and Do Their Best to Improve Public Transportation; Some Public Buses May Resume Operation

According to a Datong News Agency reporter who inquired with some senior officials of the Public Works Department, the local municipal administration of the Public Concession is now planning to improve it as much as possible. In addition to implementing a fair distribution system for people's food, the long-standing rent issue in this port has also been promulgated with subletting regulations for landlords and tenants to follow, in order to avoid various disputes. As for the "travel" issue for residents, the authorities are also providing the public with more convenience.

Efforts to Promote Public Works

It is reported that although the Concession authorities are currently focusing on the food problem, which is directly related to the residents, they have not relaxed in promoting various public works. Among these public works that the authorities have not neglected, road traffic is one of them. Since the end of the thirtieth year, in order to save gasoline, all public buses have been suspended. However, this was a last resort and was not intended to make transportation inconvenient.

Promote the Restoration of Traffic Prosperity

Therefore, in recent years, in addition to stepping up supervision of road construction, the authorities have also restored traffic between the north and south of Suzhou Creek, encouraged the interest of trishaw passenger cars, and provided new rickshaw companies with as much convenience as possible in terms of start-up procedures and expenses. On the one hand, they have also organized a strict licensing system for bicycles to protect the proper operation of bicycles, and within the scope of possibility, they may resume the operation of some public buses.

Public Bus Fares Will Not Change

At a time when the cost of living is rising, the authorities are determined to do their best to reduce the burden on residents. The authorities are well aware that the main purpose of operating public buses is to facilitate the travel of ordinary residents and not to be the exclusive privilege of a few wealthy people. Therefore, when the fares of public concession trams were adjusted on January 21, there were no increases. In the future, the burden on passengers will be the premise, and the authorities are determined not to change prices.

### Oil Foot Can Be Used to Make Gasoline Substitutes

The residue left over from Chinese-made cottonseed oil, called "oil foot," can be used to extract gasoline substitutes in the face of the decisive battle. This valuable research has been completed by a scientist who is at the forefront of local cotton production. This is good news for the "rear area" of the aerial soldiers who are soaring north and south to build great military achievements. The person who successfully researched the gasoline substitute made from cottonseed oil residue is Mr. Hibi Toshio, the director of the Nantong Agricultural Experiment Station of the Jiangbei Industrial Company's Agricultural Department.

Mr. Hibi joined Kanebo Spinning and Weaving Company's Jiangbei Industrial Company in Showa 16 (1941) and worked at the Nantong Agricultural Experiment Station. In view of the restrictions on the allocation of heavy oil and gasoline, which hindered the operation of internal combustion engines and ships, and regretting that the research on making heavy oil and gasoline substitutes from cottonseed oil residue by the cotton chemical department of Nantong Agricultural College before the war was abandoned without completion, he decided to continue the research. After a year and a half of painstaking research, he finally succeeded in extracting 70% of heavy oil and gasoline substitutes from cottonseed oil residue.

According to his research, gasoline, crude light oil, crude heavy oil, crude engine oil, and other substitutes can be obtained by dry distilling the refined residue of cottonseed oil and lime. If you want to make these substitutes from cottonseed oil, the operation is even simpler. From May to July of last year, the results of practical tests on the Yangtze River showed that a 50-horsepower internal combustion engine ship was able to travel 12 kilometers, and the oil consumption, the number of revolutions of the engine, the measurement of the maximum speed, the presence or absence of knocking, the presence or absence of smoke color, and the difficulty of ignition were all no less than the heavy oil sold on the market. The new grease industry of making gasoline substitutes from cottonseed oil has thus opened up a new era. The following is Mr. Hibi's talk.

"When local people of insight visited my home, they talked about making gasoline substitutes from cottonseed oil. The cotton chemical department of Nantong Agricultural College had this kind of facility before, and after investigating the method, I learned that it was abandoned without completion. I saw the shortage of gasoline and heavy oil, so I started the research. At first, I did not consider gasoline substitutes, but only focused on the extraction of heavy oil substitutes. In particular, I thought it was better to extract it from the residue than to extract it from cottonseed, because the residue has no other use except as fertilizer. Therefore, I took this and started the research. During the research, I fainted due to the room being filled with carbon monoxide and methane gas, and was bedridden for nearly a month. At that time, people near me said that my body smelled of gasoline, and when I took a bath, the bath water also smelled of gasoline. From this, I got a hint, and the extraction method of gasoline substitutes was completed. The manufacturing cost is very low, and industrialization can be expected in the future."

### Municipal Experimental People's Education Center Held Opening Ceremony Yesterday; Mayor Chen Attended and Gave Instructions; Ceremony Was Grand

The Shanghai Special Municipal Experimental People's Education Center officially held its opening ceremony yesterday at 10:00 AM at the center on Wenmiao Road in the Nanshi area. Those who attended included Mayor Chen Gongbo, Police Chief Lu (representing Zhu Yunsheng), Education Director Lin Jiongan, Zhao Chundi, the third section chief of the Health Bureau, Gu Jilun, the director of the center, Ding Chao, the concurrent preparation director, and about 200 people from friendly countries, including Liaison Officer Rollet, Hirose Goro, and Suetsugu Kiyoshi. The atmosphere was enthusiastic. The grand occasion is recorded as follows:

Venue Arrangement

A white cloth banner with the words "Opening Ceremony of the Shanghai Special Municipal Experimental People's Education Center" was hung at the entrance of the venue. Various colorful and eye-catching slogans were posted on both sides of the stone archway.

Meeting Situation

After the ceremony, Director Gu Jilun of the center gave a speech. Then, Ding Chao, the concurrent preparation director, reported on the preparation process of the center. Afterwards, Mayor Chen Gongbo and Education Director Lin Jiongan gave instructions. Then, Liaison Officer Rollet from a friendly country gave a speech. The meeting adjourned at 12:00 PM. After the meeting, there were recreational programs, with the Chinese National Martial Arts Association performing martial arts. At 2:00 PM in the afternoon, there were performances by comedy and Chinese film drama associations.

Mayor's Instructions

"Distinguished leaders, distinguished guests, ladies and gentlemen, today is the opening day of this center. Due to the rain, not many guests have arrived. However, the spirit of us educators is still the same. Today everyone is here, which shows that you are all very concerned about people's education in this city. China is too large, and if we want to popularize education, we must promote people's education in various places. I remember many years ago, the government held people's education experiment projects in various counties, or people's organizations applied to the authorities to experiment and study methods in fixed places. If there were achievements, they would be provided to the government for reference or adoption. Before the incident, Hubei, Shandong, Zhejiang, and other places had all experimented with it. After the incident, I also went to a certain county to observe. They believed that the reason for the failure of the People's Education Center was due to the four words "poverty, ignorance, weakness, and selfishness." Therefore, they promoted family industry, improved agricultural production, and so on in the local area to eliminate "poverty." They established schools to instill knowledge and eliminate "ignorance." They also set up hospitals or divided them into several groups to provide medical treatment for the people in various places, and they promoted sports to eliminate "weakness." They also organized the people into groups and let them engage in public work. I also discussed with them further and summed up the above four words into one word "ignorance." But according to my experience, it is because of ignorance that there is poverty, weakness, and selfishness. At the same time, in Chinese society, people's education is often regarded as a charitable undertaking, often funded by a small number of wealthy people to carry out compulsory education. This spirit is certainly very good, but their views are slightly wrong. We people who run people's education must have the mentality of religious people, treat running education as our lifelong career, and save the general illiterate people. Comrades should have this spirit in their work of people's education. At the same time, the social associations, academic societies, and other collective organizations should also regard people's education as their own business, because people's education is a national cause and is something that every citizen should do. We must eliminate the concept of running people's education as a charitable undertaking, because the reason why education in our country is not developed is because parents cannot educate their own children and pass it down from generation to generation, to the point where it is today. If a citizen in the country is not educated, it is equivalent to every cell in the human body not being able to function. Although there are few guests today, we have great courage. I hope that all of you working comrades will mobilize together to promote people's education."

The Shi family commemorated their deceased grandson Shi Zhongyingshi, and Dr. Zhang Xiangwen, director of Shangxian Women and Children's Hospital, expressed his condolences and transferred the medical expenses. The Shi family's compassion for the poor and love for the young is admirable.

### Record of the Ups and Downs of the East Indies (6)

— Qiao Song

Import Trade Status of the Dutch East Indies (Unit: Million Guilders):

Export Trade Status of the Dutch East Indies (Unit: Million Guilders):

Recent Trade Status of the Dutch East Indies (Unit: Thousand Guilders):

(The above Singapore includes Penang Island, India includes Burma, and Australia includes New Zealand. According to the Dutch East Indies Economic Magazine)

From this, it can be seen that the United States is the largest consumer of the Dutch East Indies' specialty products, tin and rubber, and most of these products are exported to the United States. Petroleum is refined in the United States and crude oil is exported from the Dutch East Indies to the United States. On the other hand, the Dutch East Indies needs commodities such as machinery, chemicals, products, toys, and food, which are massively exported from the United States to the Dutch East Indies. This has created a solid and important position for the United States in the Dutch East Indies trade, creating a deformed phenomenon of the United Kingdom and the United States monopolizing all resources in the East Indies and closing them to Japan, which is not an underlying cause of the Far East in the Greater East Asia War.

### This City's Industrial Economy Last Year: From "Laissez-faire" to "Control"

Factory Investigation Conducted

To prevent accidents in factories using highly flammable liquids, this Bureau issued a public notice in April of last year, ordering such factories to obtain licenses from the Bureau. Simultaneously, investigations were conducted on related factories. By the end of the year, twenty-one such factories had been approved and licensed. All these factories were able to comply with the Bureau's regulations. Another five factories have applied to the Bureau for licenses and are currently under investigation. Several other factories located in unsuitable buildings have been ordered to close down. This is because several explosions occurred last year in factories using dangerous liquids, such as coffee essence factories, alcohol factories, paint factories, rubber factories, etc. Several managers of the factories where explosions occurred have been prosecuted in court. Additionally, four factories were operating without licenses and have also been prosecuted in court. One of the managers was sentenced to one month of imprisonment.

Establishment of Technical Vocational Night Schools

Last year, this Bureau established two technical vocational night schools in the eastern and western districts, with the aim of imparting technical knowledge to young mechanics and electrical workers for further education. The eastern district night school is attached to the Jingzhou Road Huatong Primary School, and the western district night school is attached to the No. 25 Mabai Road Huatong School. These night schools have a total of 417 students, with a total of 1,740 hours of instruction. The results have been excellent. At the same time, the 11th Boiler Fireman Training Class trained 102 students. Since 1937, a total of 6,712 boiler firemen have been trained by the Industrial Section.

Job Placement Section

Last year, this Bureau approved the establishment of a Job Placement Section, which was organized and established by the Industrial Social Affairs Department. The purpose of this section is to implement the policy of revitalizing the city's industry and relieving unemployed workers. Its task is to register unemployed skilled workers and introduce them to suitable jobs, so that employers can find suitable talents, and job seekers can obtain satisfactory employment and alleviate their economic difficulties. The registration of skilled workers began in December. By the end of the year, 348 skilled workers had been registered, of which 91 had been introduced to employers.

Labor Section

Last year, the occurrence of industrial disputes was greatly reduced. The Labor Section mediated a total of 93 labor disputes, of which 45 were related to wages and subsidies, 25 were due to dismissals, 20 were due to shutdowns, and 3 were due to other reasons. A total of 230 factories and shops were involved in the labor disputes, affecting 10,026 workers. The Labor Section frequently convened discussions between labor and management on labor issues, which was also a reason for reducing labor disputes. It was found that at the beginning of last year, many factories were closed down due to the difficulty in obtaining raw materials. The factory owners requested the Labor Section for methods to avoid dismissing workers. These situations, together with the above-mentioned labor disputes, were successfully resolved by the Labor Section. The factory owners mostly paid dismissal allowances and travel expenses to the dismissed workers.

Drafting Standard Regulations

Generally, factories or shops have their own employee regulations. If these regulations are formulated in accordance with recognized standards, they are indeed suitable for personnel management and preventing disputes arising from employment conditions. Last year, the Labor Section studied the employee regulations of several factories. As a result, it was found that major parts of the labor-management relations were not perfect. Therefore, the Labor Section drafted its own standard regulations. Two factories have revised their original regulations based on these standard regulations and submitted them for approval. It is expected that the number of factories and shops adopting the above-mentioned regulations will increase, and the labor-management relations will inevitably be improved as a result.

Handling Deaths, Injuries, and Compensation

In addition to mediating labor disputes, the Labor Section also handled cases of death and injury compensation for workers. If a worker dies on the job, the factory will allocate funeral expenses and compensation. If a worker is injured, the factory will be responsible for medical expenses and provide disability allowance as appropriate. Last year, the Labor Section handled a total of 33 such cases, of which 21 were related to worker deaths and 12 were related to partial disabilities. The compensation paid by the factories ranged from 700 yuan to 6,000 yuan, and the disability allowances ranged from 350 yuan to 2,160 yuan. In two cases, the hospital and medical expenses exceeded 2,000 yuan.

(8) The New Face of the East Indies

The Greater East Asia War changed the fate of the East Indies.

After the Japanese army occupied Java, it took about a month to quell all resistance attempts and actions, establishing security on the entire island.

After the Japanese army occupied Java, the existing administrative institutions and their powers and laws were recognized to continue to exist as long as they did not particularly hinder the implementation of military administration. The main point of the administrative organs was that they were guided by the Japanese regular bureau, and Japanese officials and police officers were selected by the Japanese army to perform administrative affairs; senior officials were formally appointed by the Japanese supreme commander.

In terms of local power, the original provincial government was abolished, and the entire Java was divided into seventeen states, two marquisates, and one special district, establishing a unified local administrative system. The heads of each state were filled by Japanese. On the other hand, the "native lords" of Java have a long tradition and history, and are a special political form respected by the people. The Japanese side decided to respect this and formally held the appointment ceremony for the lords in early August, establishing the marquisate system.

Children's Welfare Section

Last year, this Bureau approved the employment of ten additional social workers to promote a plan to reunite lost children with their families. It was found that charitable organizations in this city that shelter children were mostly unable to accommodate more children due to economic and food supply difficulties. However, on the other hand, the number of lost children found by the police was endless. These children were either lost, ran away, or were abandoned, resulting in them wandering outside. In view of this, the Section consulted with the Salvation Army Beggar Reception Center to shelter these children. At the same time, social workers investigated the circumstances of the lost children one by one. If possible, they were returned to their families. At the same time, investigations were also conducted on children adopted by other institutions, and efforts were made to return them to their families or find adoptive parents. Last year, 378 lost children were returned to their families, and 105 were adopted. A total of 256 applications were received from citizens requesting to adopt children. After detailed investigations, it was found that many applicants had unsuitable family situations or their motives were to obtain unpaid servants. All were refused adoption. In addition, the Section helped 18 young people find jobs, and 237 juvenile delinquents in the reformatory were interviewed, with 166 receiving assistance and guidance.

Workers Welfare Section

Last year, the Workers Welfare Section instructed factories to pay attention to worker nutrition to improve worker health and work efficiency. Twenty factories provided detailed records of worker meals and submitted them to the Workers Welfare Section on a monthly basis. The Section also held a nutrition exhibition to explain the necessity of paying attention to worker nutrition and methods for preparing balanced meals for workers to improve their health and work efficiency.

Last year, two cooperative clinics were established in the industrial sector to provide workers with medicines and materials to improve worker health. The first clinic was established with funding from seven coal briquette factories, and the second was jointly established by 32 factories. A third is in the planning stage and is scheduled to be realized in January of this year.

Sublease License Office

In April of last year, this Bureau issued measures for obtaining sublease house licenses, stipulating that landlords who sublease houses for residential purposes must obtain licenses. At the same time, the profits that landlords should receive were limited. The implementation of sublease licenses was handled by the Industrial Social Affairs Department. Additional staff were hired and a separate office was established to take charge. Investigators from this office made 1,694 investigative trips to investigate whether sublease licenses had been obtained and whether the rents collected had been adjusted in accordance with regulations. The office also received 1,668 visits from landlords and subtenants and issued 5,733 letters. Any violations of license regulations and requests for tips were prosecuted upon discovery.

### Municipal Government Promotes Tree Planting, Orders All District Offices to Plant Trees Extensively

The Municipal Government, with the Arbor Day approaching, and in order to promote tree planting and encourage people to broadcast trees, aiming for one tree per person, issued a special order to all district offices yesterday, stating: "Previously, the Ministry of Industry sent a consultation on various measures and rules for the afforestation movement of this year's Arbor Day to the government, which was previously instructed by the Shanghai City Third Character No. 210 order to the Bureau, and transferred to various district offices for compliance. Article 6 of the Afforestation Movement Measures stipulates that the number and area of tree planting in the capital or provincial special districts or executive headquarters and counties should be at least 5,000 trees or 100 acres of afforestation. The old and new districts under the jurisdiction of this city have vast territories and dense populations, and the number of trees planted should naturally be as large as possible. The district chiefs are responsible for promoting and guiding the work, and should urge all personnel participating in the afforestation movement to persuade the general public to understand the great benefits of afforestation, which can broadly store materials and prevent disasters. On Arbor Day, aim for one tree per person and plant as many as possible to jointly promote the development of forestry. This is a special declaration for compliance and reporting."

### Newspaper Industry Improvement Committee Discusses Newspaper Industry Improvement

The Shanghai District Newspaper Industry Improvement Committee held a meeting yesterday afternoon at 6:00 PM at the Ronghua Restaurant, convened by the committee's director, Director Feng. Those present included Director Feng, Committee Member Ling Dating from the Municipal Government, News Inspection Office Director Dun Youcai, Chinese Daily Acting President Xu Liquqiu, Ping Bao Jin Xiongbai (Lu Guangjie representing), New China Daily Lu Feng, and Central News Agency Yang Huilang. At the beginning of the meeting, Director Feng reported on the progress of newspaper industry improvement over the past month. Then, the improvement of the newspaper industry in the future was discussed in detail. Finally, the acting president of the Chinese Daily hosted a dinner, and the conversation was very pleasant. The meeting ended at about 9:00 PM.

### Shanghai College Promotes the Tutor System

Shanghai College on Yuanmingyuan Road, formerly Shanghai University, was previously headed by educator Dr. Liu Zhan'en. After Dr. Liu passed away, President Zhu Boquan was invited to take over and adopted a tutor system. Starting this semester, the measures are more comprehensive. The tutor system involves the school hiring teaching professors to be stationed at the school on a rotating basis throughout the day, so that students can ask questions at any time. During university elective courses, there are often empty periods. In the past, students mostly used the library for self-study. There were few opportunities for teachers and students to learn from each other outside of class. Since the implementation of the tutor system, the feelings between teachers and students have been enhanced, and a good study atmosphere has been cultivated. All universities can adopt this system.

### The Reorganization of the Clearance Area Office Has Been Completed

The Shanghai Clearance Branch, in view of the long distance between the various clearance areas and the location of the branch, and in order to facilitate command and supervision, has established a Clearance Area Office in the clearance area to provide immediate instructions on everything. The director of the office was previously concurrently held by Wu Yaozhong, director of the second division of the branch, and the deputy directors were Tan Shuqian and Lin Baisheng. It is now learned that in order to adjust the organization and personnel, the branch has renamed the Clearance Area Office as the First Phase Area Office. The original six sections have been reduced to three sections: the first section is in charge of general affairs, public security, and defense; the second section is in charge of political affairs, education, and society; and the third section is in charge of taxation and economic construction. Wu Yaozhong has been relieved of his concurrent post as director of the office and will serve full-time as director of the second division of the branch. Deputy Director Lin Shuqian has been transferred to director of the first division of the branch. Shi Sifang, the original director of the first division of the branch, has been transferred to director of the Area Office. The handover has been completed, and they have assumed their respective duties.

### French Concession Police Organization

Regarding the establishment of economic police in the two concession areas, the Public Concession is actively organizing the establishment of economic police, and most of the candidates for senior inspectors and junior police officers have been selected. As for the French Concession, it was previously said that the establishment of economic police has not yet been decided. According to the French Concession authorities, the Economic Department was established long ago, more than a year and a half ago, and is responsible for investigating stores that exceed the price limit. At the same time, the establishment of the political police has also been quite long.

### To Prevent the Use of Loan Funds, Banks and Qian Zhuang Are Cautious in Lending, Goods Mortgage Must Prove Non-Hoarding, Credit Lending Is Limited to Production Enterprises

Since the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee notified its members to tighten interbank lending, member banks provide qualified collateral and apply to the committee for a down payment for lending. Loans secured by public bonds and treasury certificates must be strictly reviewed by the committee to determine whether the applicant's purpose is legitimate. After the valuation committee assesses the price, lending is granted according to the prescribed discount. As for the Qian Zhuang Joint Reserve, it takes the same steps as the Banking Industry Joint Reserve Committee to tighten lending to its members. Banks and Qian Zhuang follow the principle of extreme caution in all lending. All goods mortgages, except for members of the respective industry associations, are rejected for daily necessities. Non-daily necessities must prove that the purpose of the owner is not for hoarding for profit. Credit lending and current account overdrafts are limited to production enterprises and must have reliable guarantors. If it is found that funds from banks and Qian Zhuang are used for improper speculation and hoarding, once it is clearly established, all banks and Qian Zhuang will unanimously refuse to deal with them. In the future, the trend of speculation and hoarding in the market will inevitably gradually subside, which will benefit legitimate industrial and commercial industries and enable the entire financial system to remain stable for a long time.

Economic Review

### Promote Bill Acceptance and Discount

Recently, the emergence of new banks has been vigorous and has shown a prosperous atmosphere. Credit and lending businesses should naturally seek to improve and promote in order to be suitable for the new era of the financial system. In particular, credit lending needs to be improved. This is unanimously recognized by the banking and Qian Zhuang community. Regarding the promotion of bill acceptance and discount methods, the Banking Association recently gathered experts from various banks to study in detail and has formulated various measures and documents. The Central Reserve Bank has also formulated measures to encourage all banks to implement them uniformly. The China Industrial Bank has added an acceptance department to start a pilot program. This can be said to be a recent new facility in the economic sector. Ten years ago, Jin Guobao advocated the most actively, but unfortunately, it was not fully promoted to its full benefit. However, many factories have adopted it and achieved considerable results. The acceptance and discount system can replace the old habit of book-keeping and is the safest and most liquid credit chip, so it is convenient for the use of short-term funds and promotes the development of trade. Since Shanghai is the financial and commercial center of our country, it is necessary to promote acceptance bills in order to realize the discount market. It is hoped that the banking and Qian Zhuang community will implement it uniformly, starting with familiar customers, and the industrial and commercial sector is the place where bills are generated. Whether they are manufacturers or wholesalers, they should cooperate with the financial industry to promote it. For the sale of customers' goods, the current system of extending credit should be abolished first, and the acceptance and discount system should be used instead. The financial industry should set the discount rate for this item lower than other loans so that all industries are happy to promote it. It should be known that credit lending cannot be transferred, while acceptance bills can be transferred, and funds are more active. Credit lending does not indicate the nature of the transaction, while acceptance must occur after a transaction. There are only two parties involved in credit lending and book-keeping, while there are multiple parties involved in acceptance. If the bank is responsible for the credit review in the middle: then all procedures will be even more solemn, and all current speculation and hoarding and improper transactions can be eliminated. This system has only advantages and no disadvantages. If the banking and Qian Zhuang community uses it to change the past lending methods, promotes the advantages and disadvantages of the acceptance system and the book-keeping system, and makes the industrial and commercial community have a considerable understanding and work together to implement it, it is the self-effort of the banking and Qian Zhuang community in our country to achieve success.

### The Ministry of Finance's Income Tax Department Announces Income Tax Collection Measures

The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in order to enrich the national treasury, has announced the measures for the collection of income tax. According to Article 26 of the Implementation Rules of the Provisional Income Tax Law, the tax payment period for the first category of A and B items has been revised to be from March 1 to the end of May each year in order to comply with the general accounting period of the industrial and commercial community, and all taxes must be paid during that period. Therefore, the first category of A and B items of income tax in the 31st year will also be collected from March 1 of this year according to the implementation rules. The unpaid tax amounts in the past are also scheduled to be collected according to the implementation rules. Regarding the collection of the first category of income tax in the 31st year, according to the regulations, various businesses are required to organize their books and records and wait for the Ministry of Finance to inspect them. At the same time, the Ministry of Finance will issue an order to the collection bureaus in various districts to faithfully implement them. The Shanghai District Collection Bureau, in addition to ordering various companies, firms, warehouses, and factories to declare the amount of income from profit-making enterprises in the first category in the 31st year, incidentally notified various companies, firms, warehouses, factories, etc., to declare the amount of income in the past.

### The Ministry of Construction Plans to Build a Waterworks in Wuxi—Restrictions on the Export of Bran and Gluten Cause Sharp Decline—

The Ministry of Construction believes that Wuxi is located in a strategic location, with a dense population and a well-developed industry, but there is still no waterworks. It is now planned to establish a waterworks in the county. It has instructed the Construction Department to transfer the order to the Wuxi County Government to investigate and prepare matters, and will prepare for the establishment in the short term.

The Wuxi flour market has not yet recovered since trading was suspended. Over-the-counter transactions are also limited due to restrictions on movement, and no trading is taking place. The market situation is still very chaotic. Bran used to be actively sold in the north, but now there is a shortage of bran. After northern customers tried their best to search for it, the market price rose, and at the peak, it broke the 140 yuan mark. After the authorities restricted exports, the market price fell sharply. Yesterday, the market had fallen to about 110 yuan.

### Statement on Loan Restrictions: Commodity Prices Already Trending Downward

Following Minister Zhou's statement regarding loan restrictions, a significant reaction has been triggered. On the 5th, the Shanghai market uniformly trended downward. Amidst the recent surging commodity prices, the implementation of loan restrictions is bound to be effective. Financial circles in Shanghai urgently hope that the authorities will seize this opportunity to actively promote measures against rising prices.

According to the principle of controlled finance, it should not be limited to loan restrictions. It is hoped that it will advance further, such as the thorough reorganization methods implemented in North China. Simultaneously, comprehensive control should be applied to all aspects of production, distribution, and consumption, especially the latter two, which are urgently needed.

Distribution controls, since its implementation in April of last year, have restricted movement. In September of the same year, price ceilings were also decreed. However, a slight degree of freedom still exists in the flow of goods, causing goods to be concentrated in one place. Related parties hope to establish a balanced distribution mechanism to thoroughly control goods. (Continental News, March 5)

### Resumption of Trading in Chinese Stocks Still Awaits: Firms Currently Processing License Applications

The Chinese stock market, since the authorities' investigation into the China Yongchang No. 2 Stock Company on the 18th of last month, has been suspended for over half a month. Now, the matters concerning Yongchang and China have been largely resolved. All firms engaged in trading Chinese stocks could have resumed business immediately. However, because the authorities intend to seize this opportunity to thoroughly rectify the Chinese stock market, the resumption of a formal market must still await. Currently, firms are busy processing applications for licenses. Once these licenses are issued, it will be the day the Chinese stock market can announce free trading. However, based on the current situation, it is speculated that the market may not be able to open as early as the beginning of next week.

### Authorities Forbid Opium Dens from Simultaneously Trading Soap, Candles, and Matches

Commodities such as soap, matches, and candles have recently experienced continuous price increases. To severely suppress prices, the Shanghai Municipal Council has ordered the commodity market in opium dens to temporarily suspend trading, effective today. Consequently, there are no formal market quotations for commodities today.

### Tianjin Lifts Restrictions on Steel Movement

The Tianjin Special Affairs Agency and the Tianjin Materials Countermeasures Committee issued an announcement on the 24th, abolishing various restrictions on the movement of steel materials within the city. The announcement is as follows:

The order issued on February 19th, ceasing all restrictions on the import and export of various materials within and outside the Tianjin area, has now been followed by the abolition of restrictions on the movement of all types of steel materials within the city. (Continental News, March 5)

### Contracted Rice Shops to Also Sell Coarse Grains Based on Vouchers: Distribution to Commence from the 30th Period

To fully distribute food to registered households, the authorities are proceeding according to the established policy of issuing grain rations based on population, with the issued purchase vouchers covering three categories: rice, flour, and coarse grains. Yesterday, inquiries with the rice industry revealed that contracted rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession have already received the 29th period trade orders from the distribution department today. It is heard that the quantities of rice and flour are the same as in the 28th period. As for coarse grains, the preparation procedures are not yet complete, and distribution based on vouchers will commence from the 30th period (i.e., March 21st), and it has been decided that contracted rice shops will also sell them. The types of coarse grains will mainly be beans. The dates of sale, quantities, and prices will be announced by the authorities at that time.

### Rumor of Distributing Soybean Cakes as Coarse Grains: Scientifically Refined Soybean Flour Rich in Protein and Vitamins; 7,500 Tons of Soybeans Being Hastily Processed

Recently, it has been widely rumored in the city that the authorities will distribute soybean cakes to supplement the insufficient food supply for the people. To clarify the actual situation, inquiries were made with relevant parties yesterday. The item in question is called defatted soybean flour, which is different from ordinary soybean cakes on the market. It is said that before oil extraction, the soybeans are washed clean and then scientifically tested and have water extracted. After the oil extraction is completed, it is then carefully ground into powder by flour mills. It is rich in protein and vitamins, tastes better than ordinary flours, and has a fragrant aroma, making it especially suitable for making pastries. Currently, the authorities are preparing 7,500 tons of soybeans and are hastily processing them. When ready, it will be distributed by the authorities based on coarse grain purchase vouchers.

### Central China Development Company to Establish a Technical Committee

This technical committee will mobilize the technical personnel of its affiliated companies to participate in development and industrial plans, while simultaneously studying various technologies.

Currently, the national policy company has approximately two hundred technical personnel. Once they join the work, the achievements of the technical committee will be remarkable and can be foreseen. (Continental News, March 5)

### French Ministry of Agriculture: Oil Production Increase Plan

The French Ministry of Agriculture has drafted an oil production increase plan, proposing to expand the cultivated area for oil plants in 1943 to 290,000 mu, which is an increase of 115,000 mu compared to 1942. The implementation of this plan seeks to avoid coercive measures and will instead adopt a reward and contract system to facilitate its success. According to Agriculture Minister Ponnavos, the purpose of this initiative is to restore the situation from a century ago when France was largely self-sufficient in edible oils. Since then, domestic production has gradually decreased, and in recent years, it has been almost entirely dependent on African colonies.

### On the Issue of Economic Control

— Luan Ming

It has been almost two months since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. The authorities have clearly expressed their views on the direction of China's economy after entering the war.

Before World War I in Europe, most people believed in liberalism. The economic elements of liberalism were free competition in production and consumption, all under a state of non-interference. The leading figure at that time was Adam Smith. However, as the era evolved after the European war, the economic ideas of liberalism could no longer be adapted to the reality of society. Therefore, controlled economics emerged to adapt to social trends, resulting in a major transformation in economic thought. However, controlled economics is not a new product. There are precedents in the economic policies of various countries, both East and West. For example, during the reign of Emperor Wu of the Han Dynasty in China, the economic policies of the Grand Minister of Agriculture, Sang Hongyang, not only made salt, iron, and wine three daily necessities monopolies of the state, but also had the state engaged in the operation of all other daily necessities. At the same time, the state did not monopolize, and still allowed people to trade freely. However, the government had various strategies to suppress private merchants so that they could not obtain large profits. Another example is the prohibition of the export of gold and silver by Spain and Portugal in the 16th century, reducing the weight of coins to prevent their export, and setting official foreign exchange rates to prevent the export of gold and silver, which also contained the implication of intervention and was a precursor to controlled economics. From the past, controlled economics has a rich history. Furthermore, the stock market crash in the United States in 1929 triggered a global economic panic. In the years following the warning, the livelihood of the people in various countries became increasingly difficult. Therefore, the only way to remedy the situation was through control. Looking at the past and the present, especially in the most recent two months, the long-term prospects of controlled economics are even more foreseeable. In summary, controlled economics is opposed to free economics and contains the implication of intervention. From a practical point of view, controlled economics takes the central will as the main body. Whether it is each part of the national economic structure or its micro parts, in other words, whether it is freedom in any aspect of production or consumption, it should obey the central will.

The prerequisites for implementing controlled economics can be divided into two aspects: (1) There must be a spiritual condition, which is to overthrow feudal forces and eliminate internal obstacles to economic control. The residual forces of feudalism have not yet been completely eliminated even in open politics and advanced society. What are the remnants of feudalism? It refers to landlords, local bullies, corrupt gentry, and a small number of dishonest officials. Their evil influence can not only hinder the advancement of controlled economics in the interior, but also in trading ports. Therefore, in the progress of controlled economics, the remnants of feudalism must be thoroughly eliminated. Controlled economics must have a rational and sound foundation, and it must first control the ambitions and desires of the general public.

(2) There must be a material condition, which is to strengthen power and consolidate the foundation of control. The past economic chaos was entirely due to the loss of autonomy in economic changes. Since the outbreak of the war, the foundation of controlled economics has also been established, but the economic foundation cannot yet be considered satisfactory. For example, the failure to resolve the issue of floating capital, the blockage of freight transportation, the lack of materials, and the existence of black markets for many necessities are all unhealthy phenomena in economic dynamics. In economic dynamics, if there is no substantial force, the implementation of controlled economics will inevitably fail to reach perfection. Therefore, in the promotion of controlled economics, the country must have substantial power to secure the home and defend against foreign enemies as the basic force for promoting controlled economics.

On the government's side, economic control must start with controlling the economic thinking of the people. The so-called economic thinking means that the people can consciously, actively, and independently control their own economic behavior, which is the best policy, and its effect is often twice the result with half the effort. As for the types of control, they can be divided into four points as follows:

(1) Control of production economics - This scope is very broad, including what is called agricultural control (including water conservancy, forestry, animal husbandry control, fishery control, industrial control, etc.).

(2) Control of transaction economics - Transaction control includes what is called domestic trade control, foreign trade control, price control, currency control, and the control of the financial and insurance industries.

(3) Control of distribution economics - Control of distribution economics refers to the fact that the ruling government should actively adopt social policies. The so-called social policies include promoting labor-management cooperation, promoting labor welfare undertakings, heavily taxing the income and inheritance of the wealthy, and operating various social insurance undertakings.

(4) Control of consumption economics - The scope of this control is also very broad. Based on the economic behavior of people's consumption, it can be divided into seven categories:

(1) Control of people's food - including storing grain to prevent famine, regulating food supply, and banning banquets, etc.

(2) Control of people's clothing - even including cosmetics control and clothing, etc.

(3) Control of people's housing - including improving housing, etc.

(4) Control of people's travel - including self-sufficiency in highway fuel and the gradual elimination of unreasonable means of transportation, etc.

In short, the controlled economy of the People's Livelihood is the most suitable for the needs of our country's society, and it is more in line with China after joining the war today. If it can be implemented quickly and actively promoted, production will increase, materials will be sufficient, and wealth will be distributed equally, thereby stabilizing the lives of the people.

Enterprise Overview

### Overview of the Business Development Area of Chinese Insurance Industry

— Yang Zhigang

Since the Chinese insurance industry rose following the liquidation of British and American insurance companies, new companies have sprung up one after another. To date, the total number of new and old Chinese insurance companies has reached as many as ninety-six. This is truly an unprecedented page in the history of the Chinese insurance industry.

It is noted that our country's insurance industry has always been concentrated in Shanghai, and has been promoted and developed to coastal provinces and commercial ports and cities in the interior. Since the outbreak of the war, wherever the flames of war have reached, all places have been ravaged by war, resulting in the decline of all industries and businesses, which has had a profound and significant impact on the insurance business. It has also formed a situation of repeated concentration in the commercially prosperous Shanghai, which is an abnormally prosperous place. Because of the narrow business scope of Shanghai, the limited amount of insurance, and the gradual recovery of post-war industrial and commercial recovery in various places; British and American insurance companies that have deep roots in various places and have a long history have also been suspended due to the impact of the current situation; this objectively provides Chinese insurance companies with excellent conditions for developing to a wide range of commercial ports and cities, which is also a favorable environment for the current Chinese insurance industry to develop its business in various places.

At present, the expansion areas of the Shanghai insurance industry are mostly concentrated in various ports of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, especially along the Beijing-Shanghai and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, followed by important cities in Hubei, Guangdong, Anhui, and Shandong provinces, and as far north as Pingjin and other places. There are also plans to restore insurance business in important places in Nanyang. The insurance business network that was densely distributed in various places before the war has been re-established. Among them, the number of Chinese insurance companies in Suzhou, Hangzhou, Nanjing and other places has increased far more than before the war. Taking this as an opportunity to lay the initial foundation for autonomy, there are great hopes for future development.

Looking at the actual situation in Suzhou, Zhejiang, Anhui, and other places, taking Suzhou and Hangzhou as examples, the current commerce is more prosperous, and although many industrial facilities have been relocated or destroyed in war, the number of those that have been restored or newly created to date is not small. Moreover, many residential buildings that were damaged in the war have also been rebuilt and repaired, and the average number of residents has gradually increased, so its environment is becoming more and more favorable for the development of the insurance business, which is very obvious. However, there are still some aspects of the actual situation in various places that should not be ignored. For example, the fact that the industrial and commercial sectors have not yet reached a normal and prosperous state, the fire-fighting equipment is not complete, the construction of houses is inevitably simple and leads to an increase in danger, and the municipal organization is not extremely thorough, are all factors that are still sufficient to hinder its smooth development.

According to statistics, the distribution of the insurance industry in various coastal areas of our country before the war was: Shanghai City had a total of 24 head offices and 2 branch offices. In Jiangsu Province, Nanjing had 5 branch offices, Zhenjiang 1, and Suzhou 1. In Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou had 6 branch offices and Ningbo 2. In Jiangxi Province, Nanchang had 4 branch offices and Jiujiang 1. Guangzhou in Guangdong Province had 2 head offices and 18 branch offices, Shantou and Taishan each had 1, and Shiqi had 3. In Hebei Province, Beiping had 1 head office and 3 branch offices, and Tianjin had 10 branch offices. In Shandong Province, Jinan had 5 branch offices, Qingdao 6, and Longkou 1. Overseas, Hong Kong had 10 head offices and 6 branch offices, and Singapore had 2 head offices and 2 branch offices. Yangon and Siam each had 2 branch offices. Batavia, Penang, Yau Ma Tei, Medan, Australia, and Wan Chai each had 1 branch office. As for the number of agents distributed in various places, there are even more, reaching more than 5,000. It is now found that the distribution of insurance companies in various ports of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces is as follows: In Nanjing, it is estimated that there are a total of 35 branch offices, offices, or agencies. Suzhou has reached 32, Hangzhou has 30, and Wuxi has 18. In terms of quantity, it has far exceeded the original amount before the war. In terms of business, in addition to the virtual increase in the amount of business due to the high prices of insured objects, strictly speaking, it has not been able to reach the development before the war. However, the prospects for development are still unlimited.

From the above situation in various places, it is enough to see the general situation of various insurance companies competing to develop in other ports. As for the fire insurance rate table in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui and other provinces, it has long been established by the association and is generally followed uniformly in various places. In Nanjing and other ports, there are also trade associations to enhance the connection and unity of the industry and promote the development of the insurance business. The insurance industry was originally a social enterprise that assisted industrial and commercial development and maintained social economic stability. At present, the decentralized development of insurance business to various places directly expands the business of the insurance industry itself, and indirectly also benefits the development and prosperity of industries and businesses distributed in various places. Therefore, it is indeed a phenomenon that is beneficial to the national economy. However, the most important key lies in the thorough planning and prudent and rational management of each insurance industry itself.

### Talking About "Potential"

— Ji Chen

"Potential," simply explained, is inner strength. This strength is entirely cultivated through personal cultivation and learning. This is not to say that a coarse worker or a hard-working farmer has no potential. On the contrary, their potential is very considerable, because work is their cultivation, and experience is their learning.

"Potential" is not exclusive to the human body. Sometimes we can also refer to the durability of an item as potential. Not only that, but a country also has "potential." A few days ago, in the spokesman's speech in the newspaper, it was said that one of the important reasons for the setback in the war with Russia this time was "Russia's full exploitation of its potential." This is enough to prove that "potential can not only dominate individuals, but also influence the world!

If a person has considerable "potential" as a backing, he will not be easily eliminated by society, resulting in ruin and disgrace. It can be seen that "potential" is also one of the elements of success. However, it cannot be achieved overnight. Therefore, if we want to be in this complex society in the future, to be a part of it, then, while we are still young, let us work hard to cultivate "potential."

### After Reading "Enjoying One's Work"

— Bi Cheng

Recently, prices have risen quite a bit, making life even more difficult. This made me feel like I could no longer "enjoy my work." Therefore, I started paying attention to articles in newspapers and magazines about employment issues, hoping to understand: why can't I "enjoy my work"? "How can one enjoy one's work?" and "What happens after one enjoys one's work?"

In the issue of the 28th of this month, there was an article titled "Enjoying One's Work." In addition to pointing out that the increase in unemployment is due to social depression and personnel changes, the author, Mr. Fei Hui, particularly emphasized that "not being able to enjoy one's work" is also an important reason.

If unemployment is seen merely as an individual's misfortune, and "enjoying one's work" is considered the only good way to maintain one's original job, then I would wholeheartedly agree with Mr. Fei Hui's opinion. Conversely, if individual unemployment is seen only as a specific phenomenon of social unemployment panic, then when we investigate the causes of social unemployment, we cannot take "not being able to enjoy one's work" as one of the reasons, thereby thinking that everyone "enjoying their work" can partially solve the social unemployment problem. Because unemployment is an inevitable phenomenon of this socioeconomic system, and no subjective wishes can reduce or eliminate it. The increase or decrease in the number of unemployed only indicates the relative stability or depression of the socioeconomic system, but it cannot prove whether those engaged in social production work "enjoy their work" or "do not enjoy their work."

Mr. Fei Hui also told us—he said: "No matter what kind of job, after careful consideration, it contains a lot of interest."

This statement seems too generalized, and I dare not agree with it. The reason is simple: I believe that the scope of occupation is very broad. All work that belongs to social production and assisting social production is a kind of occupation, and people participating in a certain social production work is also engaged in a certain occupation. Lawyers, engineers, company managers, compradors in foreign firms, stars, directors, etc... are certainly occupations, but are rickshaw pullers, low-level clerks, prostitutes, and coolies not occupations as well?

Since the scope of enjoying one's work is broad, and the people who engage in enjoying their work differ from each other due to the different occupational sectors, under such extremely complex social conditions, especially in this turbulent era, where life is not stable and joy and suffering are extremely polarized, can we say: "No matter what kind of job, it contains a lot of interest"? No! Absolutely not! May I ask, would a prostitute who sells her body to make a living, or a coolie struggling on the verge of death, feel "a lot of interest" in their own occupation? The answer to this question, "yes" or "no," only needs to be based on common sense.

The motivation for me to write this is not to oppose "enjoying one's work," let alone deny the importance of "work interest" for occupation. I am only stating that "an individual's inability to enjoy their work does not constitute the cause of social unemployment." At the same time, "a generalization of the current social occupational interest is not a definite conclusion."

As for whether "taking enjoying one's work as the foundation, with enduring hard work" can "overcome general adverse environments?" Due to space limitations, I will have to discuss it later. (The manuscript fee will be used to fund student aid)

### Donating Cotton-Padded Coats

— Tian Xiao

Mr. Zhang is 71 years old, walks vigorously, and is good at running. He believes that old people being able to run is better than taking tonics, and he once wrote a doggerel poem that was published in the newspaper's supplement.

One day, Mr. Zhang was walking along a street when he saw a twelve or thirteen-year-old beggar crouching on the side of the road, naked from the waist up, and wearing a pair of torn pants with gaping holes from the waist down, shivering in the cold wind.

"Sir! Mister! Do a good deed! Freezing to death! Starving to death!"

There are many beggars in Shanghai, especially young beggars, as if Heaven deliberately placed them to embellish the bustling streets. Even Yao and Shun were concerned about widespread generosity and assistance. Mr. Zhang wanted to walk past with a blind eye, but his vigorous feet involuntarily stopped and stood still.

Because it was a severe cold weather, the northwest wind carried its fierce force, invading every part of people's skin. Even people wearing heavy fur coats were curled up like frozen birds. Recently, coal prices have soared, and the stoves in middle-class families are not warm enough, and they often exclaim: "It's cold! It's cold!" But he was naked, fighting against the west wind, and he was also an underage child, how could he bear it?

"Sigh! Why don't you have any clothes on?" Mr. Zhang asked him, "Sir! Grandpa! I—I—I'm freezing to death!"

The little beggar was shivering from the cold, his teeth chattering as he spoke, and tears falling down.

"Then come with me." Mr. Zhang ordered him.

It turned out that this place was not far from Mr. Zhang's house. After only a few dozen steps, they arrived at Mr. Zhang's house.

The family was very surprised that he brought a little beggar home. Those little rascals specialize in snatching biscuits and cakes from ladies' hands on the road.

Mr. Zhang had a compassionate heart. He had cotton-padded coats at home, specially for the poor to wear. A cotton-padded coat and a pair of cotton-padded pants used to cost only one or two dollars, but now dozens of dollars are not enough. There are two kinds of cotton-padded coats and pants, one for adults and one for children. Mr. Zhang then picked out a set for children and taught the little beggar to put it on.

"How is it? Is your body warm now?" Mr. Zhang asked him.

"It's warm," said the little beggar.

"If it's warm, then wear it and go," Mr. Zhang said to him.

"Thank you, grandpa!" He slowly wanted to go out.

"Wait a minute!" Mr. Zhang had a thought. Just now he was shouting.

"Freezing to death! Starving to death?" The problem of freezing has been solved, but the problem of hunger has not been solved yet.

Mr. Zhang instructed the maid to go to the kitchen to bring a bowl of hot rice and some pickles. The little beggar had been hungry for a long time, so naturally he ate very well.

"Eat slowly! No one will come to rob you," Mr. Zhang comforted him. At that time, Mr. Zhang's mood was like a loving father cherishing his child.

His body was warm, his stomach was full, and as he sent him out the door, he also reminded him: "Because your body was cold, I gave you clothes to wear, you are not allowed to sell the clothes."

The little beggar obediently agreed and left gratefully.

A few days later, Mr. Zhang passed by the same place and suddenly heard someone shouting again.

"Sir! Mister! Do a good deed! Freezing to death! Starving to death!"

Mr. Zhang looked back and saw the same little beggar he had seen last time, still naked from the waist up, still wearing a pair of torn pants with gaping holes from the waist down, shivering in the cold wind.

When he saw Mr. Zhang, he recognized Mr. Zhang. He wanted to run away, but Mr. Zhang stopped him.

"Where is the cotton-padded coat and pants I gave you last time?"

"..." The little beggar lowered his head and said nothing, his body still trembling.

"Didn't I tell you not to sell it? Did you sell it?"

"..." The little beggar was silent and wept.

"I know!" Mr. Zhang said: "Your clothes were taken off by your adults, isn't that right? Tell me the truth, and I'll think of a way for you, maybe I can give you another set of cotton clothes and pants."

"I! I! My clothes are there, I didn't sell them." The little beggar said.

"If you didn't sell them, why aren't you wearing them?" Mr. Zhang asked.

The little beggar said something that was very reasonable.

It turned out that after Mr. Zhang gave him a set of cotton-padded clothes and pants, he wore them to the streets to beg the next day. But passers-by saw that his clothes were neat, and although he cried out, "Starving to death!" However, not many people gave him money. Compared to when he was naked and shouted, "Freezing to death!" the money he earned was less than half. The next day was the same. The day after that, he was still naked, crying out. "Freezing to death! Starving to death!" The money he earned actually returned to its original state. The beggar's technique is like this, you cannot violate his technique.

However, a child, naked, fighting against the west wind, can he endure it? Flesh and blood, who can endure it? Otherwise, it would not be that after a night of north wind, dozens of people would freeze to death by the roadside the next morning, and children would account for the majority. If you don't teach him to beg in the streets again? Even if his body is warm, his stomach is still hungry, who can give him a full stomach every day? Moreover, there are not a few frozen and hungry children on the streets, right?

"Sigh! I'm over seventy years old, and I've learned a lesson from the little beggar." Mr. Zhang said after hearing what the little beggar said. It's not just Mr. Zhang who has learned a lesson, we have all learned a lesson, especially those gentlemen in charge of social welfare. You must know that individual relief does not help, and you need to make a comprehensive calculation.

Clang! It seemed to be the sound of plates falling to the ground. This is like thunder inevitably embellishing when heavy rain is falling.

"Fengchun," Huang Chong'an said to his second wife, "Go and see what's going on. Tell them not to quarrel, there are guests here."

"It will be peaceful after a while of quarreling," Xue Fengchun flicked off some cigarette ash with his fingers, saying it lightly. "That's right, that's right," Yang Zijie strongly encouraged, "It's better for Mr. Fengchun to go and persuade them."

Xue Fengchun smiled and stood up, then stretched and yawned, and then, with a cigarette in his mouth, walked out of the study door. "What's the use of that," he said as he walked through the patio, but he said it very quietly, so it could not be heard in the study.

The opposite room suddenly became quiet, and then Xue Fengchun was heard saying in a happy tone: "Agong, Agong, don't quarrel, I'll take you to Suzhou to play tomorrow, to Shanghai to play, you can eat whatever you want, even live brains..."

"I don't want to, I don't want to, ugh ugh, I must eat live crucian carp tonight!..." Yougong still insisted; The intermittent rain shower fell again suddenly.

Probably Aunt Qian had already left, and only the middle-aged woman was heard saying to the old woman: "Mother, I'm not talking about you, you only know how to eat vegetarian food and recite Buddhist scriptures all day long, and you don't care about housework at all, which has led to this point! Even the servants are so unruly..."

"Servants are not human!" From a distance, from some corner, or from some room, the same sentence was thrown back.

"Ah Hua, what should I do..." the mother complained.

"You Shu elder sister... Lady..." Xue Fengchun was speaking to both sides.

"Ugh ugh, I don't want to, I don't want to..." The voice was lower, quite a bit of a carefree, rain-shower-will-pass expression.

At this time, people in the study did not have to prick up their ears to listen, but were able to breathe calmly and think about what they had just been saying.

"Lu Bailian is still not coming," Yu Duzhou first returned to the original topic.

"This drunkard must be rolling in some ditch again," Yang Zijie said with a smile. (5)

### Spitting Anywhere Versus Choosing Where to Spit

— Shen Zhongwu

The prohibition of spitting anywhere has been widely publicized, and there are also fixed penalties, but the bad habit has not been eradicated, and the effect on personal and public health is minimal. Sputum contains bacteria (especially Koch's bacillus, which is the most terrible). For individuals, the sputum that reaches the throat should be discharged from the body. For the public, the sputum should not be allowed to dry, so that bacteria can spread and attack people.

What are the consequences of the current prohibition of spitting anywhere?

(1) The working class does not understand the advantages and disadvantages, and swallows the sputum—this harms themselves.

(2) The intellectual class spits sputum into paper bags and throws them in secluded side roads—this is enough to harm people, and is no different from spitting anywhere.

I have a suggestion that includes three items:

(1) Advocate choosing where to spit. Health authorities should earnestly inform residents.

(2) Health authorities should widely place sputum receptacles (containing sterilizing liquid) on transportation routes (for example, behind each street sign) to collect pedestrians' sputum, and sanitation workers should be responsible for dumping them.

(3) Publicize the harm of sputum, so that ordinary people have the habit of spitting in designated locations. This is very common for both living at home and traveling. (Thank you)
