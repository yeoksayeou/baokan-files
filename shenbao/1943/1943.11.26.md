### The Fate of Chongqing (Continued) - The Inevitability of the Kuomintang's Split in Chongqing

— Toyosuke Yoshida

Conclusion – The Progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War

During the period when the Chinese Communist Party (CCP) utilized the Kuomintang (KMT), the KMT only moved in the direction of a bourgeois democratic revolution in China. Perhaps some would say that, within this scope, the CCP's use of the KMT wasn't necessarily a bad thing, as it promoted China's modernization to some extent. The main targets of China's bourgeois democratic revolution were not only the remnants of feudalism but also imperialism. Because imperialism, with its complete military and political power in China, preserved the power of feudal remnants like warlord bureaucrats within China's entire superstructure. Therefore, if imperialism wasn't expelled from China, the remnants of feudalism within China couldn't be completely eliminated. Isn't it right for the CCP to utilize the KMT when it fights against foreign imperialism, and to discard it when it stops fighting against foreign powers? This seems logical at first glance. However, should the KMT be happy to be used by the CCP? It's like a praying mantis, where the male is happy to be eaten by the female during mating. Should the KMT, like a male praying mantis, be eaten by the CCP after completing its assigned historical mission? We must now answer this point.

Whether it's the KMT or the CCP, have you ever considered what it really means for China, as a nation, to complete its bourgeois democratic revolution at this current stage of world history? Needless to say, Mexico is a country that has undergone a bourgeois democratic revolution. If there are doubts about Mexico, then let's not talk about it for now. But surely we can acknowledge that the ABC countries of South America, namely Argentina, Brazil, and Chile, are countries that have undergone bourgeois democratic revolutions! These countries indeed have democratic parliaments, modernized industries, and capitalist management in agriculture. On the surface, they appear to be three grand and imposing "independent and autonomous" nations. However, do these three countries now use their "independent and autonomous" sovereignty to determine their own policies? Of course, it goes without saying that everyone knows that these countries act solely on the orders of Wall Street. (Regarding Argentina, although it cannot be said to be exactly the same as the other two, the fact that the country has a little freedom now is merely because its national capitalists are able to exploit the subtle inconsistencies between Wall Street agents and Threadneedle Street agents.)

If the goal of China's democratic revolution is to become a second Mexico or a second Brazil, then, of course, there's nothing more to say. Even if economically backward Asian countries can complete bourgeois democratic revolutions, believing that they can escape the global domination of Anglo-American capitalism is ultimately a sign of insufficient understanding of the times. Therefore, there's a need to discuss the post-war "Four Great Powers" that the Anti-Japanese War propaganda department boasted about. Regarding the annual production of pig iron, the United States produces 31,527,000 tons, the United Kingdom produces 9,413,000 tons (including India), and the Soviet Union produces 14,395,000 tons (all based on 1936 statistics). China has almost no decent figure to speak of for pig iron production. Unflattering figures like these are too numerous to list. In short, with copper ore production, motor usage, and all materials necessary for modern industry being disproportionately small compared to the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, on what basis can China claim to be one of the "Four Great Powers"?

### Ambassador Tani Discusses Close Cooperation Between China and Japan for the Construction of Greater East Asia in a Press Conference in Nanjing

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency) – With the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, relations between China and Japan are moving towards a stage of great progress. Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masazane, held a press conference at his official residence at 4 PM on the 25th to answer questions from the capital's press corps. More than a dozen reporters from various newspapers attended. Director of Intelligence Kishi, and Secretaries Shimizu and Matsudaira were also present. The following is a record of Ambassador Tani's answers to the reporters' questions:

Policy Focus

Question: Following the signing of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty and the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, may I ask what the focus of your country's policy development towards China will be, taking the treaty and declaration as a starting point? Answer: The publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the conclusion of the China-Japan Alliance Treaty, while different in form, are consistent in spirit. Japan's ideal is that each country in Greater East Asia finds its place, achieves its own independence and autonomy, and closely cooperates to seek the prosperity of its own country. Therefore, the primary objective of Japan's policy towards China is to assist China in achieving its own independence and autonomy, and to closely cooperate with other East Asian countries to construct the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The development of the Greater East Asia policy is the beginning of Japan's new measures towards China. Since its inception, it has been steadily progressing. Recently, the conclusion of the two countries' alliance treaty, as well as the publication of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, represent the progress of Japan's policy towards China. The Greater East Asia Declaration clearly explains how to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Its purpose is to ensure that each country in Greater East Asia is independent and autonomous, finds its place, cooperates closely, and jointly seeks the prosperity of Greater East Asia. In terms of culture, we respect the traditional concepts of each country. Therefore, each country should seek the development of Greater East Asian culture. The content of this Greater East Asia Declaration is completely different from Western utilitarianism. For example, the point about abolishing racial discrimination in the declaration's main purpose is to have each East Asian country cooperate to build a prosperous Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which will then be extended to the whole world. Therefore, looking at the substance of the declaration, the relationship between China and Japan will not only restore its original form but will also further strengthen close cooperation to jointly build Greater East Asia.

Comprehensive Peace

Question: How should China and Japan cooperate to implement the alliance treaty and complete the war, in order to achieve a comprehensive peace as soon as possible? Answer: The construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is of great importance to both China and Japan. Therefore, the important goal for both countries in the future is to jointly strive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as the main mission, in order to ensure peace in East Asia and world peace. As for how to implement the spirit of the alliance treaty, I believe that the officials and people of China and Japan should first understand the true meaning of the alliance treaty and the Greater East Asia Declaration, and then jointly awaken and understand each other, then the alliance treaty will surely be implemented, the declaration will surely be executed, and the goal of completing the war will be achieved. Since China and Japan are the pivot of Greater East Asia, if the two countries can lead the East Asian countries to strive hard, we firmly believe that not only can we achieve the goal of completing the war and building Greater East Asia, but we can also further promote the early realization of comprehensive peace. I hope that the Chinese people will make a rational judgment based on an independent and autonomous position. If they believe that participating in the Greater East Asia War is the bright road, then they should rise up and strive for the construction of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity, and complete the unification of China, then the realization of comprehensive peace will be just around the corner.

Youth of Both Countries

Question: Your Excellency recently returned from your country to your post, could you tell us something about the recent situation in your country? Answer: When I returned to my country last time, I witnessed the situation of the general public in Japan, and I had many thoughts. The Japanese people have a thorough understanding of the purpose, meaning, and mission of the Greater East Asia War, and believe that victory in the war is the key to building Greater East Asia. In particular, the general youth understand the meaning of the Greater East Asia War, so the general young students are willing to drop out of school to join the army, and are eager to serve the country, and the noble ladies of the aristocracy, even more give up the enjoyment of luxury life, and work hard in the difficult war, their loyalty to the country and spirit, is really admirable. In short, 100 million Japanese people have firmly determined the determination and belief of certain victory and invincibility, this return to the country, which makes me the most confused, is this, finally, I to the Chinese youth, also places the enormous warmth expectation and anticipation. The youth of China and Japan should understand each other, cooperate closely, jointly build Greater East Asia, and then lead the world, and strive to ensure lasting world peace.

### Bose Returns to Syonan, Ba Maw Arrives in Rangoon

Syonan, 25th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose, after attending the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo, visited China and then returned south, stopping in the Philippines and Saigon. He arrived here this afternoon.

Rangoon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Burmese representative Ba Maw, who attended the Greater East Asia Conference, passed through Manila and North Borneo on his way back to his country, and arrived here yesterday evening.

Saigon, 25th (Central News Agency) – Subhas Chandra Bose arrived in Saigon on the 24th and left for other destinations at 9:30 this morning. Before leaving, he met with a group of reporters and stated that, based on the Greater East Asia Conference, the future of the people of ten Russian nations in Asia is becoming brighter, and that he has gained firm confidence in the attitude he should take in the future. Therefore, on the way home, he broadcast to Chongqing in Nanjing, and he believes that Chongqing will not have any criticism of his remarks. At the time of the Sino-Japanese Incident, some people in India, lacking understanding and harboring misunderstandings, sympathized with Chongqing, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Chongqing army colluded with the British and invaded India, and India was completely betrayed. As a result, the Indian people's feelings towards Japan changed, especially since Japan supported the independence of Burma, the Philippines, etc., and recognized the Provisional Government of India, it became clear that India could not be independent without Japanese support, so India's attitude towards Japan changed from respect to trust. Although the British and Americans seem indifferent to the establishment of our Provisional Government, our Provisional Government has a great influence on the Indian people. With the support of Japan and the support of overseas Indian nationals, I am determined to liberate the people of India from the shackles of the British and Americans. I have full strength and preparation for advancing into India.

### US Suffers Heavy Losses in the Last Three Weeks

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency) – Since the US military landed on Mono Island on October 27, until the fifth Bougainville sea and air battle on November 17, the damage it has suffered has been gradually announced by the Imperial Headquarters. However, because the US authorities are concealing the damage suffered in these battles, Information Officer Iguchi of the Japanese Information Bureau previously criticized the deceptive means of the US authorities at a meeting with the foreign press corps, and pointed out at a meeting with the foreign press corps on the 22nd that the enemy's losses were at least 24,000 personnel, and the construction cost of the sunken warships totaled 630 million yuan. Generally speaking, the loss rate of those who were sunk immediately is 80% to 100%, while the loss rate of those who sank later is 30% to 40%. The wounded are also about 10%. Moreover, based on the number of people on board, battleships and large aircraft carriers have about 2,000 people, heavy cruisers and medium-sized aircraft carriers have about 900 people, cruisers have about 400 people, destroyers have about 200 to 250 people, large transport ships carry a total of about 1,000 soldiers and crew members, medium-sized transport ships carry 630 people, and small transport ships carry 400 people. Based on this calculation, the total loss of soldiers is at least 19,000, and up to 24,000. Calculating the loss of materials, not counting the wounded, only the sunken warships, is about 60 million yuan (a total of 4 sunken), large aircraft carriers 32 million yuan (2 ships), medium-sized aircraft carriers 20 million yuan (detailed ships), heavy cruisers 10 million yuan (9 ships), destroyers 6 million yuan (12 ships), warships with unspecified shapes 10 million yuan (1 ship).

Furthermore, travelers arriving from the south may bring 1,000 yuan per person without having to exchange it at the station, which is extremely convenient for travelers. The aforementioned rate of 100 Central Reserve Bank notes to 18 Allied Reserve Bank notes applies to all occasions where joint use is in effect, and the authorities will seek to ensure foolproof measures for its implementation. There will also be unlimited exchange for the two currencies, as needed. As for the joint use by merchants and civilians in this region, it will not hinder transactions. Furthermore, when the joint use measures are first implemented in this region, no measures will be taken to convert Allied Reserve Bank notes into Central Reserve Bank notes for the time being. Except as mentioned above, the currency exchange system for travelers between North and Central China will remain as it is. In addition, the methods of material acquisition by material acquisition organizations in this region and the regulations for exporting materials to Central and North China will not be changed. The main points of these measures are roughly as described above. The authorities are extremely cautious regarding policies for the economic development and promotion of trade in this region.

Tokyo, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) Delegates from China, Burma, and Malaysia attending the Greater East Asia News Convention recently expressed their impressions as follows: (Li Liuxiao, China) While there are various strategies for completing the war, the most important thing for completing the Greater East Asia War is for the 1 billion people of East Asia to jointly strive for victory. Now that the Greater East Asia News Council has been established at this conference, we are determined to use this as the center to work hard to unite the 1 billion people so that the purpose of the holy war can be completed as soon as possible.

(Surohakiknot, Java) After arriving in Japan, I first saw the truth that Japan is working hard to complete the war, and I am very admirable. In the future, I will use paper as a bullet to cooperate in completing the war. (Celebes Mayen Subian) I am very surprised to have been in contact with the great Japan for the first time. After returning, I will work harder to exert the power of the ideological war, so that it will contribute to the war.

### Japan-Soviet Relations Remain Unchanged

Lisbon, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch from Washington: It is surprising that the Soviet Union has announced that it does not intend to participate in the Far East Committee of the Allied Relief and Rehabilitation Administration, because it was expected that the Soviet Union would participate in both the European Committee and the Far East Committee. The Soviet Union announced its intentions to the organizing subcommittee yesterday. This attitude may be due to Japanese-Soviet diplomatic relations.

### Lebanon Announces the Abolition of the Mandate System

Paris, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) German news agency reports: British and American planes suddenly attacked the French port of Toulon yesterday afternoon.

### Physician Screening Committee Schedules Retake Examination

Nanjing, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Ministry of Health convened its first Physician Screening Committee meeting at the ministry at 5:00 PM on the 24th. Nine committee members attended.

### Germany Endures Air Raids, Public Morale Does Not Waver, Heavy Losses for British Planes Raiding Berlin

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) German Minister of Propaganda Goebbels and Capital Garrison Commander Gorlitz delivered short speeches to the residents of the German capital yesterday, saying that the German people's determination to win cannot be shaken by air raids. Goebbels commented that the recent British terror bombing only attempted to destroy residential areas and cultural buildings, but could not damage the slightest of Germany's war production. The enemy is using despicable means to achieve its goals that it cannot succeed on the battlefield, namely, to make the German resistance force diminish. It is a fallacy for the enemy to think that the spirit of the people of the German capital is weaker than that of other cities. Although the people and their residences have been damaged, the difficulties of the German people will disappear. He expressed special thanks for the trained spirit of the Germans in the air raids and believed that the Germans would all fulfill their responsibilities and a new, more beautiful Berlin would be reborn after victory.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch: It is learned here that the British planes lost 52 bombers and approximately 400 pilots in two night raids on Berlin. This is the number of enemy aircraft shot down. The number of aircraft damaged by gunfire on the way home has not yet been included. British planes, disregarding the infamous name of barbaric warfare, are air raiding Berlin, showing that Britain has repeatedly suffered setbacks in the military field and has to make up for it with air raids. German officials say: If the enemy wants to use air raids to demoralize the German people, then the people of Berlin will also show the tenacious spirit of other German cities that have suffered air raids.

### German Forces Advancing Along the Kiev Highway, Encirclement Circle Shrinking, Soviet Side Admits Retreating from Chernihiv

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) The German military authorities announced on the 24th: German forces have already secured the key point of Borosilov, 72 kilometers west of Kiev, and Chernihiv, 20 kilometers north of Zhytomyr.

Stockholm, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Moscow dispatch: The Soviet Information Bureau announced on the 24th that Soviet forces had retreated from Chernihiv, north of Zhytomyr.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch, German military sources say: The German encirclement circle on the Zhytomyr-Kiev highway is shrinking. Soviet forces launched relieving offensives south of Kiev and northeast and north of Zhytomyr, but because of German aircraft bombing, the Soviet forces have not yet succeeded.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch: In the final news on the Eastern Front, German forces are launching fierce counterattacks in the Zhytomyr and Kiev areas, cutting off and encircling large Soviet forces. This development is due to the German forces implementing a flanking offensive north of Zhytomyr. The Soviet forces advancing towards the Korosten area are currently calming down. On Tuesday, German tank formations captured or destroyed 6 enemy artillery positions and 40 cannons south of the area, and captured hundreds of Soviet troops. The Soviet army continued to attack in other parts of the Eastern Front without success. There were fierce battles in the German bridgehead of Nikopol, the Dnieper River bend, and Cherkasy. The Red Army was repulsed by major offensives on Tuesday, and several gaps were filled in during German counterattacks.

Soviet Forces Launch Offensive on the Leningrad Front

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a Reuters dispatch: There was fierce fighting northeast of Krachnoje Selo in the Leningrad area.

There was also fierce fighting 4 kilometers from Gomel. On Tuesday, the Soviet army's attack on the north of the city was unsuccessful. The Soviet army has been attacking the city of Krichev for several days, and fierce battles are still ongoing. The German counteroffensive northwest of Nevel has been very successful.

### Impressions of a Trip to the East — Wishing to Sincerely Advise My Fellow Countrymen —

— Chen Binhe

This time, taking advantage of attending the Greater East Asia News Conference, I went to Japan for sightseeing. I departed on November 11th and returned to Shanghai on the 25th, a total of fourteen days. I stayed in Tokyo for twelve days. Besides attending the conference, I had quite a bit of contact with people from various sectors of Japanese society. I will briefly record my impressions as follows:

The Greater East Asia News Conference was held after the Greater East Asia Conference issued a joint declaration. It could use the joint declaration as a foundation to discuss how to leverage the power of news to awaken the ten hundred million people of Greater East Asia to thoroughly understand its essence, so that they can unite and strive for common victory. This conference was most urgent in terms of timing.

The conference lasted for three days and concluded successfully. The meticulous arrangement of the venue and the attentive hospitality outside the venue truly gave the feeling of being at home. Special thanks should be expressed to Mr. [Name] of the Japan Newspaper Association.

However, from a personal perspective, the conference was not without its shortcomings. The scope of discussion did not include the technical problems of the news industry. For example, the Philippines has been anesthetized by the United States for a long time, and Myanmar has been deeply poisoned by the United Kingdom, resulting in a great impact on their thinking. Although China's news industry has several decades of history, its content is still extremely immature. Whether in terms of equipment, technology, or talent cultivation, it is very backward. If these kinds of practical situations are not addressed and adjusted first, the efficiency of promoting the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration cannot be expected to be too high. Therefore, on the one hand, we must do our utmost to fulfill the mission of the news industry and promote the ideals of Greater East Asia; on the other hand, we must strengthen the power of the news industry so that it can shoulder this important task. This is something that news practitioners in various countries of Greater East Asia, in addition to understanding their mission, must pay particular attention to: actual technological progress.

In Japanese cities, society is stable and normal, and one hardly sees wartime phenomena. However, this is completely different from the lack of wartime phenomena in our domestic cities. The people of Japan, from the government to the common people, are consistently filled with wartime emotions, with the goal of protecting the country and liberating Greater East Asia as the focus of their efforts. These are by no means abstract statements, and there is evidence everywhere to support them. What is most moving is the recent conscription of tens of thousands of university students in Japan, who are going to the front lines. We acknowledge that they are doing so to protect their motherland, but we cannot deny that they are also doing so to liberate Greater East Asia. At railway stations, one often sees classmates sending off those departing, and the enthusiasm of the sentiments is inspiring. The Japanese truly revere "loyalty" and "filial piety." Generously enlisting in the army is loyalty; paying respects to ancestral graves before going to the front lines is fulfilling filial piety. One evening, I was invited to a banquet by Mr. Yamamoto, the president of Kaizo-sha, and a discussion was held. On that day, his eldest son happened to be returning to his hometown of Kagoshima to pay respects to the ancestral graves in preparation for joining the army. In Chinese families, perhaps due to parental love, there would be reluctance and affectionate farewells. However, Mr. and Mrs. Yamamoto extended their hospitality and showed no reluctance, but rather took pleasure in sending their son to the nation to serve in the war. Furthermore, there is no distinction of class or attempts to evade military service among young people who enlist. For example, the grandson of Prince Saionji enlisted on November 12th. The same is true for women performing labor service. Even the two daughters of Prime Minister Tojo perform the same obligatory service as ordinary women.

The Japanese government and people are extremely widespread and enthusiastic in their concern for the China issue. At banquets and discussions, they always inquire about the true situation in China. What I find most embarrassing and unable to answer are two points: first, how enthusiastic are the wartime emotions of the government and people of China after joining the war? Second, since Japan implemented its new policy toward China, how close are the people in the peaceful areas of China to Japan?

The Japanese government and people do indeed show sincere goodwill toward China. Since the incident, our Chinese people inevitably harbor prejudices and have not been able to understand or fully trust the goodwill of the Japanese government and people. Therefore, if we want the governments and people of the two countries to be close, we must first abandon prejudices, distinguish between good and evil, recognize good as good, and recognize evil as evil, and not consider good as evil because of prejudice. This is the blessing for the future of both countries. Two things I know have truly moved me. First, there is a Mr. Shichiri in Tokyo who has been providing voluntary service to Chinese students for twenty-five years, such as guiding their studies and helping them solve difficult problems. This is completely based on his own sincerity and he has never accepted subsidies from the Chinese embassy or been entrusted by the Japanese government. Second, there is a Mr. Zhong [Name] in Kyoto who runs a student dormitory and employs a female caretaker who is dedicated to serving Chinese students. After sending her son to the front lines recently, she returned to Kyoto to continue serving Chinese students. There are many such examples. Although they seem trivial, the expression of sincerity and good intentions cannot be ignored.

Domestic prices in Japan are low, which is astonishing compared to our country. Compared to the prices before the Sino-Japanese War, prices in Japan today have risen by about 50%. Clothing prices have risen by about 30%. In the past two years, daily necessities have been subject to a rationing system, and prices have not changed. For example, for a simple family, the monthly income is about 170 yuan, then the expenditure would be 80 yuan for living expenses for the couple (middle to upper class), 35 yuan for government bond savings, and there would be a surplus of 55 yuan. The income of civil servants and workers is over 200 yuan. From this, one can see a glimpse of the stability of life.

Japan's social institutions are strict, the control is appropriate, the rationing is reasonable, and the general life is average and equal. Even if the rich want to enjoy themselves, it is difficult to obtain more than their fair share. Everyone eats rice when they should eat rice. Everyone eats meat when they should eat meat. The common people are like this, and so are the prime minister and ministers; the poor are like this, and so are the rich. Saving on clothing and food is universally practiced. It is not that there are no materials, but that materials are saved to dedicate them to the completion of the war.

In short, "everyone uses their talents to the fullest, and everything is used to its fullest" has indeed been fully achieved in Japan. Therefore, "take the strengths of others to make up for our weaknesses" is something that all of our compatriots should quickly awaken to and strive to catch up with.

### The Rice Rationing Association's Procurement Is Quite Smooth; Large Quantities of Rice Will Be Shipped to Shanghai to Help the People's Food Supply

Central News Agency: Since the Rice Rationing Committee took charge of the unified purchase and distribution of rice, it has been actively engaged in organizing lower-level institutions. Preparatory committees of procurement associations in various regions and offices in various regions have been established one after another. According to the association, considering that the people's food supply is a major issue, in order to achieve good success in the procurement work, it focused on the selection of excellent rice merchants at the beginning of its establishment, in order to maximize the efficiency of the unified purchase and distribution mechanism. At the same time, the Japanese side also actively assisted in this, so the promotion of the procurement work was very smooth. It is reported that the rice collected by procurement merchants in various regions of the association has reached a considerable amount and will soon be shipped to Shanghai in large quantities to help the people's food supply.

### Vice Minister Yamamoto Inspects the New Situation in Central China; Arrives in Shanghai and Expresses Impressions to the Press Corps

Central News Agency: Vice Minister Yamamoto of the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry, in order to inspect the new situation in Central China after the conclusion of the new Sino-Japanese treaty, arrived in Shanghai on the 24th, accompanied by Mr. Dowa, the chief of the General Affairs Section of the China Affairs Bureau, and Investigator Fujiwara. In the morning, he visited the various units of the Japanese Army and Navy and the Army and Navy hospitals. In the afternoon, he went to the embassy office and the consulate general to give instructions. At 5 o'clock, he received the press corps and expressed his impressions, saying: "The overall peace is quite noteworthy, but Japan is by no means merely considering the current situation and hoping to achieve overall peace. From the new situation in Greater East Asia and the fair and honest path taken by Japan, I firmly believe that it will promote the unification of China. The broadcast to Chongqing by Chairman Bose of the Free India government also has this meaning. As fellow East Asians, no one is willing to refuse the solution of East Asia. This fact can be proven by the enthusiasm of the representatives at the Greater East Asia Conference held the other day. The Greater East Asia Conference is by no means merely a propaganda for Japan, but a sincere unity of East Asians. Vietnam's position in East Asia is quite subtle, but the current leaders of Vietnam are all aware that there is no way to survive without cooperating with Japan. At the same time, many overseas Chinese in Southeast Asia made mistakes before the war, but now they are all awakened and vowed to cooperate in building Greater East Asia. The leap forward of Manchuria should be the result of the cooperation between Japan and Manchuria with one heart and one mind, which is a good example. From the current situation, some people may think that the policies of Manchuria seem to have changed, which is not correct. The national construction policy of Manchuria is not only not changed from ten years ago, but also expanded and strengthened to adapt to the new situation and realize the integration of Japan and Manchuria."

### The Post Office Revises Miscellaneous Fees

### The Travel Service Office Will Open Next Week

Shanghai is an important commercial port, and travelers come and go in droves. However, the wharves of various ports are often occupied by gangsters who extort, swindle, and deceive, causing various disturbances such as loss of money or loss of luggage, which cannot be fully described.

(Article 4) If the number of days calculated for the total amount of the fine exceeds fifteen days, the number of days shall be calculated proportionally to the total amount of the fine and the number of days.

### Household Oil Changes to a Rationing System with Coupons; Purchase Oil with Previously Issued Oil Purchase Coupons

After the Oil and Grain Professional Committee unified the purchase of edible oil raw materials and allocated them to various oil mills for centralized distribution, the distribution of household oil in Shanghai has been transferred from the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office to the committee. A reporter from the Shanghai Social Work Association learned from relevant sources yesterday that, in order to strengthen the edible oil distribution mechanism, the Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has been changed to the "Shanghai District Edible Oil Industry Joint Trust Office," which has a distribution department to handle household oil distribution matters.

The date of the first sale, as well as the quantity, and price of oil will be announced later.

### Reporting Minister Matsushima Criticizes the US for Covering Up Defeat as Victory; Fabricating News to Conceal the Situation

Central News Agency: After the US suffered a series of disastrous defeats in the Bougainville Island and Gilbert Islands areas, the severity of the damage can be seen from the announcements of the Japanese General Headquarters and the urgent convening of emergency meetings by the US leaders to seek remedies. However, the US authorities are deeply afraid that the truth will cause public unrest once it is published, so they have always tried to conceal the extent of the damage, or even fabricate favorable news to divert attention. Mr. Matsushima, the reporting minister of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China, when meeting with the press corps on the 24th, specifically criticized this point, saying: "The announcement made by US Pacific Fleet Commander Nimitz is extremely contradictory and ridiculous. He claimed that there were no Japanese fleets in the vicinity of Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands, which was the result of the complete destruction of the Japanese fleet by the Laffey Air Battle. This statement is extremely naive and laughable. It must be known that the fleet battle on which the fate of the country depends is by no means comparable to a child's fight, and there is no reason to show people an opportunity lightly. The operations of the Japanese Navy are majestic and special, which cannot be followed by them. Nimitz also claimed that the US Air Force is very excellent, but the only problem is that the number of aircraft and materials is too small. This proves that the damage to US aircraft is significant. He also claimed that in order to carry out longer-range operations, the number of fleets is too small. From this, it can also be proved that the damage to its fleet is significant. The extravagant words he boasted before the Battle of Mona Island are like a world away from his confession today three weeks later. However, the American newspaper reporters were able to express satisfaction with this announcement, and their understanding of naval tactics is truly blind."

### The Three Major Electric Power Companies Will Unify Their Organizations; Electricity Consumption Regulations Changed

Huazhong Water and Electricity, Shanghai Electric Power, and the former French Concession Electric Power Company will unify their organizations within the year.

For the sake of economy, it will announce the "Electricity Consumption Regularization Regulations" from the first of next month, which will be implemented from that day. At the same time, the amount of electricity supplied will be determined in the following order: 1. Direct military industry, 2. Industrial aspects of production expansion, 3. Enterprises, 4. General private enterprises, 5. General consumption.

### Chinese Tobacco Factories Receive a Batch of Tobacco Leaves

Economic Circle

### Commentary: Industrial Economic Policy

Since the independence of the Philippines, it has actively promoted various domestic industrial and economic policies. Recently, the Philippine Minister of Agriculture and Commerce answered questions from a Central News Agency reporter regarding countermeasures to increase the production of essential living materials. Among the plans he explained, the first is a five-year plan to increase food production, the second is to increase the production of general agriculture, fisheries, forestry, animal husbandry, etc., and plans to expand and rectify the rational increase in manufacturing and domestic handicrafts. The third is to solve the price problem that is the basis for promoting these policies and to increase the number of agricultural experiment stations, and plans to increase the production of essential living materials, so as to achieve the goal of Philippine economic self-sufficiency. In general, this is the industrial and economic policy that the Philippines is actively promoting.

The "Wartime Economic Policy Outline" centered on increasing production is our country's industrial and economic policy. We feel that in formulating and implementing various plans, it is necessary to learn from the Philippines to adapt to the domestic environment. Because the Philippines, like China, is also an agricultural country, so in the implementation of its industrial and economic policies, it is necessary to pay special attention to agricultural production, followed by domestic handicrafts, and then the increase in manufactured goods, which is to adapt to the domestic reality, and the steps should be so. We feel that under the call for equal emphasis on agricultural and industrial production, in order to avoid a production trend of "abandoning the fundamental and pursuing the trivial," the country should promptly formulate a large-scale plan to encourage agricultural production as the central target of the wartime economic policy. Recently, all parties have cooperated to promote rural loan work, and a large amount of floating capital in this city has been invested in agriculture, forestry, and animal husbandry, which will reach 10 million yuan in two months, which is a good sign for the industrial and economic circles. Because how to increase food production? How to increase cotton production? How to ensure that the people's food, clothing, and shelter during the war will not be a problem? This is the most urgent, most important, and most worthy of research and discussion today, and even to be put into practice.

### Alternative Argument (Transferred from the First Page)

Those who truly care about the fate of China will never be arrogant because of such "dreams"! From the standpoint of China, no, from the standpoint of the Asian nations, the most important issue at present is to first create the material basis for the prosperity of Asia. That is to say, first seize back the material basis for the prosperity of Asia from the bloody hands of Britain and the United States. If this cannot be done, even if we exhaust our brains to fight for "bourgeois democracy," it will inevitably be a fantasy in the air. Although it is the business of the Asian nations to establish their own preferred political systems, it is unforgivable Asian traitors for the Asian nations to kill each other, and to entrust the common material basis for the prosperity of Asia to the hands of Britain and the United States. In the present era, if Asia is not organized into a "large regional" group of countries, it will never be possible to confront "large regional" groups of countries like Britain and the United States. (The reason why the Soviet Union is prosperous alone is because it is itself a country with a vast territory). In the present era, if Asian countries each sing the praises of "independence and autonomy" without caring about the fate of the entire Asia, then Asia will forever be in the abyss of semi-colonialism and will not be able to turn over. In the present era, the urgent task of China is not only to "complete the bourgeois democratic revolution," but how to dedicate itself to completing the Asian "large regional" group of countries. Regarding this point, the Chinese people's perspective on observing the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War should be changed. The Chinese Communist Party, standing on its own position, has fought to the death with the imperialists for twenty-two years; the Kuomintang, since the beginning of the Republic of China, has also fought with the imperialists for thirty-two years. However, can they, with their own military force alone, drive Britain and the United States out of Asia like the Japanese army drove out Britain and the United States in the two years of the Greater East Asia War? No matter how you advocate verbally, you know very clearly in your heart that you do not have the weapons and technology to bomb the Prince of Wales battleship in 1941. With the military force of Japan, we can seize back the material basis for the prosperity of Asia. Thus, there is an angle to observe the progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War. No matter how you advocate verbally, you are thinking in your heart that without the Greater East Asia War, the independence of the Philippines and Myanmar in 1943 would be impossible. Perhaps you have some arguments about this issue. You may say that the independence that Japan gave to the Philippines and Myanmar is only formal independence. Okay, let's take a step back and assume that what you said about "formal independence" is correct. However, you cannot but admit that even "formal independence" has the fact of promoting substantive independence. You all know that the Chinese government in the first year of the Republic of China was a "formal democratic government," but you cannot but admit that this formal democratic government promoted Chinese democracy much more than the Manchu Qing autocratic government.

Looking back at the Sino-Japanese Incident, we cannot say that there were no major changes in essence during the process from 1937 to 1943. Especially with December 8, 1941 as the turning point, a fundamental change occurred. The progressiveness of the Greater East Asia War is based on the changes in the world situation that broke out at that time. The fate of China is really determined by whether the Chinese rulers can grasp the essential changes in this Greater East Asia War and whether they can adapt to these changes. If the Kuomintang cannot understand this point, then the current problem in Chongqing is as follows:

The current world situation is rapidly changing the relationship between the Kuomintang and the Communist Party in the Chinese anti-Japanese war camp. Now the CCP has even begun an offensive against the Kuomintang in its political activities in various places. If the Soviet Union wins in Manchuria, then the CCP's power will be as solid as a rock.

At the same time, due to the fear of the Communist Party, it is gradually expanding within the Kuomintang, and the power of the anti-Communist peace faction is also growing. Although their struggle with the CCP has already been made public, its tendency will become more and more blatant in the future. At that time, Chiang Kai-shek will no longer be able to maintain the same detached attitude towards this struggle as in the past.

In the end, the Kuomintang will split, one part will run to Japan, and the other part will continue to fight the anti-Japanese war shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese Communist Party, that is, it will be divided into two camps. However, those who continue to fight shoulder to shoulder with the Chinese Communist Party will have to obey the CCP's leadership in the anti-Japanese war at that time. (This phenomenon has already been realized in the areas where the Kuomintang-Communist conflict is the most serious).

The above is the "final fate" of Chongqing that is approaching decision. However, under any circumstances, Chongqing's fate cannot be said to be the "final victory" of the anti-Japanese war. (Translated by Ji) (End of full text)

### Winter Household Hygiene Tips

Harsh winter has arrived. Everyone is wearing layers and layers of thick clothes. At this time, mothers are naturally more concerned about their children's diet and daily life than usual, but some mothers even harm their children because they are too concerned. The following are a few points that housewives should pay special attention to in winter:

Many housewives put coal stoves in the room in winter, which is convenient for both heating and convenience. However, this is a very bad move, because the doors and windows in winter are not very open, which has already made the air very turbid. If you put a coal stove in the room again, it will be even more smoky. Although there is no risk of coal poisoning, it is quite harmful to children's brain nerves.

Do not let children sleep with their heads covered and wear very thick clothes. We should know that sleeping with your head covered is the biggest cause of colds, and wearing thick clothes to sleep is the main element in developing a timid habit.

Mothers are afraid that their children will be cold, so they call them to eat their fill at every meal, but the children do not know that they are asked to eat their fill in order to keep out the cold. They still run and jump as usual, so they do not prevent the cold, but a serious illness has already taken hold. (Cheng Qipeng)
