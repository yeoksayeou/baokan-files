### Opening of the Japanese Extraordinary Diet Session

The 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet officially commenced on the 15th of this month. The session is scheduled to last for three days, from the 16th to the 18th. According to brief reports, the government is expected to present eight proposed laws and three budget proposals. In addition, reports regarding the various aspects of the Greater East Asia War situation from both the Army and Navy are expected. With the session still ongoing, it would be presumptuous to speculate or criticize. However, considering the current situation in East Asia, the convening of this Japanese Extraordinary Diet Session is of utmost importance. We, the people of our nation, who are moving toward the path of completing the Greater East Asia War, should have the most accurate understanding.

The current international situation is quite clear. Both in East Asia and Europe, we are facing the eve of a decisive battle. Both the enemy and our side are strengthening their preparation activities in political, military, and diplomatic aspects, as well as in the economies of their own countries and their allies, in order to prepare for the decisive battle. In Europe, the fierce air battles in the Mediterranean and the increasingly tense situation on the German-Soviet front, as well as the movements of the neutral countries at both ends of the Mediterranean, are drawing the world's attention. However, we can say that all these developments in Europe and the problems arising from them, such as the direction of the neutral countries, the Axis powers' strategies and the strength of their two-front war capabilities, and even the actual trend of the Anglo-American plans to open a "second front," all have a focus that is at least half tied to the situation in East Asia. To get the correct answers to all of the above questions, everyone must look at the situation in East Asia. Despite the Anglo-American rhetoric about "opening a second front" and "landing operations in Europe," they have to allocate the greatest force to consider "Japan's next move." They have to allocate the majority of their troops to reinforce India, and they have to allocate a considerable portion of their naval and air forces to the remote areas of northwestern Australia. They not only lament the strategic weakness of the Chongqing regime but also have to put the largest portion of the entire U.S. military force, even the full strength of the Navy, in the Pacific! In this way, the significant impact of everything Japan does today on the European and even the global war situation is quite evident.

The movements in East Asia will determine the movements in Europe! Today, Japan is shouldering the mission of being the determiner of future history!

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War a year and a half ago, thanks to the loyal and brave combat of the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Army, Navy, and Air Force, and also thanks to the awareness and cooperation of the oppressed peoples of East Asia for the anti-Anglo-American war, we have already achieved unprecedented great war results in history. In military and political aspects, we have gradually formed a system that is certain to win. At the same time, we are actively advancing the foundational work of the Greater East Asia construction. At this time of facing a decisive battle, the convening of the 82nd Japanese Diet session and the reports of Prime Minister Tojo and the Army and Navy ministers will not only be valued by the Japanese subjects and the East Asian nations but also be observed with interest by the neutral countries, the Axis countries in Europe, and even the enemy countries of Britain and America. At the same time, the resolutions of the three supplementary budget proposals and the eight government-proposed bills will have a significant impact on the future of East Asia and the global war situation.

According to the announcement by the Japanese Information Bureau on the 14th of this month, the supplementary budget for the general accounting and special accounting of the Showa 18th year (1943) has reached 620 million yen in both revenue and expenditure. The total budget has exceeded 13.8 billion yen (13.895 billion yen), and the deficit bonds in the financial resources are only 313.22 million yen. Including the additional issuance of railway bonds, the total amount of bonds issued this year is over 21.86 billion yen. This huge budget of Japan fully demonstrates the characteristics of a "decisive battle budget." Because looking at the content of the supplementary budget, (A) General Accounting: Ministry of Home Affairs 4 million yen, Ministry of Finance 3 million yen, Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry 491 million yen, Ministry of Commerce and Industry 63 million yen, Ministry of Health and Welfare 57 million yen, totaling 620 million yen; (B) Special Accounting: Korean Government-General 140 million yen, Korean Food Management 368 million yen, Taiwan Government-General 43 million yen, Taiwan Rice Export Management 16 million yen, National Debt Consolidation Fund 420 million yen, Public Debt Fund 440 million yen, Imperial Railway 2 million yen. (The figures below one million yen are not included, according to the Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 14th of this month, Continental News on the 15th). Combining these items and figures, it can be said that it is entirely focused on increasing war power, consolidating enterprises, and thoroughly increasing food production expenses.

As for the government's side, the eight bills proposed by the government for construction have not been announced, but according to the Tokyo dispatch from the Allied News Agency on the 14th of this month, it has been clearly reported that their main purpose is to strengthen and enrich the national decisive battle system. Looking back since the 81st Diet session this spring, the authorities of our friendly nation of Japan have implemented a new policy toward China externally, strengthening the cooperation system of the three axis countries of China, Japan, and Manchukuo in East Asia, and furthermore, towards the southern countries, starting with Burma and the Philippines, forming a solid cooperation to carry out the Greater East Asia War and liberation cooperation; internally, they have strengthened the position of the Cabinet and strengthened the national unity system. Today, facing the major situation of the decisive battle, there is no doubt that the 82nd Diet will further carry out the spirit of the past, consolidate the unity of the 100 million Japanese citizens and the 1 billion East Asian peoples, and create a steel chain to defend East Asia in the decisive battle phase. We firmly believe that in this session of the Diet, the seamless integration of the Japanese government and the Imperial Rule Assistance Association and the unity of the Japanese government and the people will enable the Diet to express a strong force, and will also have better and more exciting revelations for the unity of China, Japan, and the East Asian nations.

We firmly believe that the 82nd Japanese Diet will achieve unprecedented results. What we hope is that at the beginning of this decisive battle phase, the government and the people of China can further unite and become a main force in the East Asian decisive battle, and more effectively cooperate with friendly nations and East Asian nations to overcome all difficulties and move towards final victory.

### Prime Minister Tojo Delivers Policy Speech Articulating the Beliefs Held by the Japanese Government Resolves to Lead the Entire Nation in Striving for Final Victory and to Advance Hand in Hand with China Towards Common Goals

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Japanese Diet held its opening ceremony this morning. The House of Peers and the House of Representatives held plenary sessions at 2:00 PM and 4:00 PM respectively, during which Japanese Prime Minister Tojo delivered policy speeches in both houses, expounding to China and the outside world the beliefs of the Japanese government. He first described the current stage of the Greater East Asia War, publicly explaining the current state of Greater East Asia construction, the movements of various countries and nations within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the overall picture of the new policies Japan has adopted in response. Finally, he expressed the Japanese government's determination to lead the entire nation in exerting all efforts to advance courageously on the path to completing the war. The gist of the Prime Minister's speech is recorded as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been exactly a year and a half. Our soldiers have occupied and secured vast areas under the Emperor's august authority, achieving glorious victories. I would like to take this opportunity to join you in expressing our heartfelt gratitude to the soldiers on the front lines for their tireless efforts and heroic fighting. However, many warriors have sacrificed their lives for the country to establish this glorious achievement, becoming guardian deities of the nation. In particular, the heroic death of Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, on the front lines in the South, and the tragic death of Commander Yamazaki and his soldiers on Attu Island are most inspiring to our nation. Every Japanese citizen, whenever they recall the tragic death of these many loyal and righteous soldiers, is determined to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs and continue to move forward. Our country has such warriors, and we have people who are willing to follow in the footsteps of the martyrs, so we will surely achieve final victory in the Greater East Asia War. While I cherish the achievements of Marshal Yamamoto and all the fallen soldiers and mourn them, I am even more determined to advance on the path to defeating Britain and America to console the souls of the martyrs in heaven. Now, under the Emperor's august authority, our country has established a strategically certain-to-win posture in various regions of Greater East Asia, and this posture is being strengthened day by day. The abundant resources of Greater East Asia are also being rapidly developed to strengthen our war power. Our country's establishment of this posture in East Asia will quickly seize the lifeline of Britain and America. Therefore, Britain and America are deeply shocked to see our country's rapid development in Greater East Asia. In order to stop us, they have used all the material forces they rely on and have exhausted all their plans by any means. They have repeatedly tried to counterattack, but they do not know that this has long been anticipated by our country. Our country has taken advantage of these counterattack opportunities of the enemy to defeat them anytime and anywhere, and has also taken measures to make the enemy surrender. Currently, our army has launched large-scale operations in China, on the Indian-Burmese border, and in the Pacific, and will inflict heavy damage on the enemy. Therefore, the war situation will become more and more important, and the battles will become more and more heroic. Therefore, this is the time for our 100 million citizens to face the national crisis together, with the belief of certain victory, and to display the traditional spirit of loyalty and valor of the people. In order to adapt to the above situation, you and I must clearly point out the deep-seated suffering of Britain and America. With the certainty of victory, we will resolutely exert all our efforts to win the final victory in the spiritual war until Britain and America surrender, so as to ease the Emperor's concerns. Currently, looking at the trends in Greater East Asia, the trust of various countries and nations in Japan and the sincere assistance they are automatically providing for the completion of the Greater East Asia War are increasing day by day. I recently visited the Republic of China, Manchukuo, and the Philippines, and personally witnessed the current situation in various places, and held frank talks with the authorities of various countries. This has made my conviction even stronger. Japan's unwavering policy is to liberate the entire Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and America forever and restore our original identity. Japan's policies have consistently been based on this established policy and have been moving forward to this day. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, it has been a year and a half. Today, 1 billion people in Greater East Asia have understood Japan's true intentions and are convinced that if the Greater East Asia War is not completed, East Asia will not be liberated, and the new order in Greater East Asia will not be established, and the nations of Greater East Asia will have no happiness to speak of. This conviction is now growing stronger and stronger, which is truly worthy of celebration for Greater East Asia. In order to cope with the above situation and respond to the sincerity and assistance of various countries and nations, Japan believes that it is necessary to implement its policies at this time. Now, I would like to frankly inform you of the beliefs held by the government regarding the main points. Speaking of Manchukuo, that country and our country are friendly nations. His Majesty the Emperor has personally set an example, and the people of that country have unanimously assisted our country in both material and spiritual aspects and have contributed greatly. Our country has also assisted that country in making sound development. The friendship between Japan and Manchukuo is extremely close. Speaking of the Republic of China, officials and civilians throughout the country are all working in their respective positions under the leadership of President Wang. I am deeply grateful for the sincere attitude they have taken towards our country. Now, in the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, they are joining hands with our country and advancing towards the completion of common goals. Our friendly nation, the Republic of China, has suffered from the invasion of Britain and America for hundreds of years and has experienced countless hardships. But now it has broken free from its shackles and is striving for self-reliance, and with the qualifications of a completely autonomous and independent nation, it is cooperating with our country and wants to fully exert its strength in the construction of Greater East Asia. This is because the long-cherished wish and dream of the Chinese people have been realized. Recently, generals such as Pang Bingxun, Sun Dianying, and Rong Ziheng, as well as many other people, have successively defected from the Chongqing side and supported President Wang. This has fully demonstrated the natural trend of China's revival. Our friendly nation, China, has achieved this kind of prosperity, which is worthy of celebration for the future of China, Greater East Asia, and the entire human race. At this time, our country, in addition to sincerely congratulating our friendly nation China on this rise, has also decided to double its support in the future, and plans to fundamentally revise the treaties concluded between China and Japan, so that the cooperative relationship between the two countries will be even closer. Secondly, regarding Thailand, that country has now cleared up the complex and delicate relationship with Britain and America for many years, and has resolutely joined hands with the Empire. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, it has overcome many obstacles and difficulties and has stood up and worked hard to complete the Greater East Asia War. I deeply respect this. The Empire also hopes that its cooperation with that country will become closer and closer in the future, and is willing to make further efforts in the military, economic, and cultural aspects of that country. In view of the long-cherished wish of the people of that country, it is specially stated that it has decided to devote its efforts to helping the development of that country. Also, regarding Burma, in March of this year, our government invited Chief Minister Ba Maw to Japan to convey the Empire's decision. As a result, we were able to understand the sincere determination of Chief Minister Ba Maw and other leaders regarding Burma's independence and cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, and on May 8th, the Burmese Independence Preparatory Committee was formed to actively carry out all preparations for independence. This is indeed deeply gratifying. I deeply hope that it will complete its preparations soon so that the glorious day of history will come soon. Again, regarding the Philippines, the leaders such as Governor Vargas of the Philippines are working hard to rebuild the Philippines and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War, and the general public is also gradually understanding the Empire's true intentions and actively cooperating. The Empire's attitude towards the independence of the Philippines has been detailed in previous government statements, but the Empire has decided to go a step further and grant the Philippines the honor of gaining independence this year, and hereby announces this to China and the outside world. The Philippine people, who previously had only the illusion of independence under American rule, have now fulfilled this long-cherished wish less than two years after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. I think of the gratitude of the Philippine people and am truly happy for the future of the Philippines and the future of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, the residents of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and other places are cooperating seriously under the Imperial Army's military administration, and this cooperation is increasing day by day. Even under the war, they have been liberated from the mental oppression of the past under the Imperial Army's well-intentioned guidance, and now they have received education and other cultural benefits and are living a life full of hope. This is truly gratifying for the Indonesian people. The Empire hereby wishes to go further and, according to the wishes of the indigenous people, adapt to the local conditions and gradually implement measures for the indigenous people to participate in politics this year. Among them, for Java, in view of the level of its people, it has decided to make it as possible as to meet the wishes of the people. Regarding Vietnam, the Vietnamese authorities have handled the situation quite well under complex circumstances. The Empire, based on the spirit of the Franco-Japanese Agreement on Joint Defense, is seeking to strengthen its cooperation with Vietnam. As mentioned above, the great ideal of our nation's founding, which is to enable all nations to live in harmony and all people to live in peace, has been realized step by step in the Greater East Asia region. The East Asian nations, which have been suffering from the insatiable exploitation of Britain and America for many years, have now obtained the glorious dawn. In the midst of this vigorous development of various countries and nations in Greater East Asia, only India is still suffering under the cruel suppression of Britain in order to achieve independence. I deeply sympathize with this from the bottom of my heart, and I am especially moved with great emotion. The Empire has a firm determination to use all possible means to drive the enemies of the Indian people, the British and American forces, out of India and complete India's independence. Therefore, we are convinced that the surging aspirations of the Indian people will be realized, and the forces of Britain and America will be driven out. I firmly believe that the day of India's freedom and prosperity is not far away, and I especially hope that this day will come soon. Now, looking at the European situation again, the unity between the allied nations such as Germany and Italy and the Empire is becoming more and more solid, and they are advancing together towards final victory. I am convinced that the allied nations of Germany and Italy will succeed in their magnificent wars, which they are conducting under their established position of certain victory and their unwavering leadership. The Empire also vows to thoroughly destroy Britain and America together with close ties and assistance in the future. Now, Britain and America, for their own purposes, are using any means to disturb peace everywhere, expand disasters, and try their best to drag neutral countries into the vortex of war. After luring other countries to fight with them, Britain and America themselves want to avoid directly suffering the tragic consequences and only let other countries serve as their sacrifices. Once they win the war, they will regard them as worn-out shoes and abandon them. All the declarations and treaties they have made will be regarded as waste paper and will be wiped out. What they used to call thinking for the sake of small and weak countries and supporting their independence has now turned into thinking for the sake of big countries and advocating their autocratic rule. There is no integrity in between, and they only know how to sacrifice other countries to seek their own comfort. It can be said that they are shameless. For this kind of tyranny, gods and men alike will abandon them. Also, we hereby express our respect to those countries that have not been moved by the British and American conspiracies and still maintain their neutrality. Japan currently maintains extremely friendly relations with these neutral countries and is becoming even closer. The situation at home and abroad is very important at the moment. Under this important situation, 100 million Japanese citizens are re-energizing their fighting spirit in their respective positions, taking the hearts of the soldiers on the battlefield as their own hearts, exerting all their efforts, re-swearing, and advancing towards the completion of the war. At this critical moment, the government has decided to stand at the forefront of the 100 million citizens in order to ensure that this renewed vow will surely be put into practice. In order to ensure victory in the war and success in construction, and in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, the government will resolutely break through and overcome any hindrance or obstacle, whether domestic or foreign. Fortunately, thanks to the enthusiasm and efforts of the people, the current situation of domestic production has shown significant improvement and enhancement since the end of last year. However, the government is still working with the public to enhance the decisive battle posture, and is concentrating all its efforts as a nation to enhance its war power. The purpose of the government's request to convene this extraordinary session of the Diet and to submit the budget proposals and bills on consolidating enterprises and urgently increasing food production is based on the above intention. The purpose of this consolidation of enterprises under the decisive battle is to more rapidly enhance direct war power, so we are expanding the purpose of past enterprise consolidation and implementing thorough consolidation in various sectors of industry, so that all citizens can contribute to enhancing war power. In addition, in order to operate the administration quickly and decisively, the government will also suspend or abolish all enterprises that are not directly related to the prosecution of the war, so that the government and the people can jointly exert all their efforts to engage in production in order to move towards victory.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) The plenary session of the House of Peers of the Japanese Diet was held at 2:00 PM on the 16th, during which Prime Minister Tojo delivered a policy speech, followed by Minister of the Army Tojo, concurrently, and Minister of the Navy Shimada, who reported on the war situation of the Army and Navy since last December respectively. A resolution of thanks to the Army and Navy was passed, and the session was adjourned at 3:56 PM.

Tojo and Shimada Report on the War Situation of the Japanese Army and Navy

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) Minister of the Army Tojo, concurrently, reported on the war situation of the Army at both the House of Peers and the House of Representatives of the Japanese Diet, stating briefly: Regarding the Aleutian Islands, since the Japanese Army and Navy units launched a surprise attack on and occupied the Aleutian Islands last June, the enemy was greatly shocked, because at least, this allowed several divisions of enemy ground forces, 600-700 aircraft, and other powerful fleets of aircraft carriers and battleships to be contained in the eastern Aleutians. Moreover, the enemy gradually advanced its base westward, and in February, it established an airfield on Amchitka Island east of Kiska Island. It is currently guarded by the Army, and large aircraft can take off and land. The enemy has also dispatched aircraft and fleets to cut off the Japanese supply routes in an attempt to isolate the Japanese garrison in the western Aleutians. The Japanese garrison, on the one hand, has been subjected to daily air raids by enemy aircraft, and on the other hand, has been responsible for the defense of the isolated island in the open sea for a year. On May 12th of this year, the enemy took advantage of the dense fog to land on Attu Island from the north, south, and east, and Commander Yamazaki and his unit were completely annihilated. This unparalleled spirit of loyalty of the Japanese army is enough to amaze the world and chill the enemy's courage.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) Minister of the Navy Shimada reported in detail on the war situation of the Japanese Navy in (1) the Indian Ocean, (2) the North Pacific, and (3) the South Pacific at the 82nd Extraordinary Session of the Diet convened today. He strongly stated that the Japanese army should not hesitate to make sacrifices and should actively fight to achieve the final victory.

### Zhou Fohai Arrives in Guangdong and Gives a Speech to Reporters, Expressing Great Excitement at Witnessing the Flourishing Atmosphere

Guangzhou, 16th (Central News Agency)

Zhou Fohai, Deputy President of the Executive Yuan and Minister of Finance of the National Government, recently flew from the capital to this city. He met with reporters and delivered the following speech:

It has been seventeen years since I left Guangzhou in the fifteenth year of the Republic. Coming here, to the cradle of the revolution, I am filled with immense emotion. Our Founding Father, Mr. Sun, indicated to us that the purpose of the National Revolution was to seek freedom and equality for China, and to achieve this goal, it was necessary to abolish the unequal treaties. Since China declared war on England and the United States on January 9th of this year, the unequal treaties that England and the United States had previously imposed on our country have naturally been canceled. Furthermore, with our friendly nation Japan taking the lead in automatically declaring the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, followed successively by Italy and other countries, the goal that the Founding Father had sought to achieve for more than forty years of revolution has thus been accomplished. At this time when the revolutionary goal has been achieved, returning to Guangzhou, the cradle of the revolution, my heartfelt joy and excitement cannot be described with words or writing. In recent years, due to the efforts of the provincial government authorities and the enthusiastic assistance from various quarters of friendly nations, Guangdong's construction has been steadily improving. The Chairman is extremely pleased, and my colleagues in the central government are extremely admiring. This time, I have returned and witnessed the flourishing atmosphere in all aspects, and I am even more excited and grateful for the painstaking efforts of the provincial government authorities and various quarters of friendly nations.

### Chongqing and the U.S. Conclude Military Tribunal Agreement

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency)

According to news from Chongqing, Chongqing and the United States recently concluded a military tribunal agreement. The main content is that criminal cases committed by U.S. military personnel stationed in Chongqing will be tried and handled by the U.S. court-martial or court-martial authorities. The right of trial for criminal cases committed by Chongqing military personnel stationed in the United States also belongs to Chongqing. Superficially, both parties enjoy equal rights, but the United States had previously publicly announced the abolition of extraterritoriality, and then concluded a military tribunal agreement. The inconsistency and cunning intention are self-evident. It is truly heartbreaking that Chongqing is willing to be deceived and remains unaware.

### Revolution Breaks Out in Honduras, Opposing the President's Surrender to the U.S.; If the Government Cannot Control the Situation, the U.S. Will Send Troops to Assist

Milan, 16th (Central News Agency)

Stefani Agency reports, according to the New York Times quoted by the "Sera" newspaper, a revolution has broken out in the department of Choluteca, Honduras, Central America. Its leader is General Davila. It is said that Davila openly opposes the Honduran President's attitude of surrendering to the United States. It is said that Davila has raised an army in Choluteca in the south, and the leader of the opposition party, Umano, has also led armed troops to land in the Tela area. Both departments have declared martial law. The most noteworthy development yesterday was that Honduran government planes strafed a British coast guard patrol boat with machine guns in the Gulf of Hartgette because the Honduran government believed that Umano launched the rebellion in British Honduras, so it retaliated against the British side. The New York Times emphasized that the White House is still adopting a completely reserved attitude, but in Washington, it is generally believed that if the Honduran government is unable to control the situation, the United States will send troops to assist.

### Soviet Attempts to Attack the Left Flank of the Kuban Bridgehead Fail Twice; German Fleet Attacks the Sea of Azov, Inflicting Heavy Losses on the Soviets

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, declared that on Sunday, a fierce Soviet attack on the left flank of the Kuban bridgehead had been defeated. At dawn, Soviet artillery heavily bombarded the main defensive positions of the German grenadiers. An hour later, Soviet infantry followed up the attack, but were forced to retreat due to intense German defensive fire. Several hours later, the Soviets added reinforcements and attacked again, but also suffered heavy losses and retreated, leaving behind more than a thousand corpses. After suffering two failures in a row, the Soviets changed their strategy and no longer attacked in this section. Only localized warfare occurred in the northeast corner of the Orel River bend. German artillery destroyed five Soviet T-34 tanks. The remaining sections of the Eastern Front were generally quiet. German air activity was significantly hindered by bad weather, but its bomber squadrons were still able to attack railways and factories in the Soviet rear. In addition, German bombers and dive bomber groups attacked Soviet troop concentrations and supply lines northeast of Novorossiysk. Soviet heavy artillery and anti-aircraft positions north of Krymskaya, as well as ships on the sea near Temryuk, were also bombed. Another German bomber squadron attacked railways and airfields in various regions of the North Caucasus. The airfield at Maykop suffered the most damage. Airfields and supply states in the Soviet interior, as well as the railway lines from Starobelsk to Voroshilovgrad, Ryazhsk to Svoboda, and Artyomovsk to Valuyki, were all heavily bombed by German aircraft. Countless vehicles and locomotives were destroyed or damaged.

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

On the 14th, at dawn, the German fleet once again attacked the port of Akhtari in the Sea of Azov, launching a fierce attack on the port facilities and the Soviet convoy in the port. After a fierce naval battle with the intercepting Soviet fleet, it inflicted significant damage and repelled them. The German fleet continued to bombard, and fires broke out in many places in the city of Akhtari and the port facilities. After achieving brilliant results, the German fleet returned to base.

### Turkish Prime Minister's Speech: Continuing to Maintain Neutrality

Ankara, 15th (Central News Agency)

Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu delivered a speech at the closing of the People's Party Congress tonight, stating that the Turkish policy of neutrality established by the late President Kemal has spared the country from the ravages of war. It will continue to be maintained and adhered to unswervingly. In the past four years, our country has faced the danger of war several times, but has been able to avoid it due to the implementation of the late President's sound policies. Turkey's policy of neutrality is to maintain fair friendship with both warring countries. When Germany showed goodwill to us from the Balkans, we signed a non-aggression and friendship treaty with it. This treaty stemmed from the sincere wishes of Turkey and Germany, and various facts have proven that it truly meets the real needs of both countries. This treaty continues to benefit both parties. We also welcome the Soviet Union's efforts to improve relations with us. We have also concluded a friendly agreement with the United States to strengthen bilateral relations, and have signed a treaty of alliance with the United Kingdom. The policy of neutrality has saved us from being drawn into the whirlpool of war. For this reason, we are very optimistic about the future.

### German Political Circles Believe Italy Has Abundant Resources and Will Never Be Defeated; The Italian Emperor Inspects Bombed Areas

Berlin, 16th (Central News Agency)

According to the German News Agency, diplomatic circles here say that Berlin is deeply impressed by the Fascist Party's resolution to fight to the end, considering it one of the most important declarations in modern Italian history. German political figures believe that those who know the Italian people well and have paid attention to their development in recent decades can infer the enormous resources of Italy developed after the Fascist Party came to power, and believe that the Fascist Party's resolution can prove that a nation with this kind of quality will never be defeated.

On Tuesday, Pope Pius XII received the Bishop of Spezia and listened to a report on the recent bombing of Spezia by the anti-Axis air force. Also, Italian Emperor Emmanuel III inspected the devastation in the bombed areas of Spezia on Monday and arrived in Leghorn the next day to continue inspecting the areas destroyed by anti-Axis bombs.

### Military Management Implemented in Portuguese Coal Mines

Lisbon, 16th (Central News Agency)

A Havas correspondent states that, according to the law promulgated on February 17 of this year, all coal mines in São Pedro da Cova and Pidurido have been mobilized and placed under military management starting on Monday. According to the law promulgated on February 17, all important enterprises are to be classified under military management, with the aim of providing the Portuguese army with sufficient manpower and production. At that time, it was generally believed that this new law would be implemented in labor disputes and strike movements, but in fact, it is now being implemented for the first time to protect workers and increase the efficiency of miners, which is unexpected. It is reported that the previous management of the mines currently under military management was extremely poor, resulting in a monthly decline in output. The sanitary conditions of the workers were very poor, and the safety equipment was also incomplete. Now that the mines are directly under the management of the Army, all equipment will be improved. The miners all hope that this will develop a new work ethic to increase production. Although there is a shortage of grain in northern Portugal, the workers will be provided with meals by the factory, with quantities almost indistinguishable from military rations. In addition, the workers will be provided with uniforms by the factory, which is believed to boost morale.

### Japanese Youth Corps Launches Various Activities to Strengthen National War Effort

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency)

Since its official establishment in January of Showa 16 (1941), the Japanese Youth Corps has been carrying out activities based on two major goals. The first is to strengthen the inseparable relationship with school education and, according to the national youth policy, clarify that all extracurricular life should be provided with essential moral training. The second is to complete the unified organization of youth throughout the country, sweeping away the past liberalist divisions among various groups, in order to establish a consistent training system for boys and girls. Since then, for more than two years, youth training has achieved considerable results. The Japanese Youth Corps is composed of the headquarters and local branches. The headquarters is responsible for controlling and guiding the local branches throughout the country. The local branches are organized into prefectural groups, municipal medical groups, and village/town groups. The basic organizational unit, the unit group, is the most important and can be divided into three parts: the Youth Corps, the Girls' Youth Corps, and the Boys' Corps. The Youth Corps and Girls' Youth Corps of the former youth schools and the Boys' Corps are centered on the national schools and organized according to the areas of their advanced studies, with the principals of the youth schools and national schools serving as the heads of the groups, mobilizing the guiding forces in the area and leading them. According to current surveys, there are 17,523 Youth Corps, 16,457 Girls' Youth Corps, and 18,651 Boys' Corps, with a total membership of approximately 13.29 million. Members are divided into ordinary members and cadre members. Ordinary members are students of youth schools and youths from 14 to 21 years old. Cadre members are cadres of the Youth Corps from 21 to 25 years old, who are filled with appropriate instructors. The Youth Corps focuses on training based on the current state of conscription and the importance of youth school education. Ordinary members are the direct targets, while cadre members guide those who come after them as youth instructors, so that the entire Youth Corps can automatically exert the will of the youth themselves. The Girls' Youth Corps is composed of female students of youth schools and unmarried women from 14 to 25 years old. Recently, girls from general girls' schools and higher girls' schools have also participated, and the number of members is expected to increase dramatically.

### Miscellaneous Thoughts While Traveling in Beiping Four Times

— Zhou Fohai

Reprinted from "Ancient and Modern Bi-monthly" Issue No. 25

I have been to Beiping a total of four times. However, each time I only stayed for two weeks, or as little as six or seven days. Therefore, I really cannot talk about observing and understanding Beiping. What is recorded in this article are just some miscellaneous feelings that arose from each trip to the north.

The first time I went to Beiping was in the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, when the Northern Expedition was completed. I have already mentioned it in my article "Having Read the Prosperous Yuan, I Have Exhausted the Vicissitudes of Life". At that time, my spirit was high, my interest was strong, and my hopes were great, I was truly unparalleled. After offering sacrifices to the spirit at Biyun Temple and reporting the completion of the Northern Expedition, I held a grand dinner party at the Foreign Affairs Building. All the main cadres of the four groups attended, and the four commanders-in-chief all gave speeches with great pleasure. This grand occasion is still vivid in my mind. Three years ago, during my third visit, and this year during my fourth visit to Beiping, friends from the North China Political Affairs Commission also hosted banquets for me at the Foreign Affairs Building. Closing my eyes and meditating, I felt as if I were in the midst of that grand gathering back then. However, times have changed, and everything is different, which truly evokes a feeling of extreme desolation and bitterness!

When we first arrived, we stayed in the detached palace next to Biyun Temple. Li Zi, Bu Lei, and Li Fu and I shared a room. We all loved to have fun, so at night we would sneak into the city to open a hotel, and naturally, local friends would arrange everything for us. Li Zi and Bu Lei were addicted to mahjong, so they could be satisfied by having a few players play mahjong in the hotel. Li Fu and I neither played mahjong nor were we young and active, so we went from house to house for guerrilla-style tea gatherings. At dawn, the four of us would sneak out of the city and return to Biyun Temple. Later, Mr. Chiang also moved into the city, which made it even more convenient for us, because at that time we were all staff members, and we were not afraid of others criticizing any romantic behavior, and others would not criticize us. After having enough tea gatherings in Beiping, Li Fu and I took two days off to go to Tianjin. Because we were afraid that the people from the local party headquarters would find out and invite us to give lectures, we kept it secret. After checking into the hotel, the two of us went out and called two rickshaws, saying that we were going to a tea garden. The rickshaw pullers took us to a low-class place, with a foul smell, which made us both laugh and cry. After finally finding our way, we were found out by the comrades from the provincial party headquarters, and as a result, we were still dragged to give a lecture once. The comrades from the party headquarters wanted to send us on the train, so Li Fu and I secretly discussed letting them send us to the second station and then taking the train back to Tianjin from Beiping. However, because the holiday was over, it was never implemented. However, the high level of interest at that time can be imagined. "Heroes grow old and their ambitions are in vain." The heroic spirit of those years has now disappeared. Therefore, I also feel that my vitality has temporarily diminished.

The first time I went to Beijing, I naturally wanted to visit the Forbidden City. There were too many people visiting together that time. In addition to the four of us, Li Zongren, Bai Chongxi, Zhang Zhizhong, Liu Zhenhua, and others were also together. Mixed in with the large crowd, I could not carefully observe according to my personal wishes, but only took a cursory look.

When we arrived at the three main halls, everyone thought they were great and solemn. At that time, I felt that this was a method used by ancient people to rule the people. If one person rules many people, they must make this person rich in mystery and color, in other words, they must make them deified. Because everyone is human, why should one person give orders and many people obey? Why can some people control others, and some people must be controlled? Before the development of modern legal concepts, these ruling relationships must be made very mysterious, and to be mysterious, one must rely on the arrangement of the environment. Moreover, no matter how great a person is, those who are close to him will definitely not feel that he is great. Qin Shihuang, Genghis Khan, and Napoleon, no matter how great they are, their close attendants, especially their wives, respect them far less than people who are not close to them worship them. Therefore, if their environment is not arranged to be solemn and mysterious, so that the general public feels that they are great and that they are sacred and inviolable, the relationship of rule will be shaken. From entering the Meridian Gate, you have to walk until you are out of breath before you reach the main hall, which is to first make you feel that the emperor is like being in the sky, so that you feel that it is right to bow your head and obey him. This is not only the case with the court at that time, but even a county yamen, from the gate to the main hall, has such a considerable distance. These principles were studied a lot at that time. Unfortunately, after the Republic of China, these mysterious methods were swept away. When I say this, some people will definitely scold me for having a bureaucratic mentality and feudal thinking. In fact, it is not like that. No matter how democratic it is, the system and ceremony are always indispensable. The United States can be regarded as a democratic country, but when their president goes out, he is always surrounded by police cars making strange noises. People who have not been to the United States must have seen it in movie news. What is the difference between this and the gongs and drums that used to be used to clear the way in China? What is the difference between this and the tall "Quiet" and "Avoid" signs that officials used to carry when they went out? As for the solemnity and mystery of Stalin's residence and actions, there is no need to say more. Therefore, making the ruler a little more mysterious and making the place where he lives and sleeps a little more solemn may not be completely unnecessary in politics. Looking at the solemn and majestic palaces, I could not help but think to myself. At that time, I also felt regret that I was not born a few decades earlier and had not tasted the experience of "attending court." The year I started learning to write articles, the imperial examination was abolished. I have never tasted the taste of science and always felt regret. At that time, after seeing the prosperity of the court, I added another regret. However, if the imperial system were restored and I were called to the Hall of Mental Cultivation to attend court, would it be enjoyable? This is also impossible. Because the mysterious coat has been taken off once, and if you put it on again, it is no longer the original state. The paper tiger has been pierced, so what is the point of pasting it back? These are the boring miscellaneous thoughts that occurred when I visited the various palaces all year round.

Visiting the palace is another feeling. I immediately thought of the prosperity of the concubines and the beauty of the palace maids in those years. Therefore, I felt particularly interested in the relics and legends of the concubines. Thinking of the romantic and beautiful things of the past, I couldn't help but feel fascinated. When Li Houzhu said goodbye to the temple, he did not shed tears for his ancestors, but shed tears for the palace maids. When I visited the palace, I immediately thought of the past events of the palace maids. I thought: If I were an emperor in the feudal era, no one would control me, and I would not be afraid of attacks. To put it mildly, I would definitely be a romantic emperor. To put it badly, I would probably be a monarch who would ruin the country!

The first time I visited the political center for hundreds of years, there were of course many other historical and political feelings. They are dry and tasteless, so there is no need to write them here.

The second time was in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China. This time, I did not have the same interest as the first time. Because at this time, the battle against Gui in Wuhan and the battle against Feng in western Henan had already passed. The First Army and the Second and Fourth Armies had fought each other. The leader of the Third Army, Yan Xishan, retreated to advance, claiming to accompany Feng to go abroad. Our trip to Beiping this time was to keep Yan. Under these circumstances, what kind of interest was there? Leaving aside the political situation, only Bu Lei and I accompanied this time, without Li Zi and Li Fu. Bu Lei was quiet. How could I have fun alone? Therefore, although I also went to places like Hanjiatan and Baishun Hutong this time, it was just social interaction. After the wine and red lights, and after the singing and dancing, I deeply felt that the world was getting worse and worse, and the road ahead was full of thorns.

One feeling I had during this trip to Ping was the greatness of the bureaucratic forces. The so-called bureaucrats refer to administrative officials. When I first came to Ping, there were many bureaucrats left over from the old government, and they were all at a loss. This time, the number of these gentlemen in Beiping has decreased a lot, and they have all gone to Nanjing to participate in the National Government, and many of them are very proud. At that time, there was a saying in Nanjing that "military Northern Expedition, political Southern Expedition." This means that although the National Revolutionary Army has established Youyan, the Beiping bureaucrats have brought the atmosphere of corruption to the new capital in the Southern Expedition. I think this is inevitable, because administrative officials are the basic elements of a government. No matter how wise your political leader is, no matter how suitable your policies and programs are for the needs of the times, without good administrative officials to implement them, everything is just a fantasy, just a piece of paper. The revolutionary party, to be honest, has many heroes from the grass-roots level. Although there are also many students who have studied abroad, most of them can only talk about theory and do not have the experience and training in administrative skills. There are quite a few comrades who can be good political officials, but there are indeed not many who can be good administrative officials. Under these circumstances, the administrative officials left over from the old government will of course rise. At that time, many young comrades of the Kuomintang complained a lot about this phenomenon, thinking that they had risked their lives to fight for the world, but these gentlemen were enjoying the ready-made benefits. In fact, this is not the case. After the Russian Communist Revolution, the technicians and specialists of the Tsarist era were not only still employed, but also treated better. This is an inevitable fact. Who told our revolutionary comrades to only know how to be ambitious and talk about theory, but not to earnestly receive training in administrative skills?

The main purpose of the second trip to Ping was to unite Yan and exclude Feng, but it was not achieved. Before I could do anything, I returned to Nanjing. Yan then issued a telegram of courtesy to the country, inviting Chiang to go abroad. The Central Plains War then broke out.

The third time I went to Beiping was in the twenty-ninth year of the Republic of China, not long after the National Government returned to its capital. At this time, the city walls were still the same, but everything had changed. There is no need to talk about how deep and painful the feelings of the times were. Now, I will only talk about my personal miscellaneous feelings.

After getting off the plane and entering the city through Xizhimen, I saw that all pedestrians were blocked on Lande Road. After passing the intersection of the trams, I saw more than a dozen trams stopped motionless like a long snake. I was very surprised and asked the people who welcomed me, only to find out that the traffic was cut off according to the scheduled time, but my special plane was half an hour late, so the traffic on the street had been cut off for a long time, causing so many trams to stop. For me alone, the citizens of Zhongbei felt such inconvenience. At that time, I was ashamed, apologetic, and uneasy. After that, every time I went out, the roads I passed were still blocked. After repeated requests, it was finally stopped on the third day. However, in front of and behind the car, there were not only two electric mules, shouting and embracing, but also a large truck of armed guards. The local authorities, because of their responsibilities, refused to lift these no matter how much they asked. I said earlier that a responsible person must be mysterious in order to make people respect them. This is generally speaking. If such a method is applied to me, it will really kill me. A few more guards made me feel restless, let alone others. However, more than 30 years ago, even princes and ministers did not completely block traffic when they went out. As a poor student, I was actually able to block traffic in and out of the capital of emperors for hundreds of years, and unconsciously I felt proud, but it was not like this more than 30 years ago, and it was not like this when China was unified, and I really felt that it was not perfect.

This time, I lived in Qin Zhengdian in Zhongnanhai. Opposite was Yingtai, where Dezong was imprisoned. Sleeping in the palace at night, I thought of the Wuxu coup, the disharmony between the two palaces, the tragic life Dezong lived in Yingtai, and the many secret situations in the palace. Thoughts were surging, and I could not fall asleep. Suddenly, I had a whim. If I could live in this place more than 30 years ago, I don't know what the situation would be. Although this place is not a place where ordinary people can live in casually now, I still feel that it would be much better to live here more than 30 years ago.

The fourth time I visited Beiping was in April of this year. Because I had asked my friends from the North China Political Affairs Commission not to give me a grand reception, the traffic was not cut off, but the two electric mules in front of and behind the car were still shouting and embracing. The place where I lived was still Qin Zhengdian. Fortunately, Wang Yitang opened a few rooms for me at the Six Nations Hotel. I saw guests at Qin Zhengdian during the day, and slept at the Six Nations Hotel at night. I like the life of a hotel, and living here is much more comfortable than living in the empty, large, and useless Qin Zhengdian.

The Six Nations Hotel is in Dongjiaomin Lane. This was my first time staying there. Living here, I immediately thought of the situation where the Boxers besieged this place, and I thought of the situation where the Eight-Nation Alliance entered Beijing. Although the capital of that year had been occupied by the Anglo-French Allied Forces once, causing Wenzong to flee to Rehe, China's vitality had not been greatly damaged after all. The Gengzi Incident made China unable to recover. Arriving at this sad place and thinking of the sad past, I felt even sadder. However, as soon as I thought of the national flag of the Blue Sky, White Sun, and Red Earth being able to fly in this area, I immediately turned sadness into joy, and deeply felt that everything depends on human effort, and that shedding a drop of blood can definitely reap the effect of shedding a drop of sweat, and strengthened my determination to fight.

Accompanied by Shu Hui, I went to Biyun Temple to pay homage to the Prime Minister's tomb of clothes and hats, and also visited Yuquan Mountain and the Summer Palace. It was the time when all kinds of flowers were in full bloom, which greatly helped our interest in sightseeing. These places were all old places revisited, and there were no special feelings. Suddenly, I remembered that I had been to Ping several times, but I had never been to Jingshan. This historically sad place must be visited, especially the place where Sizong martyred himself, to pay homage.

Standing at the highest point of Jingshan, you can see the entire panorama of the palace, you can see Beihai and Zhongnanhai, and you can even see the entire city. I liked this place very much and stayed there for a long time before slowly going down the mountain. After passing the place where Emperor Sizong of Ming martyred himself, stroking the ancient trees, I couldn't help but feel sad. Although Sizong was the monarch who died for his country, he was able to die for his country and was unwilling to make the ugly gesture of being a servant serving wine. Hundreds of years later, he is still respected. "I am not the monarch who ruined the country, but the ministers are the ministers who ruined the country." In this painful and simple statement, it can be seen that he was also an emperor who wanted to achieve something. Unfortunately, there was no one to assist him, resulting in such a tragic result. Pondering the ancients and weighing the current situation, I couldn't help but feel chills down my spine!

The food problem in North China is very serious. I heard that hundreds of people starve to death in Beiping every day. Hearing this, I felt sad and heartbroken. I often think that I don't have any special enjoyment, but just eat three meals a day and sleep on one bed at night. Now that I think about it, I am already very lucky. I have three meals a day to eat and don't need to eat grass roots and tree leaves; I have a bed to sleep on at night and don't need to sleep on cement. What is this if not special enjoyment? In the midst of special enjoyment, we must not forget the sufferings of the people. Of course, there are difficulties in the environment and limitations in ability. In the end, how much pain can be relieved for the people in reality and how much welfare can be sought is a question, but the heart cannot but be exhausted. If the heart is exhausted and the strength is not enough, you will not feel guilty to the gods and ashamed of the people. If you don't even think about it, you will have no soul and no heart. I use this to warn myself and encourage myself!

I have been to Beiping four times, and the situation has been different each time. The first time was when the Northern Expedition was completed, and I was most happy. The second time was when the civil war started, and I had no interest. The third time was after the National Government returned to its capital, and I was both sad and happy. The fourth time was after the declaration of war against the United Kingdom and the United States, and I had unlimited expectations for the future. Each time has a different historical background, and each time has different joys and sorrows. I hope that the fifth time I go to Beiping, the internal unification will be completed, and the external peace will be established. The freedom and equality of China sought in the Prime Minister's will will also be fully realized. We will go to Biyun Temple, the Prime Minister's tomb of clothes and hats, and hold another grand sacrificial ceremony!

### Japanese Merchants Discuss Cotton Product Allocation System: Eleven Items Supplied at Low Prices, Possibly Implemented Next Month for Japanese Residents

According to Japanese newspapers, the prices of daily necessities have recently soared, posing a significant threat to people's livelihoods. In Nanjing, the authorities have already allocated four items, including cotton, socks, yukata (bathrobes), and towels, to Japanese residents. In Shanghai, a ticket-based allocation system for items such as rice, charcoal, and sugar has been implemented for Japanese residents. Furthermore, there are hopes to establish consumer cooperatives to ensure the low-priced supply of essential goods. To meet these expectations, various discussions are underway among different industries serving Japanese residents.

Planning Committee Discusses Plans

It is learned that the Japanese Merchants' Cotton Product Association of Central China believes that the price of cotton products has risen the most among daily necessities and has a significant impact on people's livelihoods. Therefore, each related association of Japanese cotton product merchants has selected two members to establish the "Central China Japanese Resident Civilian Cotton Product Allocation Planning Committee." After several discussions, a concrete plan has been established.

Eleven Items Allocated Based on Tickets

As for the allocated cotton products, there are a total of eleven items: (1) towels, (2) plain white cloth, (3) bleached cloth, (4) flannel, (5) cotton yarn and foreign yarn money, (6) gauze, (7) absorbent cotton, (8) cloth socks, (9) Western-style socks, (10) undershirts, and (11) shirts. The above eleven items will be allocated based on tickets. The prices will be half or two-thirds of the market price, similar to Nanjing. It is expected to start in July. This move will have a significant impact on Japanese residents.

### Shanghai Press Association Sends Telegram to Console General Pang Bingxun

The Shanghai Press Association, the only united organization of the city's eight major newspapers, sent a telegram to General Pang Bingxun in Nanjing on the 16th, expressing their welcome and condolences. The original telegram stated: "To General Pang Bingxun, transmitted by the Nanjing Military Commission: We are delighted to learn of your arrival in Nanjing to pay respects to Chairman Wang. General, you resolutely participated in the peace movement because Chongqing's dragging out the war only caused suffering to the people. By shifting the power of dragging out the war to cooperate with Japan in destroying the United Kingdom and the United States, completing the Greater East Asia War, and liberating the Chinese nation, your insight and foresight are deeply admired. However, the responsibility is arduous, and we especially rely on your participation in military affairs, planning and strategizing. We look south with anticipation. We respectfully send a telegram of welcome and hope for your consideration. Shanghai Press Association."

### Special Pass for Nurses to be Issued by Authorities

To facilitate midwifery for nurses who are members of the local Midwifery Association and to prevent incidents of women in labor not receiving timely medical attention, the association recently requested the Public Security Bureau to issue special passes for nurses through the Baojia authorities, allowing them to pass through during curfew. It is heard that the special pass will soon be approved and issued by the authorities.

(2) The sugar required for various business operations will be calculated according to the adjusted new sugar price. (3) For various institutions and organizations that have been approved by the cooperative for special distribution due to special needs, they can purchase the goods with the notice and purchase certificate after paying for the goods to the designated Zhongfu Warehouse "Special Distribution Office."

Fourth Term Cooking Oil to be Sold Soon

The Cooking Oil Industry Wholesale Office recently ordered cooking oil for the fourth term from the military distribution authorities. Among them, 245 tons of soybean oil have already begun to be extracted and will be distributed to retail stores in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, and Pudong in the next few days. However, the delivery of 200 tons of raw oil supplied to the concession area will be delayed by three to five days.

### The Launch of the Fifth Scholarship Aid Campaign – Please, Readers of This Newspaper, Unite in Enthusiastic Support

This newspaper’s advocacy of the scholarship aid campaign is now in its fifth year. Looking back at the past four years, thanks to the enthusiastic support and earnest expectations of society, all of our work has been spared failure, and disadvantaged youths have been able to fulfill their aspirations for education. We should first extend our sincere gratitude to all sectors. As the fifth scholarship aid campaign begins, we ourselves feel the weight of our mission and, filled with boundless hope, dare to express our private thoughts to the warm-hearted individuals in society.

We believe that the scholarship aid campaign has a noble realm, and its profound significance is incomparable to general relief work. The greatest purpose of scholarship aid is to sow seeds of knowledge in society and to cultivate healthy and promising citizens for the next generation. At present, we may not see anything, but its future results will be extremely great. It is like planting trees; when the seedlings are planted, they are truly insignificant, but after several years, they will be verdant and vigorous, reaching straight up to the clouds, unstoppable. Only then will we know that the hard work of cultivation was not in vain. The ancients had a saying, "It takes ten years to grow a tree, but a hundred years to nurture a person." "Nurturing people" is especially an active construction of society, so it has a noble realm. Secondly, our country has never regarded scholarship aid as a charitable act, but confirms that it is a combination of compassion and responsibility. Those who provide scholarship aid do not take pity and charity as their starting point; those who are aided, however, maintain a sense of self-respect and a spirit of striving for progress. What they repay to those who provide scholarship aid is only to seek the promotion and expansion of this compassion and responsibility, and only to seek to help others in the future after gaining self-help, striving to make scholarship aid a fashion, universally extending to all places and all levels. If this can be done, the highest ideal of scholarship aid has been achieved. Therefore, we say that the profound significance of the scholarship aid campaign is incomparable to general relief work.

After the launch of this scholarship aid campaign, what worries us most is that tuition fees in various schools will generally increase next semester. The amount of the increase is currently unknown, but the impact will inevitably cause countless parents and brothers to be unable to afford it, causing their children to drop out of school. At the same time, it is also an inevitable phenomenon that the number of disadvantaged youths who hope for scholarship aid will inevitably increase sharply compared to the previous year. According to the statistics of this newspaper’s past scholarship aid, the number of applicants approved for assistance in the first year was 1,005, with a grant of 33,736.60 yuan; in the second year, 984, with a grant of 51,587.50 yuan; in the third year, 1,223, with a grant of 156,422.50 yuan; and in the fourth year, 1,694, with a grant of 246,016.00 yuan. The number of people approved and the amount of grants have increased rapidly each year. This year, due to the increase in tuition fees in various schools and the eager expectations of disadvantaged youths, the amount of grants we need may be an even larger figure.

Therefore, we earnestly appeal to people from all walks of life to unite and support this scholarship aid campaign. In the past, the cooperation given to us by all sectors was very enthusiastic and moving. We have never used any method to directly solicit donations from the outside world, only relying on a little sincerity and an attitude of impartiality and selflessness to explain to readers the loss of disadvantaged youths to the country and society, hoping that everyone will jointly shoulder this responsibility of scholarship aid. Sure enough, the grants received each time are suitable for our needs and have a surplus. Moreover, we have never considered how to raise funds for the next session. As long as the disadvantaged youths who are well-behaved, motivated, and study hard pass the examination, we will do our best to assist them. Therefore, at the end of each session of grants, there must be little left, and the donations received in the next session are even more enthusiastic than the previous session. We believe that readers are spiritually connected with us, and they will give us supervision and maintenance for the scholarship aid work at any time, and they will definitely give greater sympathy and greater assistance to this scholarship aid.

Due to the increase in tuition fees, one may think of the hardship of teachers. In this turbulent era, the high pressure of life makes everyone breathless, and the suffering of those who work their minds is even greater than that of those who work their bodies. We are determined not to bear to order teachers to teach on an empty stomach and disregard the food and clothing of their families, so everyone unanimously sympathizes with schools increasing tuition fees to improve teachers' salaries. However, there is a most serious problem at present, which is "a teacher changing careers" and "textbook vendors." We know that many specialized teachers cannot maintain their minimum living standards by teaching, so they resign from their positions and engage in other businesses. If they can have ample food and clothing and develop their strengths, it is indeed a good thing for individuals, but it is an irreparable loss for the school's teaching staff. It is necessary to know how much financial resources the country has spent to train an expert teacher. Now that he is engaged in other plans, the school lacks an excellent mentor, and students have no way to relieve their intellectual hunger. This loss is inestimable. As for "textbook vendors," they seek to teach more courses and more hours. During the day, they are busy on the road, regarding lectures as commodities to be sold. Students find it difficult to gain real benefits, and teachers also feel very tired. The above two types of people seem to be undeniable facts. We hope that the school will thoroughly rectify the issue of teachers' salaries after this increase in tuition fees, and strive to ensure that teachers who "change careers" return to their positions, and teachers who "teach concurrently" change to full-time positions. If so, the entire future of education will benefit greatly.

As for the students who apply to this newspaper for assistance, the total number is approximately 5,000 when the four sessions are combined, and the grants used are approximately 500,000 yuan. We do not need to deny this small achievement. We will pay attention to the examination of students' academic performance at any time. Recently, we re-issued forms and asked everyone to fill them out and submit them voluntarily. The purpose is that since the grants are taken from society, whether or not students' academic progress is also a matter of common concern to society, so we have to inquire strictly and take things seriously. What we expect from the aided students is their own awakening, recognizing the times, focusing on reality, not neglecting the responsibilities of the future, not wasting a moment of time, and the way of learning is especially important to get rid of pride and laziness. Only in this way can they advance bravely and vigorously and become a complete talent to serve the country. Mr. Wang Chuanshan once said that scholars take getting rid of pride and laziness as the root of knowledge. Just like climbing a high mountain, climbing one peak will first see the other peak standing above, and looking far away, the highest peak will be in sight early, but in fact, this highest peak is still too high to climb! It can be seen that learning is endless, and we want to use this meaning as a gift of encouragement. In addition, we hope that you will study diligently and practice diligently in addition to reading, and make a lot of hard work in cultivation.

Finally, please, readers who love this newspaper, jointly shoulder this responsibility of scholarship aid, save unnecessary expenses, and donate to this meaningful cause. We should regard these disadvantaged youths as our own children, and everyone should enthusiastically donate to make the scope of scholarship aid more extensive than the previous year, so that disadvantaged youths have the opportunity to study.

### Chairman Wang Benefits the Poor - Mr. Er Yu of Ink Treasure Charity Sale Obtains Piece - Deep Gratitude to This Newspaper for Enthusiastic Support

In April of this year, Chairman Wang of the National Government, at the request of Mr. Zhu Puzhi, President of Gujin Publishing House, personally wrote an article entitled "Stories of Old Friends." President Zhu deeply felt that poor children were in dire need of assistance. Upon the suggestion of Mr. Chen Binhe, President of this newspaper, and with the consent of Chairman Wang, he agreed to sell the world-famous ink treasure to raise money for the scholarship aid fund of this newspaper. Subsequently, Mr. Er Yu Yushifu, a writer from a friendly country, offered a portion of the royalties from his famous book "In and Out of Prison" and wished to obtain this treasure for 60,000 yuan.

### Charity Purchase Price of 60,000 Yuan Received Yesterday

Mr. Er Yu has made many unique contributions to the work of harmony between the people of China and Japan. He recently returned to his country, and we are now receiving the payment from him. His enthusiasm for cultivating Chinese youth is especially worthy of praise. This newspaper's scholarship aid fund has received the assistance of this huge amount of funds, and is deeply grateful for the support of Chairman Wang, President Zhu, and Mr. Er Yu. The students who receive assistance in this session should also pay their respects and thanks.

### Application for the Fifth Scholarship Aid of Shenbao Starts on July 1 - Eagerly Hope Scholarship Funds Are Sufficient for Distribution

The fifth Shenbao Reader Scholarship Aid will begin accepting applications on July 1, as schools have successively held examinations and the summer vacation is approaching. The matter was decided yesterday by the staff of the scholarship aid office after discussion.

Yesterday, the staff of the scholarship aid office discussed and decided the application date for this year's scholarship aid on yesterday afternoon, which is scheduled to begin on July 1. In addition, the staff of each group will be supplemented to ensure that the investigation, selection examination, and review procedures are further improved.

The fund predicts that tuition fees in various schools will increase this year, and the general standard of living has risen repeatedly compared to the previous year. The parents and brothers of poor students will feel that the burden is overwhelming, and they will inevitably increase. The increase in tuition fees and the increase in applicants for assistance will inevitably cause the expenditure of this year's scholarship aid to increase several times compared to the previous year.

The colleagues hope that the colleagues will be aware of the importance of their duties, and they cannot help but call on all sectors of society with this fact, hoping that all sectors will generously donate so that the scholarship aid fund can also have a positive proportion of increasing several times compared to the previous sessions. Then, one more excellent poor student will be admitted to school, and each sector will cultivate one more element of vitality for society.

I am deeply impressed by the enthusiasm. Yesterday, this newspaper received the scholarship aid fund. Mr. Zhao Guangyao of Baofeng Anji Qianzhuang saved 5,000 yuan from the banquet fee, which shows his enthusiasm. Mr. Zhao's letter deeply regretted that the standard of living has increased sharply, and there will be a large group of students who will drop out of school. The words of the benevolent are commendable.

Mr. Er Yu Yushifu, 60,000 yuan

### Judgments in Two Murder Cases

Jin Weigang Case Jiang Lianjiang, a student of Yucaizhongxue School on Shanhai Road, was only sixteen years old, and his classmate Jin Weigang from Pudong was quite close (Jin and Jiang are the same age). Unexpectedly, a crack recently appeared. On the first of this month, Jiang hid a sharp weapon and sneaked into Jin's residence in Room 29, upstairs at No. 89 Jing'ansi Road, and killed Jin with a knife. The judgment was announced, and the main text read: Jiang Lianjiang, also known as Jiang Longxing, committed murder and was sentenced to 15 years of imprisonment. In addition, Jiang Lianjiang and Jiang Jie'an shall be jointly and severally liable to compensate Jin Youming (i.e., the father of the deceased) for the loss of funeral expenses, burial land, tomb construction, memorial service, and miscellaneous expenses of 50,504 yuan in new legal currency, and to pay 100,000 yuan in compensation for mental distress, totaling 150,504 yuan.

Huang Wenbiao Case Huang Huang, a Ningbo woman from No. 73, Lane 1462, Aiduya Road, left behind a son named Wenbiao, who was eight years old. On the morning of the 29th of last month, he was playing at the intersection of Foch Road and Chongqing Road when he was suddenly hit and crushed to death by a No. 22 bus driven by Gong Guiqing from Haimen. Gong was also arrested. Yesterday morning, Gong Guiqing was sentenced to five months of imprisonment for causing death due to negligence, and compensated Huang Huang 4,097 yuan and one jiao for funeral expenses.

### Cigarette Merchants Involved in the Black Market - Allocation Has Been Suspended

The Huazhong Tobacco Allocation Association handles the allocation of goods in three phases per month, limiting each wholesale and retail merchant to sell the goods allocated in each phase evenly in ten days, and absolutely not to hoard or resell for profit. Recently, due to the speculation of speculators, the cigarette black market has rekindled and prices have soared. Some dealers and firms are even involved in black market activities. It is reported that the association has found that some dealers and firms have solid evidence, so it has cancelled the right to allocate goods and suspended the allocation. At the same time, it informed the dealers and firms that if the family members and servants of tobacco retailers violate the instructions, the tobacco retailers must be fully responsible. In addition, it hopes that smokers will report at any time to prevent abuses. As for the eighth phase of allocation, the allocation quantity has been stipulated and has been notified separately.

Short Comment

### Publication of the Tripitaka

The Tripitaka is a Buddhist giant. Our country has had the practice of compiling and printing the Tripitaka in all dynasties. Since the Republic of China, due to the changing political environment and the difficulty of compiling and printing such giants, no one has been able to discuss this. Recently, lay Buddhist Sheng You'an made a grand vow to publish the Tripitaka. Yesterday, he discussed the methods, organized a publication association, and first raised funds for administrative expenses and started to proceed. We are overwhelmed with fragrance and wish for the smooth future and ultimate success of this unprecedented event in Buddhism, academia, and culture.

According to the content of the Tripitaka to be published this time, it will be a collection of scriptures and treatises from the Southern and Northern traditions, encompassing the teachings of the Buddha in his lifetime, and the Southern tradition is especially lacking in the compilations and printings of the past dynasties, which is even more valuable. In addition, it will supplement other important works not recorded in the various Tripitakas, and correct and collate the errors in the printed wood of previous generations and the differences in the meaning of translations. All of these will contribute greatly to academic and cultural contributions.

However, we naturally sincerely expect this arduous work to be accomplished soon. However, precisely because it is too difficult and too huge, it is easy to fall by the wayside if it is not carried out with perseverance and persistence. We not only sincerely hope that lay Buddhist Sheng will start well and end well, and preside over the matter, leaving an immortal page in the history of Buddhist culture, but also hope that those who cooperate with him will work to the end with the same will, so that after a certain period of time, we will be able to meet this new Tripitaka.

Mr. Ye Gongchuo is erudite and has studied the Tripitaka extensively. The opinions he expressed are stable and practical, and are sufficient for the publishing association to pay attention to and refer to. In addition, the publishing association is located in Jing'an Temple, which is a famous ancient temple in this city. A famous temple and a famous scripture complement each other.

### A New Historical Contribution to the Buddhist Community – Compilation and Printing of the Puhui Tripitaka

Since the Song Dynasty, all dynasties in our country have published the Buddhist Tripitaka. Since the founding of the Republic of China, neither the government nor society has discussed this matter. Recently, Sheng You'an initiated the compilation and printing of the Puhui Tripitaka (Puhui is Sheng's Dharma name). In addition to first assisting with 500,000 yuan in administrative expenses, he is actively planning to proceed. Yesterday, he invited Buddhist scholars and celebrities to a meeting at Jing'an Temple. Those who attended included Yuci, Chisong, Zhifeng, Li Sihao, Tao Xiquan, Jiang Zhuzhuang, Ding Fubao, Wu Yunzhai, Chen Binhe, etc., and decided on the compilation plan. In addition to collecting and supplementing important works not recorded in the Tripitakas of the past dynasties, the entire Southern Transmission Tripitaka will also be included. The Southern Transmission Tripitaka was transmitted to South India during the Ashoka period and has never been transmitted to China. This is the first time to translate it. The completion of this plan will be a collection of Buddhist scriptures from the Southern and Northern traditions, which is a creation in the history of Buddhist culture. Yesterday, Ye Gongchuo sent a letter to Tao Xiquan detailing his opinions. The original letter is recorded below:

Ye Gongchuo's Opinion on Compilation and Printing: Shangwu in Guihu, Liang Qie Yichi, Brother Du Men Yang, has not yet reached the people, especially afraid of the reward, because the stomach is weak, going out to eat and drink, will be sleepy for a few days, very painful also, on the sixteenth day, Cheng Gong and Brother You'an invited to a banquet, urgently want to talk, and Wen You'an Brother Xun asked about walking down, the intention is very cordial, especially want to see, but because of the past situation, and these few days, there is a small cold, did not dare to go out, apologized very much, Wei Wen Jing'an's meeting, is about the Puken Tripitaka to proceed, this is the first grand event in thirty years of the Republic of China, heard the dance, brother to the Tripitaka of the past dynasties, research has been, privately constant said that the Song, Yuan, Ming, Qing, Liao, Jin dynasties, there is no mention of the compilation and printing of the Buddhist Tripitaka, the Republic of China alone no one mentioned, is the shame of the country, had spoken to Dai Li Wang Yiting, very thought it was so, has not been mentioned also. Song Zhihuang Fusi Creek Wanshou, Qisha of the Ming Dynasty, five kinds of Tripitaka, all not fake national power, Youweng this move, enough to succeed the predecessors, only when this environment changes dramatically, to make this matter to the end, we must first have a meticulous plan, otherwise it is easy to give up halfway, turn things around, and violate the original wish. Stealing this matter first should first determine the compilation outline, the second according to the outline, determine the budget, today's compilation and printing of the Tripitaka, such as following the old Tripitaka of the past, there is no need to do this again. It is said that some people advocate that the Daizheng Tripitaka should be checked and collated, which is a laborious and thankless move, because the five kinds of Tripitaka on which it is based, I still have no original (Liza cannot be obtained), not to mention that there is another basis to correct its errors. In my opinion, today's compilation of the Tripitaka in the Republic of China has a very important point, that is, to collect the lost and dispersed books of the Tripitaka in China before. According to the lost and dispersed books of the Tripitaka, there are no more than a few reasons, one because the emperor is correcting the official or the monk is holding political and religious private views, and is not allowed to enter the Tripitaka. The second reason is that the emperor, prime minister and officials hold private views on the government and religion and withdraw them from the Tripitaka. The third single line is that the solitary water has not been handed down to the world far away has not been included in the Tripitaka. The fourth is that distant land has been seen in China. The fifth is that the writings of Zhi Na after Yongzheng were not included in the Tripitaka. Although these five cannot give their names and numbers, it is credible that there are many, and there must be very value, and it is suitable for what should be done and can be done today. Because today's culture is smooth, it is easy to interview, and the political taboos and stubbornness have been eliminated, and the various obstacles in the past can be said to be no longer there. If we do not engage in it in time, it is a shame to this era. Today's compilation of the Tripitaka must take this as the main purpose and central point, and it is not impossible to add any other items, and the time and financial resources are regarded as the progress program. Only today's living standards are high, and prices are rising endlessly. If there is no general calculation first, it will lead to a dilemma. Stealing that printing is a matter of the future, but at present there must be a plan in advance, just like building a house, we must look at the site and the water, today's carving wood is no longer necessary (because the price is too high and the work is too slow) typesetting and stone printing have a lot of room for deliberation, the best is to use the method of publishing books in batches, the whole Tripitaka is based on one hundred large books, assuming that it is divided into five batches or ten batches, such as ten batches then ten books in each batch, the cost of interviews, purchases, compilations, copying, checking, printing and printing is at least 500,000 yuan (starting with 200 copies), that is, the cost of each ten books is 2,500 yuan, and the cost of each book is 250 yuan. Selling after printing, I am afraid it will be difficult to make a profit. Assuming that half of it is 250,000 yuan, then another 250,000 yuan must be paid. Such a cycle, with a period of ten years, cannot be called urgent. If you feel that this number is too huge and the period is too long, then fifty large books are the standard, or half of the expenses can be reduced, then the content must also be changed accordingly. Such a big event must not be started rashly, so as not to leave the criticism of the tiger's head and snake's tail, and to be sorry for Youweng. As for interviewing the lost and dispersed books, it is important to be cautious in choosing, but there must be no views of sects, and it should be changed to the accumulated ills of the past, in order to remove the rough and get the essence, eliminate the false and preserve the true, and should pay attention to the obscure and scattered writings of each sect, so that the essence of Buddhism will be revealed to the world through this, and its merits are really unimaginable. In the illness, I occasionally saw something, and I used it to contribute to the left and right, hoping to help the high and deep, and the rest of the details, should be considered by later generations, not urgent. Dedicated.

Economic Circles - Small Remarks on Bank Capital Increase and Merger Issues

It was reported the other day that bank capital must reach at least three million yuan, and in recent months, newly established banks have been carrying out capital increases one after another. This is entirely due to the banks' own initiative and preventive policy, so that if the government does issue such an order, they will not be caught unprepared. In fact, a capital of one or two million yuan is indeed difficult to operate with now, so in order to strengthen their strength and facilitate deployment, banks have taken the step of increasing capital and expanding.

Because banks have a tendency to increase capital, there are rumors that smaller banks need to merge. Mergers have precedents in foreign countries, and there have also been examples in our country, but it is not a very simple matter. Here is a brief description of a few points that I have thought of regarding capital increases and mergers:

(1) If the government does have a plan to adjust the banks, it must have practical measures to give the banks a reasonable period of time to engage in capital increase or merger, and it will never suddenly issue an order, merely causing the banks to be caught off guard. Therefore, banks do not need to worry too much. However, judging from the trend, banks should also prepare for a rainy day and plan for it early.

(2) If smaller banks must merge, the government will only be in a position to guide and urge them, and the banks must plan and proceed properly on their own. Because each bank has its own background, history, and current situation. In addition, personnel issues are the most troublesome, and it is not possible to merge at once. Therefore, mergers are not as easy as commonly heard and said.

(3) There are various different ways and degrees of merging. First, a complete merger, that is, two or more banks are completely merged into one organization. Second, centralized management, that is, a management company controls the shares of two or more banks. Third, interlocking management, that is, one person or several people hold shares in several banks and serve as directors of several banks in order to obtain business contacts and cooperation. It is not uncommon for the third situation to exist now, and further contact may be possible. Therefore, mergers also have to be handled according to the situation, and there is quite a bit of flexibility.

(4) When it comes to the actual credit and financial strength of a bank, it is really impossible to judge solely on the basis of capital, but capital is an indicator that is easy to compare. In the past, few old banks had capital of four or five million yuan, while new banks with capital of four or five million yuan are common. Therefore, new and old banks cannot be judged in the same way. If the old bank truly has strong assets, even if it is to comply with the law and increase shares and capital, it will naturally not be a problem.

(5) There are already many new banks that have increased capital, and it is inevitable that some of them have increased capital due to the lack of working capital. If this is the case, then the bank's past operating policies must also be wrong. The newly added funds must not be used for stagnant or improper purposes. The money market may not be overly tight again, but it will not become very loose in the near future. Maintaining the liquidity of funds is the most important principle of operating a commercial bank, and this is what banks should pay special attention to.

In short, the government, under the policy of rectifying finance, should be considerate of business difficulties and take appropriate measures. However, banks should be more self-disciplined and strive to become more robust, moving towards the safest path.

### Flour Association Petitions for Re-division of Anhui Province into Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu Regions

Since its establishment, the National Flour Industry Association has been proceeding smoothly with its various tasks. In the past, Anhui Province was divided into Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui by the grain management authorities to manage the allocation and purchase of flour raw materials throughout the province. Anqing County was affiliated with the Northern Anhui region. Recently, the Anhui Province Flour Association specifically submitted a document to the National Flour Industry Association, requesting that the Anhui Province region be re-divided, canceling the original names of Southern Anhui and Northern Anhui, and dividing it into three regions: Anqing, Wuhu, and Bengbu. The counties and towns under the jurisdiction of the three regions are: (1) Anqing region, which governs the nine counties of Huaining, Tongling, Guichi, Dongliu, Wangjiang, Hukou, Pengze, Tongcheng, and Susong; (2) Wuhu region, which governs the nine counties of Wuhu, Fanchang, Yicheng, Wuwei, Hexian, Hanshan, Hefei, Chaoxian, and Dangtu; and Bengbu region, which governs the ten counties of Chuxian, Jiashan, Fengyang, Huaiyuan, Wuhe, Shouxian, Fengtai, Jinjiao, and Laian. The Flour Association has approved the review and has submitted a document to the Ministry of Food and the Commerce and Trade Control Board, requesting consideration and approval.

### Five Types of Taxes to be Directly Submitted to the National Treasury

In the past, salt tax under the Ministry of Finance was submitted to the national treasury by various districts. However, the tax bureaus still submitted it to their respective offices for summary and transfer. Now, in order to unify the handling, in addition to the income tax, which has been directly submitted to the national treasury since last month, all provincial, regional, and bureau consolidated taxes, stamp taxes, tobacco and alcohol taxes, mineral taxes, and silk construction special donations should also follow the practice of salt tax starting next month, and be directly submitted to the national treasury by the tenth day of the following month. At the same time, reports will be submitted to the departments in order to connect the administration and return to consistency.

### Suzhou Chinese and Japanese Merchants’ Grain Transportation Procedures, Suzhou, 16th, Central News Agency

In order to facilitate Chinese and Japanese grain merchants and understand the grain business in the province, the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau specifically negotiated with the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou on the procedures for Chinese and Japanese grain merchants to transport grain, and submitted it to the provincial government for transfer to the Ministry of Food for record. The details of these regulations are as follows: (A) For Chinese merchants, (1) Chinese merchants transporting major grain commodities must have a certificate issued by their respective trade associations, and only after it has been registered and stamped by the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau can it be approved for transportation. (2) Those who hold permits from the Sino-Japanese General Chamber of Commerce and Trade Control must also register with the Jiangsu Provincial Grain Bureau before they can be moved. (B) For Japanese merchants, the Japanese Consulate in Suzhou is responsible for registering and stamping according to the above method, and the registration situation will be summarized and sent to the Provincial Grain Bureau every ten days for verification. It is also heard that in the future, regardless of whether Chinese or Japanese grain merchants fail to comply with these procedures and move grain, once discovered, they will be severely punished.

### Miscellaneous Grain Stores in Various Places Must Apply for Registration

The Miscellaneous Grain Industry Joint Association in various regions received an order from the Ministry of Food, and sent a circular to its member stores to handle registration procedures, and issued a form to urge them to report in accordance with the prescribed format: (1) The association to which the applicant store belongs. (2) Date of establishment. (3) Total capital. (4) Organizational nature. (5) Names, native places, and addresses of managers and shareholders. (6) Total annual turnover. (7) Sources of grain, locations, and quantities. (8) Grain sales, locations, and quantities.

### Hua Shares Trend

Buyers of China Underwear were active. In the textile industry, the rise of Wing On Spinning Factory and Dasheng First, Third Factories was also fierce. Among the small denomination weaving stocks, Xinfeng Printing and Dyeing suddenly broke through. The rise of the new pharmaceutical industry also started.

### Brief News

Futung Bank, having been approved by the Ministry of Finance to resume operations, began announcing its resumption of business the day before yesterday. In recent days, Chairman Song Xueqin, General Manager Jiang Weihang, and Manager Song Shuyu of the bank have been actively adjusting and arranging various businesses after the resumption of operations, and they are extremely busy. Previously, the bank was suspected of being involved in the Zhenhua Company, but the Ministry of Finance has investigated and found that it was not involved, and since then the truth has been revealed.

The "Pocket Hua Share Treasure Book" distributed by the Hua Share Daily News Agency has received such enthusiastic orders that it has long exceeded the planned amount, so it has been decided to actively prepare for printing. However, because the content of the book is purely based on direct interviews, and all investigations must be based on the latest approved manuscripts from various companies and factories, and the table-based method is used for the first time in Roman typesetting, the arrangement procedure takes a lot of time, and it is expected that it can be published before the end of July.

The Shanghai Cotton Industry Association has established its first board of directors, including Xu Hewu and Ruan Zhixiang, and fifteen others. Chen Taosheng and Ruan Zhiyi, and seven others, were supervisors. It is heard that the raw cotton needed by the members of the association will be allocated in four grades, A, B, C, and D, based on the amount of capital and the size of the business.

### Correction

In the advertisement for the winning numbers of the 78th issue of the Central Savings Society published in this newspaper on the 16th of this month, the three-color (7064) was mistakenly printed as (7164), (35874) was mistakenly printed as (33874), (129277) was mistakenly printed as (129217), (176633) was mistakenly printed as (176632), and (197100) was mistakenly printed as (197150). This is to correct them.
