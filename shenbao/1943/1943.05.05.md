### A Message for Youth Day

Recently, the National Government ordered that May 5th of each year be designated as "Youth Day." At a time when the international situation is becoming increasingly severe and East Asian nations are jointly fighting against Britain and the United States, this decision by the authorities is of great significance. It fully demonstrates the importance the authorities place on the role of youth in the new era and the earnest expectations they hold for them. From the perspective of the current world situation, in order to strive for the final victory of the Greater East Asia War and to build a new order in East Asia and even the world, it is imperative to have the enthusiastic participation of young people. From the standpoint of the nation, not only is it necessary to mobilize the total strength of the nation's youth for the current actual war, but also to start planning the training of youth as soon as possible for the future construction of a new China. All of this mainly requires the self-awareness and spontaneous struggle of the nation's youth. The government's designation of "Youth Day" should be the first call to awaken the nation's youth to rise up.

Chinese youth have a glorious history of struggle. No one can underestimate the decisive power of Chinese youth in the fate of the nation. However, it must be admitted that in the past, a few ambitious individuals exploited the passion, innocence, frankness, and bravery of young people to build positions and make sacrifices for their own benefit. At the same time, attention and support were not given to the youth groups themselves, the progress of the youth themselves, and the proper position of youth in the nation, and were even destroyed and suppressed. Countless promising young people have been innocently ruined and sacrificed, greatly damaging the vitality of the nation. We have learned from our pain and, on this first Youth Day, we respectfully plead on behalf of the nation's youth, hoping that the authorities and society as a whole will cherish young people, give them the ability to unite, seek progress, and contribute to the nation and society.

What we hope from the nation's youth is that, in view of the current severe situation and the nation's serious position, they will recognize the decisive power of youth in the future destiny of the nation, that everyone will no longer abandon themselves, that everyone will from now on respect and cherish themselves, and that everyone will be prepared to be masters of the country and pioneers in transforming society and building a new China. Secondly, we will no longer allow young people to be ignorant of current affairs, and thus be romantic and decadent, or to study to death. We can no longer be passively pessimistic, but must be truly invigorated, concerned about national affairs, and take responsibility for our motherland. Furthermore, we hope that everyone will recognize the urgent needs of East Asia and our country, work doubly hard, study science and technology, launch scientific movements, promote technical learning, forge themselves into a steel-like team, truly be pioneers in transforming society, be cadres for building a new China, and complete the great cause of a new order in Greater East Asia and even the world!

### As Long-Lived as the Nation

The Chairman, endowed with innate talent and courage, has followed Mr. Sun Yat-sen in devoting himself to the revolutionary cause for decades. The number of dangers and twists he has experienced during that time is enough to be recorded in history books and praised. We will not mention that for the time being. Let us close our eyes and imagine that if the Sino-Japanese Incident had continued to this day without the Chairman's express telegram expressing his advocacy for peace negotiations, then the recent new China policy of our friendly nation Japan would not have come about. We further speculate that the Chairman's determination to launch peace negotiations was simply with the courage of "If I don't go to hell, who will?" and thus had this heroic act. Therefore, in addition to wishing the Chairman to be as long-lived as the nation from the bottom of our hearts, we express our first point of admiration.

In our country, it is customary to celebrate the sixtieth birthday. While social customs generally dictate that those with a little wealth, even in their thirties or forties, often hold lavish birthday celebrations to show off their extravagance, the Chairman, at the age of sixty-one, has a brilliant career and his birthday celebrations are not intended to be ostentatious. From the beginning, he has refused them and has spoken out about the importance of practicing frugality and correcting customs. We feel that frugality is indeed something that all citizens should earnestly practice at this time. The result of frugality can reduce the consumption of materials and at the same time passively increase the use of materials. Therefore, the two words "frugality," at first glance, seem to be a minor matter of "being a good housekeeper" that is not of great significance; in fact, all major issues related to national welfare and people's livelihood, such as politics, economy, and even social culture, have a significant relationship with this. Especially when we are at war with foreign countries, when materials are scarce, prices are high, and people's lives are difficult, we must earnestly practice frugality in order to increase the materials needed for the war, stabilize high prices, and alleviate the difficulties of life. However, what we want to loudly appeal for is that the general public, who are suffering from difficult living conditions, have already practiced frugality to the point where they can no longer cut back. Only the middle and upper classes must practice frugality across the board. At the same time, we hope that they will use the surplus from their savings to provide for the general public who are suffering from difficult living conditions. We say this because we have seen too much of the phenomenon in Shanghai society where "the rich stink of meat and wine, while the roads are littered with frozen corpses." We believe that the Chairman's special emphasis on frugality is also for this reason. This is our second point of admiration.

We know that the Chairman is busy with official duties, managing myriad affairs every day, and yet he gets up as early as six o'clock and does not sleep until eleven o'clock at night, and is still full of energy. Therefore, it can be further proven that the more diligent you are, the healthier you will be. Looking back at some people in the officialdom, even late at night, they are still chasing after the bright lights and drunken revelry, and their spirits are "vigorous." By the next day, the sun is already high in the sky, and they are still sleeping soundly, not keeping office hours. Even when they do arrive, they are listless. Compared to the Chairman, how can they not feel ashamed! To go a step further, even if the leaders are working hard for the country day and night, it is still difficult for a single tree to support a tall building. Only if all civil servants, especially senior and middle-level cadres, take the Chairman's spirit of handling affairs as a model and work together can politics be improved and the country be revived. This is our third point of admiration.

We should understand the Chairman's great intention in refusing birthday celebrations, and we should also appreciate the true meaning of practicing frugality and correcting customs. We silently celebrate in our hearts the Chairman being as long-lived as the nation, to serve our people forever. Yesterday was the Chairman's birthday. We admired the Chairman's intention and did not say a word of celebration to avoid impropriety. However, we hope to express our inner admiration today, after the fact, and to further explain the meaning of practicing frugality, so as to celebrate with the people of the country the Chairman being as long-lived as the nation.

### Japanese Naval Air Force Launches Daylight Air Raid on Darwin Port, Inflicting Heavy Damage on Allied Air Force; Airfields in Bengal, India, Also Bombed

Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency) – On the 2nd, the Japanese Naval Air Force launched a large-scale daylight air raid on Darwin Port, inflicting heavy damage on the Allied Air Force in aerial combat. The Australian government and public were shocked, and military experts were amazed at the excellence of the Japanese Naval Air Force. According to reports from Melbourne, the Allied Command issued a statement on the night of the 2nd, stating that on the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force engaged in aerial combat with the Allied Air Force in the Darwin Port area and over the Arafura Sea to the north, and the Allied Air Force suffered heavy losses. Furthermore, a special correspondent from the Allied Command stated regarding the air battle: On the 2nd, the Japanese Air Force heavily bombed Allied airfields near Darwin Port, and the Allied Air Force suffered heavy losses in the aerial combat. Although Spitfire aircraft piloted by British and Australian personnel engaged the Japanese aircraft, the damage suffered was significant. This is the first time the Allied Command has issued a statement acknowledging significant damage in the air war in the Southwest Pacific. A special correspondent from the British Central Broadcasting Station in Melbourne also stated: The Allied forces have not suffered such heavy losses in the past. However, if the Spitfire aircraft were indeed piloted by British and Australian pilots who had engaged the German Air Force on the European front, then the cause of the defeat is even more incomprehensible. In the past, due to the urgency of the African front, it was not possible to import Spitfire aircraft, but the most recently arrived ones are the latest models. Therefore, this defeat was truly unexpected. The pilots and aircraft of the Japanese Air Force must be the best. The Australian radio station also broadcast that the Spitfire is the best fighter aircraft in the world, but in this air battle, against Japanese aircraft, it suffered heavy losses. The Spitfire aircraft is superior to other types of aircraft in high-altitude flight, and the pilots are all British and Australian pilots who recently transferred to Australia with the aircraft. Therefore, this crushing defeat is truly incomprehensible. Macarthur is known for fabricating facts. It is rumored that in order to point out the crisis in the Pacific, he may abandon his past deceptive policies and have no choice but to acknowledge this crushing defeat.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to a communique issued yesterday in New Delhi, an airfield in southeastern Bengal Province was bombed by aircraft, resulting in slight casualties and damage, and one British aircraft is missing.

Argentine Capital, 4th (Central News Agency) – The large-scale bombing of Darwin Port by the Japanese Air Force and the activity of Japanese submarines in the South Pacific seem to have given Australia a great shock. According to reports from Melbourne, Australian Army Minister Ford issued a statement on the 22nd, appealing to Britain and the United States for assistance, the gist of which was that we request that Britain and the United States send large quantities of ships, aircraft, and troops to the South Pacific front. Recently, the Japanese military has increased submarine strength in the South Pacific. Japan intends to cut off Australia's communication lines. The number of our transport ships lost due to attacks by Japanese submarines is increasing daily. Judging from the activity of Japanese submarines and the bombing of Darwin Port by the Japanese Air Force, it is clear that Japan has now launched an offensive.

### Explanation of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Essential Commodities

Nanjing, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— The Supreme National Defense Council unanimously passed the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Commodities at its meeting on the morning of the 3rd. The regulations, consisting of twelve articles, have been published in full. The aim of Articles 1 and 2 is to protect the legitimate business practices of members of trade associations for essential commodities and small vendors with capital less than one thousand yuan. Penalties are clearly stipulated for those who violate these regulations, namely, “Non-members of trade associations for essential commodities who hoard essential commodities for profit shall be sentenced to imprisonment for not less than three years and not more than seven years, and may also be subject to a fine of not more than 50,000 yuan.” Article 2 further stipulates that the trading partners of members of trade associations should be genuine direct consumers. However, this restriction does not apply to agricultural producers selling their own agricultural products or to those who are legally qualified as brokers or agents, which is a matter of course. Article 3 stipulates the obligations of members of trade associations to the competent authorities and the trade associations themselves, with legal penalties attached for those who conceal or fail to register. Article 4 provides for ancillary penalties for those who violate Articles 2 and 3; individuals shall be subject to criminal penalties, and goods shall be confiscated. Article 5 stipulates that those who use money as a means to induce others to commit crimes shall also be considered accomplices under the regulations. Article 6 stipulates severe criminal penalties for those who disrupt the market due to violations of Articles 1, 2, and 3. Therefore, the provisions include the death penalty or life imprisonment, as well as a fine of not more than 100,000 yuan. Article 7 is solely aimed at punishing civil servants who commit crimes. Even if they are state officials, their punishment will not be lenient, reflecting the legislative intent to rectify discipline. Articles 8 and 9 provide a path to self-renewal for past hoarders. Article 10 further clarifies that the provisions of Article 8 and 9, paragraph 1, do not apply to civil servants, demonstrating the government's determination to deal with civil servant crimes more severely than those of ordinary people. Article 11 defines the qualifications for membership in trade associations. Overall, the entire regulation contains the following meanings: (1) to establish a legal basis for a wartime economic system and effectively implement wartime economic policies, (2) to protect the legitimate business practices of members of trade associations for essential commodities and small vendors, (3) to clarify that the purpose of profit-making should be legal and public in nature, (4) to impose the most severe penalties on offenders, including civil servants, (5) to provide a legal path to self-renewal for past hoarders, while taking strict measures against civil servants, (6) to rectify discipline and implement clean governance, (7) after the implementation of these regulations, the government is determined to enforce them. In the future, hoarders will be severely sanctioned, and the stability of people's livelihoods and the stabilization of prices will be positively influenced by this law. The people should act together, supervise each other, strive to report crimes, and jointly complete the wartime system to revive China.

### Secretary-General Li of the Clearance Committee Returns to Nanjing from Guangdong to Report

### Hong Kong Governor Isogai Discusses Hong Kong Dollar, Permitting Temporary Circulation

Hong Kong, April 3rd, Central News Agency Telegram— Hong Kong Governor Isogai met with a group of Chinese reporters on the 3rd and answered various questions about the current situation in Hong Kong, explaining the reasons for allowing the circulation of Hong Kong dollars from the British administration. The main points of his conversation are as follows: The lives of ordinary citizens in Hong Kong are becoming more stable. The restrictions on the exchange of Hong Kong dollars and military scrip have caused inconvenience to transactions and the lives of citizens. Now that the military scrip reserves are sufficient, these exchange restrictions have been lifted. The depreciation of the Hong Kong dollar is a natural trend. Originally, the life of the Hong Kong dollar should have ended long ago. It is inherently unreasonable to allow the circulation of Hong Kong dollars from the British administration in Hong Kong, but in consideration of the lives of ordinary citizens, it is permitted to circulate temporarily.

### US Air Force Stationed in Chongqing Shoots at Innocent People in Vietnam

### The Meaning of May Fourth Youth Day

— Wang Zhaoming

The National Government's designation of May 5th each year as Youth Day is significant. April 4th is Children's Day, and June 6th is Teachers' Day. Youth Day falls appropriately between these two festivals. Moreover, at this time, new greenery abounds, and the mountains and rivers are covered in a vibrant, fresh, and lively atmosphere, which is most fitting as a symbol of youth.

Historically, January 1st of the first year of the Republic was the anniversary of the Founding Father's inauguration as Provisional President in Nanjing, and May 5th of the tenth year was the anniversary of the Founding Father's inauguration as President in Guangzhou. The former is related to the creation of the Republic of China, and the latter is related to the revival of the Republic of China. Looking back at that time, the country was divided by warlords, and darkness prevailed. Even in Guangzhou, counter-revolutionary forces were brewing and about to erupt. The Founding Father, unwilling to see the interruption of the National Revolution, took on the heavy responsibility of reviving the Republic of China in an extremely adverse environment. This spirit of knowing only righteousness and understanding the truth, regardless of success or failure, is truly the highest model of youth. At that time, some people argued that the National Assembly did not have a quorum. It should be known that since the military governors' rebellion in the sixth year, which violated the law and dissolved the National Assembly, the fundamental spirit of the "Protection of the Constitution" lay in overthrowing the military governors. Since the object of protection, the military governors, had to be overthrown, there could be no principal body to protect, the government of the Republic of China. The importance of this fundamental spirit was a hundred times greater than that of form. Unfortunately, many people at that time were mired in form and neglected the fundamental spirit, so that in the eleventh year, they were used by the military governors to restore the National Assembly in Beijing. In the twelfth year, this restored National Assembly supported the leader of the military governors, Cao Kun, with each member receiving tens of thousands of yuan or even thousands of yuan per vote to elect Cao Kun as President. From then on, the National Assembly fell into a hellish abyss. This was because the fundamental spirit had disappeared. With only the shell remaining, it naturally decayed. Many people regretted it, but it was already too late. From this, it can be seen that the progress of history depends entirely on the fundamental spirit. Form can change, but the fundamental spirit cannot. When we celebrate Youth Day, remembering the date of Youth Day, which is also the date on which the Founding Father took on the heavy responsibility of reviving the Republic of China, we should persevere.

Speaking of even older history, the fifth day of the fifth lunar month is the Dragon Boat Festival. According to legend, Qu Yuan of the Warring States period drowned himself in the Miluo River on this day. Qu Yuan's biography appears in the Records of the Grand Historian, and his words appear in the Lament. Originally, suicide is a passive act and not worthy of emulation, but when we read the Records of the Grand Historian and the Lament, we can understand Qu Yuan's intentions. Gu Tinglin's Daily Knowledge Records has two passages that are the best. Since I don't have the Daily Knowledge Records at hand, I will record them roughly as follows: When reading Qu Yuan's Lament, one realizes that Yao's actions stemmed from his integrity. Those who conform to the common customs and blend in with the corrupt world cannot be admitted to the Way of Yao and Shun.

The teachings of Lao Tzu differ from those of Confucius in that they harmonize with their light and share their dust. This is what is called seemingly right but actually wrong. The fisherman of Bu Ju exhaustively understood this. It is not that he did not know that his words could be followed, but there were righteous things that should not be done. If Ziyun knew this righteousness, would he not have written the Lament? In seeking its main point, one is born into this world and lives for this world. It is good to be good. This is why he is called the Grand Master of Mang.

The main idea of the above two passages is that a person must be firm in his faith and clear in his understanding, and not be overcome by the environment. Like Qu Yuan, who would rather die than be overcome by the common customs and the corrupt world, he is worthy of admiration. If he had not died by suicide but had died in revolution, that would have been complete. However, even this spirit of preferring death to surrender is rare. In general, young people must be firm in their faith and steadfast in their integrity. Only in this way can they establish themselves and transform society. Qu Yuan was able to hate the vulgar and be overcome by it, which is worthy of admiration, but we must go further, fighting against the vulgar, overcoming the vulgar, and transforming a bright and pure society.

From the previous Dragon Boat Festival, there is a way to commemorate Qu Yuan, which is dragon boat racing. Dragon boats are ancient tools, but the spirit of racing is the same now as it was then. Dozens of people work together on a boat, striving to move forward and compete with other boats. This kind of competition is mutually encouraging and promotes progress. This spirit of competition is very important in the sense of historical progress and in the sense of social evolution.

The above are just a few words attached to the present Youth Day, prompted by the previous Dragon Boat Festival.

In short, young people, in this era, should recognize the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia, and take on everything with a spirit of diligence, endurance, courage, and progress. When celebrating Youth Day, remembering the difficult struggle and perseverance of the Founding Father when he took office as President on May 5th of the tenth year, we strengthen our sense of responsibility to carry on the past and usher in the future, and vow to continue our efforts to carry out the unfinished will of the Founding Father's life. At the same time, recalling a beautiful history of ancient times, which is both worth singing and worth weeping, we should be stirred by the wind of inspiration a hundred generations later, and we should muster a vibrant, fresh, and lively spirit and move forward with big strides.

### London and Washington Believe the Soviet-Polish Problem Remains Very Serious, Moscow Advocates Complete Reorganization of the Polish Government, Stanczyk Demands the Soviets Release Poles

Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to the latest news obtained by Stefani News Agency, London and Washington still consider the situation after the severance of relations between the Soviet Union and Poland to be serious. The attitude of British and American newspapers seems to be dissatisfied with both the Soviet Union and Poland. A recent Gallup poll in the United States asked, "Do you believe that the Soviet Union will cooperate loyally after the war?" Fifty percent of the answers were no. This has greatly displeased Moscow.

Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Soviet News Agency stated last night that it advocated a complete reorganization of the Sikorski government, while condemning General Sikorski for colluding with reactionary elements among Polish exiles and making anti-Soviet concessions in the United States. The agency continued that Poland now needs a new government whose members have a deep understanding of wartime needs, can fully shoulder the responsibility for the Poles and the anti-Axis countries, and will not become a tool for the enemy, but will seek a friendly union with the Soviet Union. The agency concluded that a prerequisite for the formation of a new government is the rejection of the policy of occupying Ukraine, as Moscow deeply hopes that the new government can resolve border issues in a friendly manner.

Ankara, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to reports from Tehran: Stanczyk, Minister of Social Welfare of the Polish government-in-exile, has requested the Soviet government to release more than 800,000 Poles it has detained. He stated that only by releasing these Poles can the current and future misunderstandings between the Soviet and Polish governments be dispelled. Stanczyk recalled that after the Polish government refused to recognize Jews and Ukrainians as Soviet citizens, the Soviet government issued an order on January 16, 1943, depriving Poles under Soviet jurisdiction of their Polish citizenship. He stated, "If the citizenship issue can be resolved immediately, we are prepared to leave all land issues to the peace conference to resolve."

Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to a London special dispatch carried by Swedish newspapers on the 4th, US President Roosevelt sent a personal telegram to Polish Prime Minister Sikorski, urging him to resolve the Soviet-Polish dispute. At the same time, Roosevelt entrusted Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov to carry a personal letter to Stalin, the content of which was also about this matter.

### Former Bulgarian Police Chief Pantiev Assassinated

Sofia, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Former Bulgarian Police Chief Colonel Pantiev was shot and killed yesterday at 1:25 PM. The assassins were a man and a woman. Authorities believe the case has political motives. The details of the case are as follows: The assassins first lay in ambush under the stairs of Pantiev's residence. When he went out, they fired two shots in a row, both hitting his head. He died within minutes. Two people witnessed the incident and chased the assassins, but failed to capture them. The police quickly arrived and immediately began investigating. Pantiev was a well-known military judge, 50 years old. He served as Bulgaria's Police Chief from February 1929 to November 1941. He was then appointed as a judge of the Military Court of Appeals, but declined and instead practiced law. It is believed that the assassins in this case belong to the same terrorist group that assassinated former Army Chief General Koev in February and Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee Yaniv on April 15. Pantiev was well known for his fight against [communists] when he was Police Chief.

### German and Soviet Forces Complete Deployment, Preparing for Summer Battle, German-Romanian Allied Forces Launch Fierce Counterattack on the Kuban River

Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— Moscow sources report that a major offensive may soon be launched on the Eastern Front, while Berlin sources say that the large-scale attacks made by the Soviet army on the eastern flank of the Axis bridgehead in the Kuban region weakened on Sunday. According to the German News Agency, the Soviet army lost several divisions and companies and many tanks in the past few days south of the Kuban River. They then sent several battalions to fight, but the German-Romanian Allied Forces, in cooperation with the powerful German Air Force, launched a fierce counterattack. After a fierce battle, they surrounded the attacking Soviet forces. Except for a few who were captured, the rest were annihilated. It is said that some Soviet troops did not resist and surrendered. Berlin has not made any predictions about the fighting in the area. German military experts only pointed out that the Soviet army is continuing to make fierce attacks, but it is not yet possible to say whether the battle has reached its climax. At the same time, the United Press correspondent in Moscow said: The German and Soviet forces have clearly completed their redeployment along the front line to prepare for this summer's battle. Large-scale battles have also occurred several times in northwestern Caucasus.

Stockholm, Sweden, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to news from the Eastern Front, the Soviet offensive on the Kuban River has weakened, while the German counterattack is becoming increasingly fierce. Especially in the Novorossiysk area, the German army is continuing to attack and launch an annihilation battle. According to the German News Agency, it is said that the Soviet army lost 16 tanks and 21 aircraft on the 2nd, which shows the low combat power of the Soviet army. According to the United Press Moscow telegram, the German and Soviet forces have now completed the reorganization of the entire line, and are preparing to launch a fierce offensive with artillery fire. It is said that skirmishes have begun between the two armies in the Voronezh region.

Moscow, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— After increasing pressure on the German bridgehead, the Red Army is currently engaged in a bloody battle with the German-Romanian mixed army. According to front-line reports, the German counterattack has apparently failed. The Soviet communiqué did not mention the Kuban battle, only saying that fighting continues around Borokria, the Soviet bridgehead 50 miles southeast of Kharkov. In other locations, Soviet artillery and reconnaissance aircraft are probing German positions in preparation for the final battle. It is generally believed that the future German offensive will strike a major blow to the Soviet capital, with Orel being the center of the entire line, as the Germans are confident in their fierce tanks. Military commentator Lieutenant Colonel Vasilyev said, "The upcoming battle will be extremely difficult."

### American Coal Miners Temporarily Return to Work for Half a Month

Lisbon, April 4th, Central News Agency Telegram— According to reports from Washington, yesterday was the first day of the American miners' return to work. The situation was not very enthusiastic, as only half of the miners actually resumed work, and the rest are expected to return to work today. Officials from the United Mine Workers of America announced on Sunday evening, before President Roosevelt's radio broadcast, that bituminous coal miners would temporarily return to work for fifteen days pending negotiations for increased wages. Interior Secretary Ickes announced yesterday the formation of a five-member committee to oversee the operation of anthracite mines, whose contracts with the 8,000 anthracite miners who had joined the strike expired at midnight on April 30. Reports from Washington suggest that officials have not publicly discussed the matter of this strike, but general opinion seems to hold that, with one possible exception, any agreement to resolve the coal industry dispute will be submitted to the War Labor Board for approval. This exception will be that the sixth day of the week will receive extra wages. At the same time, according to War Labor Board officials, the three-person subcommittee appointed by the board will resume its work as soon as coal production returns to normal, gathering facts and making recommendations. United Mine Workers President Lewis, after agreeing with Interior Secretary Ickes on Sunday morning, issued an order to the miners that evening to return to work for fifteen days. He promised the miners that he would make every effort to use this two-week period to devise a new wage method. Labor Secretary Perkins criticized this fifteen-day return-to-work agreement, saying that it did not mean that the government had accepted the strike demands.

### British Labor Minister Announces Conscription of Workers Act

The order also includes women over the age of 45, who should serve in essential wartime industries for all or part of their time, except those with young children. Currently, there are 500,000 married women working part-time in wartime industries. The remaining manpower lies with married women, hence their inclusion in the order.

### Tunisian Front – Only Localized Battles – Anti-Axis Powers Concentrating Transport Ships – Rumored to be Planning Large-Scale Landing Operation

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) – According to the military correspondent of the Hai Tong News Agency: Only localized battles occurred on the Tunisian front on Sunday. The fighting has been relatively calm since the major battles of Easter. The reason for this is that the Anti-Axis forces, especially the British First Army, have indeed suffered significant losses. However, the enemy possesses superior manpower and material resources and should be able to replenish these losses simultaneously. The Anti-Axis forces' preparations near the front are not sufficient to offset these losses, but the Anti-Axis powers have significant preparations in Algeria and Morocco, enough to form more than one army. This is an open secret. North African railway transportation is excellent, and the Anti-Axis powers can dispatch sufficient new troops to replace their heavily damaged units, but the Anti-Axis side does not seem to have done so. Based on repeated reports of a large concentration of Anti-Axis transport ships in Algerian ports, there may be another explanation. The Anti-Axis high command, not yet using most of its preparations for North African operations, may be planning a large-scale landing operation. The Anti-Axis forces may be planning to land on the Tunisian coast, as they know that a direct attack on Axis positions is extremely difficult and would inevitably result in heavy losses. However, the Anti-Axis forces may also be planning to land on the coasts of Sicily or Sardinia, which is also possible.

### Full Picture of Naval Battle off Florida Island

(From Takeda, Special Correspondent at South Pacific 〇〇 Base (Naval Reporting Team))

The mission of the naval battle off Florida Island on April 7th was to "attack enemy fleets (mainly transport convoys) around Guadalcanal Island and crush the enemy's counter-offensive attempts." The results achieved include sinking or damaging 15 enemy ships and shooting down approximately 40 enemy aircraft. In this extraordinary operation by the naval air force, the enemy suffered a significant blow. This was a preemptive aerial surprise attack. Although the weather was unfavorable at the time of the attack, the aggressive spirit of our naval air force completely overcame this adverse natural environment, resolutely flew over Guadalcanal Island, and successfully destroyed the enemy's supply convoy. The enemy's elite Grumman fighters were shot down one by one. Therefore, this battle took very little time. The 〇〇 Commander and the reporting team at 〇〇 base personally experienced the fierce aerial combat during this operation.

Departure

At 〇〇 o'clock in the morning on the 7th, the area around the 〇〇 base was like the eve of a storm, with extremely bad weather. In this dark plain, there were dots of fireflies, which were the lights of the maintenance crew, who were preparing the machinery all night before the sortie. The fireflies disappeared into the darkness, and only the roaring engine test sounds broke the deep sleep. The sky gradually turned fish-white, and darkness bowed before the light. The planes broke through the dim sky and took off. When the lead plane carrying the commander rose to a height of 〇〇 meters, many planes were already lined up waiting, and together they quickly flew forward into the gradually brightening dawn sky.

Above the sea, patches of broken clouds floated, and the flight was very smooth. Flying 〇〇 kilometers in one breath, the leader plane we were on separated from the attack squadron and landed at a certain forward base. At this time, the Solomon Islands, overgrown with coconut groves, were full of vitality, and the morning dew wetted the landing planes. Only 〇〇 kilometers from the enemy's front-line base, "Guadalcanal," where the enemy and we have been stalemated for half a year, repeatedly engaging in bloody battles. But on this clear morning, there was no sign of killing intent.

Attack

Soon, the silence of this morning was broken. Suddenly, a metallic buzzing sound was heard overhead. The enemy's Lockheed reconnaissance plane flew at an invisible altitude. Did they know we were going to attack? We couldn't wait another hour. A large combined attack squadron of fighter-bombers immediately ascended to the skies above Guadalcanal. The reporting team prayed for the success of the combat units under the coconut leaves, while the commander, standing on a not-very-high hill, stared at the southeast sky where the planes had flown past, his heart filled with the conviction of victory. The commander knew this was a difficult attack. In broad daylight, the brave men of our naval aircraft had to rush into the modern fortifications built by the enemy with all their might, where hundreds of enemy fighters were waiting, and the enemy had deployed a heavy barrage of anti-aircraft guns. What a daunting task!

One squadron of the attack force, first departing from the sea south of Guadalcanal, advanced towards the enemy's ship concentration point on the north shore amidst dense layers of clouds. However, the sky over the island was covered with chaotic clouds over 10,000 meters, which were extremely dense. If they tried to descend through the clouds, the formation would inevitably be disrupted, which was the worst possible tactic. So they changed course and detoured west of the island. When they reached the western end, the enemy had already been alerted by the sudden attack of our air force, and dozens of Grumman fighters and intense ground fire responded simultaneously.

Patrolling right over the western end of Guadalcanal, the order for a general surprise attack came down. At this moment, four Grumman fighters suddenly attacked our fighter unit from above the clouds. 〇〇 Captain was preparing an attack posture to meet them head-on, when two enemy planes stealthily descended from above with a bang. Lieutenant 〇〇, who had fought many battles since the China Incident, immediately shot down one of them, clearing the way for the bombers while attacking the enemy airfield along the coast. At that time, four more Grumman planes attacked our bombers. 〇 Squadron received the order to "attack" and charged first, instantly shooting down three of them, leaving one to escape, forming ranks and advancing again. Ahead, five more enemy planes attacked a small squadron of our comrades. This squadron of enemy planes put up a stubborn resistance, only shooting down two, leaving the rest to the follow-up units, while the main force covered the bombers as they penetrated further east into enemy airspace.

When the bomber squadron detoured from the west to the north shore, it was attacked by enemy fighters, and the ground fire was also extremely intense, so the planes in this squadron were hit by several enemy bullets, but they still didn't care and advanced eastward. Near the enemy airfield, they saw several enemy transport convoys moving left and right from the clouds. The squadron split into two. One squadron broke into this convoy, suddenly attacking the convoy seen in the clouds. The enemy's anti-aircraft fire blindly shot without aim. Amid the deafening explosions, they quickly descended, dropping accurate bombs, and rotated. The enemy destroyers surrounding the convoy, opening anti-aircraft fire, were also hit, emitting black smoke, and gradually sank.

The other bomber squadron moved further eastward, searching for the enemy. From this point on, the enemy fighter attacks became even more intense. Enemy fire was everywhere, front, back, above, and below. Amid this hail of enemy bullets, they remotely discovered six transport ships guarded by cruisers and destroyers, with long white wakes trailing behind, obviously trying to evade our aircraft's attack, while the ships' cannons continued to fire at our planes.

The bomber squadron leisurely detoured from right to left. Led by 〇 Squadron Leader's plane, they broke into the convoy. The fire concentrated on the command plane was extremely intense, and the sky suddenly turned into a sea of fire. The lead command plane's left wing was finally pierced by a bullet and caught fire, but it still disregarded everything and dropped a bomb on a 10,000-ton transport ship. The remaining planes also sequentially bombed the number two, three, and four ships, each between 6,000 and 7,000 tons. After confirming their sinking posture, they leisurely returned to base. Although the command plane's left wing was damaged, it seemed to have divine power, and it was still able to gradually advance back to base.

Mission Accomplished

After completing their mission, a large group of naval aircraft flew back to the forward base where the commander was waiting. They arrived at the 〇〇 base at sunset. The base personnel greeted them with handshakes. However, several young and excellent men and machines had not yet returned from this battle.

〇〇 Lieutenant, commander of a bomber squadron, had already engaged in aerial combat with the attacking Grumman fighters before discovering the enemy ships. The observer in the back seat was wounded by a bullet. 〇〇 Lieutenant, filled with fighting spirit, encouraged the wounded observer through the speaking tube, and together with friendly aircraft, rapidly descended to bomb the enemy convoy. On the way back, two Grumman fighters suddenly descended from the clouds to attack, and the fuel tank was hit.

〇〇 Lieutenant's plane, with a white trail of fuel streaming from its tail, struggled to fly back to base, but the engine eventually stopped. Another fighter circled around the damaged plane, encouraging it in every way, but now there was nothing more that could be done. 〇〇 Lieutenant would no longer be able to appear above the enemy's sea.

At this moment, the observer in the plane looked up and saw friendly aircraft, waving the naval flag in his hand. In the speaking tube, the two bomber crew members declared their intention to self-destruct. Then, in an instant, 〇〇 Lieutenant released the control stick, shouted "Long live the Emperor!" raised both hands high, then gripped the control stick again, pointed the nose of the plane downward, and self-destructed in the Solomon Sea. When his comrades in the friendly aircraft, who were mourning with their eyes closed, opened their eyes, only scattered pieces of the aircraft's wreckage were floating on the sea. The heavy rain that had previously been ignored poured down at this moment. (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 30th)

These ships have simple construction and are therefore suitable for sailing in coastal areas, yielding significant benefits. Raw materials for manufacturing can be obtained from Shanghai and its hinterland. After these shipyards were taken over by the Japanese military after the war and handed over to Japanese shipping companies for management, they were only engaged in ship repairs. They will now start building wooden ships.

### National Forum: Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation and Suppress Prices - Preliminary Proposals for Organizing Baojia and Industrial Cooperation - Hu Jinyuan

Since the Incident, prices in this city have risen sharply. Compared to 1937, the increase rate has been as high as several hundred times, with a general average of about seventy to eighty times. Although the authorities have repeatedly attempted to suppress prices, the black market is rampant, even intensifying, and has ultimately failed to achieve effective results. The crux of the matter lies not in the authorities' lack of strict enforcement, but in the powerful latent force of speculators and hoarders who disregard the law and continue to manipulate prices. The psychology of general citizens being alarmed by each other has also contributed to this. As soon as prices slightly fall back, they rush to buy in droves, thus strengthening the confidence of hoarders to profit from scarce goods. This city holds the key to the national economy, and its influence has caused prices to rise sharply throughout the country. Currently, the countermeasures rely on the wise and enlightened authorities to do their best to adjust the situation, and also require citizens to understand the will of the authorities and provide practical cooperation in order to achieve success. Now, based on my humble opinion, I will elaborate as follows:

Organization of Baojia Cooperatives. The establishment of the Baojia system in this city has made bandits disappear. The organization of Baojia cooperatives can eradicate speculation and hoarding. The effectiveness of cooperatives, whether in production, distribution, credit, or consumption, has convenient shortcuts, enabling direct links between producers and consumers to avoid the profiteering and exploitation of middlemen. Therefore, if the authorities can advocate and supervise the organization of consumer cooperatives based on the existing Baojia system, with one Jia or one Bao as a unit, such as "Consumption Cooperative of Bao No. X, District Y, Z Concession," initially conducting consumer business, raising funds to request allocations from various manufacturers, or directly ordering daily necessities from production and sales areas, and then distributing them to each member, every citizen will be a member of the cooperative, entitled to enjoy the right to cheap products, and hoarders will have no way to use their tricks. In terms of material management by the authorities, this can also achieve twice the result with half the effort. Once Baojia cooperatives are established, a federation of district Baojia cooperatives can be promoted, and then the Shanghai Municipal Baojia Cooperative Federation, so that capital is concentrated, connected to each other, and common welfare is sought, and collective procurement and distribution are even easier. Its contribution to people's livelihood and economy may also be of some help.

Organization of Industrial and Commercial Cooperatives

The Ministry of Industry recently urged the reorganization of industrial associations, adjusting internal structures, and bringing them into line. Its intention is good. I believe that if we can further utilize its existing organization, various companies and firms should organize distribution and consumption cooperatives, with the industrial associations as a federation of cooperatives, and the highest organization being the Municipal Federation of All Trades Cooperatives. Its business, such as handling the purchase and allocation of raw materials and products, sharing common interests in various industries, and strengthening connections, will surely lead to a candid exchange of needed materials. The aforementioned Baojia cooperatives should also proceed in a complementary manner. This will not only allow the operations of various manufacturers and firms to develop in the right direction, but also greatly benefit the general public, and hoarding may also disappear as a result.

I lack both talent and knowledge, and I dare to offer my humble opinion. This is why I am throwing out a brick to attract jade, hoping to eliminate speculation and hoarding, suppress prices, and maintain people's livelihood. I hope that wise authorities and leading figures from all walks of life will conduct joint research and promote its concrete implementation. The people will be very fortunate!

Economic Circles: Commentary

### "Economic Exchange is Necessary"

Recently, Minister of Finance Zhou Fo Hai and Mayor of Shanghai Chen Gong Bo both made pertinent remarks on the relationship between economic exchange and food issues when meeting with journalists in North China. Minister Zhou said: "North China is the North China of the Central Government, and the Central Government is the Central Government of North China; the National Government will do its utmost to provide relief for the food problem, material exchange, and financial accommodation of transaction funds in North China." Mayor Chen said: "Regardless of North and South, economic exchange is necessary: food is only a part of the economy." From the remarks of Zhou and Chen, one can draw a conclusion that the solution to the most serious food problem at present should still be based on the fundamental principle of economic exchange; the so-called economic exchange not only refers to the transportation and transfer of food or other goods, but also to the exchange of funds between cities and rural areas, in order to alleviate the widespread economic panic.

Recently, among the measures taken by the government to solve the food problem, in addition to issuing food treasury bills, constructing warehouses, and purchasing and storing food, the most noteworthy is the matter of rural revitalization loans. Now, banks with strong capital in this city, after completing the investigation of rural conditions and cultivation situations in various places, are currently organizing jointly to handle rural revitalization loans. Such a measure can be said to be in line with the principle of "economic exchange," and the natural result is the improvement of rural conditions and the increase in food production. However, one point that the lending banks must pay attention to is that the loan amount is not too large, and the direction of the loan must be clear. The simplest sentence is that the loans for rural revitalization must penetrate into the fields and reach the farmers directly, and must not be used by any intermediary institution. Because we have too much expectation for rural revitalization, we have said everything about rural loans.

### The Ministry of Industry Promulgates General Rules for Industrial Associations, Designates Preparatory Committees for Ten Industrial Associations, and Sets a Deadline for All to Be Organized by the End of May

In order to adjust and strengthen the wartime economic structure and form a unified organization to adapt to the National Government's wartime economic policy, the Ministry of Industry proposed the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations at the National Defense Conference of the National Government. The existing industrial associations were reorganized, and for major commodity associations, county-level or special cities were used as units to establish associations with legal personality. Representatives of each association organized the Industrial and Commercial Association Federation, which is the lower-level agency of the professional department of the National Commercial Control General Association, in order to adjust the control work of private collection and allocation agencies. The above adjustment steps for the Industrial and Commercial Association Federation have been decided by the Committee for Reorganizing Industrial Associations of the Ministry of Industry through repeated meetings. The classification and names of the sixteen major commodity industrial and commercial association federations have been published successively. In addition to the fact that the preparatory committees and preparatory directors of the Cotton Products Industry, Soap and Candle Industry, Match Industry, and Tobacco Leaf Industry Federations were designated by the Ministry of Industry and have successively established initiator meetings, preparatory committees and preparatory directors for the Rubber Industry and other ten industrial associations are now designated and must be organized and established by the end of this month to enrich the organization of the National Commercial Control General Association. At the same time, the Ministry of Industry separately appointed supervisory officials of the competent industrial and commercial association federations to guide the organization and supervise the association affairs. This time, the implementation rules of the Provisional Regulations on Industrial and Commercial Associations promulgated by the Ministry of Industry, totaling 31 articles, and the Provisional General Rules for the Organization of Industrial and Commercial Association Federations, totaling 15 articles, are very detailed. The list of designated preparatory committee members and appointed supervisory officials for the ten industrial associations is listed below:

### Preparatory Committee Designated by the Ministry of Industry

### Recent Opinions of Financial Circles on the "Small Industry Loan Syndicate"

At the current stage of industrial development in Shanghai, the position occupied by handicrafts and small industries is quite important. The loan problem of various banks for these small industries has been particularly valued by the general public since the Greater East Asia War. Recently, the authorities have been working hard to establish the self-system of financial institutions and thoroughly crack down on hoarding. It is generally believed that the Ministry of Industry may implement some effective methods for revitalizing small industries.

In the past, the financial and industrial circles of the concession jointly advocated the organization of a "Small Industry Loan Syndicate." Recently, a part of the financial circles has put forward more specific opinions, and the main points of their opinions are as follows:

(1) Organizational content of the Small Industry Loan Syndicate: With the National Government or the Central Reserve Bank as the center, the Banking Association, the Qianye Association, etc. jointly invested tens of millions of yuan in lending funds, and set up a special committee to be responsible for managing and guiding its lending business, and recruited economists from the financial and industrial circles and other authoritative people to participate in this committee. (2) Lending objects: Hand-industrial factories, small mechanical factories, and small factories are the lending objects, but there are the following restrictions: (1) Those with funds of more than 10,000 yuan and less than 100,000 yuan (2) Those who manufacture non-luxury goods (3) Those who are currently starting work (4) Those who have joined the industrial association of the industry Lending purposes: The purposes of loans are limited to expanding factory equipment and purchasing various raw materials, etc. (4) Loan amount:

In principle, it should not exceed three-quarters of its funds. (5) Loan guarantee: Limited to machines, raw materials, products, etc. (6) Loan interest: In principle, low-interest loans are the guiding principle. (7) Loan method: The committee will investigate the production status of each factory at any time, and will punish those who falsely apply or use the loan for improper purposes according to the circumstances. Those who have achieved remarkable results in small industries after using the loan will be rewarded. The specific methods are roughly as above. At this time, the abuse of small banks and the plan of the concession system are good methods for improving financial activities and promoting legitimate businesses. (May 4, China Continent News)

### French Concession Tobacco Exchange Association Ordered to Close

The Shanghai French Concession Tobacco Exchange Association and the French Concession Tobacco Exchange Mutual Aid Society have been investigated by the police and found that the two organizations were engaged in black market trading and violated the statutes and public order of the two organizations, and have been ordered to stop working immediately and complete the closure within eight days (until May 10). Xu Wenxiang, the person in charge of the two organizations, has received a written notice of the above decision from the French authorities. Hereafter, all actions that claim to represent the names of the two organizations should not be believed.

### Shanghai Former County Merchants Association Can Organize a Federation

The Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants Association previously submitted a request to the Municipal Government to transfer to the Ministry of Industry for verification whether the former Shanghai Baoshan, Chuansha and other county merchants associations should be under the jurisdiction of the association. It is now approved that the war-time economic system does not have to adhere to the administrative system. For Shanghai, Baoshan, Chuansha, Chongming, Jiading, Nanhui, Fengxian and other seven counties, if there is already a county merchants association organization, they are not subordinate to each other. If it is necessary in fact, it is possible to organize a Shanghai Special Municipality Merchants Association Federation to connect and prosper. The Municipal Government has approved the transfer to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce for information.

### Trends in Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks fell first and then recovered. The market situation was particularly good at noon. Among the new pharmaceutical industries, the price of Asia New Pharmaceutical Factory rebounded the most. The China-France Pharmacy has risen too much in recent days. It has already seen a decline, and the rise and fall of the department store industry is the most active. The prices of Yong'an, Xin Xin, and Guohuo Companies have all seen a small reduction. Underwear is also weak. Yong'an Yarn Factory and Meiya Silk Factory saw that the low price was picked up by buyers. The price of small par value textile industry is still stagnant. The culture industry, Commercial Press, Zhonghua Book Company, and World Book Bureau had a rare and stagnant price. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Greater China Match slightly saw a small reduction. Jiu'an Industrial slightly rose. The buying momentum of New Yick Land Property Company tended to be flat.

### After the Promulgation of the Law on Punishing Hoarding, Prices Plummeted

The black market transactions in the city's speculative markets were affected by the death penalty or life imprisonment for speculators who hoard and manipulate prices, which was promulgated yesterday. As a result, the speculators participating in the black market were extremely panicked and rushed to sell off their inventories. Also, because the general hoarders were deeply afraid of being prosecuted, they did not dare to absorb spot goods, causing the black market prices of various commodities such as gold, gauze, securities, daily necessities, etc. to fall by 10% to 20% yesterday. However, although the transaction prices in the black market have fallen, the prices of goods sold in retail stores have not fallen, and even the retail prices of many goods are still the prices at the highest price in the past. The relevant authorities will also thoroughly investigate.

### Starting with Tolerance

— Zhou Su

Tolerance is a virtue. However, tolerance that does not see the facts clearly and does not ask right from wrong is an evil act.

Patience is also a virtue. However, regardless of whether it is right or wrong, endurance that is simply one-sided is also an evil act.

For example, we should not be tolerant or patient with speculators and hoarders who disrupt social finance and hinder people's lives. "Indulgence breeds evil" is indeed a very true saying.

Mr. Lu Xun has these words in his short essay "Experience": "Some newspaper readers no longer pay attention to declarations, telegrams, speeches, talks, etc., no matter how ornate and grandiose they are. They even go so far as not only not paying attention, but even using them as materials for sarcastic laughter..." This was said several years ago, but the situation is still the same now, and even worse than before.

When buying theater tickets, everyone squeezes and grabs to be the first, but they stand by and watch public welfare matters, and don't care. In fact, it is a matter that is closely related to everyone's interests, but it looks as if it has nothing to do with them.

The most tragic, pathetic, shameful, and pitiful thing in the world is—

"Treating the real as fake, and treating the fake as real.

Not being tolerant and patient with things that should be tolerated and endured. And tolerating and enduring things that should not be tolerated and endured.

Treating playful things as serious matters. And treating serious matters as jokes and games."

### Shanghai Miscellany (1)

— Hashimoto Kansetsu

Japanese poet Nishina Hakugyo said: "The Kun fish disdains to be a fish again, the Peng bird disdains to be a sparrow again. They only worry that the six directions are too narrow, how can they provide the Kun Peng with soaring and leaping?" Who said that Zhuangzi was blowing a conch shell there. From the Solomons in the south, to the East Indies, to the Aleutian Islands in the north, they are all crouching under the wings of my divine eagle. Drilling into the sky and entering the earth was once regarded as an incredible magic, but now it has become a reality. I just sneaked over from the seabed of Moji, but now I am already in the sky, flying in the azure sky at several thousand meters.

Following the direction pointed by Captain Tomonaga, Jeju Island is already in sight. There is still some remaining white snow on the mountain. From the ship, the mountain peaks seem quite high, but looking down from the plane, it is as if they are sliding under our feet. Seeing the turbid seawater from the clouds, we know that we are approaching the Yangtze River soon. Chongming Island at the mouth of the river is spread out below like a drying net. Chongming Island has a very large area, but there is not an inch of wasted land. Everything is cultivated in an orderly manner, which is really surprising.

In "Remnants of the Southern Inspection," I pointed out that even the tops of the mountains in the Zhoushan Islands, which are dotted like stars on a chessboard, are planted with horticulture, which shows the diligence of the Chinese people. The Chinese people who are directed by the Japanese are only the bad and ugly aspects of the lower class. If we think that all Chinese people are like this, then we are looking at people through a crack in the door, and even people become flat. Near Jiujiang, there are torrential rains every year, and the water level can rise by fifty feet overnight. Everyone thinks that the lowlands like the mouth of the Yangtze River will be submerged by floods, right?

Knowing that this is the case, they still tirelessly immerse themselves in cultivation. They often quarrel with each other for a blade of grass on the edge of the field. Their diligence and patience are really beyond people's imagination. Take a washbasin, for example. In addition to being used for cooking, it is also used for washing. To put it bluntly, it is even used as a toilet. They are such hardworking people. The Chinese people are really a people worth marveling at. We should correct our previous erroneous understanding. A certain reporting director in Shanghai once said: "There are many great people in China, but unfortunately there is no one to command them." In fact, this is also true in Japan.

However, precisely because there is no one to command them, they can unite and work under the rule of Tianwei. This is truly the happiness of the people. In addition to correcting our understanding of the Chinese people, we should also know that true peace in Asia can only be established through mutual cooperation with the Republic of China, and we should advance together with the spirit of mutual concession and mutual respect. The concept of despising the Chinese people must be liquidated.

I have been to Shanghai several times, and I am not very clear about it myself. However, the face of Shanghai that I saw this time is completely different from the previous times. The Japanese concession is small, not to mention that foreign concessions are generally clean. After revisiting the old place after four years, I immediately felt a great beauty. When I told the locals about this feeling, they felt the same way. The Shanghai that I am talking about now is not just superficial beauty. Although the colors of various countries are still clearly remaining in the British and French concessions in order to eliminate the so-called "inter-concession" or "French concession" distinction, the shackles that have bound us for hundreds of years have finally been broken. Greater Shanghai has become an entire region, and we are more delighted with this change than anything else. And the disappearance of the arrogant postures of the British and Americans striding in front of us yellow people is even more delightful.

Old friends who were temporarily scattered due to the incident have returned one by one, and some have even held important positions in the Nanjing government. I don't like interacting with people very much, so I have very few people who can be called confidants. Once everyone gets along, our friendship often lasts for ten, twenty, or even thirty years without wavering. When these people see me coming, they always shake hands and talk happily.

There is currently a so-called Cultural Association in Shanghai, most of whom are wealthy officials who like to make a few strokes, but folk painters have no share. Occasionally, when a painting is finished, it is regarded as a treasure. Even a very simple one is a great effort for them.

There are now more than one hundred and forty or fifty people engaged in painting among the people. The famous ones include Fu Tien-nien, Chien Shou-tieh, Sun Song, Chi Sheng, etc. September 9th every year is Painter's Day. In addition to the above-mentioned people, the initiators include Hsia Ching-kuan, Chou Lien, Ho Tien-chien, Wang Hsien, Sun Hsueh-ni, etc. I heard from the Japanese that they collect paintings made by Sun Song. This person's paintings imitate Wu Changshuo and only get his superficiality. Those who are deeply poisoned by Wu have neither Wu's learning nor Wu's spirit. Many Japanese painters do not like Wu Changshuo's paintings, especially young writers. This is because Wu himself does not think he is a painter. Seal carving is his specialty, and the Chinese call him the first person since the Song Dynasty. This may be true. Seal carving flourished from the Han Dynasty and soon declined. In the late Ming and early Qing Dynasties, Ting Tun-ting and Ho Hsueh-yu emerged, and they were extremely popular for a time. In recent years, no one can be called a master. Wu Changshuo's poems are also known for their subtlety among modern Chinese people, not just for their rhetoric. I'm talking too far, let's get back to the topic.

Today, after the deaths of Wu Changshuo, Wang Yiting, and Yu Yushuang, Chien Shoutieh is the most recent leader in the Shanghai art world. This is not because of favoritism. He lived in my place for a long time in 1927 and returned to Shanghai a few years ago. He is forty-two years old this year and is gradually entering a mature stage. He is constantly working hard on ancient calligraphy and paintings. (翔: Translated from the Western Asahi Shimbun, April 20)

### Adaptation and Life

— Qi Luo

This is a world where the "fit" survive. If you cannot "adapt," you cannot survive. Therefore, daily life striving for survival is called "adaptation."

Every move in daily life is an act of "adaptation." The same thing will produce various different "adaptation" behaviors due to the different personalities of each person, and therefore many different results occur. "Adaptation" can bring satisfaction to people. Because human satisfaction is obtained based on two methods, "adaptation" can also be explained from two aspects.

Good "adaptation" can make a person energetic, happy, and strive to improve; making his life a meaningful "life," indirectly creating social progress. On the contrary, bad "adaptation" makes people lifeless, decadent, and focused on self-interest; only a "life" full of gray. Even if he is lucky enough to dominate in society for a while, he will eventually be eliminated by others and become a part of failure and destruction, despised by the world.

"Adaptation" behavior is not innate, but learned. It is very easy to form habits due to multiple "adaptations." Therefore, once bad "adaptation" has become a deeply rooted habit, it cannot be easily corrected. There are often many extremely bad "adaptation" behaviors, such as: cowardice, eccentricity, evasion of responsibility, procrastination, fear, terror, depression, and烦恼, which are all developed from childhood. After growing up, they become many factors of failure. Therefore, we must pay attention to our children's actions as soon as possible, cultivate their good "adaptation" behaviors, and prevent them from being discredited in the future.

The prerequisite for good "adaptation" behavior is that when we satisfy our personal motivations, we do not harm others. In addition, with rich knowledge, profound cultivation, and upright emotions and other great forces, good "adaptation" behavior can be produced.

Therefore, if we can properly "adapt" without complaining, then the god of "success" is waving to us frequently!

### Appreciating Flowers in the Kong Garden

— Zi Jian

Being trapped by official documents all day is not as good as the late spring. I happened to read a newspaper report that Kong Zhiqing was selling flowers to help the poor, and I suddenly had the desire to visit.

Kong Garden is located at the end of Shanzhong Road, surrounded by fences. Its width is less than one mu, and there is a thatched pavilion in the middle, which is a place for the owner to rest. As soon as I entered the garden, I faintly smelled a clear fragrance that penetrated my mind, and my heart felt refreshed. Looking up at the surroundings, there were potted plants and trees everywhere, and all kinds of potted flowers and trees were arranged without any omissions. Moreover, the scenery was full of poetic feelings, sparse shadows, quiet and leisurely. Looking down at close range, the spring was full of life, and pine, cypress, bamboo, and stones each showed their beauty. Such as the "Green Snow Protecting the Dragon" and "Zhang Bian Descending the Demon" scenes, are quite likable. Occasionally, there are one or two figures, dotted among them, which makes one feel the infinite scenery and is thought-provoking. There is also a rockery, less than a foot high, but the peaks, ridges, and ravines are deep and beautiful. There are three cypresses on the coffin, which are old and strong, dancing and welcoming people, which is the characteristic of the garden, making people envious. Later, I welcomed Mr. Kong in the thatched pavilion and asked about the method of bonsai. Mr. Kong smiled and replied: This way seems simple but is actually complicated, and cannot be fully explained in a short time. I sighed for a long time. Then, the sun was about to set, and the twilight was approaching, so I reluctantly returned.

### An "Artistic" View of "Life"

— Hai Lin

"Life" should be shaped, carved, and highlighted as meticulously as sculpture and painting, using the expression and ideal of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty."

"Human works" that express selfless emotions through "altruistic behavior" are the crystallization of "art." These "works" are one's own behavior and thoughts. Originally! A beautiful "life" is a precious artistic creation of mankind.

Both philosophy and art regard "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty" as the main "purpose" of life and the fundamental law of creation. Combining the two, it is nothing more than the starting point for creating one's own life and the essence of life.

"Truth" is "reason," and reason is buried under the surface phenomena, so it needs to be excavated. And "reason" is developing along with the reality of things, so it must be grasped in all aspects of the relationship between things and its development. Recognizing and pursuing reason is not an easy task, because we will inevitably use "habitual," "common-sense," and "subjective" views, so we must overcome these in order to seek reason. Therefore, how much reason a person can obtain can determine how much achievement he has.

The starting point of "Beauty" is "Truth." If it is not true, it is not "beautiful," so beauty and truth are closely related. The life in our "ideal" is a "beautiful" life. Loving beauty is a noble nature of mankind. The "beauty" of the soul is the starting point of all undertakings. The "beauty" that does not harm one's own morality and personality is one of the most important tasks in life.

"Goodness" is responsible behavior in personality. "Ultimate Goodness" is "Ultimate Beauty." "Good" behavior is the driving force of "Truth." The purpose of a person's life is nothing more than to obtain the fulfillment of "Goodness." To obtain it, one must start with self-cultivation.

In short, an "artistic view of life" is the essence of "life," it is unique and transcendent. "Art" cannot be separated from "life," and "life" cannot be separated from "art." The value and purpose of "life" are fundamentally based on the pursuit of the noble realm of "Truth," "Goodness," and "Beauty."

### Fate

— Xiao Chuang

The development of all things must have a certain internal basis, but its accidental form of discovery, that is to say, there are reasons for various conditional bases within the development process of a thing, and this is produced: but the form of discovery is not necessarily "accidental", this small certain form, is also a certain "inevitable" to produce, so the emergence or change of all things Kenzai carefully studied the internal development of the situation, will not feel that this is special of course, this is an unbreakable theorem.

But there are many people who do not study these, and all things are successful and failed because of "fate". Successful ones are of course included here, and failed ones are also included here. Even normal life is called "fate" like this, and it cannot be remedied.

Some people do not feel their own lack of effort and progress, but they feel that their "fate" is not good. Some people work very hard and make progress, but they do not understand the current situation of society, and they do not seek to understand these things. When their lives are not satisfied, they say that their "fate" is not good. Some people do not understand their own strengths and weaknesses. When they are proud, they think that their "fate" is good, and they do not use their own strengths and how to reduce their weaknesses. When they fail, they cannot be recovered, saying that their "fate" has begun to be bad, and they do not understand the reasons for failure? The so-called "wealth and honor are determined by fate, and life and death are in the hands of God" is a sentence that takes things for granted and blindly believes that this is the power of God and the arrangement of "fate", leading to this path. I don't know how many people have been harmed? I don't know how many hopeful and promising people have been ruined in the hands of the word "fate"? I also don't know who is doing evil and deceiving so many people for such a long period of time?
