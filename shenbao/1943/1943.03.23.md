### On the Way to National Prosperity and Strength

The relationship between participation in the war, national construction and industrial development, and politics and diplomacy, along with the expectations of the people, has been discussed in detail in the previous two commentaries. We believe that China's participation in the war is to seek the liberation of China and defend East Asia; the prerequisite for this is a strong China, otherwise it is all just empty talk. There are many aspects that China needs to work on to become strong, and the most important is the improvement of the national economic life.

China's past mistake was the failure to complete industrialization. In the future, the government and the people should work towards this goal; it is also hoped that friendly nations will provide full assistance in terms of tools, capital, talent, and technology. Because if China is not industrialized, the economic life of the people cannot be improved, China cannot become prosperous and strong, and Japan will bear too much unilateral responsibility. China has a vast territory, and the economic backgrounds of different regions are not entirely the same. Some are naturally suitable for agriculture, and some can only promote animal husbandry; but today, in the peaceful areas, most are suitable for modern industry. Even industrial animal husbandry should be regarded as a process of developing towards industrialization, and not as the final goal. In today's general economic life of the world, due to the increasing shortening of transportation distances, countries must communicate with each other and become one. The ideal of friendly nations is to help each other with resources and share what they have and don’t have, which is absolutely reasonable and close to reality. Our country's foreign economic policy is also based on this ideal, and we are willing to give as well as receive from all friendly countries. Therefore, we advocate that China should take industrialization as its goal, and today we should step up the confirmation of fundamental economic policies to lay the foundation for future national construction and industrial development. Our main work should focus on: (1) Conducting a thorough survey of national resources, which of them we are rich in and can share with friendly nations; which of them we own but lack capital, talent, and technology, and should jointly develop and utilize with friendly nations. Which of them are lacking in friendly nations but we are rich in, and can supply in large quantities. (2) Studying which regions have which specialties and are suitable for which industries, and all should be subject to comprehensive planning, thorough research, and proper allocation. (3) Now that countries should share what they have and don’t have and give full play to their strengths, the internal regions of our country should also exchange what they have and don’t have. The concept of boundaries between North China, Central China, and South China should be completely eliminated. (4) Our country has a vast land and abundant resources, and the government and the people should cooperate sincerely. For those that do not require government leadership, the people should be given ample opportunity to develop their strength. Furthermore, the scope of the economy is extremely broad, and the government should take charge of the overall economic situation today, formulate financial plans, and not lightly determine major economic plans for the convenience of finance. During the period of participation in the war, national expenses will inevitably be vast, and the government cannot but focus on finance, but in the future, the scope of financial facilities should be determined based on the interests of the national economy and the national economy, and it must achieve "making the best use of the land and the people," and then there will be hope for "national prosperity and strength."

Economy, politics, diplomacy, transportation, etc., are all closely related. To make the country prosperous and strong from the economic aspect and fulfill the responsibility of participating in the war during the war, it is necessary to comprehensively improve politics, universally improve political integrity, thoroughly realize streamlined administration, strengthen the diplomatic lineup, and seek closer cooperation with friendly nations. And the economy is more closely related to transportation. In the past, because the local areas were not completely pacified, the public and private lives suffered from the inconvenience of transportation, which can be described as deeply traumatizing. Fortunately, various places have gradually returned to normal, then if we want to talk about developing the economy in the future, we must first rectify transportation. If we can achieve smooth flow of goods with sincere cooperation between China and Japan, it will not only be convenient for both the public and private sectors, but also beneficial to the interests of China and Japan. Railways and highways are hoped to be utilized more rationally, while waterway transportation should also be fully developed in Central China, South China, and some provinces in North China. At the same time, improve and increase various auxiliary means of transportation, and strive to make every stream that can be navigated a place for ships to weave, and every road that can be rolled by wheels a place for vehicles to converge, then the meridians will be connected, and economic development will surely "achieve twice the result with half the effort." As for coastal and overseas transportation, all those that are helpful to the unification of South China, Central China, and North China, and those that are conducive to the connection between China, Japan, Manchukuo, and various places in Nanyang, are also hoped that Chinese and Japanese experts will jointly study and plan, and the government should also plan as early as possible. In short, China's prosperity and strength is the main stabilizing force for liberating China and defending East Asia. Not only our country, but also friendly people, should also give more encouragement and assistance.

Translated Commentary

### The Seven-Ocean Navy and the Relations Between Britain and the United States

U.S. Secretary of the Navy Knox once stated in the House of Representatives: "If the United States only has a two-ocean navy, it will not be able to meet the needs. It must be equipped with a large navy sufficient to control the seven oceans of the world." Competing with this proposition was the boast of Secretary of War Stimson not long after, who said: "By the end of 1943, we will have an army of 8.2 million, and this plan is not to build a defensive army, but to take an immediate offensive, because we must seize the good opportunity that has arrived and end the war in the shortest possible time." In this way, the two authorities of the sea and land competed to publish their huge plans to incite their people. Needless to say, it was just a clumsy strategy to deceive their deep worries about defeat with fictitious numbers.

In particular, Knox, he is not only dreaming of building a seven-ocean navy, but also making such arrogant remarks on the practical issues: "The United States has built twice as many battleships as it has lost in the Pacific waters since the start of the war. Therefore, in March, we will give Japan a major blow." Even if the repeated announcements of the U.S. Navy authorities boasting about the rapid progress of their shipbuilding projects can be fully believed, the number of battleships commissioned since the start of the war is only four Washington-class ships and two ships entering the water. As for aircraft carriers and cruisers, there are very few. Comparing this with Japan's great achievements—sinking eleven battleships, eleven aircraft carriers, fifty-seven cruisers, and fifty-four destroyers—the ships they have built are not enough to replenish even half of them. What the U.S. Navy publishes is often used to deceive its people to avoid the responsibility for its defeat, but the cold numbers prove it without any regret.

However, what can be called a farce here is that Britain, which relies on the military build-up of the United States, fights with weapons made in the United States, and welcomes the U.S. troops dispatched to the mainland with food and drinks, is also greatly disturbed by Knox's delirium and reveals suspicious emotions. Needless to say, the recent hardening trend of British public opinion towards the United States is not only manifested because of the seven-ocean navy. A few days ago, British Colonial Secretary Stanley gave a speech at Oxford University, saying that the West Indies, which Britain leased to the United States in exchange for fifty destroyers, constitutes the territory of the British Empire. In response, U.S. Vice President Wallace and Undersecretary of State Welles simultaneously stated: "The temporary military bases set up in Central and South America will of course be returned when the war ends, but the bases outside the Americas belong to us," thereby implying the permanent occupation of the West Indies. In particular, Senator Miller Tydings once made such arrogant remarks: "Britain must first declare the transfer of the leased islands as an absolute condition for revising the Military Lending Act."

In this way, just as an atmosphere of unease was brewing in British political circles, the U.S. United Press reported the countermeasure news that the United States now intends to appoint New York Mayor La Guardia as the Governor-General of North Africa for the inauguration of British North African Resident Minister Macmillan. Of course, the Washington authorities remained silent on this news from the Associated Press, but that silence made Britain feel unhappy. Therefore, it is inevitable that the public opinion is hardened because the United States has the ambition to occupy North Africa.

It is needless to say that Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union have different dreams in the same bed, but where is the future of British-American coordination? At this time, the war is in full swing, and the struggle between the snipe and the clam can be said to be the inevitable fate of the imperialist war in the end.

The consistent spirit is to assist China in completing its independence and autonomy and achieving its development. Since the signing of the agreement, it has only been more than two months, and it has been implemented and fulfilled step by step, which shows your country's determination to fulfill its promises, which is even more gratifying.

Our country has long wanted to recover the administrative rights of the Legation Quarter, but because the relationship is more complicated, it has not been realized until now. Now, your country has first agreed to our country's recovery, so that this unnatural state in the past can be resolved. I am convinced that other related countries will follow suit and promote their friendly spirit and agree with our country's claim. The National Government is currently in consultation with other related countries. The clauses signed with your country today are very appropriate. I am convinced that other related countries will understand our country's determination to recover and accept the same content as these clauses, so that the recovery of the area can be realized as soon as possible.

Various Countries Will Return Soon

Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegram: The Beijing Legation Quarter was established in 1901 based on the Boxer Rebellion. It is a rectangular area about 1,200 meters long from east to west and about 65 meters wide from north to south, with an area of about 200 acres. It is commonly known as Dongjiaomin Lane. The countries with treaty relations include eleven countries, including Japan, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, the United States, Spain, Belgium, Austria, Hungary, the Netherlands, and the Soviet Union. According to the treaty, the Qing government recognized that the area where each country was located was for the use of the legations of each country, and the police power in the same area was attributed to the legations of each country. The Chinese people had no right to reside, and the area was recognized as an armed zone of each country. Therefore, the situation in the area at that time had become a special administrative area. Chinese people, except for the employees of the legations, had no right to reside. All administration was subject to the instructions of the chairman of the diplomatic corps of the countries. Our country has repeatedly wanted to recover this special area, but because the relationship is complicated, it has not been realized for a while. Today, Austria and Hungary, which were treaty countries at that time, have disappeared. The rights and interests of the United Kingdom and the United States have also been declared abandoned by the National Government when our country participated in the war. Japan has first recognized that our country has recovered the area, so it is expected that other related countries will also return it to the National Government.

Foreign Minister Chu's Speech

Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegram: After the Chinese and Japanese authorities signed the clauses and understandings on the Beijing Legation Quarter, the Foreign Minister made a special statement. The original text is recorded below. After our country and Japan signed the detailed clauses on the return of the Japanese-controlled concessions on the 14th of this month, the implementation clauses on the recovery of the Beijing Legation Quarter were signed today, and it was also stipulated that they would be implemented on the 30th of this month, which is the anniversary of the return of the capital. It can be seen that Japan is actively fulfilling its promises.

The establishment of the Beijing Legation Quarter began in 1901. In the name of self-defense, it implemented monopolistic administration, which was a bad example in the international community. Although the area of the area is small, it is like an enemy. This special state has been established for more than 40 years. Now, due to the change of circumstances, the reason for its existence has long disappeared. Our country has wanted to recover its administrative rights for a long time. Because the relationship is more complicated, it has been delayed until now and has not been successful. The friendly country Japan, in order to assist our country's independent development, not only returned all its exclusive concessions, but also first agreed to our country's recovery of the Legation Quarter. Its enthusiasm and determination to assist our country are deeply appreciated.

Since Germany and other countries recognized the National Government last year, the European countries have taken the same steps one after another and sent diplomats to reside in our country one after another. The friendly relations are improving day by day. Since our country participated in the war on January 9 this year, the relationship with allied Japan and friendly European countries has become closer. In order to eliminate the obstacles to political and economic development and complete independence and autonomy, our country must recover the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. Although the Legation Quarter is not a concession, the organization of its autonomous administrative organs is similar to that of the concessions. Now our country is determined to recover it, and the friendly country Japan first agrees, and the implementation clauses have been signed today, and the content is appropriate, and can be used as a model. It is thought that other related countries can accept it in the same way. Now our country is seeking to increase its friendship with various countries that have established normal diplomatic relations. The special state of the above-mentioned Legation Quarter really has no reason to exist. It is expected that other related countries can agree with our country's claim to recover it. Now our country is discussing this issue with related countries and many have expressed their agreement. Moreover, it can be seen that the friendly spirit of these countries. After the technical details are agreed upon, the recovery can be fully implemented. And it is deeply believed that the friendly relations between our country and the friendly countries will be further enhanced without a doubt.

Minister Hao Fu's Speech

Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency Telegram: Minister Hao Fu of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China made a speech at 12:00 noon on the 22nd regarding the return of the Beijing Legation Quarter. The general idea is as follows: "The return of the Beijing Legation Quarter is the elimination of the last legacy of the era when Britain, the United States, and the powers divided China. It has epoch-making significance for China's autonomy and independence. The Japanese government first recognized China's recovery of the administrative rights of the area on January 9 this year, and according to the agreement of this month, the Japanese administrative rights will be returned to China on the anniversary of the return of the National Government this year. As for the enemy countries of Britain and the United States among the contracting countries of the Legation Quarter, the National Government declared the abandonment of the treaty after participating in the war, so the issue has been resolved. Regarding the remaining countries, the National Government is currently discussing the recovery policy."

The Chongqing army's attempt to counter-attack was completely crushed. It is reported that the Chongqing army's action was an attempt to recapture the Yunnan-Burma Road, but due to the speed of the Japanese army's operations, this attempt by the Chongqing army completely failed.

Tokyo, 22nd - Central News Agency: In recognition of the many meritorious services rendered by the Burmese Bhamo Administrator and others who are visiting Japan in cooperating with the Japanese army during the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Emperor specially bestowed medals on them today. Bhamo Administrator was awarded the First Class Order of the Rising Sun with Paulownia Flowers, Minister of Home Affairs Thakinnu Mya and Minister of Finance Thakin Nu were awarded the Second Class Order of the Sacred Treasure, and Defense Army Commander Win Kyi Major General was awarded the Third Class Order of the Rising Sun with Middle Cordon.

### Japan Salvages Sunken Ships in the South Seas

Tokyo, 22nd - Central News Agency: Japanese salvage vessel expert Rear Admiral Hashiguchi stated that Japanese divers are now using their superior technology to salvage enemy ships sunk in the South Seas. At a time when efforts are being made to build ships, it is commendable to hear of the good results of salvage ships in various places. The total number of these salvaged ships is no less than the number currently under construction. Fortunately, most of the enemy ships were sunk in the South Seas, where the climate is good, making the work naturally easier.

### Japan-Thailand Academic Exchange Becomes Closer

Bangkok, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Japan is now actively engaged in medical research in Thailand. The Bangkok Tropical Disease Institute, a branch of the Taiwan Tropical Disease Institute, is sparing no effort in the study of tropical diseases, and its reports are sent to Japan on a regular basis for reference. Japan has also sent a military delegation to neighboring countries to inspect the local situation. Japan and Thailand are also exchanging professors and students to engage in medical research.

### Crew Members of Soviet Ship Kola Rescued by Japanese Ship

Moji, 22nd - Central News Agency: Four Soviet crew members of the freighter "Kola," which was sunk by a torpedo in the East China Sea on February 17, were rescued by a Japanese ship and left Shimonoseki for Tokyo yesterday. They had been drifting in a lifeboat for 17 days until they were rescued by a Japanese ship south of Kyushu on March 5. They expressed extreme hatred for the United States. It is said that when they felt the torpedo explode, although they could not identify the attacker, they later pondered the time and place of the incident and were convinced that the ship that sunk them was an American submarine. In our desperation, we are now able to regain our health and are on our way home. It is truly like a dream. We were exhausted when we were rescued, and we are deeply grateful to the Japanese warship for providing medical care, entertainment, and clothing.

### Italian Consulate Established in Saigon

Saigon, 22nd - Central News Agency: Italian Consul Maleri was previously ordered to come to Saigon to prepare for the establishment of the Italian Consulate. Now that all preparations have been completed, it has been officially announced today that it has been established and has begun operations. It is reported that Italy will also establish a consulate in Hanoi in the near future.

### Hitler Announces to the People He Will Never Discuss Peace Again; Number of German Soldiers Killed in This War Only One-Quarter of That in Previous World War

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Thousands of Berlin residents witnessed the demeanor of Fuehrer Hitler and Marshal Goering yesterday, which is enough to prove that Goebbels' statement to the press a few days ago that the British and American rumors that the German Fuehrer was ill were completely untrue. Although the wrinkles on the German Fuehrer's face have increased compared to before, he is full of energy and shows no signs of illness. The war in the past three and a half years has made Fuehrer Hitler's face more solemn and his voice more serious. Fuehrer Hitler's speech yesterday was delivered in his capacity as Commander-in-Chief of the German Army. From a political point of view, he still adheres to the viewpoint he adopted on November 8 last year. He announced to the people, "We will never discuss peace again. The day this war ends will also be the day when the countries that join hands with the Bolsheviks collapse, and the British Empire will also collapse as a result of its crimes." Fuehrer Hitler then severely criticized Churchill's policies, which are completely opposed to the German foreign policy elaborated in his book "Mein Kampf." Regarding the new order in Europe, which has been discussed extensively recently, the German Fuehrer did not directly mention it yesterday, probably because yesterday's speech was of a military nature. The Fuehrer continued, saying that the crisis on the Eastern Front had been safely passed, and all restrictions on the soldiers on the front line had been lifted. Hitler finally announced that the number of German soldiers killed was 542,000. In order to show the accuracy of this figure, he compared it with the losses of the German army in the First World War. According to the four and a half years of the First World War, the losses of the German army were 2,036,897, plus the losses of Germans in the Austro-Hungarian army were 420,000. The number of German losses in this three-and-a-half-year war is only a quarter of that in the First World War. This is because the losses of the German army were extremely small at the beginning of the German-Soviet war.

### Churchill Speech: Post-War Plan; Believes War Will Be Protracted

Lisbon, 22nd - Allied News Agency: British Prime Minister Churchill gave a radio address last night, saying briefly: Some people think the war will end soon. I am really unable to be so optimistic. In fact, the war may be delayed for another year or even two. Therefore, it is foolish to discuss the issue of national borders while this war is in full swing. Churchill then explained his four-year post-war plan, such as guaranteeing unemployment, national health, and universal education. However, post-war taxes will be heavier than before.

Stockholm, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: London Telegraph, British Prime Minister Churchill gave a radio speech last night, briefly outlining the plan to create a European Parliament. His words were brief: This organization should become a powerful alliance that can enforce its resolutions through national or international forces. In addition to the great powers, all small countries should also join it, but it should be premised on meeting the interests of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union. But it is the act of fools to discuss post-war issues and disputed boundaries at this time. Churchill continued, the Beveridge Plan is a four-year plan to improve social conditions and avoid repeating the mistakes of 25 years ago. Churchill ended by saying, the British Eighth Army has now launched an offensive in North Africa.

German Commentary

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: An important official of the German Foreign Ministry told Fischer, a foreign affairs reporter of Haitong News Agency, Churchill's announcement of the post-war plan clearly wants to eliminate the negative impression of the British press's criticism of Poland's territorial demands on the Soviet Union. However, Churchill's plan does not guarantee the people of Poland and the Baltic countries. Churchill believes that a group of small countries can stop Bolshevization, but he has forgotten the failure of the League of Nations' collective security mechanism. Churchill's four-year plan to improve social conditions seems progressive to backward Britons, but in Germany, this problem has long been solved. In order to please the conservatives, Churchill stated that there is still room for personal automatic development under the planned economy. Churchill warned the British people about the war situation that victory is still difficult to achieve, and the Allies have very few chances of winning this year.

### German Army Launches Fierce Attack on Upper Donets; War Situation Enters Emergency Stage; Soviet Union Admits Loss of Belgrade

Stockholm, 22nd - Allied News Agency: The Kharkov-Belgorod Railway on the Eastern Front has now completely fallen into the hands of the German army, and the German army is launching a fierce counter-offensive to the east and northeast on a broad front. According to Reuters from Moscow, the Southern Soviet army's offensive is strengthening, and Moscow is quite anxious. The German army is attacking Yuguev, 30 kilometers southeast of Kharkov, with particular ferocity. This move is enough to threaten the right wing of the Red Army along the Voroshilovgrad-Rostov line, and even its rear. German aircraft are heavily bombing the Donets line, and large-scale air battles occur every day. The Soviet side has strengthened its special air force, as well as infantry, tanks, and artillery.

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: A message from the British visitor in Moscow claimed that the battle in the Upper Donets region has entered an emergency stage. German tank forces had breached Togoyev yesterday morning, and Soviet forces were forced to retreat twice to new positions in the past 24 hours. The Soviet-held bridgehead west of Izium on the west bank of the Donets was also under fierce attack by the German army.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 22nd - Havas News Agency: The focus of the war situation on the Eastern Front is still in the South today. The Soviet Union issued a communique last night admitting that the city of Belgrade had fallen. According to German sources today, the German army continued to make progress on the upper reaches of the Donets River. A German communique also stated that the section of the Donets River from the city of Belgrade to the city of Kharkov is now completely under the control of the German army. The Red Army has transferred reinforcements from other war zones to the Donets River front line. A message from Moscow stated that the war situation there is very "critical." In Berlin, it is said that the Red Army's repeated counter-offensives have been repelled. According to the latest news from Moscow, the Red Army is now guarding the Donets River line southeast of the city of Kharkov, and the pressure is increasing, especially in the Chuguev area where fierce fighting is taking place. To the north, the German army, which occupied the city of Seversk, is intensifying its pressure on the city of Kursk, because this is the Red Army's last stronghold on the Orel-Kharkov railway. According to German sources, the Red Army in the Orel area has stopped its offensive, probably because the Red Army has suffered too many casualties in that area, or perhaps the Red Army in that area had to be transferred to other areas for combat, which is also possible.

Soviet Army Launches Offensive on Northern Route; Polotzk Heavily Bombed by German Aircraft

22nd - Havas News Agency: As for the war situation in the central route, there is actually no change. The Red Army continues to attack the city of Dorogobuzh, while the German army continues to counter-attack south of the city of Bely, without success. The Soviet side announced that the Red Army had recovered several locations in the central route, including the Vardino station. At present, the Red Army is fighting on the west bank of the upper reaches of the Dnieper River. Soviet General Timoshenko has also launched an offensive north of Lake Ilmen, but it does not seem to have made progress. The German defenses are solid, and they are resolutely resisting everywhere.

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Responsible officials here announced last night that on the night of the 20th, Soviet aircraft had heavily bombed a Soviet airfield west of Bologoye. Bologoye is located northwest of Moscow, at the intersection of the Leningrad-Moscow railway and the Pskov-Rybinsk railway. At that time, several buildings at the airfield were hit and caught fire.

### Diplomats Gather in Washington; Speculation About Eden's Mission to the United States

Buenos Aires, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: British Foreign Secretary Eden and British Ambassador to the United States Halifax returned to Washington today from New York. Chongqing's Ambassador to the United Kingdom Gu Weijun, US Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, and Chongqing's military attache to the United States arrived in Miami, Florida today by plane from Chongqing.

Stockholm, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: A report from the Swedish Daily News in London stated that there are many different speculations as to what Eden's mission to the United States is, but one point is generally the same: the United States' views on post-war policy are different from those of the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union. It is only natural that Eden is attempting to persuade the United States to adopt the same position as the United Kingdom and the Soviet Union.

### British Military Delegation to the Soviet Union; Martel Appointed Leader

Lisbon, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to news from London, the British War Office announced that Lieutenant General Martel has been appointed leader of the British delegation to the Soviet Union, succeeding General Miles. Martel is a tank expert who has written books on tanks, which have been translated into Russian. In 1936, Martel visited Moscow with General Wavell. After the outbreak of the European war, he served as commander of the 58th Infantry Division and participated in the Dunkirk battle.

### Elite British and American Troops Begin Action; Major Battle Unfolds in Tunisia; Northern Coastal Area Occupied by Axis Forces

Fuehrer Headquarters, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Today's German military report stated that elite British and American troops in southern and central Tunisia have launched a major offensive. Fierce fighting is taking place on both land and air fronts.

Rome, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Italian military headquarters announced this afternoon that the hard battle in Tunisia is progressing. Yesterday, after heavy artillery bombardment, Allied forces launched a fierce attack on the central and southern sectors. Axis air forces participated in the battle, attacking enemy transport lines and advancing troops. Italian aircraft bombed Bone Harbor and Bougie Harbor, and the enemy suffered losses. Italian torpedo planes attacked enemy ships anchored in Algiers Harbor last night, sinking one 10,000-ton ship, setting a medium-sized vessel on fire, and hitting two other ships.

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to news received here last night from the North African front, German and Italian joint forces continued to advance in northern Tunisia. The entire coastal area as far as the Alag River, 20 kilometers northeast of Tabarka, has been occupied by Axis forces. The Tabarka-Béja coastal road used by the British Eighth Army to transport supplies has now been cut off. The section of the road that crosses the high ground of Abi Woode has also been occupied by Axis tank forces. The Axis forces have captured a great deal of spoils of war in this campaign and captured more than 2,000 enemy troops. Allied forces launched an offensive in central and southern Tunisia on the evening of the 20th, but no major battle has yet taken place. In southern Tunisia, the US 1st Armored Division has advanced eastward from Gafsa, with the apparent goal of reaching the Mediterranean coast and flanking General Rommel's tank forces. The British Eighth Army is advancing northeast in the central sector, but German aircraft are active and have made their progress very difficult.

### Greek Government Moves to Cairo

Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: After the news that the Greek government-in-exile has moved from London to Cairo, diplomatic circles here are paying close attention. Responsible officials in Ankara predict that the Allies will take military action in the eastern Mediterranean, and this is the first sign. In the past, before the British army attacked Abyssinia, Negus was taken to East Africa, which can serve as a lesson.

Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Turkish military delegation sent to the Tunisian border has a total of 12 members, led by Generals Womultak and Noyan. They took a US plane south. It is heard that Eisenhower and Giraud will entertain them.

### International Briefs: General Giraud Travels to North Africa

Ankara, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: General Giraud flew from Beirut to Algiers today to participate in a meeting with Tegel and Giraud to mediate.

Tangier, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The "Tangier Echo" fought and said that General Tegel is still hesitating about whether to go to Algiers, because Algiers has abolished the laws promulgated by Roche and appointed General Giraud as the leader.

Tangier, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: Algiers news, French Minister to Finland Ganlin has now joined the Giraud faction. Ganlin has long since left his post in Helsinki.

### Germany and Italy Exchange Prisoners with Britain

Istanbul, 23rd - Central News Agency: According to a cable from Ankara, Germany, Italy, and Britain exchanged prisoners, which began on the morning of the 22nd at Mersin Port, southwest of Adana, Turkey.

### Overview of German Arms Production

Berlin, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: According to the manager of a German arms factory, the number of bombs produced at the same time is now four times higher than before the outbreak of the European war. The amount of steel required to manufacture a 250 kg bomb is now 70 kg less than before, the number of other part workers has been reduced to one-fifth, and the amount of power consumed has also been reduced by 88 percent. 78 percent of the factory's employees are foreigners, and 80 percent of them live near the factory.

### Indian Poetess Naidu Released

Bangkok, 22nd - Haitong News Agency: The Indian poetess Naidu, who was arrested for almost two years, has been ordered to be released by the authorities due to serious illness.

### Air Combat Roundtable Between Japan and the US - Continued - From Air Raid Routes to Various Defense Methods

Why Doesn't Japan Have an Aviation Ministry? Both Japan and the US Have Separate Army and Navy Air Forces.

Reporter: Now let's talk more about the possibility of establishing an aviation ministry. Has the question of establishing an aviation ministry been raised a long time ago?

Fujita: This question is not within the military scope. It doesn't refer to an Air Force Ministry. Does it refer to the Air Force? Is it intended to change the Aviation Bureau of the Ministry of Communications into a ministry?

Reporter: It refers to the Air Force.

Fujita: Does that mean wanting to separate the Air Force from the Army and Navy?

Reporter: Logically, that's what it means.

Fujita: I think it's better for Japan to maintain the status quo.

Oonishi: Because the tasks are different.

Fujita: Although the independence of the Air Force has developed smoothly in foreign countries, it is better for Japan to remain as it is now.

Oonishi: Perhaps only Japan and the United States have aviation in the naval aspect in particular. This is because Japan and the United States must wage war in the Pacific. This is the reason why the naval aspect has a special air force. Sometimes the British Air Force is independent, sometimes attached to other departments, but now it seems that it is not attached to the Army and Navy. Perhaps the Air Force is unified.

Fujita: It's not like that now.

Oonishi: At first, the air force of the Army and the Navy was divided, because each had special tasks. If they are not divided like this, I think that the strengths of both sides will be erased in the future.

Nakajima: It seems that it is better to keep the status quo, as His Excellency Oonishi has pointed out.

Oonishi: But there is no intention to merge the air forces of the Army and Navy into an independent Air Force Ministry at present.

Honne: Some people say that the status quo also has difficulties, and Germany has an independent air force department, so our country can be changed to an independent one. Although there is this faction, I think that foreign countries have special circumstances, and Japan has special circumstances. It is right for foreign countries to change to an independent Air Force Ministry, but it is not necessarily right for Japan.

Oonishi: German aircraft are all land-based aircraft. When the Bismarck battleship was sunk before, although the aircraft flew to assist, they did not find the battlefield and flew back. This is because there is no habit of flying at sea. In short, if maritime training is not conducted with the fleet, no results can be achieved no matter what.

Honne: Generally speaking, although the ocean is wide, navigation seems easy, but it is actually very difficult.

Oonishi: Although ships sailing in the sea are very wide and it seems that they are not easy to collide with each other, in fact, they sometimes collide with each other, even to the point of sinking.

Honne: Even if you pay attention to looking ahead in your own direction, you still need technical skills.

Oonishi: The sea surface is different from the land, and there is no need to "stop" such trouble, but navigation still requires considerable training.

Reporter: Let's go back to the previous question and please teach us about how military aircraft will develop.

Oonishi: That's the stratosphere I just talked about.

Reporter: Stratosphere and long distance problems have been mentioned before, but please teach us more.

Okada: Stratosphere flight is when flying in, but when bombing, it is in the air at 10,000 meters. In short, if you don't fly low, it is very difficult to drop bombs on the target.

Matsuura: Can the platform for bombing large cities be bombed from high altitude?

Okada: Isn't it written at 4,000 meters in "Essentials of Air Defense"? If bombing at an altitude higher than this, it will make people on the ground look down on it, saying it is too timid, so the impact on the ground will be weakened. Bombing at a high altitude makes it difficult to hit the target, and on the other hand, it is not enough to scare people, so bombing must be carried out in a suitable sky. Besides, intimidation is one of the main tasks of air raids.

Abe: Of course, the effect is like this!

Fujita: Because high altitude is always blowing strong winds from all directions, it is very difficult to hit from high altitude.

The outline of the future air war between Japan and the United States is only favorable for Japan to bomb the United States.

Okada: Hitting the target and influencing people's hearts is the purpose of an air raid.

Abe: Perhaps letting people hear some explosions or letting people see some tragic scenes may have a greater effect.

Oonishi: How difficult it is to overlook the ground when flying to an altitude of more than 13,000 meters. Only when the weather is clear can the boundary between water and land be seen.

Matsuura: It is easy to look down, but difficult to look up. So it is easy for people above to find targets below. When dozens or hundreds of aircraft fly over, they will naturally not look for targets to drop bombs one by one.

Abe: Also, there is a big difference in the technical proficiency of each bomber.

Honne: If a sight cannot be invented, stratosphere aircraft may not be used for bombing in the next year or two, but now high-speed aircraft are being produced in large quantities, and mechanically beautiful aircraft are also being manufactured with each passing day. Whether it is a military aircraft or a transport aircraft, yesterday's aircraft becomes an antique today.

Reporter: Is Japan currently researching stratosphere aircraft?

Honne: Japan is researching whatever foreign countries are researching.

Fujita: Japan may have achieved considerable success, but it just can't be said.

Honne: Everyone thought that the parachute troops had it and they didn't, but as a result, their teachings are quite complete.

Fujita: The question is that we must be ahead and not behind.

Reporter: In this way, maybe it's easy for us to bomb New York!

West: That's impossible. Although the speed of the plane is very fast, it's not that fast. It's still 30 percent slower.

Matsuura: It's definitely not as fast as you say.

Oonishi: It's probably almost there with about 30 percent more speed.

Matsuura: This is obtained by mathematical methods.

Oonishi: If this is the case, it is possible, when going there is a westerly wind, and when coming back is an easterly wind, as long as it is downwind both ways, it is of course possible to bomb. But it is always a westerly wind, and when you come back, it becomes a headwind, and when you go, it is a tailwind.

Fujita: It's very inconvenient when you come back. (Laughter) Then you can go around the earth when you come back.

Reporter: Let's end here! Thank you all for taking time out of your busy schedules to come and give us advice. (Translated by Ji from the February issue of Industrial World)

### Review of the Soviet Winter Counter-Offensive: Failed to Achieve Expected Goals

(Berlin, 11th, Dōmei News Agency) The Soviet winter counter-offensive, despite reports of Stalin personally going to the front to command, has failed to achieve its expected goals due to an unexpectedly early thaw and a fierce German counter-attack on the southern front. Instead, the Soviet Union finds itself in a position where it must prepare for a German summer offensive. A military reporter from the German News Agency, on the 11th, compared and reviewed the Red Army's initial goals with the results so far, and made the following comments.

There is no doubt that the Red Army's goals in this counter-offensive were, first, to recapture Ukraine; second, to force the German army back to the Dnieper River; and third, to recapture the Crimean Peninsula to restore control of the Black Sea. This view can be understood simply by looking at the traces of the Red Army's advance in February, and it is what the Soviet Union itself has declared. One of the most important results of the German army's elastic defense strategy is that the Red Army saw "weaknesses" rather than "strategies" in the German defense line.

On February 5, Soviet military experts wrote an article entitled "The German Army Has No Other Option But to Retreat to the Dnieper River and Await the Red Army's New Offensive," and said that "the only way to stop the German army's retreat is to launch a surprisingly local offensive." However, the "deployment of the situation" is already underway, but it is not worth calling it "surprising." The Red Army's high command, believing that it had penetrated the Donets line, launched several armies in the direction of Dnipropetrovsk and Zaporozhye, and dug its own grave in that area.

The annihilation of these Red Army troops can be said to have opened a new era in the third year of the German-Soviet war. The German army has regained the upper hand on this broad front, repelling the Red Army from most of Ukraine, and preventing the Red Army from reaching the vast resources of the Donets, perhaps permanently. In the past two weeks, the German army's attack units, like a rising tide, have begun to advance eastward; now the center of the battle is the area south of Kharkiv and the area south of Orel, especially in the latter battlefield, where the Red Army is continuing its inevitable counter-offensive in an attempt to reverse its previous setbacks. German authorities have said that "because elite troops have been transferred to the main battlefield, the central front has been allowed to counter-attack by the Red Army": but it is not difficult to understand that the purpose of the Red Army's large-scale offensive on this front is to recapture the Baltic countries.

Communism is a deadly danger to any country in Europe. The people of the Baltic countries are well aware of this, so they have all participated in this European war and are fighting against the Soviet Union. According to the German army authorities, citizens of Latvia and Lithuania are currently organizing volunteer armies, and Estonian volunteers have already taken on one wing of the German army's defense and are participating in the anti-communist war. Under these circumstances, the Soviet Union's attempt to recapture the three Baltic countries is not easy to achieve. (Translated by Ding from the March 14th Yomiuri Hōchi)

### German Army Grabs the Initiative - The Meaning of Taking Kharkov

(Berlin, 12th Special Dispatch) The German army on the southern front of the Eastern Front broke through the enemy's defense line in Kharkov, rushed into the city one after another, swept through the northern and western areas, and occupied the Red Square in the center of the city. Street fighting is still continuing in the southern area, but its annihilation is only a matter of time. Only three weeks after the city was captured by the Red Army, it will now return to German hands. In this German attack on Kharkov, the main force, under the cover of tank units, advanced in one breath, cutting off the Red Army units deployed on the vast front into several sections, and then annihilating them one by one. Moreover, it overcame countless swamps, small rivers, hills, mountains, forests, and other natural adverse conditions. Such an amazing advance by the German army cannot but be praised. As for the true significance of this battle, it can be described in the following three points.

First, due to the German army's widespread encirclement and simultaneous general advance, the Red Army could no longer carry out any organized resistance except for local resistance. As a result of this general advance, three armies of the Red Army were annihilated, and the attached tank units and mechanized squadrons were also thoroughly defeated, and the results of the battle are still expanding. The losses of the Red Army corps are known to be extremely large.

Second, as a result of the general counter-offensive, in addition to reoccupying a vast area, the German army more importantly captured and annihilated a large number of Red Army troops. According to reports from the front, the Red Army on other fronts is retreating for fear of repeating the mistakes of the past.

Third, the impact of this battle on other fronts cannot be ignored. Because the Red Army's large-scale counter-offensive attempt on the entire front was completely lost due to the great defeat in the Kharkov area, and the initiative in the battle was completely seized by the German army.

In this way, the German army's territory in the area surrounded by the Donets, Dnieper, and Mius rivers has been comprehensively strengthened, and a favorable situation has been prepared for the future spring offensive. Even in the central war zone of the Eastern Front, which is under the superiority of the Red Army, the initiative in the war will be completely controlled by the German army, taking the Battle of Kharkov as an opportunity. Even in the Vyazma area, the Red Army does not have enough reserves to catch up with the strategic retreat of the German army, so the retreating German army can consolidate its new defense line at ease with its rear guard. (Translated by Ding from the March 14th Yomiuri Hōchi)

### The Contradictions Between Britain and the US Towards the Soviet Union - Three Countries Contain Three Kinds of Interests

(Special Correspondent from Zöhrlikdorf, 15th) The complex interests of Britain and the United States in relation to the Soviet Union have become apparent since the Casablanca Conference. Recently, due to the "slip of the tongue" issue of US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Standley, it has become even more difficult to resolve. However, the fact that the relationship between these three countries, especially the US and the Soviet Union, is showing a deep-seated opposition, while Britain is taking a mediating stance between the US and the Soviet Union, is noteworthy. It can be said that the purpose of British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States this time is to adjust the relationship between the US and the Soviet Union.

Recently, the US policy towards the Soviet Union was fully stated in the demand made by US Vice President Wallace the other day that "in order for cooperation between the US, Britain, and the Soviet Union to be possible, the Soviet Union should first abandon its world revolution movement." That is, the United States wants to understand the future policies of the Soviet Union before deciding its policy towards the Soviet Union. However, the biggest concern of the United States is what policies the Soviet Union will adopt towards Chongqing and others in the future. On this point, the recent claim by Senator Hillaire has clearly pointed it out, saying: "If Stalin's war aims are not clear, the United States cannot establish a future world plan." It goes without saying that Roosevelt hoped to meet with Stalin around the time of the Casablanca Conference, based on the above-mentioned policy, but Stalin has always turned a deaf ear to Roosevelt's request for a meeting. It is a well-known fact that the United States wants to use the lease of the Siberian base to make the Soviet Union participate in the East Asian war. However, at the same time, the United States is wary of the Soviet Union's actions, which is also worth noting. However, what should be pointed out here is that former US Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Bullitt, once made the following public statement on the US policy towards the Soviet Union:

"If the policy of a foreign government does not meet the hopes of the United States, then we must make efforts to make it act according to our wishes. To achieve this goal, there are two methods. Those two methods can be compared to the example of driving a donkey. The first is to use a carrot to lure it to the donkey's nose, and the second is to whip its ass. Such a comparison is easy to understand."

Is the US carrot to the Soviet Union military aid or the strengthening of the debt? Or the unfolding of the Second Front? Let's put it aside for now. However, Standley's slip of the tongue can be regarded as a "slip of the tongue" of a kind of aversion to the Soviet Union's consciousness, and the issue of the Siberian base can be regarded as the United States taking a policy with what Bullitt calls a "whip."

Britain, which is in the middle and has a relatively friendly relationship with both the US and the Soviet Union, is now putting its efforts into mediating between the two. However, there is also the Polish issue standing in the way of the British-Soviet relationship, so it is gradually facing a dead end, which is also worth noting. That is, the Polish government-in-exile, citing the Atlantic Charter, claims to guarantee post-war independence (of course, that refers to the victory of the anti-Axis powers), while the Soviet Union thoroughly insists on annexing Poland without giving way. If Britain is loyal to the Atlantic Charter, then it must realize that it may cause the Soviet Union to leave the anti-Axis camp; if it listens to the Soviet Union's demands, then the Atlantic Charter, the only war aim of Britain and the United States, will be fundamentally negated, and it will fall into a difficult situation of causing the overall defection of small governments-in-exile such as Belgium, Poland, Czechoslovakia, Yugoslavia, and Greece. The British political world has been discussing this issue, but recently, Edward Hallett Carr, who is famous for signing the "peace conditions," sent an article to the London Times on the 10th of this month, stating his views on the issue of close cooperation between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union as follows:

"It is impossible to guarantee the security of Western Europe without solving the East European question. At this time, what we should especially remember is the failure of the East European delimitation decided at the Versailles Conference. Britain ignored this mistake and insisted on giving Poland guarantees with the Danzig issue as the center in 1939, which resulted in the establishment of the German-Soviet agreement, and finally saw the outbreak of World War II. In principle, we must deny the doctrine of national self-determination. We believe that it is most appropriate for the great powers to establish absolute hegemony, and that small countries should each belong to this double power.

Regarding the above-mentioned views, Carr described them in detail in the so-called "peace conditions" as follows.

"The principle of national self-determination contained in the Atlantic Charter is that small countries cannot be applied after all; because small countries in Central and Eastern Europe are not suitable for the concept of a country. Therefore, the "status quo" in Eastern Europe before the war cannot be used as the basis for determining the post-war state; therefore, these small countries should be included in the Soviet sphere of influence and maintain their existence. Only in this way can these small countries cooperate peacefully with Britain."

Local newspapers believe that the above-mentioned Carr's claim is an informal expression of the British government's views, which seems to be disappointing the small government-in-exile; however, well-informed people in neutral countries believe that as long as the Soviet Union continues to fight the main force of the German army in a decisive battle of the century, Britain has no other way to protect itself except to adopt a "sell-out" policy towards the Eastern European countries. In this way, the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, which contains absolutely unsolvable contradictions, is gradually entering an inextricable stage as the contradictions expand and deepen.

### The official cooking oil retailers are temporarily issuing sales based on house tax tickets, and it is estimated that planned sales by weight per capita will be implemented by the end of this month or the beginning of next month. It is possible that the ration of coarse grains will be sold concurrently with the household grain of the 31st term

According to information from the cooking oil industry association wholesale office, cooking oil will soon be sold once based on house tax tickets in accordance with the old method, and the system of issuing oil by per capita quota based on oil purchase certificates will also be realized in the near future, and preparations are actively underway. It is said that in the past few weeks, it has been quite difficult for residents of this city to purchase even the minimum amount of daily cooking oil needed, so the phenomenon of cooking oil shortage has become widespread among the people. However, it is reported that the cooking oil industry association wholesale office has recently obtained from the authorities an amount of oil sufficient for the needs of the oil sales method based on house tax tickets.

### Rice and Sugar Sales Orders to be Issued Soon

In order to maintain the people's food supply, after the authorities implemented per capita rationing of rice, flour, coarse grains, sugar, and cooking oil, purchase certificates for coarse grains, oil, sugar, etc. have been distributed. A commercial news reporter learned from relevant sources yesterday: (1) The rice and flour for the 30th term have been sold by contracted rice stores based on certificates from the 21st, with a valid period until March 30. The 31st term household grain sales order will be collected on the 25th and sales will begin on April 1; (2) The first term of sugar sales has been carried out by retailers based on certificates since the 11th, until March 31. The second term is allowed to be implemented on April 1, and the ration quantity and price will be announced by the cooperative at that time. As for the issuance of sugar purchase certificates, it will be based on newly registered retailers so that certificate holders can purchase nearby; (3) Cooking oil has been purchased by the military authorities from 12 Chinese and Japanese oil factories in this city and handed over to the cooking oil industry association wholesale office to be distributed to retailers based on certificates. It is heard that it will be implemented from April 1, with the price based on the new oil price set on March 1, and the quantity is estimated to be half a catty per capita; (4) The per capita rationing of coarse grains is heard to be sold concurrently by contracted rice stores when purchasing household grain for the 31st term. The types, quantities, and prices will be announced separately at that time.

### First Term Household Sugar Sales in Blockade Zone Areas

The first term of per capita sugar sales in the West Shanghai District began yesterday. Residents can purchase the allotted household sugar at designated sugar retailers based on the first term sugar purchase certificates. The scope of this sugar ration has been stipulated by the relevant authorities and is temporarily limited to the Nanshi, West Shanghai, Zhabei, and Pudong city center areas within the blockade zone. The number of sugar rations for residents in the district is temporarily based on the population in March. Regardless of age, half a catty of sugar will be issued per month per capita. The first sugar ration is limited to the end of this month, the 31st, and will be invalid if overdue. The retail price of the rationed sugar is 4 yuan 5 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per catty for brown sugar (2 yuan 2 jiao 5 fen per half catty), and 4 yuan 7 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates per catty for white sugar (2 yuan 3 jiao 5 fen per half catty).

### Military and Police Rice in Urban Areas to be Rationed This Month

Regarding the supply and adjustment of rice for military and police in urban areas, the Municipal Food Administration has carefully planned this month and has now completely resolved it. A total of 3,600 bags of rice are required, including 1,788 bags for the security team and 1,802 bags for the police. Once the Food Department has allocated the rice, it will be distributed immediately. As for how the supply will be in April, no solution has been planned yet.

### Shen Bao Scholarship Donation Report

Yesterday, this newspaper received scholarship donations from all walks of life totaling 1,000 yuan from Mr. Han Gongbei and Ms. Lu Ruosi (transferred from the longevity feast to help Mr. Zhou Feijie), 100 yuan each from Mrs. Wei Zhang, Mrs. Lu Tang, Yang Fuqing, and Qiu Feiran, 150 yuan from Kang Bolan, 60 yuan from Wang Meisheng, 32 yuan 9 jiao from Pu Qiting (in memory of the 72 martyrs of Huanghuagang), 28 yuan 3 jiao from Moor Associates, 20 yuan each from Ye Hong, Li Fenfu, and Tao Jiayu, 20 yuan from Pu Qiting (in memory of late friends Chuan Hongshui and He Zhongxiao), 10 yuan each from Fei Kedun and Guan Zhuming, 8 yuan from Qu Zhongqing, and 5 yuan each from Hua Yi, Wu Erping, and an anonymous person, totaling 1,794 yuan 2 jiao in Central Reserve Certificates, with a balance of 277,082 yuan 6 jiao 9 fen.

### Large Quantities of Coconuts and Sugar Shipped to Shanghai

According to Dōmei News Agency, a large batch of coconuts and sugar will arrive here from the Philippines today (the 23rd). This is the result of an understanding reached between the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy in China and the Japanese military authorities in the Philippines. The quantity of these goods is estimated to be several thousand tons. The carrying ship will dock at the old Ning Shao Wharf to unload. The coconuts will be distributed to various soap factories in this city, and the sugar will be prepared for use by the citizens of this city. In the future, the shortage of soap can be greatly relaxed, and sugar will be easier to obtain. Through this barter method, Shanghai will be able to obtain various goods for citizens to consume without any difficulty.

### Regulations on Livestock Control to be Improved

Due to the implementation of the new system for the movement of materials at the Hongkou Livestock Market, the transportation of various livestock will become more convenient. Therefore, the regulations on controlling livestock in this city are also planned to be changed. According to the market, the number of livestock sold in this city last year was 314,000 pigs, 16,000 cattle, 45,000 sheep, 10,000 pigeons, 909,000 ducks, and 20,220 dan of chickens. Most of the above-mentioned livestock are transported to Shanghai from Xingang, Zhanghuanggang, and Xinshenggang in Jiangbei. The total number is only one-third of what it was before the war. Due to the lack of arrivals, black market prices have been created. It is expected that after the market improves the control measures, livestock prices in this city will tend to fall.

### Reader Forum: A Further Discussion on Youth Employment Issues Luo Chaifu After reading Mr. Ye Minhe's "The Vocational Problems of Young People" in this forum, I feel that this is indeed a serious issue. Seeing that another batch of graduates is about to enter society, in order to prevent graduation from becoming a synonym for unemployment, we should plan ahead and propose several practical methods to help the upcoming group of unemployed. As Mr. Ye said: "Please let social figures take on the responsibility of genuine leadership, which is fortunate for the youth, fortunate for society," and even more fortunate for the nation and humanity.

For these reasons, I hope that the graduating students themselves will organize to solve their own pressing problems. Every one of us students has an ideal, which is to maintain friendship after starting a career. I remember there was an article in "Free Talk" called "Warm Friendship," which said that friends from middle school are often true friends and can become lifelong confidants, because elementary school students do not understand the value of friendship, and in college or society, the "poison" of money seeps in, making it difficult to find close friends. Everyone also thinks that if they can still work together after graduation, that would be a great help.

With these benefits, our class has organized a permanent alumni association. The vocational problem was also discussed in the association. With the deep discussion of teachers and students, we have obtained some practical methods, so I might as well write them down for reference.

(1) Survey Form—Investigate whether each student will pursue further studies or seek employment after graduation? What kind of job do you want? What is the occupation of your parents?

After filling out the form, it is divided into two parts: one part for further studies and one part for employment. Then, among those seeking employment, students who want the same job are put together. The most important thing is to know the occupation of the parents.

Why? Because after knowing, sincerely ask the parents to cooperate with the school in order to pass on recruitment information. For example, if a parent is very familiar with the banking industry, then if news of a recruitment by a certain bank is revealed, students who have filled in the form wanting a banking career can be notified in advance to prepare for the exam. This is a very adaptable method for current social recruitment, because now when recruiting, the recruitment news is not published on the surface, let alone advertised in newspapers. It all requires internal people to introduce their children to take the exam. Without an introduction, you simply don't know where is recruiting. This is the first benefit. The second benefit is that there is hope of achieving the ideal of "studying together and working together," because if many people take the exam at the same time, it is possible to admit many people at the same time.

(2) Mailing List—After the survey is completed, the school authorities should communicate with the alumni who graduated earlier, because most of the alumni have already found jobs after graduation, so whether their professional circles need to add people, they can naturally know in advance and recommend in advance.

I think these two methods are very willing to be cooperated by the students themselves, the school, and the parents. Especially the parents, who can see that an immediate check that they have invested can be cashed immediately, will be filled with comfort in their hearts regardless of the level of the occupation or the amount of salary. And we ourselves, being able to get a job earlier and familiarize ourselves with the reality of society earlier, are of course also very happy. Economic News Yesterday, the Joint Savings Bank bonds. The transaction was light. Operators sold at 3.73 yuan and bought at 3.68 yuan, a difference of 0.02 yuan. The retail price must be 3.75 yuan, and bought at 3.65 yuan. Japanese military notes tightened. Dealers quoted each other at 5.5556 yuan. Small money shops and banks sold at 5.56 yuan and bought at 5.545 yuan. Comments on the Responsibilities of Trade Associations in the Future Now that the National Federation of Commercial Control has been established, the various trade associations at the grassroots level bear the greatest mission and the greatest responsibility. They should strengthen their forces and take up their responsibilities to complete this arduous task. At the inaugural meeting that day, Mayor Chen said: "The facilities of the National Federation of Commercial Control must be based on the interests of the people's livelihood. If you are capable, you must do it. If you are not capable, you must also do it. If you can only do it if you are capable, and you don't do it if you are not capable, then who will do it?" Minister Mei also said: "Whether the organization of the Commercial Control Federation can implement its mission and promote the work of control in the future depends on the strength of the organization. However, relying solely on the government's strength for control work is not enough. We must concentrate the national economic strength to achieve the goal. At the same time, the control organization itself should appropriately give play to the spirit of autonomy and integrate the strengths of all parties so that the organization can be sound and the work can be successful." These words are all the key points to strengthen trade associations. Not only to strengthen them, but also to require the associations themselves to have a spirit of fearlessness, to work hard without complaint, and to be unswerving; they must also have a spirit of autonomy, be honest and impartial, and be of pure heart.

In the past, the biggest shortcomings of many trade associations were: (1) scattered and without power; (2) facilitating the private plans of a few people; (3) leaders not taking responsibility, listening to one or two secretaries and clerks, engaging in corruption and fraud; (4) those who handle affairs wanting to resign and retire when encountering difficulties, giving up halfway; (5) relying on the government and not thinking of uniting the industry itself to generate power.

These five points are not only true of trade associations, but any industrial and commercial organization cannot avoid this major problem, which must be absolutely avoided.

It is hoped that the various trade associations in the future will correct the past malpractices and implement the following principles under the leadership of the National Federation of Commercial Control:

(1) Concentrate the power of the industry and intensify collective organization. All those in the industry must join the association and must not act freely.

(2) Those who have already assumed duties in the trade association in the future must be absolutely fair and honest, and must not consider personal relationships or act for personal gain; in particular, they must restrain their subordinates, secretaries, clerks, and others from engaging in corruption and fraud; when encountering difficulties, they should work hard without complaint and persevere through the hardships.

(3) The power of the association must come from itself; if there is a spirit of autonomy and united strength, then all parties will cooperate to seek the welfare of the industry, and at the same time, they can also assist the government in promoting economic policies.

We hope that the government will quickly revise the Trade Association Law to rectify the national trade associations and assist the National Federation of Commercial Control in promoting this important wartime economic policy. Qian Dagui, Vice President of the Central Reserve Bank, submitted a request for the Shanghai branch manager's approval. The vacancy will be filled by Supervisor Dai Ailu.

Nanjing, 22nd, Central News Agency—When the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank was being prepared, the environment was treacherous and it was difficult to cope. Therefore, Qian Dagui, the vice president of the bank, also served as the manager to create and develop it. After the opening, thanks to Qian's efforts, the foundation gradually became solid and the business gradually developed. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the remaining forces of the British and Americans and the Chongqing side in the concession were all cleared, and the security of the concession gradually became established. Qian believed that the manager was no longer necessary to be concurrently held by the vice president, and repeatedly asked President Zhou Fohai to resign from the concurrent position. Zhou sincerely retained him until now. Recently, Qian stated again that the bank's situation was getting bigger and the business was getting busier, and he should fully assist the president in seeking the development of the entire bank. He deeply felt that time and energy could no longer be spent on the Shanghai branch, so he again submitted his resignation from the concurrent position. After Zhou carefully considered it, he approved it and internally appointed Dai Ailu, supervisor of the bank and executive director of China Prosperity Bank, to succeed him. It is heard that Dai will go to take office on April 1st upon order.

(Another dispatch) The position of Director of the General Affairs Department of the bank has always been concurrently held by Wu Jiyun, Director of the Investigation Department. Wu has now requested to resign from the position of Director of the General Affairs Department because he cannot take care of both. President Zhou has approved it and appointed Ma Jiliang, the Deputy Director of the department, as the Director. Ye Fuxiao is the Chairman of the New Central Savings Association. Li Da and Wu Jiyun are the Party Affairs Committee Members.

Shanghai, Central News Agency—After the Central Savings Association was released from military administration on the 19th of this month, it was approved by the Ministry of Finance of the National Government to have the Central Reserve Bank allocate funds to inherit its assets and liabilities and operate all savings businesses. At the same time, Tang Shoumin and other fifteen people were hired as members of the Supervisory Committee of the Association. The Supervisory Committee of the New Central Savings Association was formally organized and established on the 19th, and held the first Supervisory Committee meeting, which elected Ye Fuxiao as the Chairman of the Supervisory Committee, and Wu Jiyun and Li Da as the Standing Committee Members. It was stipulated that the Supervisory Committee meeting should be held once a month. Its internal organization is still divided into four sections: accounting, general affairs, documents, and business. However, the savings matters of the business section are separately planned and set up as a savings section. It is heard that in terms of business, the scope will be expanded, and plans are being made to issue economic revival lottery tickets, special installment savings, and prize-bearing principal-returning savings bonds, etc., to encourage people's savings interest in many ways. All the original depositors of the old Central Savings Association before the incident can continue their rights and interests after going through legal procedures. Talk by Mr. Tsushima, President of North China Development Company

Beijing, 22nd, Central News Agency—Mr. Tsushima, President of the North China Development Company, went to Nanjing and Shanghai to inspect and had earnest talks with the authorities in Central China. He returned here on the 20th. According to his statement, the central authorities of the National Government are quite aware of the economic situation in North China and are very satisfied with the smooth progress of economic construction in North China. Economic circles in Shanghai have praised the new policy of the Japanese side. The Japanese side took the lead in expressing its willingness to cooperate and abolished the prevention and control of the movement of materials in Central China. At the same time, the National Federation of Commercial Control was established. Therefore, the problem of commodity prices in Central China is expected to be solved satisfactorily. The impact of this organization on the economy of North China is indeed not small. Therefore, it seems that it is planned to set up a branch of the Control Federation in Tianjin. However, the establishment of this branch is by no means for the implementation of the allocation and control of materials in North China. In short, North China and Central China must adopt the principle of mutual communication and make closer connections in the future. The Lower-Level Institutions of the Business Control Federation Mainly Based on Cooperation Between Chinese and Japanese Business Circles

The National Federation of Commercial Control has not been established for long, and its internal institutions have been largely organized and have begun to handle movement permit affairs. The list of members of the Materials Control Committee has also been decided. The adjustment trend of the Japanese business community is also quite active. The lower-level institutions of the Commercial Control Federation are not yet specific and are currently in the preparation period, without active activities. Regarding the composition of the lower-level institutions, except for special materials, they are generally based on cooperation between Chinese and Japanese business circles and are organized independently. The Japanese business community is also proceeding with adjustments based on the above methods. The following preparatory work is noteworthy:

(1) There is a tendency for the Japanese business community to establish combinations indiscriminately. According to the principle of one industry, one combination, it is necessary to reorganize and merge them. Organizations with two or more combinations in one industry will be gradually merged and abolished to strengthen efficiency.

(2) Combinations without distribution or purchase boundaries must be strictly distinguished and formed into units to join the new control organization.

(3) It is hoped that an agency will be established to negotiate with the Commercial Control Federation as a spokesperson for the wholesale business community and the public. (March 21st, Continental News) Chinese Stockbrokers Yesterday Requested Registration with the Economic Bureau. More than 130 Chinese stock brokerage firms in the city have been suspended from business for more than a month since they followed the authorities' orders. It is now heard that the majority of the industry has followed the authorities' instructions and first applied to the Engineering Bureau for a license to operate. Yesterday, Zhou Lundi, Zhang Yilin, Sun Wencheng, Han Jixiang, and others gathered the industry and applied to the Special City Economic Bureau for supplementary registration, hoping that the resumption of business in the industry would be resolved as soon as possible. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Urges Members to Register Simple Factories. The Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association of this city previously received a letter from the Jiangsu Tax Bureau, stating in brief: "This bureau has organized and established that the factory registration matters of all simple weaving factories should be filled out by the factory numbers according to the format, and the attachments should be submitted to the bureau for registration." After receiving the letter, the association issued a notice to its members to comply. There are indeed many members who have complied, but there are also many who are waiting to see. Therefore, the association has recently received repeated notices from the bureau, asking them to forward the notice to urge members to process the registration as soon as possible. It is understood that the registration of simple weaving factories is a necessary procedure for the movement and sale of yarn and cloth in the dyeing and weaving industry. The association has issued separate notices, urging all members who have not yet applied for registration to go to the association to collect the registration form (5 yuan per copy), fill it out, and submit it for approval. If there are any unclear procedures, etc., they can also go to the association to inquire. Financial Stabilization Bonds to Pay Interest on Schedule The government previously issued 150 million yuan of financial stabilization bonds to stabilize finances and manage old legal tender. They were issued on June 1st of last year. According to the regulations, interest is paid twice a year, every six months from the date of issuance. Interest is paid only within ten years, and principal is repaid from the eleventh year. It is heard that the second phase of interest payment is 37.5 million yuan, which has been allocated by the Ministry of Finance from the special accounting income according to the principal and interest repayment schedule and deposited in the Central Reserve Bank's bond fund account for repayment. It is heard that full interest will be paid by the Central Reserve Bank starting from May 31st. The ministry will issue a public notice at that time so that everyone knows. Shanghai's Industrial and Commercial Trade Conditions in Recent Months Shanghai, Central News Agency—According to financial sources, Shanghai's industrial and commercial trade conditions have obviously become more active in recent months. Although the Nanyang aspect has not been fully restored, there has been a concrete approach with the Philippines since the establishment of the Philippine port material agreement. It is estimated that what Shanghai ships to the Philippines is silk, medicinal materials, cotton textiles, etc., while what the Philippines ships to Shanghai is sugar, tobacco, and Manila hemp, etc. At the same time, an agreement has been reached with Singapore on the exchange of materials. It has been agreed that Shanghai will export soap, matches, cotton cloth, silk, etc., and import raw materials such as oil and rubber. In addition, the Shanghai-Hong Kong material trade agreement has not been concluded. The materials traded by both parties are Shanghai's cotton textiles, grains, groceries, and Hong Kong's stored sugar.

Domestic Aspects Trade between Central China and North China agreed in January of this year to amend a part of the trade agreement concluded here in early April and conclude a new agreement.

Key points of the agreement

(1) Promote the exchange of materials between the two parties and maintain the balance of payments in both regions; (2) Stipulate the special yuan as the currency for exchange settlement, but military tickets and Shanghai exchange can also be used in conjunction; (3) Divide the trade agreement into two types: specific material trade and general material trade. The so-called specific materials are coal, pyrite ore, pig iron, alkali powder, etc., transported from the north to the south, and wheat flour, sugar, ammonium sulfate, tobacco, gauze, rayon, tea, and paper rush, etc., transported from the south to the north. The so-called general materials are glass, peanut oil, and other agricultural products, etc., transported from the north to the south, and paper, Chinese medicine, metal products, stationery, soap, leather, groceries, etc., transported from the south to the north. Cigarette Allocation Prices Announced by China Central Tobacco Company Black Market Swept Away. After the China Central Tobacco Company's intensive efforts, the allocation of cigarettes in this city has been largely completed. Major tobacco dealers in this city have been contacting the company for wholesale matters in recent days. According to the company authorities, the quantity and price of allocated cigarettes have been agreed upon and will be announced in the coming days. Major tobacco dealers are divided into two levels, A and B. Roughly, level A is allocated more goods and has more small tobacco dealers under it, while level B is less. From the date of sale of allocated cigarettes, the black market price of cigarettes in this city will be swept away. All cigarettes sold by each tobacco dealer must be sold to customers at the official price. News in Brief The Central Market Nanshi Land Cargo Investment Consortium has been prepared. A founding meeting was held at the Central Market Nanshi Market yesterday (22nd) at 3 pm, and 23 directors and supervisors were elected. The second issue of the "China Industry" monthly magazine compiled and published by the China Industrial Bank has been published. The content includes Pan Yao's "Cooperation between the Industrial and Financial Sectors," Cai Shoubai's "Assistance to Industry and the China Industrial Bank," Pan Yinge's "Shanghai Finance in 1942," and other articles. It is sold by the magazine's distribution department at 1010 Dahua Road intersection, Jing'an Temple Road. The annual subscription is 30 yuan, half a year is 16 yuan, and the retail price is 3 yuan per copy. The Dynamics of Daily Necessities Sugar Sugar has been rationed by population since the 11th. The control and allocation of sugar was implemented after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Regarding sales in the inland, an inland sales agreement council was established in the past to control the exporting side, but it was completely free in Shanghai. The pre-war sugar market was an important commodity market because idle funds were used here. Especially in the three months before the outbreak of the war, the market was chaotic, and even laymen intervened. With the tension in the Japanese-American negotiations, various rumors of war rose, and market prices rose step by step, breaking through 300 yuan. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, Japanese troops entered the concession, and various important materials were restricted, including sugar. All were registered with the military distribution association. From this time on, about 000,000 dan were registered by the Chinese merchants. The annual sugar demand in Central China is about 000,000 dan. In advance, the Chinese merchants expected Japan and the United States to go to war, so they imported enough sugar, exceeding one year's demand. The military distribution association took over the inventory in the concession, including the association's spot goods, and established a rationing and control plan, which was the beginning of controlled sugar in Shanghai. Therefore, a Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative was newly established as the allocation agency for the Chinese merchants. All the powerful merchants on the Chinese side joined. The Japanese allocation agency was not set up separately, but was entrusted to the Food Commercial Association to control and allocate. The price of white sugar was set at 7 jiao and 1 fen per jin of Japanese gold. The allocation quantity was not stipulated by either the Chinese or Japanese side, but was increased or decreased at any time according to the needs of the season, and a flexible control and allocation was implemented. A year has passed since the start of control, and there has been no change in the control, but the price has fluctuated a bit. It fell to 6 jiao and 8 fen per jin of Japanese gold in June of last year, and then rebounded to 7 jiao and 8 fen in September of the same year. Around November of last year, rumors spread that the inventory was exhausted and a coupon-based distribution system would be implemented. In Hongkou, you could also see long queues of people buying sugar in front of the stores. Later, it was announced that the stock was abundant, and the panic buying was lifted. In the end, there was no special black market, which was much better than matches, cigarettes, soap, etc. The reason why sugar control was relatively smooth was first because its inventory was more abundant than other commodities, and second, because the Chinese merchants were able to cooperate actively without the slightest unwillingness. According to the authorities of the military distribution association, the population-based rationing system implemented from the 11th of this month can limit consumption. This is a necessary measure for wartime life and is not due to a reduction in inventory. This year's sugar, about a considerable amount can come from Zha Port and Taiwan. In the future, trade with the South can also be restored, and there is no need to worry about a shortage of sugar supply. (March 19th, Continental News)

Free Talk Understanding "Human Defects" Xu Yuzhang Living in a turbulent era, in a high-pressure area of life, I am afraid that everyone, whether poor or rich, is lurking in a shadow of "defects." We only need to look at this society, which is bustling and bustling all day long, scheming and fighting for themselves to find ways to "bring in" and use funds to "make up for" the performances, which is clear evidence.

In fact, the root of this "defect" did not originate today. Since the birth of mankind, the embryo of "defect" has been nurtured. Only because there are "defects" can mankind continue to evolve. As Darwin's "Theory of Human Evolution" says, "defects" are the path to progress. If people in the Stone Age felt that everything given by the universe was "satisfied" and without "defects," then we might regress to the primitive era and become modern barbarians. Where would there be great nations and brilliant cultures? Therefore, using reasonable methods to complete the "future" from "defects" to satisfaction is urgently needed by mankind. However, many people have distorted its definition and embarked on the path of "selfishness," using "trickery" and "exploitation" to satisfy their "defects," and even using any means to satisfy their "defects" for a while.

Mankind has a pair of gifted, flexible "hands" and possesses a "brain" that is "superior to all things," and can "advance with both hands and brain" to pioneer in the realm of "unlimited extraction and inexhaustible use" of nature, and excavate what you need—whether spiritual or material, to satisfy your "defects." Why use heinous "trickery and plunder"!

It is said that in the course of his life, man has always lived a contradictory life, forever occupying the shadow of "defects"; for example, having "enough" still wants "warmth," having both "enough" and "warmth" still wants "lust"... Although after natural evolution, the ambition remains unchanged. Therefore, the "defects" of "life" cannot be "satisfied."

However, this argument is also biased. If human beings fully understand the truth in the "defects of life," possess the forward-looking thought of "progress," and use the method of "frugality and love of people" said by Confucius to obtain reasonable "satisfaction," this world would not be as miserable as it is now. Talk about "Education of Love" Ji Chen In this cosmopolitan city, everything is blinded by "money." What people see are money and goods that are more valuable than money, and what they hear is everything about "money." Talking about education is very disappointing. Unless it is a poor educator or a general higher-level intellectual, no one will appreciate your words.

Education, in the eyes of a group of vulgar people, is like goods that can be bought with money. As long as you pay the fees and send your children to school, isn't that the end of it? But no. Education needs to start at home. This article is about the education of "love" in the family.

Although theoretical education is not easy to implement for the time being, practical education related to the future of children cannot be ignored.

Therefore, Dr. Boshe said: "When your children are young, you should train them to become upright, resourceful, and agile."

To train children, we must first be patient and slowly guide them into the right path. If you have tried repeatedly without success and feel discouraged, then you have failed.

In the family, we must pay special attention to the following points: (1) the quality of the books that children read daily; (2) do not be indifferent to children; (3) inspire children's interests; (4) pay attention to the friends they make at ordinary times; (5) encourage them to participate in collective life; (6) never set a bad example; (7) pay attention to their speech and behavior.

The first time we discover each mistake, we should correct it immediately. Because every bad word and deed is cultivated from childhood. We must never use the excuse that children are young to cause great obstacles to family education. And we must not arbitrarily indulge out of doting.

Usually, we are not easy to be aware of doting, but only feel that it is a reasonable and proper love. Unexpectedly, it has harmed our children invisibly. This is a matter that is extremely related to the future of the country and must be corrected by all means.

Occasionally, I saw a lively and lovely child's photo in the window of a photo studio with four words: "Don't Kiss Me." This sentence is not without basis. Because most of children's diseases are transmitted from this seemingly loving behavior, and all mothers are prone to this unintentional mistake. Perhaps the child will lose his little life because of this. This is such a dangerous thing.

Regarding the various mistakes caused by "love," due to the limitation of space, I will not discuss them one by one. Anyway, the books on this aspect are very rich in various libraries. For the sake of the future of the country and the future of our children, we may take the time out of our busy schedule to borrow a few books home to read and correct our past mistakes. Root Xin Bo "Here, Old Gen, take it. The foreign money is all good. If you don't believe it, you might as well knock it piece by piece."

"How can the foreign money from Lord Huang's mansion be bad?" Genming said, still wrapping the original old newspaper, twitching his face, shaking his hands, and stuffing it into his shirt pocket.

"A Wu, A Wu," Huang Chong'an called, "Get the wine warm and bring out the supper."

In A Wu's response, Genming said goodbye to Huang Chong'an: "Thank you, Lord Huang, so that our family can have a peaceful New Year." There was some coldness in his voice, and he turned to Yang Zijie and Yu Duzhou and said, "I'll treat you two to a drink on the street tomorrow." There was some warmth in these words.

"What about me?" Lu Baishu stretched out his hand to stop Genming. He had completely sobered up when he heard about warming the wine.

"You, wait for me at Wu Laosi's shop tomorrow."

As soon as Genming arrived in the hall, A Wu ran out from a room on the east side and said, "Old Gen, are you going back?" "Let me light a lantern to send you out. It's very dark in the house, and you are unfamiliar with it. It's not easy to walk without light."

In Genming's polite thanks, A Wu lit the lantern, and then the two walked into the courtyard and entered the house on the west side; then they went north from there, going out one courtyard after another. There were five courtyards in total, all empty and uninhabited.

"I'm very sad to hear you say that," A Wu said, holding the lantern in front, "Rich people are all unscrupulous!..."

"Alas, who told you to have no money!" Genming sighed behind him. Second Place in the February Essay Contest How to Read Books, What Books to Read? (Part 2) Ying Yuanze How to Seek Breadth It is undoubtedly appropriate to use the "browsing method" to seek breadth; however, the "browsing method" cannot be achieved overnight, and must be cultivated at any time in childhood, so that it can be cultivated into a habit. Once the habit is formed, it can be browsed through no matter what book. The key to this reading method is to concentrate the reader's attention, use keen vision and comprehension, quickly read several chapters of a book, or select the important parts to read, and omit the unimportant ones. The most important thing is to be able to understand the train of thought of the book or the general idea of its content, so as to avoid the drawbacks of random reading. In addition, readers must make full use of fragmented time, and must pre-determine the decision order for the books to be read, so as to avoid disorder or wasting time. From a broad point of view, the main reading methods are nothing more than "seeking precision" and "seeking breadth." In addition, many trivial reading methods belong to either "seeking precision" or "seeking breadth." Due to space limitations, it is impossible to enumerate them one by one. (2) What Books to Read? Now that we know how to read books, the next question is "What books to read?" This question is closely related to the first question, because if we don't know what books to read, why talk about reading methods first? Book Selection Criteria The world is like a sea of smoke, and the time that can be used for reading in life is so short. In this way, to finish reading many beneficial books in a limited time, the only way is to know how to select books; but selecting paintings is not an easy task. Selecting books and wanting to "do everything well": - having a hundred benefits and no harm - it is best to stipulate several book selection criteria in advance as practical guidance when selecting books. Now, according to what I have seen, I will briefly describe the three most important points for readers' reference: (1) It must be able to enhance our basic knowledge - books of this kind include society, economy, politics, science, philosophy, history, geography, and common sense, etc., and newspapers and magazines also belong to this category. (2) It must be beneficial to personal cultivation - books of this kind include celebrity biographies and essays, poetry and novels, ethics and morality, as well as self-cultivation and personality cultivation. (3) It must make a direct contribution to making a living - such as occupations, technology, industry, pharmacy, law, physics and chemistry, or languages, etc., all belong to this category. They have a direct or indirect relationship to the occupation that individuals are engaged in. They are not theoretical books, but tool books. The author has put forward several criteria for selecting books, but if there is no suggestion for practical books, that is not reasonable. As for the tool books contained in the third item, the scope is too broad, so I have to omit them. Patients with Cough and Sputum Attention to Social Services Yang Yusheng Recently, the weather has been cold and hot, and many people have coughs. Coughs can be divided into: (1) Dry cough, such as inflammation of the throat, bronchitis, pleurisy, early tuberculosis, heart disease, gastritis, women's pregnancy, etc., all have coughs, but coughs without sputum do not need to take expectorants. (2) Wet cough, such as bronchial leakage, lung abscess, lung gangrene, the sputum must be examined to diagnose what kind of disease, and then medicine can be selected. (3) Barking cough, the cough sounds like a dog barking, with a long sound, such as children suffering from diphtheria (infectious disease), whooping cough (commonly known as egret cough) because its cough sound is special, it cannot be treated according to ordinary methods. (4) Paroxysmal cough, with bursts of cough, such as children suffering from angina (i.e., tonsil swelling), influenza, throat disease, bronchial disease, and nervous diseases, also need to be distinguished. (5) Resonant cough, the cough sounds like the sound of knocking on a jar or pot, its sound is empty, the cough sound resonates with the air in the chest, or there is pneumothorax. (6) Small cough, a very slight cough, should not be taken lightly, or it is chronic rhinitis of the upper respiratory tract, or early pulmonary tuberculosis. (7) Silent cough, coughing without sound, such as nervous "hysteria" or vocal cord paralysis. In addition, such as swelling of the lymph glands in the trachea of children, or stimulation caused by the accumulation of earwax, or reaction caused by parasites in the intestines, a doctor should be asked to identify them. There are also various kinds of sputum coughed out, including mucous sputum, rusty sputum, foul-smelling sputum, foamy sputum, and bloody sputum. The time of coughing is different, there is coughing in the morning when waking up, and coughing before going to bed. As for cough medicines, do not buy them indiscriminately, because there are various kinds of medicines, including suppressants, stimulants, and solvents, depending on the condition. Regarding the condition's doubts, my colleagues at the Friends' Aid Medical Society on Shanghai Notre Dame Road can answer them free of charge. Jingcheng Clinic Offers Treatment The Jingcheng Civilian Clinic, hosted by Huang Yizhao, a famous doctor of One Finger Zen massage, offers treatment to the poor and sick, and is skilled in all kinds of male and female diseases. The time is from 8 to 11 am every day. The clinic is located at No. 2, Alley 21, Chengdu Road, telephone 32973. Collection Report (1) Small Loan: Wang Zhuying 500 yuan, balance 8390 yuan.

### Yuanshun Rice Store: Deducting from Ration Allotment

Cai Ruen and Ye Shineng, employees of the Hengda South Goods Store at No. 265 Qipu Road, went to Yuanshun Rice Store at No. 729 Penglu Road at 11:00 AM on the 21st of this month to collect white rice with nine ration tickets, totaling two dou and two and a half sheng. However, Cai and others had long known that Yuanshun Rice Store's scales were inaccurate and that they deducted rice rations. Therefore, they brought their own scales. Unexpectedly, upon weighing the rice, they discovered that it was short by two and a half pounds. They immediately reported this to the French Concession Police, who dispatched Detective Gao Yongan and Japanese Detective Meguro to investigate. The investigation confirmed the facts, and the police brought Chen Zhongwei, the owner of Yuanshun Store, along with his employees Ni Yongsheng, Lu Laisheng, and Zai Yuexiang, as well as the measuring dipper, to the police station.

Brief Commentary

### Saving Electricity

Thrift is originally a virtue. In any era and any situation, one should practice thrift. Especially in wartime, because of the sharp increase in the consumption of materials, thrift is no longer a passive virtue but an active and absolute necessity.

Electricity, the power for all industrial production, is an extremely urgent need. In order to increase production, it is necessary to concentrate electricity on the industrial sector, or at least reduce all non-productive electricity consumption to the lowest possible limit and transfer it to all production uses. This is a simple theory.

However, let us look back at the current electricity situation in Shanghai. On the one hand, non-productive consumption, although repeatedly restricted, is still brilliant in entertainment venues, catering establishments, storefront model rooms, etc. Has it been reduced to the minimum level of consumption? On the other hand, old factories and workshops can only work for three or five days a week due to electricity restrictions, and factories and workshops that are preparing to be built cannot start work because they cannot obtain electricity. Generally speaking, the industry of a country at war should produce day and night to meet the needs. Then, how can our industry be said to be in line with the principle of increasing production?

We hope that the relevant authorities will pay attention to this unreasonable phenomenon, restrict non-productive electricity consumption on the passive side, and quickly find ways to increase coal production and increase electricity supply to fully supply productive factories and workshops on the active side, because "increasing production" is already the most important point in the wartime economic policy outline, and it is also the main material factor in winning the Greater East Asia War!

### Toho Theatre Troupe: Scheduled Performance in Beijing; Chen Yunshang and Others to Accompany

It is now heard that the entire troupe, led by troupe leader Shibusawa Hideo, will go to Beijing on the 25th of this month to participate in the celebration of the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. They will also begin performing at the Dahua Grand Theater for seven days starting on the 29th. Tickets for the Dahua are already on pre-sale starting yesterday, the 21st, with three prices: 15 yuan, 25 yuan, and 35 yuan. Those who went to pre-purchase were very enthusiastic, and it is expected that there will be a grand occasion when the performance begins.

The 30th of this month is the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. The stars of the China United Film Company also plan to make a special trip to Beijing to participate in the celebration. Chen Yunshang and Zhou Manhua are scheduled to leave together on the 29th of this month. Li Lihua, Wang Danfeng, Bai Guang, and Xi Qiuxia are scheduled to go to Beijing with the Toho Kabuki Troupe on the 25th. It is expected that when the celebration of the return to the capital is held, the capital will be filled with starlight, creating a particularly lively scene.

### Civil Cases: Deadline for Settlement

The Ministry of Judicial Administration believes that civil cases handled by courts in various places are often delayed and not resolved, causing the litigants to suffer from litigation fatigue, which is not appropriate. Therefore, in order to rectify this situation effectively, it specially ordered the Shanghai courts that all unresolved civil cases that have been delayed for more than half a year, except for those with special circumstances, must be cleared and completed within three months and must not be delayed any further, so as to avoid inconvenience.

### Additional Yangtze River Ferry

Recently, the entry and exit of materials in North China have been frequent, especially those to and from Central and South China. Transportation mainly relies on trains. Last year, there was a new ferry, Jinling Maru, between Nanjing and Pukou, with six tracks laid on the upper deck, a deadweight of 2,300 tons, and operating connections. Currently, freight cars are very crowded and it is already felt that it is insufficient. Therefore, the Central China Railway Company has decided to add another ferry to facilitate freight transport. It is heard that the ship will still be built by the Shanghai Mitsubishi Shipyard (i.e., Jiangnan Shipyard), of the same type and class, and will start construction in the coming days.

### Tourist Commits Suicide by Poison
