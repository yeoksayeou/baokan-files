### Linguistic Politics by Yoshida Tosuke

After hearing "songs of Chu on all sides," Xiang Yu resolved to commit suicide. This was because hearing about the events of his home state from the enemy, he knew that many of his own people had already betrayed him. Before the war, when I first came to Shanghai, a Chinese friend took me to a dance hall. A group of Chinese gentlemen were sitting next to me, all using English to evaluate the women's good and bad points, strengths and weaknesses, talking animatedly and oblivious to others. My friend, a very ambitious patriotic person, angrily said to me: "Shanghai is a British colony! Those guys are babbling in English to show how pleased they are with their colonial slave status!" These Chinese people, in another sense, heard "songs of Chu on all sides" in Shanghai. I sensed the rising Chinese national consciousness in my friend's dismay. At that time, I also heard Japanese people speaking English in Shanghai, which proved that British power in Shanghai had unknowingly penetrated deeply and widely. Later, the world situation changed drastically, and even in Japan, there was a great deal of reflection on linguistic politics. All English signs in shops were removed, and even English words that had become almost Japanized were felt to be very inappropriate and were put away. How does Japan's awareness of this kind of linguistic politics affect its policy towards China? Unfortunately, I have not yet found such a large reaction in Japan's policy towards China. But recently, in the book "Mongolia Traverse" by Miyazaki Takeo, a member of the Kyoto Imperial University Investigation Team, I saw the following record, and in that work, I found that the Japanese people's reflection on linguistic politics was greatly elevated.

"Upon entering Guyang City, we ate lunch in an open square. There were two or three rows of Mongolian soldiers who were constantly and actively training. Commands and counting off were all in Japanese. Seeing this situation, one feels that the military power of our Emperor has reached such a remote place as Mongolia. There is probably no one who would not be happy to see the expansion of national power! For the Japanese, there is nothing more delightful than this. However, this is the preference of the Japanese and needs to be considered again and again. Just thinking back, we can remember that almost all of our predecessors did not understand German and French, but they were trained with foreign language commands that they didn't understand, such as 'Haltu' Stand at attention! (German), 'Attention' Attention! (French) and other commands. Especially, whenever German instructors and French instructors alternated, the commands were often replaced with other languages. Is it really without regret that the spirit of glorious Japanese soldiers is trained with commands in foreign languages whose meanings are not well understood? Afterwards, after more than ten years, we are now in the interior of Mongolia, seeing the repetition of past mistakes. This is just a practical example that accidentally catches the eye in Guyang, but attention should also be paid to this kind of thing in various areas such as politics, culture, industry, and other areas of implementation and guidance."

It may be that the Mongolian people accept Japanese commands because the instructors are Japanese, and they have no choice but to do so. But if Mongolian instructors use Japanese commands for Mongolian soldiers, one must think about the reaction of the general Mongolian people to this point. As the author said, the Japanese also had the experience of using foreign languages for commands. That has already been changed to using Japanese like it is today, and this is Japanese Min'eism (peasantism). From "Revere the Emperor, Expel the Barbarians" to today, after such a long experience, the Japanese are the people who know the anguish of nationalism most clearly. The Japanese should not forget that there is the same kind of nationalistic anguish in China as we have. If that Chinese patriot who hates the fact that Chinese people in Shanghai speak English knew that Chinese people in Shanghai were using Japanese commands, what would he think? That Chinese person's feelings are worth further consideration by the senior Japanese in East Asia. In the past, the Chinese patrolmen of the Shanghai Municipal Council all used English for commands. Japan should not completely learn from the British policy towards China in its administration of the new Shanghai. Now that the Shanghai concessions have been returned to China, there is even more need to reconsider linguistic politics. Whether or not the Chinese people can understand the meaning of Japan's new policy must begin with these kinds of daily practices. (Translated from Japanese)

Editorial

### Banquet for Allied Japanese Colleagues in Shanghai

Yesterday, the Shanghai News Federation held a Sino-Japanese journalists' get-together, attended by more than two hundred people, reaching the height of popularity. The main purpose of this get-together was to entertain fellow members of the Japanese press staying in Shanghai, an allied nation, to express a sense of unity.

According to the founding purpose of the Shanghai News Federation, it is to publicize the national policies of China and Japan, study the development of the news industry, give play to the performance of the news industry, and fulfill the mission of the news industry as a pioneer of the times. We know that since the association was established this spring, although it has been actively promoting association affairs, it has been biased towards business discussions among the newspapers, and has not been able to fully implement and gradually achieve its founding mission. This time, the get-together to entertain the journalists of allied nations is of significance in further fulfilling the mission undertaken by the association.

The news industry of a country originally bears the responsibility of publicizing policies, explaining current affairs, guiding the people's trends, and conveying public opinion, and is also a medium for integrating the government and the people. Journalists are the actual workers in the news industry. Of course, the mission of the news industry is the task of journalists. Since the signing of the peace treaty between China and Japan and after the Greater East Asia War, the relationship between China and Japan has reached the stage of sharing life and death (lips and teeth). Therefore, the task of journalists in China and Japan has expanded to the point of communicating all opinions between officials and civilians of the two countries. How arduous is their responsibility? Therefore, in order to fulfill this arduous responsibility, it is necessary to start by communicating opinions among Chinese and Japanese journalists themselves. Then, this get-together undoubtedly has this kind of meaning. We hope that it will be held continuously, and at the same time, further progress from get-togethers to fully exchanging opinions, and fulfilling the above-mentioned arduous responsibilities. This must be a common understanding among Chinese and Japanese journalists, right?

We do not shy away from saying, nor do we modestly say, that China's news industry is much more backward than Japan's. We hope that the news media of allied nations will not hesitate to provide technical guidance, and at the same time, we hope that allied nations will provide assistance in tools, so that our news industry will become more and more advanced, so as to jointly cooperate in completing the mission.

Finally, what is worth mentioning in this get-together is the "frugal dishes" used for the banquet. The News Federation has recently been advocating the frugality movement with great effort, and the use of frugal dishes this time is to practice the frugality movement. It is said that this kind of "frugal dish" is only 500 yuan per table, with ten people per table. In this time of wartime life and frugal consumption, it is really a model for everyone to follow.

This time, His Excellency Minister Aoki of the Allied Greater East Asia Ministry has come to our country in person to inspect the general situation of our country after the implementation of the new policy towards China, and the status of various Japanese agencies in China. Our enthusiasm for welcoming him is beyond words. When Allied Ambassador Abe came to China in the past, Your Excellency accompanied him in the name of Advisor to the Ministry of Finance. As the Supreme Advisor to our country's Economic Commission, Your Excellency has always been meticulous and thorough in fostering Sino-Japanese relations and building our country's economy, and has enthusiastically coordinated to create great achievements, which are deeply appreciated by the government and the public in our country. Later, after the establishment of the Allied Greater East Asia Ministry, Your Excellency returned to his country and took office as Minister of that Ministry, contributing greatly to the construction of Greater East Asia. This spring, Your Excellency also inspected the South Seas, and the unity of the 500 million people of East Asia has become stronger, which is deeply etched in our minds. Since our country participated in the war, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer. Recently, the Allied nation returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality to our country, and our country's independence and autonomy has been completed. In the future, the promotion of our country's construction will be faster, and the work will be more complicated and the responsibility will be greater. Your Excellency's visit to China this time will certainly provide many instructions on this, so that our country can move forward on the road of revival and devote itself to the completion of Greater East Asia construction.

### Japanese Expeditionary Force Announces One-Week War Situation; Fierce Air Battle Unfolds in Guilin

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China announced the one-week war situation on August 20th as follows: The Japanese army continues to launch fierce attacks on the Chongqing army operating in the occupied area and is currently launching a suppression campaign against the 111th and 114th divisions of Yu Bi-zhong's force around Weishan Lake in southern Shandong Province, North China. This time, the Japanese army's blitzkrieg air operations have greatly shaken the US air force strength on the Chongqing side and exposed its internal weaknesses. But the Chongqing side is still constantly publicizing that it will bomb Japanese soil and actively cover up the facts of its defeat at home and abroad. However, the power of the Japanese air force stands firm and unshaken. This severe reality has already made the Chongqing side realize that the US Air Force is not reliable.

Japanese Planes Attack Guilin

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Naval Air Force of the Chinese side launched an offensive in late July to preempt the movements of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, and fiercely attacked the enemy's forward base. Afterwards, it temporarily monitored the enemy's movements. Dare to approach the enemy to reverse the decline and resume supply work. In order to completely smash the enemy's records, the Japanese Army Air Force began a fierce offensive again. Army planes from a certain base were dispatched on a large scale on the 20th, rushing to the enemy's forward base, Guilin. At noon on that day, they arrived over the Guilin airfield. The Japanese Army planes attacked 15 enemy fighter planes of the P-40 and P-38 types that were defending the airspace over the area in a large formation, and a fierce air battle unfolded between the two sides. The enemy prisoners were at an absolute disadvantage and tried to escape. The Japanese Army planes immediately chased and fired fiercely at them. As a result, two of them were shot down (one of which is uncertain). At the same time, another team, before and after this, also launched a fierce attack on the chaotic enemy planes in the airspace over the area, and shot down three P-40 type planes (two of which are uncertain). The Japanese planes' attack was completely successful, and a total of five enemy planes were shot down (three of which were not definitively proven). The Japanese planes then returned safely as a whole.

Shot Down Chongqing-US Planes

Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Expeditionary Force in Central China issued a report at 7:00 PM on the 21st: The US Air Force stationed in Chongqing launched two waves of attacks at 2:57 PM and 3:05 PM on the 21st, using a joint formation of bombers and fighter planes.

Since the recent transfer of Chinese rural cooperatives by allied nations, the Chinese economy has formed an autonomous position. The authorities have defined interim measures to promote mutual assistance in increasing production and will be jointly announced and issued by the Ministry of Food and the Ministry of Industry.

### Chen Pu Arrives in Japan and Expresses His Impressions of This Trip

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) – Chen Pu, the editor-in-chief of the Guangdong Zhongshan Daily and a representative of South China attending the Greater East Asia Literary Conference, flew from Guangzhou to Fukuoka by plane on the afternoon of the 20th and is scheduled to take a car to Tokyo tomorrow. After arriving in Fukuoka, Chen expressed his impressions as follows: I am participating in the Greater East Asia Literary Conference as a representative of South China. I am very happy to be able to have a sincere discussion with modern Japanese writers. I am determined to work hard to investigate the trends of the Japanese literary world under the wartime system and to use them as a lesson for our country's literary world.

### Germany Has Full Preparations for Defending the European Continent and Will Triumph with Action

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) – Since the anti-Axis forces occupied Sicily, the war situation in southern Europe cannot be ignored. Therefore, what kind of strategy Germany will adopt in the future to defend the European continent has attracted the attention of various countries around the world. In this regard, decisions should have been made at the German Head of State’s headquarters meeting a few days ago. However, due to the recent talks between the German and Italian Foreign Ministers, the countermeasures have become increasingly strengthened. It is conceivable that Mussolini’s loss of power and the abandonment of Sicily, although they cannot but be described as major events for Germany and Italy, the German top leaders have not been panicked by this, and it is known that the German Head of State’s headquarters has long had countermeasures for this event and has established its strategy for defending Europe. As for where in Europe Germany will use as its final line of defense, the German Head of State’s headquarters must have already decided.

If the war spreads to the Italian mainland, it is still impossible to say who will be more advantageous at that time. Rome's non-militarization declaration and the policies of the Badoglio cabinet are all major political factors in the European war situation. Therefore, the trend of the current Italian government's policies has a major impact on the European war situation. If the enemy recognizes Rome as a non-militarized city and the military operations in the Rome area cease, it will definitely affect the military defense of southern Italy. In the future, Britain and the United States will definitely combine military and political strategies to carry out their work in Italy. The central issue of the Roosevelt-Churchill talks currently being held in Quebec must also be here. The German side relied on its superior tactics and fought with the superior British and American naval and air forces in Sicily. The pressure it received was natural, but if the enemy comes to the mainland, Germany will definitely wipe them out in one fell swoop. German Colonel Chans once predicted that Germany would win in three points: (1) Suppress the main force of the Soviet field army to the point of near incapacitation. (2) Successfully bomb the British mainland and control the lives of 40 million people. (3) At least annihilate one million British and American troops landing on the European continent. The current Germany is making urgent preparations for the most likely of the above three points and will take action as soon as the opportunity arises. Germany began a thorough national mobilization in February of this year, and the effect is quite significant. The fundamental reorganization of its national power and the power of its re-equipment cannot be seen until the final stage of the European war. From this perspective, some people in Germany are visionary. The German side also has preparations for landing operations from the English Channel, and preparations for the Balkans are also complete. We can see that the German army in Sicily overcame all difficult conditions with a small number of troops and fought with the British and American troops for more than five weeks, inflicting great losses. If the British and American troops land in Italy, it will not be as easy as before.

### Italian King Broadcasts

Commending the People of Sicily and Believing that the Country Will Be Liberated

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – Agenzia Stefani News Agency reports that Italian King Victor Emmanuel III broadcast to the people of Sicily last night, saying: "The pain that you have suffered makes our ties even closer. You must have heard the moving remarks of former Prime Minister Badoglio and former Prime Minister Orlando. I will soon travel to the beautiful city where you live. At that time, you did not make any requests. The compatriots of Sicily are people of strong will, who do not know treason and do not doubt, so even today, they still do not make any requests. During the long period of suffering, I will share your hardships. Your attitude deeply moves me. Your pain is my pain. Compatriots of Sicily, your King, my heart is with you, and I am the first to share your worries and the first to believe that the country can be liberated. Although the motherland has been seriously injured, it will definitely not lead to failure."

Allocating Funds for Refugee Relief

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) – It is reported that the Italian King and Queen recently gave one million lira to Prime Minister Marshal Badoglio to educate and help refugees from Sicily. Prince and Princess Pietro also gave 100,000 lira to Marshal Badoglio for education and help. Other princesses of the royal family also donated 10,000 lira each to the Sicily Refugee Relief Fund initiated by the "Italian Voice."

### Meeting to Be Held in Franco's Villa; British Ambassador and Spanish Foreign Minister to Attend

Madrid, 21st (Central News Agency) – It was announced here today that British Ambassador Sir Hoare flew to Corunna yesterday in the British Embassy's Douglas aircraft and will hold an important meeting with General Franco. It is reported that Foreign Minister Jordana will also attend this meeting. Jordana went to General Franco's summer camp in the Melas area yesterday, which is close to Corunna. The meeting will also be held there. Accompanying Hoare is Ambassador Harewood of the British Embassy.

### Quebec Conference to End the Day After Tomorrow; Hull Visits Eden for Talks

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports that Quebec officials announced: the Quebec Conference will conclude on Tuesday, with Roosevelt and Churchill scheduled to depart for Ottawa on Wednesday. Roosevelt will deliver a speech in the Canadian Senate. Sources with inside knowledge say that Britain and the United States have notified Moscow of the conference's proceedings. Regarding rumors that Eden will go to Moscow, sources say that if the situation necessitates, Eden will make a trip to Moscow. Also, news from Washington today states that U.S. Under Secretary of State Welles stated in an intelligence conference that he is unaware of the U.S. sending a representative to the Soviet Union, as the decision to dispatch a representative does not rest with Britain and the United States, but rather with whether Moscow is willing to accept. Britain and the United States hope to send a representative to the Soviet Union to seek Stalin's agreement with the resolutions of the Quebec Conference, but there has been no response from the Soviet side, largely because it is expected that Stalin does not approve of proceeding in this manner.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - Huitong News Agency reports from Quebec that U.S. Secretary of State Hull, after arriving here yesterday afternoon, immediately visited Eden for talks. Hull will also attend the banquet held that evening with Roosevelt, Churchill, Canadian Prime Minister King, and others. British and American military and political figures held a meeting this morning, the details of which have not been revealed. It is said that any communique must be reviewed by Hull before it can be released. The news that New York Archbishop Spellman has reported to Roosevelt the details of his discussions with the Pope and Franco regarding the Catholic Church's stance on post-war issues has aroused interest among people in Quebec. It is reported that Prime Minister King recently had a long conversation with Canadian Catholic Archbishop Villeneuve, but the Archbishop's secretary declined to disclose the content of the conversation, only stating that Spellman will also come to Quebec in the near future. Canadian Catholics oppose the bombing of Rome and support Badoglio's declaration of Rome as an undefended city.

### Thai Prime Minister Phibun to Visit Japan to Express Gratitude

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - It is reported that Prime Minister Tojo visited Thailand in early July and held talks with Prime Minister Phibun in Bangkok. At that time, it was decided to reaffirm the basic policy of Japan respecting Thailand's autonomy and independence, and the Thai government signed a treaty on the incorporation of new Thai territories on the 20th, so Thailand's national foundation has become more consolidated, and its cooperative stance with Japan in prosecuting the war has become even closer. It is now reported that Prime Minister Phibun, representing Thailand, will express gratitude to Japan and thank Prime Minister Tojo for his visit to Thailand, and will soon visit Japan in the name of a return delegation. It is said that Prime Minister Phibun has long intended to visit Japan, and his dispatch of Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon to Japan on August 3 was to thank Minister for Greater East Asia Affairs Aoki for his previous visit to Thailand. Now that Foreign Minister Wan Waithayakon has taken a route through Manchuria to return home on the 19th, Prime Minister Phibun of Thailand will again visit Japan, which will undoubtedly further strengthen the relationship between the two countries, the significance of which is truly profound.

### Burmese Government Announces Permission for Indians to Naturalize

Rangoon, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The government issued a national representative declaration this afternoon as follows: Although the Burmese government has stated that Burma is at war with Britain, Indians among the British people will not be regarded as enemy nationals, but will be treated the same as nationals of friendly third countries: (A) Indians residing in Burma, (B) Indians residing in Burma who are nationals of allied and friendly countries, (C) Indians passing through Burma on a mission. According to this declaration, Indians among the British people who are not enemy nationals are eligible to naturalize as Burmese citizens according to the "Burmese National Naturalization Law" to be enacted.

### Bulgarian Prime Minister Declares Policy Unchanged

Istanbul, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Bulgarian Prime Minister, in a meeting with reporters, declared: Under no circumstances will the Bulgarian government change its current policies. If there is any change in the Bulgarian cabinet, the new cabinet will not alter the policies of the current cabinet. The Prime Minister also denied that there is a revolutionary movement in Bulgaria. There are not many communists in Bulgaria. The friendly relations with Turkey will not be changed by anything. In his speech, he said that all Bulgarian wishes have been achieved. Some newspapers have mistakenly interpreted his words as referring to the border issue with Turkey, but Bulgaria has no demands on Turkey, because Turkey is also implementing the same policy. Finally, he said that he personally has great respect for President Ismet's contributions to Turkey.

### Gift

The style is small and exquisite, and they are indeed sturdy and durable.

### Enemy Ships in Vella Gulf Attacked by Japanese Aircraft

Shonan, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a Japanese military base in the South Pacific, four enemy destroyers infiltrated Vella Gulf from the eastern sea area on the night of the 19th and shelled the Japanese positions on Vella Lavella Island and Kolombangara Island. The Japanese Navy's seaplane unit, which was conducting reconnaissance and patrol, received a report and repeatedly bombed them and strafed them with machine guns, forcing them to flee southwest.

### Eastern Front Situation

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency dispatch) - The German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 21st: South of the Mius River, and south and southwest of Belgorod, Soviet forces continuously attacked German forces fiercely, but all failed. German mechanized units have penetrated deep into the Soviet rear. Near Vyazma southwest, Soviet forces attempted to break through the German line, but were repelled by German forces. On the 20th, German forces destroyed 154 Soviet tanks on the Eastern Front, and shot down 80 Soviet aircraft in aerial combat.

### Anglo-American-Soviet Disputes Surface

Recently, three major events have occurred in the European political situation, namely the emergence of the new Italian government, the end of the Sicilian campaign, and the Italian summer offensive. This situation has produced three major political activities. First, the Churchill-Roosevelt talks; second, the meeting of the Hitler headquarters; third, the meeting of the German and Italian foreign ministers in northern Italy. On the Anglo-American side, the military and political situation following the collapse of the Fourth French Republic and the occupation of Sicily must be thoroughly reviewed, and the recent anti-British and American demonstrations by the Soviets are also under review. The Anglo-American side had previously rumored the possibility of a tripartite conference, but the Soviet Union did not send a representative to the Churchill-Roosevelt talks.

Soviet Union Opposes Compromise with Italy

Regarding Britain's operational intentions after the Battle of Sicily, Swedish newspapers observed that "the operations against the Italian mainland will be completely different from the Battle of Sicily, and will generally be carried out based on comprehensive political considerations." London's conservative newspaper, the Daily Mail, pointed out the anti-German nature of the new Italian government and the strong anti-war sentiment, and advocated the bombing of industrial cities in northern Italy. Therefore, it can be seen that the bombing carried out by the Anglo-American air force is mostly intended to be offensive.

The Mystery of the German-Italian Foreign Ministers' Meeting

After Mussolini's resignation, the view of Italy held by neutral countries is completely different from before. A Swiss newspaper headline read: "Italy Hesitates Between Peace and War." This headline is how neutral countries saw Italy's situation at the time. Diplomatic circles in London speculated that "Italy's defection will occur within two or three weeks." In this extremely delicate and complex atmosphere, German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Foreign Minister Guariglia held a mysterious meeting. Because it was extremely secretive, its content cannot be easily speculated. Regarding the meeting between the two foreign ministers, Rome remained silent. While Berlin did not deny it, it did not issue any formal statement. Conversely, the anti-Axis countries only expressed "deep attention without explanation."

According to observations from neutral countries, the meeting between the German and Italian foreign ministers took place after the Hitler headquarters meeting, so it is quite thought-provoking. In addition to Hitler, the figures who attended the headquarters meeting included Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Marshal Goering, Minister of Armaments Speer, SS Chief Himmler, Minister of Propaganda Goebbels, Minister without Portfolio Bormann, General Inspector of the Wehrmacht Keitel, Commander-in-Chief of the Navy Dönitz, Director-General of Aviation Milch, Chief of Staff Zeitzler, and General Jodl. All of Germany's powerful political and military figures were present, which is quite noteworthy.

Speculation on Germany's Proposals to Italy

Therefore, the German Foreign Minister's meeting with the Italian Foreign Minister naturally carried the instructions of the headquarters meeting. The first result that manifested externally was that the Italian newspapers on the 10th suddenly changed their tone and began to attack Britain and the United States. However, what the two foreign ministers discussed is something that observers from neutral countries have not touched upon. Regarding the new Italian war aims, the Italian government often issues statements that "the war policy remains unchanged," but it would be wrong to regard present-day Italy as the same as Italy in the Mussolini era.

New Prime Minister Badoglio uses soft policies to control everything within the country, and under martial law throughout Italy, he intends to use force to interfere with anti-government actions and strikes. The ideological commonality between Germany and Italy no longer exists, but as long as the war continues, the community of interests between the two countries will still exist. From the German perspective, this community of interests is gradually turning into a military community. Conversely, from the Italian perspective, this is a political gambit (the last trump card in a card game) that Germany is playing on the belligerent nations. Regarding the content of the German headquarters meeting, it is observed that the Italian issue was discussed from an extremely realistic perspective. As a result, the supposed proposal that the German Foreign Minister made to the Italian Foreign Minister was likely to treat Italy as a military-geographic area, rather than as a political-geographic area.

Germany and Italy's Joint Propaganda War

It is reported that the German Foreign Minister told the Italian Foreign Minister that if Italy's "crisis" is unavoidable, the German army will bear the brunt, and powerful German units will continue to be stationed in northern Italy. In addition to military issues, the two also discussed a joint German-Italian propaganda war to cope with Anglo-American bombing. The war aim of Britain and the United States is to rebuild the European capitalist order. As for the specific plans, there seem to be two extremely opposing opinions:

One is a compromise plan, and the other is a thorough non-compromise attitude. The Anglo-American side views the Italian coup as a good opportunity to implement their plans, but they disregard the new Italian government, and the plan has failed. The Neue Zürcher Zeitung reported on the 11th the following London whispers:

"The attitude of the new Italian government has made Britain and the United States more determined to thoroughly destroy Italy's cities and industrial areas."

This means that London will adopt the second approach mentioned above. Britain and the United States intend to take the same attitude towards Germany and Nazism, but not towards the Balkan countries. This is clearly also a topic of discussion between the two foreign ministers.

The above is a review of the meeting between the German and Italian foreign ministers. As for the Churchill-Roosevelt talks, they were reportedly held to deal with the changes in the European political situation. Reuters reported:

"The Churchill-Roosevelt talks discussed three issues. First, using political and military means to get Italy out of the war while satisfying Anglo-American and Soviet conditions. Second, conducting a truly significant European continental operation to contain Soviet forces on the Eastern Front. Third, studying effective ways to force Germany to surrender."

These issues clearly indicate that the main motive for the Canada talks was to resolve the Anglo-American-Soviet disputes. In short, behind the Italian issue and the European issue, there is now a political issue lurking that cannot be ignored. (Translated from the August 15th issue of the Asahi Shimbun, Fourth Section)

### Ministry of Food Allocates Rice to Shanghai Market in Two Batches of 300,000 Bags to be Transported Successively

A Shanghai news agency reports that the Ministry of Food, in order to stabilize public sentiment and increase the quantity of rice allocated, has ordered the Shanghai Special Municipality Food Bureau to supervise and expedite procurement within a specified period. The United Rice Association has entrusted the Da Kang Transportation Company to handle the procurement of vehicles and transportation. It is also reported that the Ministry of Food allocated 150,000 bags of rice to the Shanghai District Rice Joint Operations Association last month, instructing them to transport it to Shanghai. Of these, 30,000 bags were from Huzhou, but due to the waterway blockade, only 15,000 bags have been transported. 20,000 bags from Yangzhou have been fully transported. A total of 100,000 bags from the four districts of Su, Chang, Song, and Jia, of which approximately 85,000 bags have been transported to this location, leaving approximately 15,000 bags yet to be transported. It is reported that this time there are also 150,000 bags, which are currently being planned for transportation in preparation for the next period.

### Match Allocation Method

The city's Match United Association is actively managing the allocation of matches. The outline of the regulations has been roughly drafted. In the future, each district's baojia will distribute purchase coupons based on the population of the district. Each person will receive one coupon, and each coupon will allow the purchase of two small boxes of matches, priced at two to three yuan. Citizens can use their coupons to purchase matches at designated cigarette stores, and the cigarette stores' matches will be allocated by the Match United Association to 300 wholesalers throughout the city, who will then transfer them to 6,000 small retailers. The official implementation date is expected to be in early next month.

Allocation of Five-Ocean Goods to Households

The price increase of Five-Ocean goods (goods imported from Europe, America, Japan, etc.) is more severe than that of other goods. The First District Office started investigating Five-Ocean goods at the beginning of the month, and is still continuing. It is reported that the relevant authorities have made an overall plan for Five-Ocean goods. In addition to thoroughly investigating hoarding, they will also implement allocation to households, with methods similar to those for sugar and oil. The specific methods are being formulated by the Five-Ocean Goods Industry Association.

### Price

The Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration of the Ministry of Finance has submitted and had approved by the Ministry of Finance an adjustment to the official salt price. The instructions state: "Considering that commodity prices and labor costs have been rising recently, it is indeed necessary to adjust the salt prices in various regions. According to the original price, add six yuan and three jiao per dan (a unit of weight) for the market price and transportation costs. However, the Yu Hua Company is not allowed to charge any extra money on top of the increased price. As for the retail salt per jin (a unit of weight) sold by retailers (i.e., small shops), they should collect the handling fee according to the regulations, but it should not exceed 20% of the regular price, and a proposal for setting the retail price should be submitted for verification. The above methods will be implemented from August 16, 32nd year of the Republic (1943). The current official price in this port is 18 yuan, 4 jiao and 5 fen per dan, and adding 6 yuan and 3 jiao makes it 24 yuan, 7 jiao and 5 fen, plus a handling fee of 20%, which is 4 yuan and 9 jiao and 5 fen, totaling 29 yuan and 7 jiao per dan, which converts to 1 yuan and 6 jiao and 5 fen per jin in Central Reserve Bank notes."

### Final Week of Broadcasting by the Municipal Propaganda Department

The Municipal Propaganda Department's month-long broadcasting will enter its final week this evening (the 22nd). The department has hired Peng Sijian from the Baojia Youth Department, Zhou Bangjun from the business community, Lu Zongxun from the Municipal Farmers' Association, Jin Pingshan and Zhang Beihai from the Municipal Baojia Committee, Chen Jiufeng and Cheng Zhiliang from the First District Baozhong Association, Jing from the Eighth District Baojia Association, Xu Liqiu from the Shizhi Joint Association, Dong Baibai from the Journalists' Association, and Ren Yunpeng from the News Association to take turns broadcasting. The time is set from 8:25 PM to 8:35 PM every evening, and citizens can listen.

### Over 520,000 Bales of Registered Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Unregistered Not Included

The National Commercial Control Association, upon order, will purchase the existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai. The purchasing office for cotton yarn and cloth will begin purchasing operations within the next month. The initial purchase will be of registered cotton yarn and cloth in various warehouses. For unregistered yarn and cloth, the Executive Yuan has decided to grant an extension for supplementary registration. If the registration is not applied for after the 15-day deadline announced by the competent control authority, the yarn and cloth will be confiscated and punished for hoarding. It is reported that the city's 581 public and private warehouses have previously applied for registration of stored cotton yarn and cloth to the Commercial Control Association and the Municipal Bureau of Economy. The registered yarn from Chinese merchants is 115,051 pieces, from Japanese merchants is 79,788 pieces, totaling 194,839 pieces. The registered cloth from Chinese merchants is 8,271,056 bolts, from Japanese merchants is 4,876,420 bolts, totaling 13,147,476 bolts (each 40 bolts of cloth is equivalent to one piece of cotton yarn), which converts to 328,687 pieces of cotton yarn. The total amount of registered cotton yarn is 523,526 pieces. The unregistered yarn and cloth are not included in this total.

Today, we are fortunate to have a good opportunity to gather Chinese and Japanese reporters together, which is very rare. We are also grateful for everyone's participation and for the attendance of officials from the local authorities, for which we express our deep gratitude on behalf of the entire News Joint Association. In this great era, Sino-Japanese...especially the news media...take the lead to construct Great East Asia. I am confident that we can work closely together to complete our mission. Today's invitation is to practice frugality; many aspects may not be sufficient, and we hope for your understanding."

It is an unprecedented event that Chinese and Japanese reporters are gathering together, and we are very happy. I came to Shanghai to take office two years ago, and at that time, due to environmental reasons, I met with reporters from a third country, but I did not meet with Chinese reporters. Chinese and Japanese reporters, your task is heavy. You represent the entire public opinion of both countries, and we hope that you will all work harder in your respective positions in the future. For example, today's grand gathering, participating and enjoying ourselves, is valuable, and we hope that it will continue to be held in the future. The significance of this kind of gathering is profound. Not only for China, but also for our Japanese reporters who have come from afar, it is a great pleasure to be able to have like-minded friends, like...the happiness of being in a family...it is truly precious."

Performance by Deng Guoqing Troupe

After that, everyone raised their glasses to toast, and the Deng Guoqing acrobatic troupe, famous throughout the country, gave free performances of various acrobatics, magic, martial arts, and dances. The program included aerial flying knives, flying bowls, flying balls, flying steel knives, hitting basins to drop eggs, women's balance board skills, group children's martial arts, aerial high-ladder skills, hypnotism, head-topping glass tower, and biting an Eight Immortals table with the mouth.

The troupe will perform a benefit performance at the Jincheng Grand Theater, and after that, the Sino-Japanese co-production film "Ten Thousand Purples and Thousands of Reds" will be screened.

### Public Servants and Youth Corps Second Term Summer Training Camp Closing Ceremony Held Yesterday Morning

Deputy Chairman Chen Chang presided over the training and gave instructions. Three weeks of training were successfully completed.

Central News Agency: The first session, second term of the New National Movement Public Servants and Youth Corps summer training camp, which began on August 1st in Shanghai, has concluded after more than three weeks. The closing ceremony was solemnly held at 8:30 AM yesterday in the camp's auditorium. Deputy Chairman Chen Gongbo of the New Movement Summer Training Committee represented Chairman [name omitted] to preside over the ceremony. Details are as follows:

Solemn Closing Ceremony

In the faint morning light, the trainees from both camps gathered at the drill ground to undergo inspection. The directors, deputy directors, instructors, and staff of both camps stood in orderly ranks. At 8:30 AM, Deputy Chairman Chen arrived, accompanied by all members of the Summer Training Committee, bureau chiefs from the municipal government, Brigadier General Kudo of the Allied Forces Army, Naval Press Chief Captain Toda, Lieutenant Commander Izubuchi, and Deputy Consul Fuwen from the Embassy's Shanghai Office. Deputy Chairman Chen reviewed the trainees from both camps to the uplifting sounds of the municipal police band. He then presided over the closing ceremony. First, Deputy Chairman Chen, representing Chairman Wang, led everyone in performing the ceremonial rituals. Then, representatives of the two camps – Qin Sen from the Public Servants Camp and Xu Songnian from the Youth Corps Camp – respectfully offered their tributes to the leader. Following reports on camp affairs by Camp Commanders Chen and Lin, Deputy Chairman Chen gave a speech to the trainees of both camps. Finally, Camp Commanders Chen and Lin presented awards and certificates to outstanding trainees. A group photo was taken, and the solemn closing ceremony concluded around 10:00 AM.

Deputy Chairman Chen's Speech

Fellow public servants and youth comrades, today is the closing ceremony of the second term of the New National Movement Public Servants and Youth Corps summer training camp. As the deputy chairman of the Training Committee, I am honored to be here on behalf of our leader to preside over the ceremony and say a few words to you all. I feel very happy and excited. This second term of training was held in Shanghai, starting on the very day that the Shanghai foreign concessions were reclaimed. Today, taking advantage of this final opportunity to address you all before the end of the training, I would like to discuss with you the leader's instruction to "awaken the citizens and pay attention to fundamental reconstruction." For a century, the Shanghai concessions have poisoned us in three ways: First, politically, they have undermined the integrity of our national sovereignty; second, economically, they have hindered the development of our national capital; and third, culturally, they have numbed our inherent beautiful thoughts and morals. Now that the concessions have been reclaimed, we must make everyone realize that they are Chinese, that they are East Asians, and strive to be useful Chinese and useful East Asians. There is no doubt that the outstanding public servants and youths among you must shoulder the responsibility for clearing away the ideological toxins of Shanghai. That is the meaning of the leader's instruction to "awaken the citizens and pay attention to fundamental reconstruction."

### Jing'an Temple Dharma Protection Association Established

It is reported that the association has already been established, respectfully inviting Minister Chu, President Jiang, Sheng Youyi, and Xu Tiecheng to serve as honorary directors, and Li Sihao, Chen Binyu, and Sun Chunsheng to serve as chairman and vice-chairmen.

The committee has instructed all Baojia offices in the districts to comply, so that the Baojia system in the city becomes more comprehensive. Citizens in each district who violate Baojia regulations will be punished or fined.

### Intensifying the Promotion of Labor Insurance

Since the Social Simple Insurance Bureau has actively promoted labor insurance, factories have been applying for insurance one after another. However, a few factories are still taking a wait-and-see attitude. If these factories continue to delay, it will be a violation of the national wartime social policy. According to Article 10 of the Provisional Outline of Social Simple Insurance, "If an employer refuses to provide compulsory labor insurance for their employees without a legitimate reason, they will be fined up to 5,000 yuan."

Commentary

### Soaring Food Prices

The common people of Shanghai are truly approaching a time when they "do not taste meat for three months"! A piece of pork the size of a gold bar costs more than ten yuan. Unless you are born into a wealthy family, any ordinary housewife will probably just look at it and sigh. The extent of the sharp rise in the prices of all other foods is similar.

Fortunately, the authorities are keenly aware of the people's suffering. At the third committee meeting of the Materials Investigation Committee yesterday, the final motion was: "Since the purchase of gauze has begun and the market price has fallen daily, the prices of general food items have risen sharply, which has a great impact on the people's livelihood. It has been decided to start investigating the reasons for the high prices of meat, eggs, and other items, and request the government to strictly enforce the crackdown." This motion is very meaningful.

During wartime, the most crucial issue in price control is the control of food prices. If the prices of food and all other food items are allowed to rise arbitrarily outside the scope of control, with a public black market on the left and a dark open market on the right (such as the use of non-standard weights and measures, prices exceeding the purchasing power of ordinary people), then unimaginable consequences will occur for the entire people's livelihood.

Therefore, we earnestly hope that the authorities will strictly enforce price limits on food items necessary for people's daily lives to maintain people's livelihood.

### Mobilizing the Public to Investigate Materials

The important current problem in Central China's economy is how to solve the issue of prices and materials. How to mobilize public organizations to promote this action is worthy of our attention. This time, the authorities dared to buy yarn and cloth, and both the authorities and the public have extremely high expectations. However, advancing the work is not simple because Shanghai's economy is too complex, and it can be said that there are too many accumulated problems.

It is believed that the authorities must have various great plans in order to carry out their original intentions. However, the strong and enthusiastic implementation of the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth shows their resolute determination. Currently, the investigation work is continuing to advance. Important materials are, of course, not limited to cotton yarn and cotton cloth. In terms of quantity, Shanghai has 4.5 million people. Assuming that one-tenth of them are hoarding, then there would be 450,000 hoarders, which is quite alarming. The current difficulties in investigation are due to emphasizing quantity over quality and the application of the important materials registration system is still insufficient. However, the investigation work must be completed quickly. Therefore, we advocate mobilizing public organizations to solve this problem. Since the Greater East Asia War, the Baojia self-defense system has made great contributions to maintaining the security of the concessions. Preventing terrorism and adjusting materials are, of course, two different things, but in terms of the nature of the problems, the danger to the public is the same. Now that Shanghai already has the Baojia system and the administration of the former two concessions has been unified, at the very least, the Baojia chiefs or district chiefs should be responsible for assisting in the investigation of important materials within their jurisdictions under the command of the Materials Investigation Committee. In short, the public should understand that assisting in the investigation of hoarding is to liberate their own future lives, and to be aware of this sacred mission. At the same time, the authorities should also regard this matter as a civic duty, organize it, and supervise it to ensure that this work is completed quickly and smoothly. It is hoped that the authorities and the public will recognize the current situation and handle it well, which would be very fortunate. (Yunpeng: From the China Daily News, August 10th)

### How to Build a New Shanghai After the Recovery of the Concessions (Continued) - Speech at the Civil Servants' Youth League Training Camp

— Chen Gongbo

Bribery and Acceptance of Bribes Must Be Eradicated

First, many people now criticize government officials, thinking that all officials are corrupt. However, according to my experience, the people of Shanghai are not necessarily cleaner than the officials. I often say that in other places, officials who want money have to find ways to get it, but in Shanghai, money will find its way into your house, and sometimes if you want money, the people will praise you. If you really don't want money, you may face unexpected dangers. I know some officials who often receive anonymous letters with checks and bullets inside, meaning that if you want money, you can be safe and sound, but if you don't want money, there will be immediate danger. If you are timid and corrupt, you will naturally want money. Also, the people of Shanghai like to bribe. The intermediaries also get benefits. For example, an industry association or a company bribes an official, using 10,000 yuan, but can declare 50,000 or 100,000 yuan. There are no receipts for bribes, and the intermediaries can claim that the officials want money and pocket a sum of money themselves. I believe this kind of thing must be eradicated with all our efforts, otherwise there will be no clean Shanghai. Bad Habits Must Be Corrected

Second, when Shanghai had concessions, foreigners only knew that they wanted prosperity, so they tried their best to protect the rich. As for the source of the money, foreigners did not ask. In the past, warlords and bureaucrats fled to the concessions with heavy assets after their defeat. Local tyrants and evil gentry also fled to the concessions to escape legal sanctions. Over time, in the concessions, as long as you had money, you could find a way. No matter if a person was a corrupt official, a gangster, or a rogue, as long as they had money, they were always superior in the concessions. Therefore, justice lost its function, the law lost its sanctions, and public opinion lost its effect. Even the public opinion of newspapers, fearing revenge from bad people, sometimes spoke up for them. In the future, we must correct these bad habits.

Dark Forces Need to Be Clarified

Third, in Shanghai, the center of power is not the government, not public opinion, but what is called the "gangsters." Why do gangsters have power in Shanghai but not in other places? Undoubtedly, it was cultivated by the concessions. Because of the concessions in Shanghai, the government's laws could not be enforced. Therefore, the dark forces of society took advantage of the situation to rise up. As long as they could deceive the foreigners, they could do anything outrageous. Even if the foreigners knew, because it was a Chinese affair, they only cared that it did not harm them and did not care about anything else. The upper-class gangsters colluded with the rich in the concessions, the middle-class gangsters colluded with foreign detectives and informants, and the lower-class gangsters organized gangs to gamble their lives for money. The rich were not afraid of legal sanctions, but they were most afraid of vendettas outside the law. The gangsters knew these weaknesses and became even more rampant. As a result of accumulated problems, even Chinese officials took pride in knowing gangsters. The so-called literati, while praising benevolence and righteousness, secretly associated with thieves. As things deteriorated, society became irreparable. To build a clean Shanghai, we must start by clearing up these kinds of people.

Extravagant and Vulgar Customs Should Be Strictly Prohibited

Fourth, Shanghai lacks the sanctions of justice and the input of culture. Customs are becoming more and more decadent. Even decades after the death of parents, people still hold memorial ceremonies to collect money. People who are only twenty years old throw lavish birthday parties. Things like this are shocking. Young masters open mountain gates and become old marshals, and use money from unknown sources to adopt many children. These strange phenomena are unique to Shanghai, and are considered shameful in other parts of China. All kinds of indulgence and extravagance are symbols of national demise, and we should strictly prohibit these vulgar customs.

Speaking of Shanghai's administration today, I believe that education and construction are more important than everything else. We should give equal importance to school education, social education, and family education. If we can change the bad customs, we can build a new Shanghai. If we let it decline, there is no need to talk about construction, and Shanghai will truly sink. I am the mayor today, and recovering the concessions can be said to be a grand occasion that happens once in a century. But I think that if we recover the concessions but cannot rectify people's hearts and change customs, then it is as if the concessions were not recovered at all. (The End)
