### Crisis in Shanghai Education

Since the Shanghai concessions were received, the authorities have concentrated their efforts on changes and constructions in political and economic aspects. However, there are also a group of enthusiastic and forward-looking people in the society who believe that with the importance of Shanghai's position, the improvement of cultural and educational facilities in the future will have a profound impact on the whole country. Relevant authorities should also take this into consideration for progress. Regarding the improvement of education in Shanghai, it has long been heard that the authorities are doing their best to plan, and there have been many things that have come to fruition. We have also repeatedly offered suggestions for reference. Now, we will just briefly present our views on some phenomena that urgently need to be improved, which seem minor at first glance, for the consideration of the educational authorities in this city.

The issue of academic atmosphere has always been the most difficult for educators to deal with. Before and after the incident, it made those who cared deeply worry. However, in recent years, the academic atmosphere in Shanghai has indeed shown a better trend. We have not heard of any student movements, nor have we seen any facts of students making political disturbances. This is certainly the result of the educational authorities' guidance in an invisible way. However, the activity and energy of young people are innate. When a cause for activity disappears, they are likely to find a way out in other areas. As a result, some young people inevitably fall into a kind of distorted phenomenon: 1. An indifferent attitude towards national and social issues; 2. An extreme development of individualism, becoming a selfish and self-interested attitude; 3. Embarking on the path of romance, indulgence, and degeneration.

The first phenomenon can be seen in the exam results of some of the major middle schools. Generally speaking, their understanding of current affairs is relatively poor. The second phenomenon is even more common. Many students study only to obtain a qualification, which they regard as a talisman for their personal future. As for what they learn, what their responsibilities to society and the country are, they do not care about. As for the third phenomenon, it is the development of the above two phenomena. Male and female students go to school with the purpose of finding a "partner." As a result, they are slicked up, perfumed, and dressed in fine clothes. They hang around in school and then go out to spend their time in revelry. Singing halls, dance floors, cinemas, and theaters are places they often frequent. Although it is only a partial phenomenon, the existence of this phenomenon is an undeniable fact.

The development of such distorted and bad phenomena in schools may not be visible on the surface, but it is actually a fatal factor for the future of the nation. We dare to boldly say that for the sake of the future of the country and the nation, students who are driven by emotional impulses and often make disturbances are less desirable than the current group of male and female students who do not know how to improve their studies, but only know how to dress up and embark on the road of decadence! Because even if there are any political errors in thought and action, they are still expressing their concern and love for the country and society. If appropriate methods can be used, it is not difficult to guide them to the right track. However, those who are psychologically indifferent to the country and society and only know how to enjoy themselves cannot but be said to be the biggest crisis in education. Today, we do not have any special countermeasures to correct the distorted phenomena, but only seek to first implement the following two points as a test for thorough improvement: 1. All male students in middle schools and universities should have their heads shaved, and they are not allowed to wear suits or gorgeous clothes, and they do not have to wear leather shoes. 2. Female students are not allowed to perm their hair, not allowed to keep long hair, not allowed to apply powder, and their clothes must be simple. Why do we specifically mention these two seemingly minor things? The main thing is to revitalize the new spirit of male and female students. At the same time, it is also the minimum condition necessary to practice wartime life and strictly implement the thrift movement. Because shaving the head can reduce a lot of time for hairdressing and the cost of hair oil. At present, a suit costs thousands of yuan, and a pair of leather shoes costs no less than a thousand yuan, which are all objects of thrift. As for female students not perming their hair and not keeping long hair, it has the same meaning as male students shaving their heads. Not applying powder and simple clothes are not only for strict thrift, but also should be the best expression of the pure and innocent nature of girls, and should be regarded as the most glorious thing. That is what we have always advocated: everything must be considered from a long-term perspective and started from the easy. The above two requirements do not seem too harsh, do they?

Today, another most serious phenomenon in all universities and schools is the hardship of life for teachers and staff at all levels. Mr. Jiang Shoutong, who recently suggested the establishment of a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, said that the income of university professors now is less than that of a rickshaw puller, and the income of primary school teachers is less than that of an ordinary nanny. Just imagine, teachers who are educating our children and cultivating talents for the country and society are living a life that is even worse than that of rickshaw pullers and nannies. What kind of society is our society? What kind of country is our country? Regarding teachers as less than slaves, and we still want to put the responsibility of "poor educational performance" and "decline of academic atmosphere" entirely on the teachers, it is really unfair! Therefore, any way to improve education and increase efficiency must start with improving the lives of teachers. Only when the lives of teachers are reasonably maintained and the status of teachers is fully guaranteed can we then strictly select teachers and make them bear the sacred responsibility. What is a pity is that, until now, there are only written articles about improving the lives of teachers, and only verbal theories have been heard. There are few facts of salary increases, but in reality, because the ratio to prices is still too far off, it is always useless. Today, we especially hope that the educational authorities will make the greatest efforts to improve the treatment of teachers and staff, so as to stabilize the lives of teachers and staff at all levels. Only when their lives are free of worries can we ask them to do their jobs well. Otherwise, if they cannot eat their fill and cannot support their families, and we ask them to be ambitious and far-sighted every day, frankly speaking, it is absolutely impossible! Many of the poor educational performance and bad student habits in society are blamed on the general teachers and staff. We dare to speak out on their behalf here: if the lives of teachers and staff are worse than that of rickshaw pullers and nannies, then educational performance and youth habits will not improve and be corrected, and the crisis in education cannot be completely eliminated. The educational authorities should pay attention to this.

### Japanese Naval Air Force Launches Surprise Attack on Two Australian Airfields, Darwin Port's Ground Facilities Damaged

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - Enemy long-range bombers have repeatedly made clumsy moves, attempting to carry out sporadic air raids on Japanese-occupied territories. The Japanese naval air force, therefore, launched a surprise attack on the enemy's long-range bomber bases, Broome and Batchelor airfields in Australia, before dawn on the 23rd, destroying several runways and anti-aircraft artillery positions. All Japanese aircraft have safely returned to base.

### Japanese and German Fleets Coordinating Operations, German Auxiliary Cruiser Thor Arrives in Japan

Tokyo, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese naval authorities issued a statement at 5 p.m. on the 24th, stating in essence that due to geographical relations between Japan and Germany, they have been focusing on maritime communication to continue cooperating in the war. Currently, they are implementing joint warfare through maritime communication during the war, based on the common interests of Japan and Germany. Currently, the Japanese and German fleets have severely damaged the British and American navies in all sea areas of the world, achieving great war results. The Japanese navy has destroyed many main warships, aircraft carriers, and other major warships of the Anti-Axis forces. The German navy has focused on commercial destruction warfare, also achieving great war results. The number of British and American ships lost in the Pacific and Atlantic Oceans is increasing day by day, which is a major blow to the enemy. The current war situation is such that the Anti-Axis forces, unlike in the previous World War, can hardly grasp absolute sea control in any ocean. The threat to their maritime traffic is due to the inability to prevent the Japanese and German navies from exerting their power in distant sea areas. Currently, the German auxiliary cruiser Thor, commanded by Captain Priepl, has safely arrived in Japan after achieving great war results. This has proven the power of the German navy. The ship's crew has received a warm welcome from Japanese officials and civilians and is scheduled to rest in Japan to recover from the fatigue of long voyages. At the same time, they will have the opportunity to learn about Japan and the Japanese people, which will definitely be of great help in preparing for new tasks.

### Air Defense Fever in North China

With the evolution of the world war situation, air defense has become a necessary measure, and the air of air defense has permeated the whole of Beijing in the past few days. In addition to the important people giving speeches everywhere on the importance of air defense, the North China Permanent Bureau has also ordered a full-scale air defense exercise in North China for eight days starting from September 1. This air defense exercise is different from the past in three points: first, it covers the whole of North China, not just Beijing; second, people from third countries also participate in the exercise in order to adapt to the practice; third, each report, notice, and alarm is attached with the words "exercise" to avoid confusion with a real air raid. On August 19, the Beijing Defense Command also convened representatives of the Beijing Special City Military Police Defense Corps and various special police defense groups to issue the implementation plan for the air defense exercise. According to the implementation matters disclosed in the newspaper, the scale of this air defense exercise is really large.

On the other hand, the aviation observation exhibition that opened in Zhongshan Park on the 19th is also a noteworthy event. The exhibition venue is in the waterside pavilion, which has a total of three rooms. The first room introduces various aircraft patterns, logos, and models. On the wall are hung six posters of American aircraft in Chongqing: North American B25 medium bomber, Curtis P40 fighter jet, Frewster SB fighter, Boeing B17 heavy bomber (i.e. the Flying Fortress), Consolidated B24 heavy bomber, and Lockheed P38 heavy fighter. There are also model aircraft with detailed explanations, giving wartime citizens a lot of knowledge about air combat. The second room introduces the actual situation of aviation sports in Qingdao. Among them, there are two glider aircraft with a scale of one-sixth of the actual size. The third room specifies the usage and power of various air defense weapons. This exhibition only lasts for three days, and will end on the afternoon of the 21st. This is certainly a very meaningful exhibition during the war. From this, we can also see the enthusiasm of the air defense movement in Beijing. (Sent by a student on August 20)

### Japanese Army Announces Combined Battle Results for Last Month

Central News Agency, Kyoto City, 24th - The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China's Information Department announced on the 24th: In July, there were a total of 1,764 battles. The combat strength of the Chongqing army was 251,677. The Chongqing army suffered 9,067 fatalities, and 68,563 were captured or surrendered. The Japanese army seized a total of 24 artillery pieces, 6,461 artillery shells, 187 heavy and light machine guns, 175,864 bullets, 4,870 rifles, 166,710 rifle bullets, 703 pistols, 4,663 pistol bullets, 59 grenade launchers and foreign guns, 144 bullets, 9,200 hand grenades, 725 military sabers, and a large amount of other telecommunications equipment, gunpowder, horses, and clothing. The Japanese side suffered minimal damage. The Japanese Army Air Force, after discovering that the American Air Force stationed in Chongqing was attempting to make a move, preemptively bombed their air force bases in Jianzhen, Hengyang, Lingling, Baoqing, Zhijiang, Guilin, and other places, inflicting heavy damage and destroying 47 American aircraft.

Comparison of Battle Results

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 24th - The Japanese Expeditionary Forces on the front lines of mainland China are continuously attacking the Chongqing army in various places, repeatedly achieving great victories. The Information Department of the Chinese Expeditionary Forces announced the combined battle results for July on the 24th. Comparing this with the battle results of July last year, the combat strength of the Chongqing army has decreased by approximately 28,000 men. The number of large artillery pieces seized has decreased by 65, and heavy and light machine guns have decreased by 207. Conversely, the number of captured and surrendered personnel has surged by approximately 6,000. This is sufficient to prove that the Chongqing army's fighting spirit is low and it lacks heavy weapons, leading to a daily decline in combat effectiveness. Furthermore, the number of rifles seized has significantly increased, indicating that the Chongqing army is using rifles to compensate for the lack of artillery. The Chongqing side's worries are also evident. The surge in the number of hand grenades, a major weapon of the Chongqing army, further exposes the lack of artillery raw materials. The number of Japanese fatalities has decreased by 509 compared to July last year, which is sufficient to prove the advancement of Japanese military tactics and the vigorousness of morale.

Central News Agency, Hankou, 24th - Japanese army units have established strong positions in the vicinity of Wuhan, preventing the Chongqing army from making any rash moves. They are still braving the scorching heat to continue their punitive expedition. The situation of the Japanese army in this area is recorded as follows: A certain unit of the Japanese army in the Tian Dian area, 16 kilometers northwest of Yingcheng, discovered approximately 500 members of the New Fourth Army on the Xu Dian River bank at 10:30 AM on the 16th. They immediately launched a surprise attack, and after a short battle, the enemy fled westward, abandoning 13 bodies. Furthermore, a certain unit of the Japanese army in the Hao Xue area, 50 kilometers east of the city, urgently attacked Zhang Jinhe City. A certain Japanese unit in the Ci Kou Town area, 24 kilometers northeast of Tongshan, routed approximately 1,000 members of the Chongqing army's 102nd Regiment of the 34th Division and a separate force near Shui Mutou, west of the town, on the morning of the 16th. The Chongqing army abandoned 31 bodies. On the 21st, the National Government army also launched a surprise attack on bandits and guerrillas two kilometers west of Xiao Gan, causing them to flee. The enemy abandoned five bodies, four prisoners, and seized six rifles. Several non-commissioned officers belonging to a guerrilla team in the Song He area surrendered on the 20th in the northwest of Jing Shan, bringing six rifles and two horses. Furthermore, thirteen non-commissioned officers from the 1st Regiment of the Provisional 53rd Division of the enemy army surrendered to the Japanese army in the Shi Chao Gang area, 34 kilometers northeast of Jing Men, on the 14th, bringing one light machine gun, two grenade launchers, and eleven rifles.

### Situation on the Central and Southern Sections of the Eastern Front Enters a New Phase German Troops Mobilized for Counteroffensive

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 25th - The situation on the central and southern sections of the Eastern Front has entered a new phase after the retreat of German troops from Karkov. According to military experts in London, the German troops in the Kharkov area are gradually retreating westward under the cover of strong rear guard units. At the same time, they are mobilizing reserve troops along the Dnieper River and are about to launch a major counteroffensive. Therefore, the Soviet army must defend against a fierce German attack around the city of Poltava, 80 miles southwest of Kalif. Furthermore, according to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet troops that bypassed Kharkov and advanced westward have reached the north of Poltava. Furthermore, the Soviet troops southeast of Kharkov have pressed towards the west bank of the Donets and Mius rivers, engaging in fierce battles with German troops southwest of Voroshilovgrad, 170 miles south of Kharkov.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th - A special military correspondent for Jinxin News Agency reports: The German army's retreat from Kharkov has greatly shortened and straightened the front line, which is of great help in enhancing the German army's resistance. The German army has encircled two Soviet divisions and two tank units between Simui and Atirga (north of Kharkov). Therefore, the retreat from Kharkov is actually an effect of the divine army weakening the enemy's combat power.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 24th - The German High Command announced on the 23rd: Since the German army launched its summer offensive on the Eastern Front on July 5th of this year, it has destroyed more than 15,300 Soviet tanks.

### A Record of the Long March on the First Line of the North Pacific: The Kuril Islands

From the Solomon Sea in the south to the Aleutian Islands in the north, in the naval supply war in the North and South Pacific, the transport ship 〇〇 Maru, which had experienced fierce battles, was speeding across the sea with rapid engine sounds. On the blurred mast, the bullet marks, point by point, could be faintly discerned. This was a fresh record of repelling an attack by the enemy's Grumman fighters during the supply war in the south.

Out of Death and Into Life

At the bow and stern of the ship, vigilance against the air and submarines was unceasing. The watchmen, wearing thick fur coats and holding binoculars, stared at the lead-colored horizon, seemingly waiting for someone. The sun showed its face before departure, the sky was a heavy lead-colored cloud, and a white thick fog enveloped the sea surface, reducing the watchmen's field of vision. In addition to wearing a set of cotton outerwear over the shirt, a woolen vest was also put on. All the cold-proof clothing was worn on the body, but the cold air still attacked the whole body from the deck where we stood. The crew members were extremely busy on the deck. Having escaped death several times, they had been tempered and were used to it. If you ask any crew member, they will frankly and unanimously say: "If you are afraid of submarines, afraid of planes, and afraid of the ship sinking, you cannot be on the ship. And coldness is very common on the sea of the North Pacific." Seeing the active situation of the wartime crew, the reporter could not help but bow his head

Flower of the Nation

The dark night spread out, and on the sea where nothing could be seen, the noctiluca emitted a faint light, sometimes bright and sometimes dim. The thick fog gradually attacked the large deck from the left and right. The ship, with all the lights completely controlled, was groping forward on the surface of the North Pacific with only a compass. On the way to a certain place, I floated to the surface and sailed leisurely. If the enemy submarine was discovered by our ship, it would not be spared. By tomorrow, there would be a story of repulsion to tell. But on that night, nothing fresh could be known. Everyone on the ship had this spirit.

"Are we still in dangerous waters?"

"This ship is about to reach its anchorage."

"Too hard!"

"Well, that's the normal thing about sailing on a ship during wartime."

The old captain stared intently at the compass with his mouth wide open, without a second thought. In a corner of the room, a nameless flower of the northern country exuded a rich fragrance, filling the entire room.

Outside, the fierce cold wind was blowing. The thick fog still shrouded the blackboard. The time on the watch was pointing to one o'clock in the morning. The reporter, shrinking into the collar of his coat and standing on the deck, only saw the figure of the sentinel standing upright on the foggy sea. In the howling wind that rang in his ears, he stood upright with a chilling demeanor and continued to watch. We seemed to see a famous painting, and felt a kind of intense excitement in our bodies. Later, in the afternoon several days later, the shining sun dimmed, and we couldn't help but rejoice greatly. To sail the North Sea in midsummer, one must have amazing endurance, a calm state of mind, superb skills, and a strong fighting spirit. And the crew members on the transport ships on the expedition to the North Pacific all possessed all of these, and they also personally experienced a full morale, so they often sincerely thought of the strengths of Japanese sailors.

The Sun Bestows Grace

The fog on the sea was sometimes bright and sometimes dim. On this first line of the northern frontier, seeing a clear blue sky was more joyful to the soldiers than anything else. Sometimes, at one end of that clear sky, the sunlight of the northern country shone directly down in an instant, and the soldiers shouted loudly, too late to take off their raincoats and coats: "The special grace of Mr. Sun." The blossoming flowers of the northern country, each emitting a cold fragrance, and the fog covered the tops of our clothes and coats, and the cold air continued to rush up from under our feet. We were responsible for the important task of building a certain team's base airfield. The brave men of this unit worked tirelessly from dawn to dusk on their daily work in the northern forests. We saw a type of creeping pine that was less than a meter high, with its roots twisted in all directions. It took a lot of effort to remove this root. And in the area where it grew thickly, it was extremely difficult to uproot. In order to open up this northern forest, the brave men valued their sleep and meal times very much. They knew that they must complete the work before the specified date and could not delay it for a few days.

Magnificent Spirit

From morning to dusk, working with all our energy, that is the expression of a severe, endless spirit. In every army, that spirit is extremely strong. In the eyes of these brave men, the harsh conditions of nature were no longer a problem. In front of the temporary dormitory in the misty fog, the brave men ate their cold meals in simple lunch boxes. Their eyes seemed to have tasted the taste, their faces were filled with a strong appetite. During the break after lunch, they picked up the rice grains stuck on the ground with their black hands covered in mud and chewed them carefully. They gathered together in groups of three or five to listen to us talk about things back home. That was a completely pleasant and leisurely scene.

Every day, what we saw and touched was the joyful faces of the brave men, the creeping pine forest, and the lead-colored fog and sky. In the eyes of the brave men at this base, our visit was a very rare consolation. "Ha! I haven't seen the faces of folks from my hometown for several days..." The young sergeant looked back and said like this. "You have worked hard..." These were the words of consolation we could express. "Because I am the captain, when I heard about the suicide attack on Attu Island, I felt heartbroken and angry." "I will not forget the pitiful situation of the brothers who died on Attu Island, and I swear to avenge the brothers..." The soldiers said such determination over and over again.

### Reorganizing the Baojia System Baojia Heads Who Neglect Their Duties or Abandon Their Posts Will Be Held Jointly Liable All Minjings Will Mobilize in Response to Alarms

The Central Police Bureau of the Eighth District specifically notified all Lianbao heads under its jurisdiction yesterday to inform the Baojia heads and Minjing team members under their jurisdiction. The original text is as follows: "After investigation, Lianbao Baojia heads and Minjings often neglect their duties and abandon their posts during their duty hours, which is very inappropriate. Therefore, all Lianbaos are hereby ordered to quickly inform all Baojia heads and Minjing team members under their jurisdiction that from now on, regardless of the time, if there is an incident, all members must mobilize and cooperate in their work. Minjing members must also be serious and punctual in their daily patrols. If they abandon their posts, not only will the Minjing be punished, but the Baojia head will also be held jointly liable for failure to supervise. The penalties are: 1. A fine, 2. Suspension of freedom for fifteen hours, 3. Lockdown (Baojia heads will also be subjected to this)." Furthermore, in view of the fact that returning residents often take their citizen ID cards with them and do not return to Shanghai for a long time, resulting in problems, the Baojia authorities have now specifically stipulated new measures. From now on, if a citizen returns to his hometown without handing over his citizen ID card and the procedures have not been completed within the prescribed time, the Baojia authorities may cancel his household registration once discovered. If it is discovered that the citizen engaged in illegal activities before leaving Shanghai, the head of the household will be held responsible."

Third Police Bureau Stipulates Two Measures

The Third Police Bureau has specifically stipulated two new measures for handling application matters: (1) When various trade associations and other groups convene meetings, they must submit the application to the department three days in advance so that personnel can be sent to provide guidance. (2) When various dramas and puppet troupes begin their performances, the scripts that should be submitted for review must be sent to the department for review together with the application form ten days or one week in advance, in accordance with the regulations, so as not to miss the deadline. It is reported that the new measures have been distributed to the responsible departments for attention and compliance.

Reorganization of the Baojia System Generally Decided

The Baojia of the first and eighth districts of Shanghai Special Municipality originally had guidance committees, but after the two concessions were taken over, the first, third, and second police bureaus established Baojia departments, directly under the jurisdiction of the police bureaus. This reorganization has been discussed several times and has been generally decided. It will be officially implemented on September 1st. Furthermore, it is reported that the Third Police Bureau of the Eighth District has long abolished the organization of the former Baojia guidance department, and the Baojia affairs are handled by the Baojia office, which is temporarily supervised by the administrative department.

### Customs Will Establish More Tax Collection Offices

In view of the sharp decline in foreign trade and the corresponding decrease in tax revenue since the outbreak of the Pacific War, the customs authorities are changing from levying taxes based on quantity to levying taxes based on value in order to increase tax revenue. At the same time, they are establishing transit tax collection offices in various places. Such offices have been established successively in Nanjing, Wuhu, Ningbo, Jiujiang, Hankou, and other places. It is now learned that the customs authorities are preparing to establish more tax collection offices in Zhenjiang, Wuxi, Suzhou, and Hangzhou in order to expand the scope of transit tax collection. It is estimated that the Hangzhou collection office will be established by the middle of next month. The establishment of the Wuxi and Suzhou collection offices is expected to be in October.

### New Movement Corps Deliberates on Practice Convention

In order to enable the five million citizens of the city to vigorously carry out the New National Movement, the New National Movement Promotion Committee of this city has issued a practical outline and organized practical groups to effectively promote the New National Movement. The New National Movement Practice Corps of various groups in this city, after receiving orders, are now specifically formulating various practice conventions for the New Movement in accordance with the regulations of the New Movement Association, in order to jointly abide by them and cultivate a new national habit for all citizens.

### Match Rationing to Be Implemented Next Month

The Shanghai Match Association has been actively handling rationing matters. Various concise rules and plans have been drafted and submitted to the authorities for review. The Baojia in each district will distribute purchase coupons based on the household register, with the level determined by the size of the population. This match rationing will be implemented starting next month. According to a reporter from the Economic Office of the First District Public Office, the authorities will also begin rationing soap. The plan has already been drafted and will be implemented once it is decided.

### Negotiating Methods for the 45th Period of Rice

The rice sale tickets for the 45th period were still not issued yesterday. However, the Rice Adjustment Committee met the day before yesterday and generally decided on the method of allocating rice for this period. The sale tickets may be issued tomorrow.

Allocated Rice Definitely Sufficient for Distribution

According to intelligence gathered by Datong News Agency, if the Ministry of Food allocates 150,000 bags per month, and the Central China Rice Distribution Office supplies one-third of that amount on schedule, there will definitely be no shortage of household rice, which is distributed in three periods of three liters per period for the first and eighth districts.

Restaurants and Factories Temporarily Reduce Rationing

Due to the stagnation of the state rice transportation organization, the Rice Flour Procurement Section, in order to concentrate the rationing of household rice, has stopped the special rationing of rice to first and second-class restaurants, and is now stopping the rationing of rice to third and fourth-class restaurants. At the same time, the rationing of rice to factories has been reduced from two liters to half a liter. However, the above measures are a temporary expedient.

Illegal Rice Shops Will Be Severely Punished

The local food authorities in this city have recently received repeated reports from various parties stating that a small number of rice shops are engaged in illegal activities. For example, when the authorities allocate half brown rice and half white rice to rice shops, some rice shops hide the white rice and privately sell brown rice instead. When citizens demand white rice, they charge a handling fee under the pretext of whitening the rice, or discount the quantity on each rice ticket. The authorities are currently secretly investigating these small number of illegal rice shops and will severely punish them. They also hope that citizens will report them at any time.

### Household Sugar Pricing Issues Approved for Sale Immediately

After the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office handles the planned sugar distribution and special allocation to various industries in order to maintain the normal need for sugar, the military distribution authorities will allocate the sugar to the cooperative office for distribution on schedule. The household sugar and special allocation for various industries for this period have been prepared. As for the pricing issue, it is currently being considered by the military distribution authorities and will be sold as soon as it is approved.

Replenishment of Insufficient Sugar in the Nanshi District

The planned sugar distribution for the fifth period in the city and the central urban area has not been widely distributed due to insufficient sugar. It is now learned that the city and the central urban area have successfully resolved this issue. All the insufficient sugar will be replenished by the Sugar Merchant Cooperative Business Office and will be widely distributed starting on the 30th of this month. The price will still be 2 yuan and 35 cents per half catty. As for the central urban area, a solution is also expected to be found within two or three days.

### 10,000 Dan of Cooking Oil Transported from Pudong to Shanghai Rationing to Be Implemented Within Days

For this period's household oil, the Edible Oil Trade Wholesale Office has reached an agreement with the military distribution authorities to allocate 10,000 dan of edible oil stored in Pudong to meet the urgent need. The goods have been started to be picked up and transported to Shanghai since yesterday. Rationing is expected to be implemented within a few days. The pricing issue has not yet been decided.

### Solicit Citizens' Opinions on the Facilities of Greater Shanghai

August 1st is the day when Shanghai's municipal administration was unified. The new construction of Greater Shanghai after this day is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the trend of municipal administration is worthy of citizens' attention. And the quality of the facilities, before the establishment of the representative bodies, citizens should also express their opinions with sincerity.

They will be compiled and disclosed. If it is necessary to keep them confidential, they will also be forwarded to the municipal authorities for reference. However, the content of the text should be truthful and the description should be concise and to the point. Absolutely do not use empty arguments. Write your real name at the end of the article and sign your name. A pen name can be used when publishing. Once published, a fee of 100 yuan per thousand words will be paid.

### Hualian Collects Donations Jiang E Donates Money

The Hualian Entertainment Association of this city, believing that Mr. Jiang E, a member of the association, was brave in capturing and avoiding death, and was tragically sniped, and was in a desolate state after his death, launched an appeal to all sectors to collect donations. It is now learned that the donations raised by the association to date total 2,000 yuan. Attorney Cheng Zhengping has been entrusted to temporarily keep the donations and distribute them to Mr. Jiang E's family.

### A First-Aid Medical Room Established at the North Railway Station Free Diagnosis and Treatment for Passengers

In view of the fact that passengers often suffer from symptoms such as catching a cold, the Road Police Management Department of the Ministry of Construction specifically ordered the Shanghai Police Section to establish a "Railway Station First-Aid Medical Room" in the office of the North Railway Station in this city, and hired two volunteer doctors to provide free diagnosis and treatment for passengers who have various temporary illnesses at the station, and administer medicine.

### Selling Coal at a Low Price in Cooked Water Shops Same Rationing in Hamakit

The first batch of 500 tons of coal for sale at a low price in cooked water shops in this city has been allocated to the first and eighth districts and various businesses in the two cities and Shanghai. However, the flat coal for cooked water shops north of the Suzhou River has not yet been supplied. All the coal in Hamakit is authorized by the authorities to be handled by the Hongkou Coal Retailers Association. It was learned yesterday that the Cooked Water Shops Association has reached an agreement with the coal industry to supply flat coal to cooked water shops in Hamakit, which may be distributed within ten days. The distribution method is the same as in the first and eighth districts, with each shop limited to seven baskets. The price is 429 yuan and 10 cents per ton of Central Reserve 券. The Cooked Water Shops Association will notify the public at that time so that they can pay the money.

The amount insured in Nanjing will remain the same, and the other four bureaus will be temporarily limited to 100 yuan.

### Central Market to Suppress Vegetable Prices

Recently, the prices of daily necessities have been falling frequently, but the prices of vegetables on the market have been soaring, greatly affecting people's livelihood. A reporter from the Central News Agency learned that the vegetable seeds and vegetables in this city are all centrally purchased at the Central Market. The Price Evaluation Committee of the market determines the prices, and then the market's commodity combination distributes them to vegetable vendors. Upon inquiring with the responsible parties of the market about the reasons for the soaring vegetable prices, it was stated that the current soaring vegetable prices are actually caused by illegal vegetable vendors secretly raising prices, which is more than double the price determined by the market's evaluation. Therefore, the market is now actively cooperating with the police authorities to suppress vegetable prices, planning to disclose the evaluated vegetable prices in newspapers each time, and setting up vegetable price wooden signs in various small vegetable markets, so as to effectively suppress vegetable prices.

### First District Office Investigates Private School Fees

The Culture Section of the Special High Section of the First District Public Office recently received orders to investigate the income and expenditure of larger private schools within its jurisdiction.

In order to assess whether the increase is reasonable, personnel have been dispatched to various schools for verification. It is reported that the main content of the investigation includes: 1. The number of students; 2. The amount of fees charged; 3. The amount of fees charged last semester; 4. The names and salaries of teachers and staff; 5.

"This Welfare Cup charity soccer tournament was held to raise funds for the welfare undertakings of the Chinese Social Affairs Association. We are grateful for the enthusiastic support of the Shanghai Municipal Sports Association and the full management of the Shanghai Friendship Sports Association. In terms of ticket sales, we are grateful to the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce for promoting sales to various industries on our behalf. The charity soccer was purchased by Mr. Pan Sansheng, Mr. Ma Dehong, and Mr. Xia Shikui for the highest price of 220,000 yuan. The players on both sides did not give way to each other, and the match was full of excitement and tension, which was unprecedented. The spectators from all walks of life competed to be the first to watch, and the enthusiasm was unprecedented. We are honored to have Mayor Chen and Minister Chu take time out of their busy schedules to attend the opening kick-off. We heard that Mr. Yuan Ludeng, Mr. Shen Siliang, Mr. Cen Xinshu, Mr. Luo Junqiang, Mr. Zhao Shushu, and Mr. Shao Shidan attended to give guidance. Actresses Hu Feng, Xi Qiuxia, Li Hong, and Chen Juanjuan attended to preside over the auction of the soccer ball, which achieved the highest record. Other aspects, such as the close assistance of the Eighth District authorities and the special convenience provided by the person in charge of the Yiyuan Garden, were also greatly appreciated and deeply honored. In addition to sending separate letters of thanks, I would like to express my sincere gratitude first! In addition, the income from the door tickets is still being calculated. Once the accounts are settled and the funds are collected, a public report will be made."

Economic Circle Comments

### Purchase, Distribution, and Production

The basic countermeasure of wartime economy lies in promoting the exchange of materials, which is an unchangeable principle. Materials and finance are like the blood vessels of the human body, which cannot be interrupted for a moment. Any obstruction will lead to disease. Therefore, the economic blood vessels must be checked at all times, and no stagnation is allowed.

Speaking of promoting the exchange of materials, it seems that three key points should be included: 1. Purchase; 2. Distribution; 3. Production; because: after purchase, materials will not remain in the doors of hoarders; after distribution, materials can be shared by all; after production, materials have their source of supply and circulation.

However, it is by no means as easy as ideal to smoothly implement the above three points: for example, since 150,000 of the 194,839 pieces of cotton yarn stored in Shanghai have not been registered, it is known that purchase must prevent concealment and non-reporting; because those who do not smoke cigarettes use cigarette rolling as a way to make money, and those who do not need milk use applying for milk to accompany bayberries and drink coffee, it is known that distribution must prevent fraudulent claims and false reporting; because this year's cotton harvest has increased by 30% compared with last year, and the total harvest can reach 4 million dans, it is known that the raw materials for production cannot be said to be few, and the basic strength of revitalizing industry lies in the greatest possible use of local products; therefore, increasing production in wartime must prevent the shortage of raw materials in factories.

In a word, materials and finance are both the blood vessels of wartime economy, and the most important thing is to be unimpeded and avoid stagnation. This is the responsibility of the government, and it is also the responsibility of the economic circles.

### Various Trade Associations Establish Mediation Committees

Responsible for mediating disputes between peers

The various trade associations in this city, in order to assist the authorities in restoring Shanghai's industry and commerce, have all issued notices to their respective member industries, urging them to buy and sell in accordance with the established regulations and not to overstep the norm and be prosecuted. If they are manufacturing factories, they should distribute the manufactured products to merchants who operate this product. Retailers must sell the existing goods to legitimate users. Do not hoard privately or seek excessive profits.

Request to Dispatch Personnel to Mediate Impartially

Recently, as the authorities have become increasingly strict in their work, general speculative merchants have been severely threatened, and they have gradually lowered the prices of their hoarded goods for sale. Even past black market purchases are not accepted, resulting in repeated disputes and an embarrassing situation. They are now requesting the various trade associations to take into account the welfare of the industry, and to dispatch personnel to mediate impartially, in order to achieve a satisfactory solution.

Establish a Committee to Handle

It is understood that the various trade associations have established "Mediation Committees" separately to take charge. Once they receive a letter from the industry requesting mediation, they will review the various points presented and then notify the relevant member industries to attend the meeting on the specified date for impartial mediation. The agreement reached by the representatives of both parties will be recorded in the mediation record, and the association will issue it for implementation. In addition to the standing committee members of the various trade associations, the committees also hire experienced people in the industry to participate in order to achieve perfection.

### Stock Market Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, while Chinese stocks were wavering amidst uncertainty, they suddenly showed strength in the afternoon. This was mainly because various stocks had already fallen significantly and for a long time, so a rebound was not unexpected. Consequently, trading became more active, and the supply of shares felt tight again. The news of the new capital increase of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory in the new pharmaceutical industry has gone from prediction to becoming a reality, and buyers have been particularly enthusiastic. The market rose gradually, and there were fewer sellers in the afternoon, with bids very firm. China-France stocks, which initially saw small price adjustments at market price, also exceeded the previous day's price in the afternoon. Five Continents, Sin Yi, Jiu Fu Pharmaceutical, and New Star Pharmaceutical Factory all made progress. The transaction price of Scientific Chemical also increased.

Dafa and Mayer traded around the previous day's price, while Sino-Foreign rose, especially rapidly in the afternoon. Hong Sheng and Da Zhonghua Weaving already had buyers active. Lun Hua, Tian Lun, and Guo Guang also showed a stable trend. In the department store industry, Wing On rose significantly, while Sun Sun, National Goods, and underwear all saw active trading of new shares. King Fook Shirt and Socks also rose significantly, but King Lun still showed little improvement. Da Zhonghua Matches and Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company were firm, Sanyou Industrial rose slightly, and Home Industry was slightly lower. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press was strong, while Zhonghua and World continued to soften. Yongxiang Printing, Standard Paper Products, and Jin Feng Paper Manufacturing were all doing well. Among public utilities, the rise and fall of Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Merchants Electric were minimal. Public Electrical Appliances was being sought at the customs, while China Xing Coal Mine was lower, and Hanyeping was higher. Real estate stocks turned from falling to rising, with Lianhua, New Benefit, and Yongxing seeing a sharp increase in bids in the afternoon. Jiu'an Industrial jumped up from flatness, Xiang Sheng and Shanghai Tricycle saw good prices, Kangyuan Canned Food and Jimei Food traded at the original price, and Standard MSG continued to rise, with new stock buyers gradually increasing.

### Devil

— Jie Ru

It was an early summer morning. Shuying, carrying the letter of introduction that Mrs. Bao had given her yesterday, set off towards this secluded Anhe Temple Road. The bus stopped at the last stop on Xiafei Road, and she walked straight west. The quiet street had very little traffic. The breeze rustled the trees on both sides. She was drawn in by the bronze plaque reading "Moli Shen Residence" at the entrance of No. ××. She felt a tremor in her heart. She felt that knocking on the door of a stranger's house was even more difficult than borrowing money from someone.

The peephole on the iron gate finally opened, and two mysterious black eyeballs filled it.

"Is this the Shen residence?" Shuying asked in a formulaic manner.

"Yes, who are you?"

"My surname is Fang, I'm looking for Mr. Shen."

The iron gate opened, and Shuying was invited into the living room in the west wing. In the center of the hall hung a large portrait, an oil painting of a man in his forties. A round face with two round and small eyes, with a European-style small mustache above his lips. "This is probably the master of the house. I wonder what the two children are like?" Shuying thought.

After a while, two children came down from upstairs. Their curious eyes were fixed on Shuying's face, feeling that she was very kind, and they started playing aside without any hesitation.

Shuying grabbed the hand of a girl and asked:

"Little friend, what is your name?"

"My name is A Jing, he is A Yu."

"Do you like to study?"

The older one shook her head, and the younger one stared blankly at his sister.

"You like to play a lot, right? Can I play with you?"

Shen Shouyi took the letter of introduction and sat on the chair reading it. Mrs. Shen leaned against the door frame, standing as if she was monitoring her husband. After a long while, Shen Shouyi stood up and said leisurely:

"Oh, you are Mr. Fang from ×× Women's Normal University. I have heard of you for a long time. It is really lucky for the two children to be able to receive Mr. Fang's teaching. However, the treatment here is not low. I will tentatively set the tuition fee at four hundred yuan a month, and the hours are from 9:00 in the morning to 6:00 in the evening. What do you think, Mr. Fang?"

Shuying hesitated and pondered for a while, and then said:

"That's fine."

"Then please come tomorrow, the 5th. I will prepare the books and supplies in advance."

"Very good."

At this time, Mrs. Shen had already taken the children inside,

Just as Shuying was about to get up to leave, Shen Shouyi squinted his eyes, peering at Shuying's appearance, and opened the letter in his hand to look at it, saying:

"Mr. Fang is originally from Shaanxi!" "Yes."

"Alone in Shanghai?" "Yes."

"Are you single now?" "Hmm!"

"Then how do you live alone?" "That's why I came to teach."

"Excellent, you are self-reliant, respectable and admirable."

Being a tutor is a difficult thing, but Ying can be considered to have no shortcomings in her work. However, spending all day messing around with them is also a troublesome thing.

One day, Mrs. Shen went out due to an affair. The maid said that Mr. Shen had asked him to go upstairs to discuss matters. Ying nervously took the two children up, with the maid following behind.

"Mr. Shen, what do you want to teach me?" "Um! I have something to discuss with you, please sit! Please sit!" He turned his head to the maid again, "You take the children to buy a bag of chocolates."

Ying knew that this was a trick to lure the tiger away from the mountain. A danger would happen in an instant. Her heart was racing, but her face did not show any fear. She tried hard to make her attitude look natural, with a calm face and closed mouth, like a prisoner awaiting judgment. She was mustering up the courage to resist as she should.

"Please sit, Miss Fang." He said, showing a very graceful expression.

"You can't call me that," she said angrily.

"Okay, then I'll still call you Mr. Fang. Mr. Fang, I see that you are also a smart person. Haven't you thought about your future at all? I really feel sorry for you!"

The fierce desire was burning in his heart, and his face showed an indescribable expression. He was like a beast with temporary impotence, as long as he found a very small opportunity, he would immediately pounce on Shuying and devour him cruelly.

"What are you saying! Shameless thing! You're so old and still so absurd. Your surname is Shen. My surname is Fang. I am your tutor, but unfortunately, it's inappropriate. What does it have to do with you? Please be upright and don't embarrass yourself!"

Shuying said these words as a precaution, shooting them out like arrows, as if scolding a bad child, not leaving him any room to resist.

"Hey! Mr. Fang, what does this mean? Don't misunderstand my good intentions. Since you don't want any development, why get so angry? Besides, we don't owe each other anything now." Seeing that things were not going well, Shouyi quickly tried to justify and defend himself.

Coincidentally, Mrs. Shen called over at this time. When she saw the two of them arguing in the room, she couldn't help but ask suspiciously:

"What are you doing? Where are the children?"

Shuying couldn't help but feel a little embarrassed, while that sly old fox Shen Shouyi laughed loudly and shrugged, saying,

"It's nothing, he wanted to ask me for an advance on his salary, but I didn't agree for a while, so he got angry like this. Haha, what a temper! The children went to buy candy with Xu Ma and will be back soon."

On the evening of the fifth day, Shen Shouyi walked into the living room with a yellow envelope in his hand. As soon as he saw Shuying, he smiled on his face and said, "Mr. Fang, this is your salary for this month, please count it." After speaking, he fell onto the sofa, trying to suck on his pipe as much as possible. Shuying took the envelope and unceremoniously pulled out the letter paper and banknotes inside. He first looked at the note:

"Received from the Shen residence a teaching fee of four hundred yuan, including a midday meal fee of two hundred and fifty yuan. To Mr. Shen Shouyi, receipt, June 5th."

Shuying was stunned when she saw this receipt:

"Ah! Is money also deducted for lunch?"

"Of course, especially with the price of rice being so high now. The contract didn't specify this." "This money, I know, is definitely not enough for you, Mr. Fang. I would also like to help you more, but... benefits and obligations are opposites, right? Haha! If you can agree, I have a way."

Seeing that he was becoming more and more unreasonable, Ying simply turned her back and ignored him. Seeing that she was silent, Shouyi thought she had fallen for it. So he slowly walked behind her, his face even more filled with a hideous triumphant expression. He stood behind Shuying, stretched out his aquiline nose, and tried his best to inhale the fragrance of her hair, and a pair of demonic hands followed the sound of his mouth and wrapped around her body:

"This method is not difficult to implement at all, especially for someone like you who is alone."

"Bah! You inhuman pig!" Shuying suddenly turned around and spat on his face, showing an inviolable expression, angrily breaking free from his hand, and strode back to her room.

### The Source of Porridge

— Gong Guangzhao

"Yanchun, Yanchun!"

Yanchun had concentrated on writing his long creation, and when he suddenly heard his wife's cry, he put down his pen and asked softly, "Jinru, do you want to drink boiled water?"

"No. Since I got sick, I haven't eaten a formal meal for two weeks. Today, I feel a little hungry and want to eat some porridge."

"Oh, I'll cook it right away." Yanchun replied quickly.

The bag of rice lay on the ground like its hungry owner. Yanchun knew there was none, but he picked it up to look anyway, as if to reassure himself: "What should I cook for Jinru to eat?" He was simply at a loss.

When Yanchun's wife was sound asleep, he gently opened the wooden box and secretly piled the cotton clothes and coats together like a thief.

A little white cat jumped into the room from the windowsill. The loud noise woke his wife, who was deep in sleep. She stared at the scene in front of her: "Yanchun, what are you doing?"

"The weather is good today, these clothes; I'll take them out to bask in the sun, so they don't get moldy.

"Alas! It's all my fault, I'm sick, and I'm burdening you with cooking, lighting the stove, washing clothes, and all the other trivial things. Yanchun, I really don't know how to thank you."

"Jinru, talking too much will hurt your spirit, you should rest. I'll bring the porridge over in a while." In fact, the pot was still lying coldly on the unlit stove. Where was the rice coming from? Yanchun waited for his wife to close her eyes and rest before taking the package out the door.

The sun shone intensely on the earth, and there were many pedestrians on the road. "What if I run into an acquaintance?" Yanchun fearfully watched every oncoming passerby. It was not easy to reach the Rusheng pawnshop on Xihe Street: "Sir, these clothes."

"Hmm," the gentleman with glasses looked at him and opened the package: "These five pieces of clothing, how much do you want to pawn them for?"

"Two hundred yuan."

"Hehe... what a big mouth, outdated clothes, wanting to pawn them for two hundred yuan, take this, here is one hundred yuan."

Yanchun silently accepted.

On the way back, he exchanged all the money from pawning the clothes for rice.

Yanchun tiptoed into the front room from the kitchen like a mouse. His wife was still sleeping soundly. He coughed on purpose, and his wife stretched lazily and woke up: "Yanchun, is the porridge ready?" He replied: "You're eating it now?" Jinru ate a few mouthfuls, savoring it.

"Maybe your appetite is good, Jinru, eat another bowl, and when you recover, we'll go see the scenery of the summer streets together."

"That way, you can also add to your writing material."

"Ha..."

### Wall

— Lan Yi

Piece by piece, it is piled up by strong black arms, mechanically, constantly down and up.

The sun peeks out from the horizon;

Piece by piece, it is piled up;

The sun steals into the horizon;

Piece by piece, it is piled up;

Gradually high, high, high,

Thick, thick, thick,

Long, long, long,

Before the dawn of the first day,

A sturdy wall is built

### Random Notes

— Liang Meng

Passion

Passion is undoubtedly the basic driving force of all achievements.

With great passion, one can build amazing achievements.

But passion is bound to cool down one day.

Only by letting reason control passion can it ignite an even more tenacious, fire-like passion.

Doubt

Without doubt, there is no progress.

Doubt is like a vaccine that will help you become stronger.

But, if you don't have a firm stance and decisive judgment, it will always keep you wavering and hesitating.

### Lamp

— Jing Bo

In the deep of night, the lamp is my only companion. I write, it leaves me, never complains about me. Sometimes the wall clock seems impatient and chimes twice, as if saying, "It's getting late, go to sleep soon," but my companion—the lamp—sends me a kind smile on its bright face, giving me a lot of warm voices, increasing my infinite courage, so that I do not feel the loneliness of the night, the terror of the night, the bleakness of the night. Although the snoring from next door continuously transmits into my eardrums. The wind outside the window is roaring, hoo! hoo! I—lonely I—at this time is like drifting on the sea, there is fear, there is sadness, disappointment, discouragement. The emotions of regret flood my heart.

I look up at the dark night outside the window, really, my end is near, this moment of time, it seems as if I will say goodbye to the world forever, the last time, but I occasionally glance back and see my companion lamp full of smiling faces full of radiance, immediately making my eyes clear, the clouds of worry disappear, only feeling that the future is full of hope and vitality,

Seeing that I feel the troubles of life like at the time, it seems like I am shouldering a thousand pounds of burden, making me unable to breathe, my feet are heavy, my head is dizzy, tears blur my eyes, looking at my future is bleak, just a dim sigh, the ruggedness of the road, the hardship of life, plans are like bubbles, hope is like a flower in a mirror, I only see hideous eyes surrounding me, my sweat is flowing, my heart is trembling, the flashing whips are still waving in front of my eyes. I am a decaying fallen flower, and I will be cut down, I curse my birthday, I dare not complain about people's indifference, black clouds are rising, and the shadow of despair has shrouded my life, but I occasionally open my eyes and see my companion's bright face like a lighthouse in the sea of suffering, illuminating me and guiding me to that golden world, lamp ah! You are really my only companion, because you give me an upward inspiration!
