### Promotion and Fortune

— Yoshida Tosuke

On February 14, 1912, Sun Yat-sen resigned as Provisional President. The following day, Yuan Shikai, upon Mr. Sun's recommendation, assumed the office of President. I believe this was the most regrettable event for Mr. Sun. In short, it was due to the government's lack of funds. Mr. Sun believed that it was imperative to maintain the South, so he proposed a loan to Japan. However, this issue made no progress. Later, the Senate resolved to transfer power to Yuan Shikai, and the loan issue became a thing of the past. At this time, Masatsugu Fujise, a director of Mitsui & Co., whom Sun Yat-sen had entrusted to raise funds, managed to secure 300,000 yen. He reported to Mr. Sun, saying, "As per your instructions, I have been running around everywhere, but I have been unable to raise enough funds. I have only managed to scrape together this amount with great effort. Please use it!" Mr. Sun immediately responded, "Thank you for your kindness, but I will not use it." And thus, he declined. Fujise thought that Mr. Sun felt the amount was too small and was expressing his resentment. He felt that "all this hard work and planning to raise the money was in vain." So he retreated in disappointment. However, Fujise later heard that when he brought the money, it was after the Senate had already resolved to remove Mr. Sun Yat-sen. He felt very sad, thinking that if he had delivered the money to Mr. Sun a few days earlier, he might have been able to do something. So he visited Mr. Sun again, saying, "I heard that you unfortunately stepped down. You must need money, so please accept this money!" Mr. Sun Yat-sen replied, "I declined your offer the other day because I no longer needed the money. I have decided to hand over all political power to the North. To maintain political power and run the country, this money would certainly be needed, but as things stand now, it is no longer necessary, so I declined. — As for now, although you say that this money can be used for my personal expenses, I would have no hope of repaying it if I borrowed it, so I can only accept your kindness, but please take the money back." Fujise said, "There may be many twists and turns for you in the future. If you don't have this amount of money, you may not be able to maintain the dignity of a former president. If the loan had been obtained before the Southern government was handed over, what would have happened? Then I would have demanded that the Northern Yuan government repay it…" Upon hearing this, Mr. Sun's attitude gradually changed, and he said, "That is absolutely impossible. We launched the uprising to overthrow the corrupt government of China and to eliminate corrupt elements. If we followed your words, then the first president of the Republic of China would be continuing the old bad practices, and that is absolutely impossible." And thus, he sternly and inviolably rejected Fujise's kindness. After hearing these words, Fujise is said to have been filled with respect and wept. (Talk by Mr. Kayano Nagatomo, a participant in the First Revolution)

The phrase "promotion and fortune" has become a common saying. In a society where officials feel no shame in accepting money, discovering such integrity is truly surprising and exciting for the Japanese. The officialdom in China at that time could be said to be morally corrupt, but we cannot help but painfully acknowledge that the officials of the Republic of China have largely inherited the moral bankruptcy of the Qing Dynasty era.

Lin Yutang, in his article "The Real China," described the corruption of Chinese morals as follows:

"...A staff member (Li Shih-hui) of the National Museum in Beijing colluded with the guards to steal national treasures from the museum's collection, selling them to the highest bidder, turning them into cash, and pocketing the money. He then built a large house without any repercussions. When someone filed a complaint with the court, it was refused. Furthermore, a certain general (Tang Yulin) didn't even put on a show of fighting. He allowed the great mountains and rivers of Rehe Province to be occupied, while he used two hundred military trucks to transport his concubines and family property. Yet the National Government pardoned the crimes of such generals. Many generals, after losing a battle, abandon soldiers and ammunition as if they were worthless, and only focus on transporting their stored opium. Because they sell the opium, they have the capital to buy back power. In order to maintain their undisciplined troops without paying them salaries, they force farmers to grow opium instead of food crops. Therefore, China, which is known as an agricultural country, has to import millions of taels of silver worth of rice and wheat from abroad every year. But in such a lawless state, the people who are directly harmed cannot say 'no' to their rulers and oppressors. There must be something wrong with the country. So the people cannot help but lose all their moral standards and concepts of right and wrong."

Indeed, after the Qing Dynasty became the Republic of China, the corruption in the officialdom remained the same. The term "promotion and fortune" has not been removed from the Chinese dictionary. Even the anti-Japanese Chinese and the British and Americans, who list all the evils of the Japanese, admit that Japanese officials are not ashamed of being poor. In Japan, if an official or politician becomes wealthy, that is sufficient evidence to suspect the person's morality. However, in China, "promotion" is synonymous with "fortune," so no one finds it strange. It is said that there are high-ranking officials who have accumulated tens of millions of fortunes in just three or four years, but no one dares to ask how such a large fortune was accumulated. The people, in the face of this situation, can perhaps truly be said to be "losing all their moral standards and concepts of right and wrong." Then, wasn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution simply a revolution that changed the name of the Qing Dynasty to the Republic of China? Absolutely not. As Mr. Sun Yat-sen himself said, it "was an uprising to overthrow the corrupt government of China and to eliminate corrupt elements." The Republic of China accepting the return of concessions from Japan cannot be considered "the success of the Chinese revolution." Mr. Sun Yat-sen's movement was a struggle against all the old structures in society (the Communists call them feudal remnants, as if they are just remnants after most of the feudal property has been cleared away, but this certainly does not represent the current state of China). Mr. Sun's revolutionary goal was a social revolution of Chinese democracy. And "promotion and fortune" is the most concrete symbol of a feudal society. Therefore, if we do not fight against "promotion and fortune," Mr. Sun Yat-sen's revolution completely loses its meaning. Mr. Sun's will regarding the revolution, in the true sense of its words, is indeed the truth that has never been realized in real China. As long as the phrase "promotion and fortune" exists in the Chinese dictionary, as long as it exists in Chinese reality, then we cannot lightly say that the Chinese revolution has succeeded.

—Alas! The revolution has not yet succeeded—(Chinese translation)

In August of the 9th year of Taisho (1920), he was appointed Battalion Commander of an Infantry Regiment. In the 12th year (1923), he was appointed Commander of an Infantry Unit in the mainland. In March of the 14th year (1925), he was appointed Chief of the Armaments Department of the Garrison in China. In August of the 15th year (1926), he was transferred to the Commander of a Mainland Unit. In December, he was transferred to the Commander of the Attu Island Unit. He died in action on Attu Island on May 29th of the 18th year of Showa (1943).

Japanese Army Ministry Awards Citation

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — The Army Ministry announced at 3:00 PM on the 28th that the highest commander of the army in that area had awarded citations to the Yamazaki Unit guarding Attu Island and Lieutenant General Yasuyo Yamazaki after his death. His Majesty the Emperor has been informed.

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — On July 14th, the Supreme Commander of the Northeastern Area of Japan presented letters of gratitude to the Yamazaki Unit and Commander Yamazaki for their loyal and brave defense of Attu Island. The letters of gratitude are as follows: The Yamazaki Unit, under the command of Lieutenant Colonel Motokawa, consolidated its unity, overcame all difficulties, and guarded Attu Island for a long time. On April 17th of Showa 18 (1943), Colonel Yamazaki arrived and, under his command, further strengthened their united hearts. Accomplished the mission, (omitted above) These troops, in this difficult situation, persevered, fought vigorously, united firmly, resisted the great material power, displayed the highest spirit of loyalty and bravery, killed the enemy effectively, seized their spirits, and made a great contribution to the overall operation. Their actions are truly the essence of the Imperial Army, and their military achievements are outstanding. This letter of gratitude is hereby awarded and announced to the entire army.

The Battle Was Moving and Admirable

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) — The brave warriors of the Yamazaki Unit of the Attu Island garrison, previously on Attu Island, restrained the main force of the US Pacific Fleet and a division of approximately 20,000 troops. They resisted the enemy, causing fear among the enemy's citizens. Due to being outnumbered, all the brave warriors died in action at the end of May. Three months have passed since then. The details of the fierce battle at that time have been reported to the Emperor. The Japanese Army Ministry announced the awarding of citations and posthumous promotions. The details of the Yamazaki Unit's fierce battle are as follows: The Yamazaki Unit included infantry, artillery, and engineers, as well as some communication and medical units, totaling approximately 2,700 men. Led by Lieutenant General Yamazaki (then Colonel), the soldiers defended Attu Island. In April, the enemy attempted to push their air force base westward along the Aleutian Islands. They landed a battalion on Attu Island, 130 kilometers west of Kiska Island, and hastily built an airfield. A month later, they had facilities that could be used by allied bombers. Therefore, in addition to constantly bombing Kiska Island, the US military also scouted the situation on Attu Island, using cruisers and destroyers to prepare for an invasion of Attu Island and to explore the location of the Japanese garrison. By May, the Aleutian Islands had entered

The Foggy Season

There were very few clear days. On May 15th, the enemy took advantage of the fog and sailed a large fleet, escorted by transport ships, to the vicinity of Attu Island. Another unit landed. The Japanese garrison prepared a counterattack, intending to wipe them out as they approached. However, around 10:00 AM, a Japanese observation post discovered a large number of enemy troops heading towards the northern part of the island. The Japanese immediately began a fierce counterattack, trying to prevent the enemy from landing. However, the enemy landed on the beach in a steady stream from three directions: north, central, and south. It was clear that they were numerous. Although the Japanese garrison fought back with all their might, the enemy finally broke through around a certain corner near 7:00 PM. At the same time, the enemy troops who had landed in Massacre Bay were also reported to be approaching. Another unit of enemy troops landed in Sarana Bay at the eastern end of Attu, but was quickly annihilated by the Japanese. However, at that time, the enemy troops who had landed on the north and south shores had already reached the northern area. Therefore, the Japanese garrison launched a night attack on the enemy troops who had landed on the south shore on the night of the 12th, causing them to retreat 1,000 to 1,500 meters. The enemy troops attempting to land in Sarana Bay were also wiped out. The Japanese garrison had achieved great results. By dawn on the 13th, the enemy began aggressive actions with reinforcements. Reinforcements were steadily arriving at Massacre Bay. A large transport ship convoy of the enemy also deployed some troops in a certain bay. Relying on their superior equipment and numerous troops, they began a fierce attack on the Japanese garrison that afternoon. Enemy cruisers also opened fire on the Japanese positions. The Japanese garrison not only resisted the enemy on all fronts and secured their positions, but also lured the enemy to land in a certain area, using mountain guns to annihilate them. The morale of the entire army was greatly boosted. The weather was relatively clear that day, but the visibility on the shore and at sea was only about 300 meters, making the battle particularly difficult. On the 14th, an enemy ship departed from a certain direction with excellent equipment, fiercely attacking the Japanese army and the Japanese H-soldiers defending a certain mountain. At the same time, two battalions of enemy troops who had landed on the shore attacked the Japanese army with several artillery pieces. That day, one small battleship, two cruisers, and three destroyers appeared in the waters near Attu Island, opening fire on various locations. The enemy heavy bombers flew over and bombed the Japanese positions, dropping bombs like rain. That day, the Japanese navy also bravely sortied,

Severely Damaging Enemy Ships

From the 12th, when the enemy landed, until the 14th, the Japanese army suffered only tens of casualties. On the 15th, the Japanese army continued to secure their positions, preventing the advance of ten times as many enemy troops. On the 14th, Japanese forces in a certain bay had launched a night attack, disrupting the enemy positions. However, due to the gradual increase in the number of enemy troops, weapons, and equipment, the battlefield gradually became more difficult. The Japanese garrison in that area had already seen a part of their troops make heroic sacrifices. At the same time, the enemy's attack on Massacre Bay became increasingly fierce. Enemy 15cm shells fell on the Japanese positions in a flurry. With the distance between the two sides being only 150 to 200 meters, the Japanese army carried out a night attack at noon that day. After fierce hand-to-hand combat, the enemy was forced to retreat over 900 meters. However, due to the thinner fog that day, the enemy's artillery fire was extremely intense. On that day, enemy transport ships continued to transport personnel and equipment to the shore. The number of enemy troops was approximately one division, totaling 20,000 men, all with special equipment. On the 16th, the enemy used heavy artillery and equipment, launching a fierce attack on the Japanese positions from land, sea, and air, resulting in the total sacrifice of one Japanese platoon. On that day, enemy transport ships continued to land. The commander of the Yamazaki Unit moved ammunition and food stored upstream of a certain river to the mouth of the bay on that day, determined to counterattack the enemy in front. From the 16th, from midnight to the 17th all day, they moved to the key area of the mouth of Chichagof Bay. At this time, all Japanese boats had been sunk, and the sea was also suppressed. The enemy fiercely attacked to hinder the concentration of Japanese forces. At dawn, because the planes mistook their targets, they mistakenly bombed the enemy's first line, which was ridiculous. Although the Japanese garrison was subjected to random enemy fire, they still completed the move to the mouth of the bay. They used the Kulu Circle formation near Mount East as the front line, attempting to strengthen their position and deploy troops to conduct operations in the Mupu area. The enemy concentrated artillery fire on the Japanese. On the 19th, the enemy began transporting supplies to the enemy who landed on Attu Island. Enemy ground troops also continued to attack. The Japanese, due to being outnumbered, had no choice but to retreat. The commander of the Yamazaki Unit ordered a unit to prepare to retreat to the Picke and Chichagof Mountain defense lines. On the 20th, the Japanese garrison continued to secure their original positions. The enemy continued to pursue with artillery fire. On the 21st, the commander of the Yamazaki Unit, in light of the various circumstances, advanced north, mobilized troops at the new defense positions, prepared at the front line, and concentrated the wounded soldiers at the mouth of a certain bay. The wounded soldiers in the hospital who could still fight and other military personnel were armed and deployed at the front lines, in a posture to counterattack the enemy. At that time, although there was still no need to be pessimistic about food and ammunition, the number of troops and weapons gradually decreased. However, the Japanese officers and soldiers were united in their determination to destroy the enemy.

Spirits Were High

And when mobilizing all weapons to fight fiercely, Commander Yamazaki had already decided to use the incompletely depleted force to make the final decisive move. On the 22nd, enemy warships and aircraft attacked. At this point, it was clear that enemy aircraft carriers had also arrived. Around 11:00 AM on the 23rd, Japanese aircraft flew to the skies over Attu Island to provide assistance. The soldiers on the ground were grateful to see the Japanese aircraft flying in. They saw the Japanese aircraft bombing the enemy fleet from afar. Splashes of water shot into the sky, and enemy ships caught fire. The entire garrison was greatly invigorated, and the enemy's fierce attack became even more intense. A part of the Japanese defensive position had been penetrated by the enemy. A fierce battle unfolded at the final stronghold, south of a certain mountain. Commander Yamazaki and others fought bravely, but due to a lack of weapons and manpower, after all the infantry on the front line had died in action, artillery and engineers replaced them as front-line defenders. On the 25th, due to the dense fog, the enemy's attack gradually eased. On that day, an encouraging telegram from the Japanese commander arrived, praising the brave and isolated struggle of the Attu Island garrison and wishing them a final heroic battle. Commander Yamazaki sent a reply, saying that all officers and soldiers vowed to exert themselves with a hundred times their courage, etc. At that time, the bravery and great achievements of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island were reported, and they were awarded unprecedented praise. This praise was telegraphed to Commander Yamazaki on the 25th and relayed to all the soldiers. All the soldiers were moved to tears when they received the imperial edict on the remote northern island. Their determination to serve the country was renewed. On the 26th, the enemy continued to attack fiercely. Commander Yamazaki, fearing that wireless communications would be cut off, wrote down the details of the battle since the enemy landed on Attu Island amidst the hail of bullets. By the 27th and 28th, the Japanese forces had prepared for the final assault. Commander Yamazaki believed that although there were other strategies, they would only waste fighting power and would not be able to strike the enemy. Therefore, he prepared for the

Final Assault

All seriously wounded soldiers who could not fight took their own lives. The survivors took up their guns and went to the front line to fight. After Commander Yamazaki waited for all preparations to be completed, he telegraphed each commander to express his gratitude. The Japanese authorities sent a plane to observe the final situation of the unit. Then, on the night of the 29th, they issued the final farewell message, saying, "We have decided to destroy the wireless communication device here." By midnight on the 29th, all the officers and soldiers launched a concentrated attack on the enemy. Thus, the 3,000 heroic spirits of the Japanese garrison on Attu Island fulfilled the important task of defending the northern border.

### Inside the Quebec Conference

Regarding the Quebec Conference, according to comprehensive reports from various sources, Roosevelt and Churchill spent the entire day of the 21st studying and discussing the shipping problem. Before Roosevelt arrived in Quebec, Churchill had already discussed the above-mentioned issue with British Minister of Transport Leathers and other shipping experts. US Secretary of War Stimson arrived in Quebec on the 22nd as scheduled. According to news from that location, Stimson's arrival in Quebec indicates that the discussion of military plans for the anti-Axis direction has in fact come to an end. Stimson's attendance was only to inform the specifics of the agreement on the use of American troops. After Stimson, US Secretary of the Navy Knox also arrived in Quebec.

The main issues of the Quebec Conference were:

Establishing an operational plan to alleviate the Soviet Union's demand for a second front.

Strengthening air combat on all fronts.

Strengthening aid of military supplies to the Chongqing government.

Establishing a general operational plan. Furthermore, Roosevelt and Churchill decided, based on the Mutual Defense Agreement, to substantially increase the supplies provided to the Soviet Union, which will be implemented soon. Regarding these international issues, a consensus has been reached to some extent, but the most important issue at present is the political issue. The relationship between Britain and the United States towards the Soviet Union remains unresolved and remains. It is said that if this conference cannot reach a decision in a timely manner, a second new conference will be held. The New York Times correspondent in Quebec emphasized that in order to discuss and resolve the issues that were not resolved in this Quebec conference, it is absolutely necessary to hold a second conference. He said:

"In this second conference, countries other than Britain, the United States, and Canada should be guaranteed the freedom to speak, and the conference should also invite small countries that attend only for formal issues. This Quebec conference is only a conference between Britain, the United States, and Canada. It is absolutely necessary to convene a conference including all anti-Axis countries." Also, the Soviet government recalled its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov, and appointed Soviet embassy counselor Gromyko as his successor. This matter caused a great reaction in all aspects. The above news was immediately notified to Roosevelt and Churchill in Quebec, but the two avoided making any criticism before clarifying the measures taken by Moscow. This recall of Ambassador Litvinov follows the recall of British Ambassador Maisky. Stalin's recall of this first-class diplomat and the appointment of an unknown young man to the position has given rise to various rumors. On the Soviet side, they are now engaged in threatening Britain and the United States to quickly open a second front.

On the 22nd, Soviet newspapers published the replacement of the ambassador to Washington. The Soviet government stated that although the ambassador has been replaced, the "fundamental friendly relations" between the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, have not changed. Although the second front has not yet been formed, the Soviet government will maintain the same relationship with the United States and the Soviet Union as before. However, the Soviet newspapers' expressions were quite dissatisfied, and the demand for the opening of a second front was extremely strong. In the next four months, the development of the European war situation centered on the second front, and the relationship of mutual surveillance between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, are worthy of attention. (Translation from the August 24th edition of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Economic Director Explains the City's Food Problem - Poor Operation, Hope for Improvement

The household rice registration in Shanghai has been postponed, and the allocated quantity has been reduced again. The public is panicked and cannot live in peace. Although the food authorities have repeatedly stated that there is no need to worry about the people's food in this city, because facts speak louder than eloquence, although it may dispel public doubts, this reporter specially visited Director Chen of the Economic Department of the First District Office to inquire about the truth. He told me the following:

Allocated by the Ministry of Food Since July

Since July, the household rice in this city has been allocated by the Ministry of Food every month. The national rice purchased in the Suzhou, Huzhou, Nanjing, and Yangzhou areas, totaling 150,000 bags, is entrusted to the United Food Joint Operations Society to transport to Shanghai. Together with the foreign rice supplied by friendly nations, the total is more than 200,000 bags. The former International Settlement (First District) and the former French Concession (Eighth District) receive 100,000 bags. Considering that the population of the First District is approximately 1.4 million and the population of the Eighth District is approximately 770,000, each person can receive a rice allocation of 2 liters every 10 days, plus 1.5 jin of flour every 10 days, regardless of age. The monthly total is 6 liters of rice and 4.5 jin of flour. Since July, although friendly nations have claimed to be shipping foreign rice, only 110,000+ bags of the 150,000 bags allocated by the Ministry of Food in July have been transported in more than 50 days from the beginning of July to the present.

August Rice Has Not Yet Been Shipped

The 150,000 bags of rice that should have been allocated in August have not yet been shipped, which has greatly affected the household rice. This is the key to the entire Shanghai rice and grain problem. The 44th period of household rice in the First and Eighth Districts could originally only supply 1 liter. The office, in view of the importance of the people's food problem, has specially found a way to add half a jin of flour to the flour allocation in the 45th period to slightly supplement it. However, there is also a fixed quota for flour allocation, which cannot be increased at will. Therefore, we have requested the National Government Food Administration and relevant Japanese parties to provide assistance.

Borrowing Foreign Rice to Meet Urgent Needs

Since the operation of the Rice and Grain Joint Management Society is poor, as mentioned above, and the people's food cannot be interrupted for a day, we have had to borrow a portion of foreign rice from friendly nations, approximately half a liter per person, and a portion of miscellaneous grains, approximately half a jin per person, and expedite the allocation of household flour for the 46th period to meet urgent needs. It is hoped that the citizens will understand that this is an unexpected and special situation and not worry too much. It is firmly believed that all relevant parties will have a proper solution to the entire food problem to maintain the people's food supply.

### This Period's Household Rice Temporarily Reduced to Half a Liter, Now on Sale, Additional Half a Jin of Miscellaneous Grains Issued - Quantity of Next Period's Household Flour Announced

The 45th period of household rice is now on sale, each announcement. The sale of flour for the 45th period is said to be the last day. The 46th period will be sold from September 1st to the 9th, at 1.5 jin per ticket, priced at 10.5 yuan. Also, in order to supplement the people's food supply, the previously issued Miscellaneous Grain Certificate No. 2 can be used to purchase half a jin of miscellaneous grains from September 1st to the 5th, priced at 2 yuan. The announcement issued by the First District Office yesterday is recorded below:

Announcement Issued by the First District Office Yesterday

It is hereby announced that the fourth ticket must be used by August 30th of this year to purchase flour, and will be invalid after the deadline. During the period from August 29th to September 5th of this year, the rice shops in this district will only sell rice with the 45th rice purchase ticket, and the retail rice shops shall issue half a liter of white rice and/or broken rice and/or brown rice at a price of three yuan when they receive each of the tickets with the shop number marked on it. During the period from September 1st to September 5th of this year, each retail rice shop in this district and each rice shop of this office will only sell miscellaneous grains with the Miscellaneous Grain Purchase Ticket No. 2, and the retail rice shops shall sell half a jin of corn and/or barley and/or hulled barley and/or sorghum at a price of two yuan when they receive each of the tickets with the shop number marked on it.

Furthermore, all retail rice shops in this district and all rice shops of this office will be temporarily closed on August 31st and September 10th of this year. The quantity of rice for the 46th rice purchase ticket will be announced separately.

The Third Police Bureau also issued the same notice yesterday.

The Eighth District Regularly Issues Rice Tickets

The Food and Price Management Department of the Third Police Bureau of the Special Municipality hereby announces: Regarding the issuance of the 13th period of household rice and household flour tickets: The 13th period of household flour tickets (Purchase Certificates Nos. 49 to 52) will be issued starting on Wednesday, September 1st. The usage date and available quantity of the tickets will be announced later. The heads of each household will be notified by the Lianbao chiefs to bring the household head's certificate paper and the housing tax bill for May and June of this year (both) to the issuing office in each district to claim the tickets on the scheduled date.

### Prices of Flour from Each Factory to Be Allocated Have Been Determined

Since the new wheat of this year came on the market, the General Commerce Control Office of the whole group has been actively acquiring it in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang and Anhui. Up to now, the quantity has reached more than 8 million bags. This wheat has been allocated by the Flour and Wheat Special Committee to flour mills in various places, and they are now working day and night to produce flour. The Commercial News reporter recently learned that each factory has a considerable output of flour. The Flour and Wheat Special Committee will immediately implement the allocation of flour according to the previously established flour and bran allocation plan. The prices have also been determined: 311 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen for first-class flour, 270 yuan, 1 mao and 6 fen for second-class flour, and 208 yuan, 2 jiao and 6 fen for third-class flour. The total daily allocation is 38 million dan. All allocated manufacturers are given a 20% legal profit.

### Five Major Bookstores Offer Preferential Treatment to Poor Students - Detailed Measures to Be Announced Soon

The five major bookstores in this city, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, World, Datong, and Kaiming, in order to respond to the New Student and School Movement in Shanghai and to reduce the burden on poor students, will universally offer book vouchers and preferential treatment. All students approved by the New Student and School in Shanghai can enjoy preferential rights when purchasing textbooks and other items from the above five bookstores. They are currently working with the trade association to formulate detailed measures. Once a decision is made, it will be announced. Because of the expensive paper and book prices, which poor students cannot afford, approved students often write to express their difficulties. The water newspaper stipulates that it cannot universally assist students, which is deeply regrettable. Now the five bookstores have initiated the offering of preferential book vouchers to reduce the burden on students. This benevolent and righteous act is worthy of praise from the academic community.

### Silver and Money Industry Identifies Counterfeit Banknotes - Decided to Act Cautiously - Authorities Taking Measures to Ensure Currency Credit - Hope to Raise Compensation for Losses of the People

Because the Central Reserve Bank has recently discovered five-yuan and ten-yuan counterfeit banknotes of the bank on the market, and the paper and printing of these counterfeit banknotes are almost indistinguishable from the real ones, the bank officially announced the English letters and suffixes printed on the counterfeit banknotes yesterday, as well as other distinctions, in order to avoid losses to the people. The news spread throughout the city. Based on the counterfeit banknote codes announced by the Central Reserve, there are many such counterfeit banknotes circulating on the market, which is extremely inconvenient for the general public and businessmen to use. According to people in the silver and money industry, the reporter of the Commercial News learned that a month or two ago, banks and money shops in this port discovered that there were counterfeit banknotes mixed in the five-yuan and ten-yuan banknotes of the Central Reserve, and the quantity was quite considerable. However, on the one hand, it was not easy to identify the real and fake ones, and on the other hand, the Central Reserve authorities had not yet made a formal statement. Now that the Central Reserve authorities have announced the counterfeit banknote codes and distinctions in detail, all silver and money shops and industrial and commercial circles must act cautiously and carefully distinguish when receiving and paying banknotes. However, the economic impact on the common people is very great. As for the plan for today, the Central Reserve authorities should, in order to ensure the credit of the currency and the lives of the common people, on the one hand, refuse to use such banknotes, and on the other hand, seem to take a remedy. The principle is to prevent the common people from suffering excessive losses, and to provide compensation.

### North China Journalist Group Arrives in Shanghai Yesterday

A group of fifteen North China newspaper reporters arrived in Shanghai from Suzhou at 9:20 last night according to the planned itinerary. Liu Kechang, the section chief of the Municipal Propaganda Office, and Commissioner Fang, and representatives of the Shanghai press went to the North Railway Station to welcome them. After the journalist group got off the train, they shook hands with the welcomers one by one. Then, they took the special car provided by the Municipal Propaganda Office to the New Asia Hotel, where they stayed. The list of the entire group and the scheduled itinerary are recorded as follows:

Full Group List

Cai Tianmei (leader), Wu Wei (deputy former leader), Xu [blank], Zhang Wenxin, Du Xusheng, [blank] Yi Kun, Chen Genglin, Liu Kunming, Qi [blank] Zhan, Zhang Wenxi, Zhao Xi [blank], Qiao Satong, [blank] Zhi [blank], Chen [blank] Shi, Wu Mengsong [15 members].

Scheduled Itinerary

Starting at 8:40 a.m. tomorrow, visit the Chunghwa Daily, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, and the Municipal Government. At 10:00 a.m., pay a visit to Mayor Chen. Starting at 10:50 a.m., visit the Shen Bao, the Continental News, the Central News Agency, and the Tongmeng News Agency. At noon, Mayor Chen will host a banquet for the entire group at the International Hotel. In the afternoon, free browsing. Starting at 4:00 p.m., visit the China United Film Studio, and the company will host a public banquet at the Kang Le Grand Restaurant. Afterwards, go to the Cathay Theater to watch a play.

### Guo Yuanrui Professes Loyalty to Peaceful Movement

(Central News Agency) Two months ago, the Municipal Security Office received a secret report that the Chongqing Loyalty and National Salvation Army's Political Commissioner Office for the Beijing-Shanghai Line had recently sent people to Shanghai to carry out activities and purchase materials. The office immediately secretly dispatched officers to secretly investigate, and on June 17, Guo Yuanrui (alias Yi Fei), the secretary of the commissioner's office, and several others were arrested at the North Railway Station. After separate interrogations, several suspects who were found to be irrelevant were released on bail. As for Guo Yuanrui himself, because the evidence was conclusive and there was no way to deny it, he fully confessed without reservation. However, the Security Office still treated the officer with great courtesy after arresting him, and gave him education and influence. Therefore, after two months of reflection in the Security Office, the officer has now sincerely regretted his non-plan to participate in the anti-Japanese organization in the past. In particular, the recent facts that friendly nations have returned the concessions have made the officer understand the sincerity of friendly nations in assisting the construction of a new China, and has decided to profess loyalty to the peaceful movement and has given himself a new life. In order to follow the supreme leader and Mayor Chen's magnanimous spirit towards the youth of Chongqing, the Security Office released him on bail yesterday.

### Comprehensive Suppression of Prices - Deadline is Not Far Away - Investigation of Materials Launched

The city's comprehensive and strict price suppression measures and the implementation of more widespread and severe penalties for violators are expected to be implemented by the authorities. The recent forced closure of six businesses on Yanjing Road for several days is the prelude to large-scale action to prevent hoarding and illegal profiteering. Furthermore, the authorities will then extend to various other areas on a large scale. Since the municipal administration has been unified after the reception of the two concessions, the powers can be uniformly implemented in a universal way.

Investigator Identification

Since the Materials Committee launched the investigation work, the committee has recently closely investigated the market prices of grains and meat. It has separately summoned the responsible persons of each industry to inquire in detail, and ordered them to do their best to dredge the frozen sources and suppress the wholesale prices. It is heard that the committee has re-examined the qualifications of the investigators after strengthening the investigation work. The investigators dispatched have a large yellow staff certificate for attendance, with the official seal and the chairman's name stamp affixed on the certificate, a photo of the investigator affixed, and a hard seal affixed. In addition, the investigators have a small silver badge with the words "Investigator of the Materials Investigation Committee" and the number on the badge. The investigators are issued an investigation notice for attendance to prove their identity and to show seriousness. As for the blue cloth staff certificate and the small round gold badge with the words "Materials Investigation" used by the internal staff of the committee, they are only used to prove the identity of the internal staff and are absolutely not allowed to investigate materials. If outsiders encounter people who have incomplete documents and come to investigate materials in the name of the committee, they are unscrupulous people who are impersonating the committee. They can be turned over to the nearest police organ for strict handling according to the law. The committee also hopes that citizens will cooperate and report them at any time to clear the scum.

### Establishment of the First District Public Office - Administrative Meeting

(Central News Agency) The First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, with respect to the former Shanghai Municipal Council's subordinate committees, including those for finance, police affairs, civil air defense, baojia system, public works, personnel, public utilities, sanitation, education, industrial social issues investigation, appeals, materials control, comprehensive affairs, subsidies, mediation, special consultation, rent control, transportation, dairy products, etc., after deliberation by the administrative meeting, decided that the five committees for public education, comprehensive affairs, special consultation, rent control, and dairy products were unnecessary and therefore abolished. Due to the need to review the city's price issues, a price committee was established. At the same time, the personnel committee was reorganized into two committees, senior and junior. Above the seventeen committees, an administrative meeting was established to manage the affairs of all committees, with Chief Secretary Wu Song, Advisor Ozawa, Special Secretary Takase, Director of General Affairs Sun Lifu, Director of Finance Kunino, and Chief of the First Section of the Secretariat, as members of the administrative meeting.

### Reminder to Collect Subsidies

This organization has approved students in various scholarship groups to collect their subsidies. Except for the university business and industry groups, all other groups have already passed the prescribed dates. It is now stipulated that, except for those who have requested to retain them in their letters, all students must collect their subsidies from this office before the 31st, so as to bring the matter to a close as soon as possible. It is hoped that all students who have not yet collected their subsidies will pay attention.

Subsidies Cancelled
Zhongyi Ben Yongxiang, Junior High School Second Grade Wang E, Junior High School Third Grade Fang Zhihao, Ben Xuedong Shishu, Senior High School First Grade Wang Meiyan, Feng Dingyi, Tang Dong, Fang Kang, Fei Yuzhong, Zeng Wenbi, Commercial High School Shi Zhongshi, University Group Zhang Peiheng, have all sent letters requesting to cancel their approved subsidies.

Approval to Change Schools

Junior High School Second Grade Xu Gao is approved to transfer to the First China Vocational School, subsidy of 160 yuan. Junior High School Third Grade Li Jianhua is approved to transfer to Guangshi Middle School, Senior High School First Grade Guangxin is approved to transfer to Datong Middle School, Senior High School Third Grade Bixian is approved to transfer to China Vocational Supplementary School, subsidy of 120 yuan. University Group Xingfu is approved to transfer to Shanghai Art College, Mu Songtao is approved to transfer to Shanghai Business College, subsidy of 500 yuan. (For all those where changes to the subsidy amount are not specified, the amount remains the same.)

Approval of Subsidies

University Group Cheng Xu, Shanghai Comparative College, 780 yuan. Cheng Wenying, Renmin University, 700 yuan. Wang Miaohan, Datong University, 800 yuan. Furthermore, this newspaper has learned that Shantang Wangren donated 2,240 yuan in scholarships, designated to support impoverished students at Shixue Elementary School. However, by the time of the scholarship application deadline, some schools did not have clear information on their impoverished students and did not submit applications. Therefore, at the request of the donor, late applications from 18 students will be considered. Except for Gao Xiaoyisheng, Jiang Xiuxi, Yan Hongjun, and Zhou Honghai, who have passed the newspaper assessment and are approved for subsidies of 200 yuan each, the remaining 14 students from Elementary School Year 1 to Year 4 have been assessed by the donors as coming from impoverished families. The school board has decided to allocate the donation amount appropriately, with each student receiving a subsidy of 100 yuan.

### ### Records of Calligraphy and Painting Collection from the Chinese Painting Academy

— Chen Dingshan

Recently, I and several gentlemen founded the Chinese Painting Academy at 470 Chengdu Road, with an exhibition of calligraphy and paintings from past dynasties as its first undertaking. Ji Qian and Bangda and I were responsible for soliciting paintings. After sixty days of planning and preparation, we are fortunate to announce its completion. I hereby express my gratitude as follows:

There are approximately fifty or more collectors in Shanghai. The aim this time was to request two or three works from each person, totaling about one hundred and thirty to fifty pieces. However, by today's deadline, we have already exceeded three hundred pieces, all of which are masterpieces. More are still coming in continuously. The enthusiastic support of collectors at home and abroad is worthy of mention, one.

All of the paintings in this exhibition are non-sale items. Initially, we planned not to sell tickets, but fearing overcrowding, we decided on a ticket price of twenty yuan, with half of the proceeds donated to the Shen and Xin newspapers' scholarship funds. We are grateful for the enthusiastic promotion by economic figures and social elites, which greatly benefits impoverished students. This is by no means a small amount, and this is worthy of our thanks, two.

This exhibition of paintings from past dynasties is of an experimental nature. Although we have tried our best to ensure the safety and protection of the works produced by the major collectors, due to the exceedingly high value of the calligraphy and paintings, we did not over solicit them. Therefore, for this exhibition, we planned to start from the early Yuan Dynasty up to the late Qing Dynasty. After achieving success, we will then expand to Tang and Song exhibitions. We are grateful to Mr. Xuzhai, a collector from home and abroad, for generously offering Guo Xi's "True Traces" from the Northern Song Dynasty, which increased the value of this academy a hundredfold and gave our association unlimited spiritual joy. This deserves our thanks, three.

Collectors at home and abroad such as Wu Puxin, Tan He, Zhang Congyu, Sun Bangjun, and Tui'an have collections no less than those of Yunlin, Qingmi, Zijin, and Tianlai. This time, they all selected the finest and most unique pieces to lend their support. Masterpieces of the Yuan Dynasty are all from their collections. The Ming and Qing masterpieces discussed by Gu Songlin, Jin Meixian, Zhao Zhongying, and others are also mutually reinforcing, allowing this exhibition to have a systematic arrangement. The Yuan Dynasty's Four Masters, the Ming Dynasty's Wen, Shen, Tang, and Chou, the Qing Dynasty's Four Wangs, Wu, the Eight Greats, and Shi Tao, as well as Xin Luo and Liang, are all exquisitely selected. This deserves our thanks, four.

The original plan was to display one hundred and fifty items, but the number of items solicited was almost twice that amount. Therefore, we plan to change the displayed items daily, so that visitors can fully appreciate each piece. We are also grateful to the major paper and fan shops, as well as the four major companies and major restaurants and silk shops on Nanjing Road, for their willingness to consign sales and support the publicity. This deserves our thanks, five.

Since the closure of the Daxin Painting Hall, painters have generally felt the lack of a suitable exhibition venue. The Chinese Painting Academy is centrally located, with spacious high-rise buildings, making it the only good location. Furthermore, the name "Daguan Tang" was inscribed by [blank] Hu, and the name "Chinese Painting Academy" was inscribed by Hu Fan in a magnificent and elegant style. This is worthy of our gratitude, six.

Recently, the heat has been even more intense than during the dog days. Ji Qian, Bangda, Dabang, and Ziqi are all key members of the academy and are working particularly hard. From numbering and arranging the exhibits to working through the night, they are sweating profusely. However, they have had the privilege of feasting their eyes on over three hundred masterpieces from the Song, Yuan, Ming, and Qing dynasties. This is worthy of our gratitude, seven.

Sports

### Health Cup Basketball Exhibition Opens - South China Defeats Beller

The Health Cup Invitational Basketball League, sponsored by the China Health Association, opened at the Beller Court yesterday afternoon. The audience was packed. Chairman of the Association, Lu Ludeng, President Wen Duting, Vice President Lin Kanghou, Ding Fubao, and others attended and presided over the event. Others present included Chen Binhe, Pan Sansheng, Ma Xiangsheng, and others. After Lin Kanghou gave a speech, the performance began. The prelude was a women's performance between Sansheng and Hua Xin. Under the opening ball ceremony of Mr. Pan Sansheng, the competition began. Sansheng won the first game with a score of 1 to 20. In the next game, San San Er lost to Hua Ying with a score of 32 to 45. The main battle was originally between Zhongbei and Hua Yu, but because Zhongbei failed to assemble, Beller was temporarily called to fight. South China defeated Beller with a score of 43 to 36, creating a big upset.

Hua Ying Joins the Battle

The league will continue with the second act today. Due to Hua Ying's request to participate, it has become a gathering of nine heroes. There are two games scheduled for today. The first game is between Hua Ying and Da Hua, and the final game is between Tongren and the Oil Team. Taihua and Yuejian are evenly matched with Hua Ying. Tongren's Yijia has a long history. The Oil Team has new arms. Hua Ying vs. Da Hua at 5:00 pm, Tongren vs. Oil Team at 6:00 pm.

Yesterday's broadcast time was 7:20 pm

Economic Commentary

### Knowledge Required Under a Controlled Economy

The Chinese nation has historically centered its economic life on the individual. Therefore, people are unaccustomed to the principle of the state using its power to manage the economy. Upon hearing the word "control," they feel uneasy, even alarmed. When they hear the word "purchase," they are even more dismayed, like startled birds. They fail to realize that purchase is merely one of the many tools used to implement a controlled economy. After purchase, there is rationing. Beyond rationing, there is production.

Haven't we moved beyond this? When analyzing a matter, we must carefully examine the facts and conduct thorough research. We should not make reckless guesses and cause ourselves unnecessary worry. For example, just because the government purchases cotton yarn and cotton cloth, it is assumed that the yarn factories will be unable to spin yarn. Seeing the control of medical supplies, it is assumed that pharmaceutical factories will be unable to produce medicine. Isn't this just self-inflicted trouble? Unless one is ignorant of the facts, one should not imagine things this way. It should be understood that after the control of cotton, the production capacity of yarn factories can be increased. After the control of pharmaceutical raw materials, the production costs of pharmaceutical factories can be reduced.

A controlled economy is adopted during wartime to achieve the goals of the war. Therefore, no country does not adopt a controlled economy during wartime. It can be said that nothing is not under state control. There is production control, sales control, and financial control. The purpose is nothing more than to have the entire nation unanimously abandon its individual freedom and consider the interests of the majority of people in a time of war. Because, "If the skin does not exist, what will the fur cling to?" If there is no water, fish will never survive.

### Securities Exchange to Reopen - Initial Trading of Chinese Stocks

The reopening date of the stock exchange has been postponed again. The reason is due to the arrangement of the securities market, registration of brokers, and internal personnel adjustments of the exchange. Now, the preparatory work has been largely completed. If there are no unforeseen events, it is hoped that trading can be reopened in mid-next month. It is also learned that after the reopening of the stock exchange, it has been decided to first trade Chinese stocks. These Chinese stocks are limited to those that have been submitted for approval and have a company registration license. After the opening of trading, all transactions will be conducted with cash and spot goods. Futures trading will not be undertaken for the time being. All transactions will be handled in accordance with the provisions of the "Stock Exchange Law."

Trends in Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks initially showed a weak trend. This was due to the pressure from sellers seeking to offload their holdings. Around noon, there was a sudden turnaround, and in the afternoon, the upward trend continued, recovering most of the losses from the morning and even rising further. Yong'an Company in the department store industry saw low trading in the morning, but suddenly saw an increase in demand in the afternoon. Xin Xin and Dahuo Company softened in the morning, but in the afternoon, they reversed from a decline to an increase compared to the previous day. Neiyi also rose in the afternoon. Jingfu shirts and socks saw considerable trading, and Jinglun stabilized. In the textile industry, Yong'an Textile initially remained flat today, but rose in the afternoon. Dasheng Factories One and Three both declined. Meiya, Tianlun, Xinye, Hongsheng, and Da Zhonghua Weaving initially saw slight declines, but later also rebounded. Nanyang Tobacco Company and Da Zhonghua Match fluctuated and declined. In the cultural industry, Commercial Press, Zhonghua, and World all declined. Yongxiang saw little trading, and Ge [blank] Weaving. Yangzhun Paper [blank] progressed. Xinye Five [blank], Xinye [blank], and Xinya remained flat. Xinya saw the most trading. Zhongsi, Zhongmo, and Zhongfa all saw small trading. Mingxing Perfume was uniquely stable. In the public utilities industry, Zhabei Water and Electricity rose slightly, Huashang [blank] Gas declined slightly, Public [blank] Electric Appliances, Inland Tap Water, Zhongxing Coal Mine, Hanyeping Coal [blank], and Shanghai and Xiangsheng Three [blank] stocks maintained [blank]. Sanyou Baoye. Family Industry rose slightly. China and Huashang Cement both [blank] Tongjin. Real Estate Industry. Xinyi remained flat and weak. Lianhua and Yongxing remained flat. Jiuan Industrial remained small. Xinya Construction remained stable. Baoan Glass and China Investment Association saw little change. Guosan Investment rose on news of a capital increase. Kang [blank] Can Company, Meilin [blank] Head, and Guanshengyuan all maintained their original prices. Standard MSG and Jimei Foods also remained flat. Other stocks also remained stable.

### Imported Materials - Wheat is the Most

According to a statement by the Materials Movement Permit Office of the Commercial and Trade Council, the most recent controlled import material is wheat from the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee. The main materials for export are sundries, medicines, etc. According to the permit office, there are 12 types of export items and 2 types of import items. The monthly benchmark quantities for import and export are determined by the Materials Control Deliberation Committee.

Commercial Summary

Yesterday, the government bond market was once again uncertain, fluctuating up and down. Generally, people believe that government bonds are better than stocks because stocks are more likely to be subject to control. Therefore, some are abandoning stocks and buying government bonds, but people's opinions are not unanimous. Yesterday, Type C bonds initially rose and then fell, but rebounded slightly higher than before at noon. The trend is still not firm. People are still uneasy.

Call Loan: The interbank call rate of the Money Industry Association is 2.4% per annum.

Few rice and grain shipments arrived. There were sporadic sales. Merchants from other provinces are eagerly seeking to purchase, so people are excited and the market has increased prices across the board. Both japonica rice and paddy rice rose higher than yesterday's market. Baiyuan also followed suit. It is heard that miscellaneous grains such as soybeans and red beans are in a stable situation, with no major price changes. There is little market for the rest.

Tea has been weak for several consecutive days and prices are [blank] soft and weak. Suppliers are still [blank] eager to sell. Buyers are very sluggish, resulting in few transactions and little activity in the market. The total trading volume in the city was 7 dan of black tea, sold by Wuchang Tea Company, designated by Taili Tea Factory. At the same time, [blank] Mao [blank] and Shengtai Tea Companies each imported about 5 dan of green tea, all sold by Yongshun Tea Company.
