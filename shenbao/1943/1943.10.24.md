### Answer to Pessimists

— Yoshida Toho

Since Badoglio's surrender and the German retreat on the Eastern Front, it must be admitted that pessimism has been growing among some Chinese people. They are beginning to wonder if Germany will soon follow Italy's fate! If that happens, then Japan and the Nanjing government, situated in the Greater East Asia region, will face unprecedented difficulties! Whether this observation is correct is of great importance to the fate of Japan and China, so it is necessary to answer it thoroughly. As explained in the past, Badoglio's surrender resulted in the removal of opportunists from the Axis camp, and the situation became favorable to the Axis. Or, to say that Germany's strategic position "is absolutely invincible," I think this kind of explanation cannot fully convince pessimists. Whenever I encountered these pessimists in the past, I always asked this question in return: Let's assume your observation is correct, but after Germany and Italy fail, it must be admitted that there is no longer a strong wall against the invasion of Europe by Soviet forces. At the same time, it must also be admitted that the pressure to suppress liberalism and communism in various European countries has suddenly disappeared. If so, it goes without saying how liberalism and communism, lurking in Germany and Italy, will flourish, and even liberalism and communism, lurking in countries such as France and Spain, will advance by leaps and bounds like bamboo shoots after rain, thus creating a situation suitable for Soviet invasion of Europe. If there is no hindrance to the westward development of Soviet forces, then it is not difficult to imagine that a wave of communist revolution will be set off in Europe at the same time as the defeat of Germany and Italy. Therefore, if Britain and the United States defeat Germany and Italy, then the European problem will not be solved. Furthermore, after the collapse of Germany and Italy, the flames of European communism will probably cause the rise of liberalism and communism within Britain and the United States, thus threatening the position of the ruling class in Britain and the United States, who are currently engaged in war. Then, even if Britain and the United States defeat Germany and Italy, they will not only be unable to get out of the European quagmire, but will sink deeper and deeper. Even if Britain and the United States "solve" the European problem, in that situation, it would be better to say that the European problem "solved" Britain and the United States. In this case, it is even more absurd to say "attack Japan with all our strength after solving the European problem." Therefore, the Greater East Asia War will not be decisively affected by the "solution" of the European problem.

Hypersensitive pessimists may raise a counter-question to my statement: "If Britain and the United States can compromise with the Soviet Union on the European issue after the defeat of Germany and Italy, then won't Britain and the United States be able to attack Japan with all their strength?" This is indeed correct. It can also be said that it is not absolutely impossible for Britain and the United States to compromise with the Soviet Union on the European issue alone. But a real compromise between Britain and the United States and the Soviet Union is impossible even now, let alone in that situation, wouldn't it be even more difficult? The following three points are appropriate answers to the pessimists' counter-questions.

Even if the Soviet Union itself can promise not to invade Europe, it does not have the will to prohibit the spread of communist ideology in Europe.

The Soviet Union does not have the will to help Britain and the United States suppress the communist wave that occurs naturally within European countries.

After the defeat of Germany and Italy, the Soviet Union is not so carefree that it does not know who its greatest enemy in the world is.

Of course, there are still skeptics who are not satisfied with these three explanations and advocate the argument that Britain and the United States will attack Japan with all their strength. Okay, let's take a step back and admit this assumption: After Britain and the United States "solve" the European problem, Britain and the United States will attack Asia with all their strength. Even in this situation, I still dare to assert that the Greater East Asia War will not be decisively affected. How is my judgment possible? Indeed, we cannot deny the enormous productivity of the United States, especially we cannot deny the enormous aircraft productivity of the United States, which will eventually exert its power on the Pacific battlefield. If Britain and the United States use all their aircraft in a major offensive in East Asia, its power will indeed be terrifying. It has already been proven on the European battlefield that the issue seems to be air combat in the future. In the past, people generally said that aircraft could not have a decisive force on the war. However, looking at the shape of modern air combat in which a large formation of one thousand aircraft air raids every day and can drop more than one thousand tons of bombs, it seems that the idea that aircraft cannot determine the war has reached a point where it cannot be established. Indeed, it cannot be denied that in Europe, aircraft can achieve a certain degree of decisiveness. In this case, can we say the same in the Greater East Asia War? Needless to say, there will be a Pacific Ocean between Japan and the United States. Even with the recent development of the aircraft industry, it is still quite difficult to overcome this distance strategically. At the same time, even if the United States wants to air raid Japan, it is not an easy task to find a suitable land base near Japan from which to take off large-scale aircraft formations. Taking off aircraft from aircraft carriers has its limits in terms of quantity and bomb load, so I don't think it is possible to carry out a large-scale offensive against the Japanese mainland like the battlefield in Europe. Of course, it is possible to use the Chinese mainland as a base, but it must be known that if a large group of aircraft is organized from Chongqing to air raid Japan, I am afraid that one-third of the strength will be sacrificed on the way. If aircraft do not have the decisive power to attack Japan, then the navy and army will not have the decisive power to attack Japan. Therefore, even if Britain and the United States attack Japan with all their energy, the military force that can quickly determine the Greater East Asia War cannot be concentrated. Of course, the distance from Japan to the United States is the same as the distance from the United States to Japan, so there is no special reason for Japan to quickly resolve Britain and the United States. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese people had already considered it to be a great and long-term war unprecedented in history. Today, after two years of arduous fighting, it is increasingly proving to be an indestructible truth. In short, no matter how the European war situation develops recently, there is no sufficient reason to assert that it will have a decisive impact on the Asian war situation. The pessimists' analysis of the current world situation is completely a fabrication behind closed doors, and it is obviously influenced by the so-called "anti-Japanese clichés."

### Japan Officially Announces Recognition of the Provisional Government of India; Declares Willingness to Provide Assistance to Achieve Goals

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 11:00 AM on the 23rd that Subhas Chandra Bose established the Provisional Government of India on the 22nd of this month. The Imperial Government notified its recognition of the said provisional government on the 22nd. The Imperial Government declared that the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India under the leadership of Subhas Chandra Bose is believed by the Imperial Government to be a major step forward for the people of India in realizing their long-cherished desire for Indian independence, and therefore grants recognition and declares its willingness to provide all cooperation and support to the said government in its efforts to achieve its goals.

Shaonan, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Provisional Government of Free India announced on the 23rd that the first meeting of the Provisional Government of Free India was held at Chairman Subhas Chandra Bose's residence starting at 9:00 PM on the 22nd, chaired by Chairman Bose. At the meeting, a resolution was passed to thank the comrades in India who are leading the anti-British struggle and the patriots who have contributed their lives to restoring India's freedom. The comrades also exchanged views on India's domestic economy.

### Significance of Japan's Move is Great

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India is different from the ordinary recognition of an independent country in international law. The Provisional Government is not the government of an independent country, but one established with the goal of striving for future independence. Therefore, it can be said that the government recognizes this provisional government, but it does not establish formal diplomatic relations under international law like those between independent countries. Therefore, diplomatic envoys will not be exchanged, and necessary negotiations between the two sides will be conducted by their respective overseas agencies. The most noteworthy point about Japan's recognition of the Provisional Government is that the Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government will coincide with the declaration issued by the government authorities. The Provisional Government of Free India is a government fighting to challenge the enemy and for the permanent salvation of India, a friendly country. This Provisional Government echoes the movement within India to promote independence and has the mission of driving out the evil forces of Britain from India and establishing a formal government in the future. This time, Japan took the lead in granting recognition, which is actually a congratulatory message for the Indian liberation war.

### Statement by President Amau

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Japanese Information Bureau President Amau released the following statement regarding the Japanese government's recognition of the Provisional Government of Free India:

The Provisional Government of Free India was born on October 22nd. The independence of India is the long-cherished wish of all Indian people and the expectation of all countries in the world. Burma, which has been groaning under British oppression and exploitation for a long time, has already become independent. The Philippines, which has been oppressed by imperialism and whose national characteristics have not been developed, has also been resolutely born as one of the countries in East Asia. Now, with the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India, it adds to its glory.

British Exploitation and Oppression of India

Britain extended its aggressive claws to India in the early 17th century, sucking the blood of the Indian people and taking their wealth. However, the Indian people gradually developed a spirit of resistance, and their desire for independence has become even stronger since the Russo-Japanese War. During the First World War, the British government used the promise of granting India autonomy as bait in order to exploit India's human and material resources as much as possible, but after the war, the British government not only failed to fulfill its promise, but instead imposed greater oppression. Thousands of people have been killed. Since the start of this war, Britain's exploitation of India has become even more severe, requisitioning Indian people and making them stand at the forefront. According to the figures released by the British government in June of this year, the British Empire has lost 500,000 soldiers since the start of the war, of which Indian soldiers accounted for two-tenths, or more than 100,000 people. In addition, the excessive burden of military spending and the supply of military materials to the population have caused India to suffer from malignant inflation and a serious shortage of materials.

Implementing Tyranny and Creating Famine

Moreover, the so-called man-made famine has been caused in Bengal due to British tyranny, and the number of people dying of starvation is increasing day by day. This kind of tragic news can also be seen in reports from Britain and the United States, and it has become an important issue in the British Parliament. Britain's oppression of India has been strengthened recently, and its momentum has become more pronounced since August of last year, becoming the so-called Atlantic Charter of the British and American war aims. Although the principle of national self-determination is clearly stated in it, it does not apply to India. The deceitful policy of Britain and the United States can be said to be completely exposed here. Under these circumstances, there is absolutely no hope for India's freedom to be obtained from Britain. There is no other way but to use force to drive British forces out of India. This has been resented by patriots all over the world.

Striving for Independence and Working Hard

Subhas Chandra Bose has always been a patriot who has been working hard for India's independence. After being arrested by British officials in India a few years ago, the Indian people immediately went on strike to show their resistance. Later, he went to various countries to bury himself in the difficulties of saving the country. He came to Japan in June of this year and went to the South. Since then, he has strengthened the Indian Independence League and the Indian National Army, and has steadily advanced the independence movement. Now, the opportunity is ripe, and the Provisional Government of Free India has finally been established. This government is not only a political power to strive for independence, but also has the mission of turning India from a temporary liberation to a formal Indian government. The Indian National Army is composed of young Indian people who are filled with enthusiasm for independence and are willing to sacrifice themselves for the country. When these soldiers begin to rush to the ancestral network to persuade liberation and attack, they will also be able to completely rid India of centuries of shackles and be liberated.

Japan's Assistance Has No Ambition

The Imperial Government admires the great ideal of allowing all countries to obtain their place and making all people live in peace. It has previously expressed its support for the independence of India, and sincerely has the same feelings, and will not hesitate to provide assistance. Now, the Imperial Government firmly believes that the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India has the most important responsibility for completing India's independence. We recognize and support the purpose of the government and provide all assistance to India to increase its oppression or implement a policy of appeasement. However, what Britain decorates India with is ultimately only shackles. Our struggle is to eliminate the shackles of Britain and the United States, and the rise of the Indian people is the same. Japan must work with India to celebrate the country's independence. As the spokesman of the Provisional Government of India explained, Japan has no political or economic ambitions for India after independence. The day will surely come when our people will increase their mastery over India.

### Japanese Army on Yunnan Border Seizes Nujiang River Crossing

Lisbeta, 24th (Central News Agency) - The Chongqing side is always making false announcements about the Japanese army's offensive on the Yunnan border, not allowing others to know the whole story. According to a telegram, the former spokesman of the Chongqing Military Commission said when foreign reporters visited him on the 22nd that the Japanese army has sealed off the Nujiang River crossing, and the Chongqing army in the Ligung Mountain area is in danger of being sealed off. It is said that the Japanese army is attacking the western highway of the two provinces in three routes. The soldiers on the border are already in a state of encirclement. The Japanese army that started its actions from Zhina is attacking northeast and east. The Japanese army with even more strength is advancing north from Wenan Longling face. It has now reached the west bank of the Nujiang River. It is said that the Japanese army has awakened the whirlpool and recognized the river. It is a mistake to transmit the cone. The Japanese unloaded and seized the crossing of the Nujiang River on the west bank. Most of you have to listen. Because the woven Japanese army has controlled the southwest of South Africa. Add the former Qian area of Burma Xunxiang Zhilanna, and the three-fish running area in the middle of its carriage and anger. In this war, the three weeks before the four were able to retreat.

### British Newspaper Admits Difficulty in Counter-Attacking Burma; Extreme Obstacles to Transportation

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a special telegram from the Swedish capital of the Tokyo-based Yomiuri Shimbun, the enemy army in the Shi Xun area began to stir after the rainy season. On the dawn of the 8th of this month, it attempted to land on the Mengduo side of the Burmese-Indian Fourth Army border, but it was annihilated by the Japanese army's guard. The pre-war blueprint of the counter-attack has been completely shattered. Regarding this matter, the Allied forces' East Asia Command argued on the 19th that although the British-Indian army's attack on Mengduo was the first attack on Burma after the rainy season, it was a very large-scale attack. Also, the British press warned the British that it would be dangerous to have too many expectations for the British-Indian counter-attack on Burma. For example, the London Times pointed out that in the Burmese operation last winter, the Indian Army Command at that time did not pay attention to the firmness of the Japanese defense positions and the inferiority of the Axis ships and air force. This was the reason for the tragedy in Arakan. Haxpawn pointed out the importance of the Burmese operation. The so-called counter-attack by Brigadier General润森盖 and the failure of Arakan were purely due to the small advantages of the terrain, but the Japanese army has long been trained in this kind of climate. After this failure, the British combat authorities knew that if they wanted to recapture Burma, they had to launch an extremely difficult large-scale operation. Burma's geographical conditions are very favorable for defense, and the attacking army must conduct several river crossing operations. It is difficult to develop hundreds of miles of large forest areas, especially because the rear supply is difficult. They can only transport cattle and sheep and cars from India, otherwise they have to wait for planes to transport them from the air. The longer this sleeve operation lasts, the more pain it will feel. Today, most British people have not correctly recognized that the transportation capacity of the Assam-Bengal railway and highway is limited, and it is difficult to transport large numbers of soldiers and military materials to the Sami Shidian front. Also, the Brahma Putra River can solve part of the problems, but the river changes again and again, and the water flow is turbulent, which only transmits the weaknesses of the military. However, any commander must know that when the Burmese two divisions deploy naval operations, the ships that they do not have will be bombed by the Japanese air force from three sides, and at the same time, they will be attacked by the army of one side. Its military power must rely on light aircraft carriers. Moreover, the harbor facilities in the various ports of India, which are the naval bases, are poor, so they are subject to significant limitations. Although it is shaped to quickly implement the combat plan, its greatest obstacles are strategic and transportation problems.

### Vargas Appointed Philippine Ambassador to Japan

Manila, 23rd (Central News Agency) - President Laurel of the Philippines consulted with his cabinet and decided to appoint Vargas as the first Philippine Ambassador to Japan. The appointment was officially announced by the Presidential Palace at noon on the 23rd. It is expected that he will take office immediately, and the ambassador's entourage is being selected.

### Japanese Army Air Force Again Attacks Chittagong; Fierce Fighting in New Guinea

Yangon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Army Air Force fiercely attacked the enemy's important stronghold in eastern India, Chittagong, on the 20th. It dropped bombs on enemy transport ships parked in the port and fired enthusiastic high-altitude artillery fire to destroy its docks and military facilities, achieving the following results: Two large steamships seem to have sunk, and fought with seven enemy Hawker Hurricane aircraft in the air, shooting down two.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Japanese army in the two Pacific regions on the 23rd, the battle in the Finshire Hafen area has become increasingly fierce in recent days.

### New Games Association to Publish Youth Ten-Day Journal

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The New Games Association has decided to publish Xu Xiqing, the head of the training department of the National Youth Cadre School, as the president.

### German Command Reveals Badoglio Regime's Conspiracy to Betray

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to Lu Haithong News: Documents released by the Supreme Command revealed Badoglio's conspiracy to try to hand Hitler over to Britain and the United States. The documents revealed that before the Badoglio government surrendered, the Italian military attaché stationed in Italy asked Schleicher to convey the Italian government's request, hoping that Schleicher would immediately go to Italy to discuss the issue of intensifying resistance against the common enemy. At that time, it had been decided to hand over Mussolini Hitler. It was obviously an attempt to hand Schleicher over to Britain and the United States as well.

Perceptive of His Treachery

However, the German government refused this invitation after receiving information that the Badoglio government was preparing for a mutiny. These documents remind readers of the situation after the Italian coup. The signs of the rebellion and the loyalty of the Badoglio regime to the Axis were mutually ornamental. It supplied the navy with fuel oil without disclosing the amount of Italian oil reserves and the border between Germany and Italy. The intention to mutiny needs to be increasingly clarified. The German army transported to the south to protect the Italian border, while the Italian roads around the Alpine region were attacked by the German army in three or five traffic lines. Three Italian divisions were stationed on the German-Italian border. On August 7, by order of Italian General Luo Yazhai, they resisted the German army in Wanshi Diqi. Only after the German army seized the three places designated to enter the Italian border, General Rozoer, General Yoterxi, and Military Attaché Ren Lun discussed with General Roate, the head of the Italian delegation in Boloni on the 5th of the month, the conspiracy to mutiny was obvious.

Playing Along

The German delegation protected the meeting with stormtroopers to prevent accusations. General Yueteta requested that the Italian army be woven in the north, while Luo Yaqin stationed the Italian army at the main entrances and exits of Tongyi and Tongwang Xi and Krot, and Luo sought to have the Italian army stationed at important seaports. At the same time, Luo Yazhai reiterated his loyalty, and Germany also sincerely accepted his sincerity to prevent Luo Yatai from discovering that the country had been suspected. The government of Austria and Wu repeatedly expressed its loyalty in the late August and early September, and at the same time, General Caste and General Eisenhower, the commander-in-chief of the Allied Forces in North Africa, held negotiations and signed a surrender agreement on September 3.

Military Measures

The document also stated the German countermeasures, the retreat of the Fourth West Li Island, to avoid the interception of the armed forces there. The army can firmly defend the bridge fort of Sicily. The German Command took many measures to occupy Naples, Walles, Rome, Spezia, and Genoa, and occupied all the main entrances and exits of the German-Italian border and the French-Italian border. On September 8, the US telegram covered the news that the Allied forces had surrendered to Italy. General Luo Yatai telephoned General Zaiselin to state that he did not know "the secret discussions and hurtful actions of the Royal Family and Badoglio," and submitted a list of "those suspected of having secret contact with the enemy," and submitted "political and military information" to the army, which was rejected by the General Army. At that time, the Italian army continued to concentrate seven divisions in the Luo Qun Ni area, including tank fleets and two divisions stationed in the north and south of Rome.

Italian Army Surrenders

However, the German army led Rome, and the Italian army in northern Italy surrendered due to Rommel's oppression. Genoa, Spetzja, Bolonna, Verona, and Kli were captured by the German army. More than 90,000 Italian soldiers were disarmed. The Italian ships and merchant ships in the Aegean Sea were all taken by the Sui army, and the Italian ships in Spezia joined the team. Badoglio originally wanted to hand over ten divisions of the Sui army to the British and Americans, but they were disarmed by the German army.

### Japanese Army in Jin Announces War Situation

Taiyuan, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army in Shanxi announced that since mid-September, the stationed Japanese army has launched an autumn campaign against the Communist army in Shanxi province.

As of the 22nd, the Japanese army's captured war results are as follows: 4,439 enemy corpses, 745 prisoners, and the destruction of 42 enemy facilities, including arsenals, military uniform factories, and granaries. The Japanese army seized 41 machine guns, 8 grenade launchers, 1,192 rifles, 272 pistols (including automatic rifles), 5,469 pistol bullets, and countless other military materials, communications equipment, and clothing.

### Railway Protection Propaganda Week Date Set

Nanjing, 3rd (Central News Agency) - As bandits and disturbances stir, local sentiments waver. To ensure the safety of railway operations, strengthen railway protection areas, and foster love for the railways among the people of China and Japan, the National Economic Reconstruction Commission of the Ministry of Construction has organized a full-scale Railway Protection Propaganda Week, with the assistance of the Central China Railway Company, to implement railway protection efforts. The implementation area includes Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Hangzhou, Jiaxing, Wuhu, etc. The first period is from the 25th to the 31st of this month.

### Allied Forces in Italy Intensify Offensive, Using Tanks in Mountain Warfare

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the National News Agency: British and American forces have intensified their joint offensive and reconnaissance activities in the Apennine Mountains and along the coastal areas of Italy. Although the battles are only local in nature, the deployment of a large number of tanks by the Allied forces is noteworthy. After setbacks in the German defense line in the Apennine Mountains, the enemy apparently does not expect the success of its infantry tactics. Therefore, the British and American forces, disregarding the difficult mountainous terrain, are again using tank groups to support infantry operations and avoid significant losses. At the same time, the Allied forces are using a large number of bullets to attack German positions in the mountains and hollows.

British Defeat on the Upper Volturno River

On the other hand, a detachment of British reconnaissance troops consisting of tanks and infantry suffered a serious defeat near the village of Rocchetta and the Upper Volturno River. In the fierce fighting, German 88mm cannons concentrated fire on four British tanks. Lacking protection, they attempted to dig trenches for self-defense but were disrupted by heavy German artillery fire. During this period, a British regiment launched an offensive on the highway leading to the German defense area east of the Volturno River. German artillery positions near Venafro were again attacked by large Canadian forces. According to reports, some time ago, several Canadian squads suffered heavy losses in the area, including nine Sherman tanks that were immobilized. In the eastern sector, the Eighth Army continues to reorganize its units, and some army squads are under fire from several German artillery positions.

### Great Battle in the Dnieper Bend Enters New Phase, German Forces Defend Steel Line 150 Kilometers Long

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reports: The great battle on the 150-kilometer front between Kremenchug and Dnepropetrovsk on the Eastern Front has lasted for nine days. The momentum has not subsided and has now entered the second phase, where the Soviet army is striving to protect the flanks of the breakthrough point without seeking to advance its vanguard. The breakthrough in the German defense line presents the Soviet army with great difficulties and dangers because the German command is often able to make appropriate strategic adjustments to cope with difficult situations in surprising ways. The German army is now reorganizing its troops and reserves, and the Soviet army feels it is extremely difficult to maintain the positions it has occupied in recent days. The Soviet army continues to reinforce the gap it has created with new troops, but does not attempt to expand it. This is different from the initial battles. The Soviet army uses its main force to protect its flanks. Therefore, another new development is expected, but it is not known how many days this second phase, which has a cautious nature, will last. The German military believes that the fighting will become more intense again. The fighting is particularly fierce in the Melitopol area, about several tens of kilometers from the coast to that location, and the defense line between Melitopol and Zaporozhye is about 100 kilometers long. On Thursday, the Soviet army made a forward thrust to the north, but suffered heavy losses.

### Soviet Army Heavily Reinforced, Attempting to Widen Gap

Bern, 23rd (Reuters) - Reuters reports: The current focus of the fighting on the Eastern Front remains the Great Dnieper Bend. On Sunday, the Soviet army attempted to widen its breakthrough between Kremenchug and Dnepropetrovsk. Although the Soviet vanguard's new attempt to advance south is not yet apparent, this is inevitable. On Wednesday and Thursday, the enemy forces gathered a large number of fresh troops into the gap. Some of these fresh troops were engaged in consolidating the edges of the gap, while the main force was preparing for a major offensive. The fighting on Thursday, although not as intense as at the beginning of the week, was still quite tense, especially the German defense positions south of Kremenchug and southwest of Dnepropetrovsk were under heavy pressure from the Soviet army. The fighting is still in progress in some places. There has also been fierce fighting between Zaporozhye and the Sea of Azov. The fighting in that area is closely related to the fighting in the northern Dnieper Bend because the enemy's strategic goals are the same in both areas.

### Soviet Landing on Eastern Crimean Coast Unsuccessful

On Thursday, fighting also took place at the entrance to the Nogai Steppe. The enemy forces attacked the German-held territory on a front of 100 kilometers. The fighting was particularly fierce on both sides of Melitopol. The enemy's attacks were repelled, but fighting continues in some gaps. A small enemy squad attempted to land on the eastern coast of Crimea but was immediately driven back by the German coastal defense forces. However, it is still unknown whether this action was a precursor to a major landing. A summary of the situation elsewhere on the Eastern Front is as follows: The situation in the Krivoy Rog area is relatively stable. The enemy's offensive south of the city suffered significant losses. The offensive north of Siversk has made some improvements to the positions. The Soviet army moving north at the confluence of the Sozh and Dnieper rivers, attempting to encircle the German forces in the Rechytsa and Gomel regions, was unsuccessful. The enemy's offensive on the narrow front east of Orsha on the Smolensk-Minsk highway was repelled, and the Soviet army suffered heavy losses. The enemy's attempts to limit the fighting on the Volkhov and Neva rivers to a local nature, but the enemy has concentrated a large army in recent days, and a major battle may be imminent.

### Japan Strengthens Domestic Situation

Unification of Regulations

Just by looking at the tense work at the Nakajima Aircraft Factory, one can understand how difficult the path of increasing aircraft production is. High-performance machine tools operate non-stop for 24 hours a day, without holidays, without nights, without Sundays, without anything. They bury themselves in hard work, running all the equipment to strive to increase production threefold. But that is not something that can be achieved overnight. Where are the concrete methods to make this possible?

First, the unification of regulations and standardization of formats. The necessity of this has been discussed many times. The issue is how to implement it. The consensus on the principle of "unifying military regulations" is welcome, but in the implementation of this unification, from the Ministry of the Army and Navy down to the regulation committee, opinions are divided and there is no consensus. Establishing a Ministry of Military Procurement, which would handle all military production, is theoretically one of the most desirable approaches. But this is merely a formal improvement. From the perspective of future effectiveness, it may not be the best solution. In this sense, establishing a regulation committee that is closely related to the command system seems to be the most realistic solution.

Adjustment of Enterprise System

Second is the issue of adjusting the enterprise system centered on the aircraft industry. The aircraft industry can be said to be a kind of assembled industry. Large aircraft have more than 100,000 parts, and small aircraft require 30,000 to tens of thousands of parts. Aircraft must be equipped with various parts such as firearms, optical instruments, mechanical machinery, and electrical machinery. If the aircraft industry is to enhance production to its peak, it is essential to adjust the system of related enterprises. Otherwise, a large-scale increase in production is impossible. This adjustment of the enterprise system should be decided in the context of the industrial structure. The enterprise group of aviation machine tools has presented an excellent model. That is to say, outstanding finished product factories are designated in various places to take full responsibility, and the former cooperative factories are closely linked to these designated factories to form a group. So even factories that used to manufacture finished products sometimes become parts factories. In this operation, the Ministry of Munitions consults the needs of the military department, unifies the regulations in a centralized way, and the control association orders from each designated company in proportion. The necessary materials are allocated, and the control association acts according to the instructions of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry. Therefore, the products of factories within the system are manufactured under the guidance of the general factory. Supply factories can no longer simply issue their products to factories with lower prices as before. The delivery of finished products is carried out by the Ministry of Munitions according to the ratio of the mobilization plan. This is an enterprise reorganization similar to the German "linked system," with the Ziben thermal network relationship as the basis for the combination of accredited manufacturing plants and the provision of livestock guidance, resulting in decomposition. The industrialization and management of the company should remain within the previous command and affiliation relationship. Starting from the viewpoint of pure production technology, the combination of manufacturing plants based on the new type of product is implemented. This can be said to be the adoption of a production guidance system that transcends capital.

Consistent Sea and Land Transport

Third, to increase aircraft production two or three times, everything from raw materials such as electricity, coal, copper, iron, and machine tools, to transport ships must also be increased two or three times, not to mention labor and capital. In this sense, "establishing a system of absolute self-sufficiency in food between Japan and Manchuria" and "strengthening the consistency of sea and land transport" are of great significance. The consistency of sea and land coordination is naturally something to be strongly emphasized. The establishment of the Ministry of Transportation is what the public has been generally hoping for. I personally hope that there will be a decisive measure to clear obstacles.

Fourth, whether steel, money, coal, and so on, which are the foundations of all industries, can be obtained at the rate specified by the material mobilization plan is a problem. Perhaps this is one of the main reasons why the materials mobilization plan cannot be carried out satisfactorily. Also, the complexity of the various supply systems is very obvious. This should naturally be resolved. In addition, the thorough regulation of various control groups and public corporations should be implemented at this time.

Simplification of Prices

Finally, when it comes to the issue of the complete simplification of prices, the low-price policy must be adhered to to the end. This complete simplification of prices must be considered in conjunction with the strengthening of production. Therefore, changing the previous regulations, calculating costs, only wastes time and hinders production. Regarding machine tools, wartime models should be adopted. At the same time, the control association and government agencies should work together as one to decide and review prices. These are points to be studied. If an enterprise group operates on its own, prices and other control regulations should cease to apply within its internal relations. In short, it depends on the government's strong practical ability, especially the political power of the cabinet, which is the foundation for the operation of national affairs. Deeper expectations are placed. (End of full text) (Source: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 29th)

### Organization of the Seventh District Public Office Under Review by Municipal Government

After the Jin District in the Nanshi area was transferred to the municipal government as the Seventh District, it was decided to restore the District Public Office to supervise and promote local administration. The municipal government has appointed Lu Ying, director of the Second Police Department of the city, to concurrently serve as the head of the District Public Office. The organization of the District Public Office is currently under careful review by the municipal government. Once everything is in order, the District Public Office will begin to organize itself in accordance with regulations.

### Regulations for Applying for Permits for Rice Grain Procurement and Transportation Announced by the Rice Grain Control Committee

Branch offices of the Rice Grain Control Committee will be organized and established in various regions within days and will immediately begin procurement and purchasing work. The procedures for applying for rice grain procurement permits and rice grain transportation passports have recently been established. Rice merchants who are designated as preparatory committee members of local rice grain trade associations must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee or its subordinate offices for "Rice Grain Procurement Permits" when they intend to procure and transport rice grain within the same rice grain marketing management area. Rice merchants who are preparatory committee members of local rice grain trade associations must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee for "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" when they intend to transport rice grain from one area within the rice grain marketing management area to an area outside that region.

Transportation Passports Issued by Region

The "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" applied for by the preparatory committee members of the rice grain trade association are limited to the following cases and are issued by the offices of their respective jurisdictions: (1) The Jintan Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Jintan Liyang area to Zhenjiang; (2) The Yixing Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Su Song Chang Jia area to the Suzhou First, Second, and Third Phase areas; (3) The Xiashi Office issues permits limited to the transportation of rice grain from the Hangzhou area to the Southeast Taihu Second Phase area.

Fill Out Application Forms in the Prescribed Format

Designated planned distribution agencies must apply to the Rice Grain Control Committee for "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" when they receive rice grain from the Rice Grain Coordination Committee and intend to transport it from one area within the rice grain marketing management area to an area outside that region. Holders of "Rice Grain Procurement Permits" and "Rice Grain Transportation Passports" must conduct procurement or transportation in accordance with the specifications of the Procurement Permit and Transportation Passport. Applicants for rice grain procurement permits or transportation passports must fill out the application form in the prescribed format, with one original and one copy.

Permits and Passports Must Be Returned After Use

When transporting rice grain in the Qingxiang area with a Rice Grain Transportation Passport, the procedures stipulated in the Provisional Regulations for the Zhejiang Anhui Rice Grain Marketing Management must be followed before implementation. Procurement permits or transportation passports are limited to one-time use and must be returned to the issuing office of the Rice Grain Control Committee immediately after use. If a rice grain procurement permit or rice grain transportation passport is lost, it must be reported to the original issuing Grain Control Committee or office, and an advertisement must be published at the applicant's expense by the original issuing agency to declare it invalid. When applying for a replacement for the aforementioned permits or passports, a guarantee from a reliable guarantor must be provided, but if it is deemed to be intentional fraud or gross negligence, replacement will not be permitted. Those who procure or transport with expired or invalidated permits or passports will be punished in accordance with the provisions of the Provisional Regulations for Rice Grain Marketing Management in the Three Provinces.

### Subsidies for Teachers and Staff of Private Schools Will Be Issued Soon; First Batch of 800,000 Yuan

In light of the hardships faced by teachers and staff of private schools in this city, the municipal government, at the request of the Municipal Education Association, has agreed to provide a monthly subsidy of 500,000 yuan, which will be distributed by the Education Association to the teachers and staff of various schools. However, the source of this funding is from the municipal government's agreement with the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance to pay from the fees collected by the department assisting the municipal government. It was originally scheduled to begin in August, but according to the results of negotiations between the Municipal Finance Bureau and the Taxation Department, the Taxation Department can only raise 300,000 yuan in September and 500,000 yuan each month from October to December. Therefore, the first batch of subsidies consists of only 300,000 yuan for September and 500,000 yuan for October, totaling 800,000 yuan, which the Municipal Education Association has repeatedly requested from the municipal government. The municipal government has also repeatedly negotiated with the Taxation Department, but in reality, the Taxation Department can only provide this amount and can only be obtained from the Finance Bureau. Regarding how to allocate this amount, the Education Association has long convened representatives from the education associations of various districts to form a custody and allocation committee to discuss various allocation principles and withdrawal procedures, striving to make the procedures as simple and strict as possible. At the same time, after the Education Association receives the first batch of 800,000 yuan in government subsidies, it will begin to distribute them from the 27th of this month in accordance with the methods repeatedly decided by the custody and allocation committee.

### Rice Purchase Slips for Households Can Be Issued Tomorrow

Tomorrow is the last day to sell rice for the 49th term to households. The rice purchase slips for the 50th term can be issued the day after tomorrow because the Rice Preparation Section is closed today due to the holiday. The quantity and price will be officially announced by the First District Public Office in a notice. The 51st term of household flour can also be sold at the same time.

### Vegetables Are Shipped to Shanghai One After Another; Price Limits Are Announced Daily

The market prices of various vegetables have previously been affected by the rising prices of all goods and the deliberate actions of illegal merchants, resulting in repeated price increases that have harmed the people's livelihood. The Central Market and relevant authorities, recognizing this, have actively taken measures to clear supply lines and investigate the truth. Those who engage in speculation will be severely threatened. According to a Shanghai News reporter, I learned from relevant sources yesterday that various green vegetables have recently reached the harvest period, so the quantity of vegetables shipped to Shanghai has obviously increased compared to before. The market is now full of spot goods, and market prices are falling. As a result, the general situation in the vegetable market is slightly better than it was a month ago. However, I understand that the Zhonggong Market is determined to stick to its original intention and, in addition to actively procuring various vegetables and shipping them to Shanghai one after another, will continue to assess and set standard price limits, which will be announced daily. All member brokers must strictly abide by these limits and must not deliberately exceed them. Otherwise, they will be punished in accordance with the regulations. As for various fresh meats such as pork, beef, mutton, fish, eggs, and other meat dishes, the authorities have already set price limits and listed them for public implementation. In order to ensure effective enforcement, the authorities have repeatedly sent personnel to various vegetable markets or sales firms to investigate.

### Coal and Charcoal Transportation Urgently Needs Improvement

According to news from the coal and charcoal industry yesterday, in order to balance the market situation and meet needs, the industry is actively clearing major supply lines and urging all members to procure in various production areas. However, due to the urgent need for improvement in transportation, the quantity shipped to Shanghai has been slightly affected. However, according to industry insiders, the amount of coal and charcoal stored in Shanghai is still substantial, sufficient for several months of demand. However, market prices have been pushed to their highest peak, which has greatly harmed the people's livelihood.

### Gauze Pricing and Allocation Measures Under Review by Authorities; Business Control Committee Answers Various Questions

Central News Agency: The Business Control Committee's office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth has been in operation for some time since the implementation of the regulations on the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth. Various parties are quite concerned about issues such as pricing and allocation after the purchase of gauze and cloth. A reporter from the Central News Agency specifically inquired with the Business Control Committee about this matter. The person in charge of the committee provided detailed answers. The following is an account of the conversation: (Question) From when should deposit slips be issued after the gauze and cloth have been inspected and purchased, and has the payment date been determined? (Answer) Regarding the initial payment date for this special fixed deposit slip, this association has already submitted a request to the Executive Yuan for approval. (Question) Various gauze and cloth merchants hope to shorten the payment period and pay the second installment of the bid price in advance, and request relief on various points. Is it possible to handle this? (Answer) This matter has been clearly stipulated by the authorities, and this association is handling it in accordance with orders. As for the request to mortgage or discount the deposit slips with the Central Reserve Bank, it is currently being reviewed by the Executive Yuan. (Question) What are the security responsibilities and surrogate custody measures after the purchase of gauze and cloth? (Answer) Before the completion of the acceptance procedures by this association, the security responsibility should be borne by the applicant for the sale. However, this association has now begun acceptance, and it should be completed soon. As for the surrogate custody measures, the office for purchasing gauze and cloth of this association has already been instructed to formulate them as soon as possible. (Question) What about the production allocation and transfer measures for the processing and manufacturing industries? (Answer) The allocation measures are being reviewed by the government and are expected to be announced soon. The transfer measures will also be adjusted accordingly upon implementation of the allocation. (Question) It is rumored that the purchase price of processed cotton cloth has already been reviewed and approved. When will it be announced? (Answer) The purchase prices of various cotton yarn and cloth were first proposed by the "Cotton Yarn," "Cotton Cloth," and "Processed Cotton Cloth" three-tier categories of the China-Japan Joint Price Investigation Committee and passed by the committee's second meeting. They have now been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and announcement.

### Self-Defense Service Age Still to Be Determined; Unified Measures to Be Announced Soon

The talk about the unification of the service age of self-defense corps members in the first and eighth districts of this city has attracted considerable attention from all circles. A reporter from the Central News Agency met yesterday with Qian Guoqiu, the secretary of the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, and asked about the truth of this matter. According to him, Gu Jiwu, the chief of the Baojia Section of the First Police Bureau, has been actively supervising his subordinates to promote work since taking office a few days ago, sparing no effort. Regarding the service age of the self-defense corps, he is also considering unified measures so that the advancement of Baojia administration can be consistent and without regret. The rumored news is slightly different from the planned unified measures, and the section is expected to make a formal decision and announcement within days.

### Minister of Construction Receives Key Personnel of Sino-Japanese Companies

Chen Chunpu, the Minister of Construction, in order to receive the directors, supervisors, and senior staff of various Sino-Japanese joint venture companies, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing a few days ago, accompanied by the Vice Minister of the Ministry. Yesterday (the 23rd) at 4:00 PM, a tea party was held at the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel to receive key personnel from the following companies.

### Resale of Aquatic Products in the Eighth District Still Subject to Two Percent Tax

The Municipal Aquatic Products Trade Association previously submitted a case to the Eighth District Office requesting exemption from the two percent tax on the grounds that the sale of various aquatic products to water merchants and fishmongers was not a resale in nature. The Eighth District Office rejected the case, believing that, as the buyers were all water merchants and mobile fishmongers, it was already admitted that the buyers were not formal members of the same trade, and therefore the two percent tax should be paid in accordance with regulations.

### Coal Ball Raw Material Supply to Be Fully Maintained; Coal Ball Factories Urged to Increase Production

The recent sudden shortage of coal ball supply in this city has caused considerable anxiety among normal consumers. Upon investigation, the reason lies in the fact that there are some people in the coal industry who are taking the opportunity to seek exorbitant profits. The authorities have long been paying attention to this point. Although applications have been made, the determination to maintain the price limit of 32.5 yuan per dan remains unchanged. Recently, measures such as limiting the quantity of retail sales at coal ball shops have been taken, and at the same time, personnel have been dispatched undercover as buyers to investigate whether coal ball retailers are violating the price limit. Therefore, the black market trend has been suppressed. Currently, the relevant authorities intend to maintain the continuous supply of coal ball raw materials so that the coal ball factories can operate continuously and increase production, so that the overall situation of this essential fuel can be stabilized.

### Soap and Match Retailers Must Absolutely Abide by Agreements; Severe Penalties for Violations

The First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality is very strict in its management of the 397 retail stores allocated soap and matches and requires them to sign an agreement. Each retail store must absolutely strictly abide by the agreement. The main points are extracted as follows:

Main Points of the Agreement

Retailers are only allowed to accept purchase certificates for allocation of matches or soap that bear the same registration number as the store. During the first period of selling matches or soap, retailers should only sell upon presentation of purchase certificates for matches or soap bearing the words "First Period." The same applies to subsequent periods. Any purchase certificate for matches or soap may only be used during the period indicated by the number on the certificate. For example, the "First Period" is only valid during the first period and is invalid after the expiration date. In addition, there are the following: At any time, matches and soap must be delivered and picked up according to the stipulated price. At any time, strictly comply with the regulations and sell all allocated matches or soap to users who hold match certificates or soap certificates with the corresponding registration number. Each store must absolutely strictly abide by and comply with the above items. Violations will be severely punished.

### Rumors of Selling Unlicensed Milk Untrue

Regarding the supply of fresh milk, the responsible party of the First District Office recently informed the reporter that "the recent report that a milk company licensed by this office sold a large amount of unlicensed milk is not true. The milk supply in the first district has always been closely supervised by the Health Section of this office. Not only are personnel dispatched to inspect the milk companies periodically, but also close attention is paid to everything every morning and evening to prevent the private transport of unlicensed milk. On the one hand, milk samples are taken from various milk companies for chemical testing. In order to put unlicensed milk to normal use and to consider the milk sheds in Pudong and neighboring areas that cannot meet the standards of Grade A or Grade B, this office has formulated measures for licensing Grade C milk sheds. One provision in these licensing regulations stipulates that this type of milk can only be used for feeding pigs or for industrial purposes. Although there have been cases of unlicensed milk being privately transported into this district in the past, the private transport has rarely been discovered since this milk can be sold to milk powder manufacturers. Based on the above, milk consumers need not worry about the milk delivered by licensed companies."

### Scholarship Fund Collection Report

The following Shen Bao reader scholarship funds were received yesterday: Xiangyuan Store, Ye Yunqi, 1,000 yuan (to commemorate the 80th birthday celebration of Mr. Zhu Wang Qinsheng, Housheng, and Duansheng by donating the congratulatory gifts); Ji Jinhai, 31 yuan.

### Jiming Cup Basketball Exhibition Opens; Western Youth Defeats Renyu; Second Act at 7 PM Tonight

The Jiming Cup basketball tournament, which was organized to raise funds for the Jiming Hospital, opened at 7:00 PM last night at the Baxianqiao China Youth Gymnasium. Huang Yanfang personally attended the opening ceremony and threw the ball. In the first match, Chen You faced Huaying. With the help of Tao Shaosheng and Zhang Jinxuan, Chen You's strength was strengthened. Huaying's combat power was weakened due to Li Zhenzhong's absence. At the end of the first half, Chen You took the lead with a score of 22 to 13. After changing sides, Huaying counterattacked, and Chen You also continued to work hard. In conclusion, Chen You overcame Huaying with a score of 29 to 32. The main battle was Renyu against Western Youth. As the fierce battle began, Western Youth scored five points in one go. A few minutes later, Ma Canxi shouted and established Renyu's first achievement. The first half ended with Western Youth taking the lead with a score of six to two. After the break, Western Youth's Ye Yun, Kaiji Milov, and Funik each made contributions. Renyu tried hard to catch up, but Wang Zhiqing scored a lot of points, but it was difficult to turn the tide. In conclusion, Western Youth won with a score of 49 to 15. Zhu Dashanshi, a philanthropist, bought the charity ball for 40,000 yuan, which is admirable. Starting at 7:00 PM today, the original venue will continue to be held, and Renyu will fight Western Youth again. Before the match, there was a women's recording team against Sansheng.

Economic Circles Commentary

### Dedicated to the Rice Control Committee

Regarding the Rice and Grain Control Committee, we would like to add a few supplementary opinions: We believe that handling grain administration is an arduous task. Because it is arduous, those who manage it must not regard it as a place to make money, let alone as an organization for personal favors. Only by having obligations and no rights, only by enduring hardships and having no benefits, can one be loyal and not disgrace one's mission.

The Rice Control Committee must adhere to the following two principles in terms of personnel and administration: (1) The chief commissioners of local offices and various industry associations should be selected from leaders in the food industry who have a high reputation and credibility. Private individuals must never be placed in these positions, especially those who are not in the industry, so that they can take on important work in various places, which would lose the original purpose of establishing the Rice Control Committee. It is hoped that the election of chief commissioners of local rice and grain associations will be conducted by leaders in the industry who are highly reputable and trustworthy, and that no one or two people outside the industry will be allowed to intervene, so as not to disrupt grain administration and repeat past mistakes. (2) Regarding the purchase of rice and grain, the responsible officials of the authorities and friendly countries unanimously advocated fairness and impartiality, and not suppressing farmers with low prices. It is also hoped that the transportation authorities and military and police authorities will do their best to assist in every way, so as to provide grain merchants with the convenience they deserve. If subordinates are found to be making things difficult or extorting, they should be severely punished without leniency, in order to rectify the discipline of grain administration.

In short, we should know that the purpose of reorganizing the Rice Control Committee this time is to correct past malpractices and to renew all past tax policies from now on. Therefore, the mission and task are more important than all other institutions. In the event of private gain, immoral, or non-compliant behavior, it will not only be criticized by the whole country, but also ridiculed by neighboring countries. How can the crime be forgiven? Because our hopes are deep, we cannot help but be concerned. We sincerely hope that those who serve the Rice Control Committee, regardless of the size of their position, will deeply examine and restrain themselves, and not be negligent in the slightest, so as to assist the country in the success of grain administration!

### Flour and Wheat Professional Committee Adjusts Affiliated Organizations; Jiangyin Branch Temporarily Closed

Since the establishment of the local branch offices of the Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association, they have been promoting their work and carrying out the task of purchasing wheat very seriously. Therefore, all facilities and businesses have gradually stabilized. In order to strengthen the control system and adjust the actual implementation of the work, the association has decided that the area under the jurisdiction of the Jiangyin Branch does not produce much wheat, and the peak season has passed. It seems that there is no need to establish it temporarily. It has issued a letter to the Wuxi Office instructing it to close within a time limit. In the future, it will be re-established when necessary. The association is continuing to investigate other local offices to determine whether they are necessary for establishment in order to adjust and strengthen the organization.

### The Shanghai Fuya School for Cultivating Talented Deaf-Mutes

At No. 33 Huangjiasha Garden Road, east of Avenue Road and Carter Road, stands a three-story western-style building. To the south is a schoolyard enclosed by a bamboo fence. Although the transportation is very convenient, it is far from the noise of the city, truly a quiet place in the midst of the hustle and bustle! This is the famous Shanghai Fuya School, an institution for cultivating talented deaf-mutes.

Miserable Management

Outside the bamboo fence, sounds of "Ah, ah" learning to speak can be heard. Upon entering the gate, scenes of educating deaf-mute children are presented before one's eyes. Principal Wang Jingyuan, a scholar who has been enthusiastically involved in education for the blind and deaf for over thirty years and who is himself partially deaf, described the situation of deaf-mute education in China with emotion:

The first school in China to educate deaf-mute children was the Qiyin School, founded in Yantai, Shandong, twenty-seven years before the founding of the Republic of China. It is still in operation today. In the fifth year of the Republic of China, the Nantong School for the Blind and Deaf appeared. In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Beijing School for the Deaf and Mute appeared, and so on. However, most of them have ceased operations today. In Shanghai, as early as twenty years before the founding of the Republic of China, the Sacred Heart Convent of Xujiahui founded the Dumb School, which is still struggling to survive. Then, in the ninth year of the Republic of China, the second deaf-mute education institution appeared—the Shanghai Qunxuehui School for the Deaf and Mute. However, it has now ceased operations. The largest in scale seems to be the Shanghai Tsunlan Ya Deaf and Mute School, founded in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China by the famous American scholar Dr. Jean Lanier, which is today's Shanghai Fuya School.

Dr. Jean Lanier was a predecessor enthusiastic about social education in China. After he funded the founding of a school for blind children, he returned to the United States due to old age, but he still cared about charitable work in China. He believed that after the development of education for blind children, the education of deaf-mutes should not be delayed. Therefore, in the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, he sent a letter to Mr. Jean Foublan, principal of the Shanghai School for Blind Children, instructing him to prepare for the establishment of a school for the deaf and mute. At that time, Mr. Fu and Wang Jingyuan, a teacher at the School for Blind Children, prepared to establish the "Jean Lanier School for the Deaf and Mute" with an opening fee of three thousand yuan at Kangjiaqiao on Jessfield Road. At that time, the Hangzhou Hui'ai School for the Deaf and Mute was unable to maintain operations, and more than ten students merged into the school. The first group of students numbered more than twenty, and the second group increased to sixty-odd. The original school building was not enough, so another western-style house was rented, and the enterprise tended to expand. In the seventeenth year of the Republic of China, Dr. Jean, concerned about the school and seeking permanence, sent a special letter from the United States instructing the purchase of more than twenty acres of land in Jiangwan as a permanent fund for the school for the deaf and mute. However, at that time, the Northern Expedition was taking place, and Shanghai was once in a chaotic situation, so this matter was not carried out. In the winter of that year, Dr. Jean Lanier passed away, and no will was made regarding the school for the deaf and mute, so the school had no source of funding. It had no choice but to implement austerity measures. In the spring of the eighteenth year, it was renamed Shanghai Fuya School, and a new board of directors was formed. In fact, the School for Blind Children still provided a moderate subsidy each year, about two or three thousand yuan. In the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, all the students were selected into the School for Blind Children, which continued for three years.

In the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China, due to the development of school affairs, it was inconvenient to combine education with the School for Blind Children in all aspects. Therefore, Principal Jean Foublan and enthusiastic people from all walks of life, such as Wang Yiting, Chen Heqin, Shi Boqun, and the Shanghai Zhushi, initiated a fundraising campaign of 55,000 yuan. In the same year, the July 7th Incident occurred, and not only did the fundraising campaign completely stop, but also because the school site happened to be in the war zone, school affairs were temporarily suspended. It was not until the spring of the twenty-seventh year that Shanghai society gradually recovered, and parents of deaf-mute students requested to resume classes. Therefore, Wang Jingyuan, the then vice-principal, ran around planning and appointed a board of directors. First, he borrowed a part of the school building of Guohua Middle School on Rue Godefroy (hosted by Hu Shuyi) to start classes. In the spring of the twenty-eighth year, it moved to the former Central Research Institute on Route Tenant de la Tour, just opposite Zhaoyi Feng Park. The environment was quiet, and the school building was particularly grand. It was truly a place most suitable for education. At that time, the number of students also increased to more than eighty, and school affairs presented a vigorous atmosphere again. After December 8th of the thirtieth year, the school site was taken over by the municipal government. On Children's Day of the thirty-first year, it moved to the original site of the Foundling Home of the Tzu Yu Association and officially resumed classes.

Able to Hear and Speak

Mr. Wang Jingyuan, principal of the Fuya School, enthusiastically talked about deaf-mute education.

The highest goal of deaf-mute education is to enable the deaf to hear and the mute to speak, so that unfortunate deaf-mutes can study and work like healthy people. The Shanghai Fuya School also clearly states its purpose as: "To cultivate healthy bodies for deaf-mutes, to cultivate good morals for deaf-mutes, to create outstanding talents for deaf-mutes, and to develop the skills of deaf-mutes to deal with the world." In teaching, the school adopts the American-style individual education method, with no more than ten students in each class, so that both teachers and students can concentrate. Because the self-study ability of general deaf-mute students is relatively weak, there are eight classes a day, each lasting forty-five minutes, and various methods are used to inspire their interest and perseverance in learning.

The most basic teaching method in deaf-mute education is "phonetics," which enables deaf-mute children to pronounce sounds without relying on gestures or other symbolic notations. The most popular phonetic alphabet for educating mute children internationally is Bell's alphabet, which is based on the structure of each person's vocal organs. Various languages, such as English and French, also have their own basic phonetic alphabets. China has adopted the meaning of Bell's alphabet to create the basic alphabet of Mandarin, which is the same in number as the Mandarin phonetic symbols. The most common phonetic teaching method is for teachers and students to sit side by side facing a large mirror, so that each can see the subtle state and movement of the vocal organs when making a certain sound, in order to correct it. The best way to restore pronunciation is to start from infancy. Then, after four or five years of hard work, it is not surprising that a mute can speak.

It is more difficult for adult or older deaf-mute students to restore their ability to pronounce and speak, mainly because most of them lack patience and find it less convenient to use gestures. Therefore, they are taught "gesture language." There are different types of gestures, such as Mandarin gestures and English gestures, which are generally synthesized by combining phonetic, pictographic, and associative methods. In addition, for high school students, "written communication" can also be taught.

The problem of speech for deaf-mutes can be solved gradually through education and training in phonetics, gesture language, and written communication. As for the problem of restoring hearing for the deaf, in addition to those who are partially deaf who can use hearing aids to supplement natural hearing, there is currently no special method for so-called "heavenly hearing." What deaf-mute schools in various countries teach, in addition to relying on gestures and written communication to understand the opinions of others, is mainly what is called "speechreading," which is to enable deaf students to use their eyes instead of their ears to observe the movement of the speaker's vocal organs and their expressions to perceive the content of their language. Therefore, the teaching of speechreading also requires extraordinary hard work and extreme patience. After a long period of training, one can understand the conversation content of the other party or a second person just like a normal person.

The Fuya School educates deaf-mute students to the best of its ability, using the latest scientific methods in the world and adapting them to the specific circumstances of the students, in order to achieve practical results. The efforts of the past seventeen years have established a foundation for deaf-mute education in China and are among the best in the country.

### Newly Established Four Controlled Associations to Open in Mid-Month

Important materials, such as machinery, copper and iron, non-ferrous metals, and wood, have successively established controlled associations. The four newly established controlled associations (including paper, cement, chemical products, and rubber) that are being prepared have also been completed and will be officially put into operation within the month. According to reporters, the chemical products controlled association includes not only raw materials, pigments, industrial products, and dyes, but also various fragrances and printing inks.

### Market Trends of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, the fluctuations of Chinese stocks were small, and the momentum was weak, which was due to the sale of shares by floating investors on Saturday. Large amounts of chips are still held by major investors, so it is difficult to squeeze out smaller investors. Yong'an Textile even had some buying in the afternoon, which brought the decline to the same level. Real estate stocks were the most stable. Transactions were sparse on the day. The situation of stocks in various industries is recorded below.

Textiles: Yong'an Textile once briefly entered the pass, but quickly returned. The final transaction was the same as the previous day's price. Dasheng No. 1 Factory was flat, and No. 3 Factory and Rongfeng Textile both rose. China Textile, Xinyi, and Meiya Silk Factory had small and slight gains. Meilun, Dagong, and Lunhua each saw a slight decline. Ruitai could not recover. Jingfu Shirt and Socks saw a new high price after the increase in capital again. Jinglun also increased by half a percent.

Department Stores: Xinxin Company rose slightly. Yong'an and Zhabei Department Store both declined. A certain large investor purchased a large amount of underwear, and the price was stable. Mo'an and Guanghua Department Store opened slightly higher than the previous day.

New Industries: Danya Concentrated Factory returned to fluctuate near Xiaosi. China-France Pharmacy was slightly weak. Deyi and Jiuxin Pharmaceutical both saw a slight decline. Wuzhou, Zhongxi, and Xinxing Pharmaceutical were all flat.

Finance: Zhexing and Jincheng both rose. Mainland and Yanye each rose by half a share, but it was still difficult to absorb. Shanghai, Zhongyi, and Tongyi Trust were flat.

Industry: Dahua Fire Company was weak and lacked momentum. Transactions of Nanyang and Huacheng Tobacco were also sparse. Jiuan Industrial's old shares and ex-rights shares each rose slightly. Dahua Industrial opened with a premium of 10% over par value. Xinya Construction was stable. Datong Industry rose slightly. Xinghua Industry was flat. Within the par value, there was little supply. China and Guohua Investment were both boosted by major investors. Kangyuan Canning reached a new high price again before returning to flat. Sanyou Industry declined slightly. Fumin Dairy and Standard Monosodium Glutamate were priced the same as the previous day. Bao'an Glass and Huasheng Ceramics were flat. China Film declined slightly.

Culture: Only Shijie Struggle Journey saw an opening, and the price was slightly lower. The price reduction of Commercial Press and China Police Bureau was flat. Yongxiang Printing and Standard Paper Products also had little change.

Real Estate: Yongxing Real Estate rose by half a percent, approaching twice the par value. Xin Yi and Linhua also rose slightly.

### Summary of Commercial News

Public Bonds: Yesterday's market price continued to rise strongly, especially for the so-called miscellaneous brands such as A, B, D, and E, which rose even more strongly. Market sentiment gradually became excited. There were many who sold Category C and bought miscellaneous brands because the price difference between miscellaneous brands and Category C for the same goods was too large, which caused some exchange, resulting in a smaller increase in Category C. Category C opened flat, then rose sharply. It once saw a small decline in the middle, then rose slowly with the price of miscellaneous brands. The final price at noon was better than the previous day. The rise of Categories A, B, D, and E was stronger than that of Category C.

Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Industry Association eased. The listed price was reduced by another two points, to 14%.

Woolen Fabrics: The market continued to be strong yesterday, and the market price trend was firm. Qipao woolen fabrics were the most popular. General western-style tailor shops and woolen fabric and silk shops that sold them had excellent business. Because 70-80% of these qipao woolen fabrics are made of Chinese wool, and there is more cotton than wool and more wool than light fabrics. Sixty-inch wide doors are all priced at over 13%, and the price is also cheap, which is very popular among women. Retail sales are good, and wholesale transactions are also lively.

### Grain Department徵集Superior Rice and Wheat Seeds to Promote Agricultural Production

After the war, agricultural production declined, and unscrupulous merchants hoarded and manipulated prices, causing agricultural product prices to rise, which had a huge impact on the entire social life. At this time of war, it is urgent to actively promote increased food production in the rear. Therefore, the Food Department requires the rice and wheat experimental farms in the province to fill out investigation forms in detail regarding the superior rice and wheat seeds collected this year, so that farmers can adopt them to increase agricultural production and stabilize people's livelihoods.

### Life of a Secretary

— Xiepu Ke

At present, there is no way out for friends of the pen. No matter how knowledgeable you are and how capable you are of writing powerfully, others will always see you as "a useless scholar." Wearing a long gown is a waste of life! To be honest, it is far inferior to a rickshaw puller or a boy in a restaurant, who can be wealthier. Unless you become the chief secretary of a prominent official, with a high position and generous salary, can you be haughty! In my spare time, I also serve as a Chinese secretary for someone. Speaking of the life of a secretary? You must have the talent to write quickly and accurately. Otherwise, before one document is finished, another one comes, putting pressure on your desk, making you feel like "nothing is as it should be"! Moreover, you must understand your master's intentions and be able to guess the words and phrases he wants to say and the meaning he wants to express, catering to his psychology. You must also be good at writing to win the master's praise and reuse. Over time, you can be trusted to open letters, act on his behalf, and actually handle matters. Otherwise, no matter how wonderful your writing is, you will be ordered to rewrite it again and again. The mental burden is unbearable. Sometimes, when the master gets angry, the secretary has to endure it for the sake of making a living. In the eyes of others, the private secretary of a wealthy man or general manager must be in a good position and receive special favors. In fact, who knows the inner suffering of being a secretary? As for the treatment, providing you with a meal and giving you a monthly salary of 300 or 400 yuan is already a great favor. Regardless of your family burden, or what you are raising, taking the meager monthly salary, no matter how clever your economic calculations are, in this situation of rising living standards, it really feels like a non-sense!

### Sunday Commentary Edition (Continued from page 1)

The Greater East Asia War has entered a stage of confrontation. If this stage continues for a considerable period of time, what will break this equilibrium? I firmly believe that if Japan can use the liberation demands of all Asian nations as the driving force for carrying out the Greater East Asia War, then Japan can quickly decide the war. The independence movement of Asian nations originates from the inevitability of world history and has irresistible power. The Japanese who recognize the Meiji Restoration as a Japanese national independence movement originating from the inevitability of world history must also recognize that the nations of Asia, which are slightly less culturally advanced than Japan, are imitating the Japanese precedent and launching national liberation movements. This is an unavoidable event. Just as after the French Revolution, no one could stop the nationalist movement throughout Europe, naturally, no one can hinder or strangle the Asian national movement. History has already proven this in Japan and China, and is now proving it in India, the Philippines, Burma, and other countries. If Japan can grasp this historical inevitability and use it as a driving force for the Greater East Asia War, then all Asian nations will become Japan's comrades-in-arms. No matter how much Britain and the United States flaunt their huge productivity, they cannot cope with the solidarity of half of the world's population. When the strength of all the liberated Asian nations becomes the pillar of Japan, that will be the time to determine the outcome of the Greater East Asia War.

As I have repeatedly stated in my paper, the so-called entire Asian nations, the important ones are only Japan, China, and India. However, the attitude of the Indian nation towards Japan depends on Japan's attitude towards the Chinese nation. The reason why Indian leaders such as Gandhi and Nehru have not yet publicly stated their support for Japan is that the Sino-Japanese Incident has not yet been resolved. On the whole, the attitude of the Chinese towards Japan is not yet clear. If the Sino-Japanese Incident is resolved satisfactorily, and if the Chinese nation fully supports Japan, then the Indian nation will also fully support Japan without hesitation. From this point of view, the future of the Greater East Asia War ultimately depends on how Sino-Japanese relations are adjusted.

Therefore, the issue of comprehensive Sino-Japanese peace has once again produced new historical significance. This comprehensive peace cannot be achieved by external pressure. Peace achieved by external pressure only suppresses the superficial resistance to the inside. This kind of peace, which appears to be in harmony but is not, accumulates and increases the force of resistance internally. If external pressure weakens, it will immediately erupt from the inside into a huge fire of resistance. The Sino-Japanese peace that determines the power of the Greater East Asia War cannot be such a comprehensive peace. However, for the point of achieving peace through frank and open talks between the two sides without relying on external pressure, Japan, which has greater external pressure than Chongqing, naturally holds more initiative. Comprehensive Chinese peace determines the trend of Asian nations, the trend of Asian nations determines the Greater East Asia War, and the result of the Greater East Asia War determines the future of the world war. If this is really the case, then the decision-making power of the world war is still in the hands of China and Japan. To put it more concretely, it depends on how Japan takes the initiative in comprehensive peace and how China responds to it. This is by no means an exaggeration.

If Chinese pessimists seek pessimistic arguments in the possibility of adjusting Sino-Japanese relations, that is another matter and not within the scope of this article. As for the attitude of discovering pessimistic arguments in the European situation, it must be pointed out once again that this is because I unknowingly accepted the influence of the traditional "War of Resistance concept" in Chinese intellectual circles.

### Price Controls and Rationing of Western Medicine

— Zhu Wenjie

Price controls, rationing, and standardization of Western medicine is difficult because it is a complex category and cannot be uniformly managed. Because the items are small in size and high in value, they are easy to hoard, especially since all raw materials are imported from abroad. Since the outbreak of war, the supply has been cut off. While raw materials and medicines still exist, the merchants are in control of them. Those merchants with a large supply of items are frequently able to control prices and artificially raise them. Also, holders of goods only need to store goods for one more day to make profit. So, they hoard goods and do not sell. Purchasers do not hesitate to purchase at high prices, so prices climb. I will recount my views and what I have witnessed as a contribution and reference for the authorities.

Price Limits and the Black Market

Since the last strict order of the authorities to limit the prices of some medicines, the situation was only partially managed and the items were just hidden and diverted to the black market. Those who held goods acted this way because the limited prices were below the cost of production or because black market prices were higher and would make more profit. Those who legally needed the goods were unable to buy them. So, many people were unable to purchase goods and a strange phenomenon of "high prices, no goods" occurred. The formation of a black market is related to many factors:

Some Improper Western Pharmacies—The operation of these pharmacies seems like a black market for medicines. These businesses do not act like a retail business and do not do any wholesale trading. They specialize in buying and selling black market items and giving rebates to people. The pharmacies sell off goods they are unable to raise the prices for, or the pharmacies and doctors resell their allotment of goods they received from foreign trading companies or from Chinese medicine factories, to merchants in other cities or sell the goods on the black market to needy patients. During the height of Western medicine inflation, the proliferation of these types of pharmacies were like bamboo shoots growing after the rain, because the equipment required was simple—a telephone, a room, a knowledgeable middleman, and an advertisement for the desired goods in the trade listings or for goods being sold. Trading one day, one makes hundreds of thousands of dollars and does not take this as a big deal. This type of light investment, heavy profit-making business must be strictly investigated during crackdown on black marketeers.

Pharmacies—When going to pharmacies to purchase goods with limited prices, you will usually not be able to buy anything. It is impossible for the medicine to be immediately sold out when the price limit is enacted, because medicines are not daily supplies, such as soaps, coal or rice, and are only needed when one is sick. So, the items are regularly funneled to the black market or hoarded. If the authorities organize an investigative team, they must strictly examine the detailed purchase and sales records of the pharmacies. If an investigation finds wrongdoing, they must be strictly punished to serve as an example to others. Additionally, the authorities must encourage citizens to report any wrongdoing and if the claim is substantiated, reward the reporter.

Doctors—Some doctors also seek small profits. The allotments they receive each month from the trading companies or pharmaceutical factories are also sold on the black market for profit. The original intention of the allotment by the trading company is lost. Why would the trading company not sell on the black market itself? Those who give allotments should be trading companies who want to extend benefits directly to patients by way of a doctor. Some may introduce patients to a place where they can purchase medicine (a place they specify), but are secretly consigning their medicine to that place and are paying a commission to the consignee. For the sake of morality, reputation, and credibility, doctors should not profit in this way.

Pharmaceutical Factories—The prices of pharmaceutical factory products must be approved by the authorities before the goods can be sold. When the black market prices of raw materials are above the cost of the products, the pharmaceutical factories will frequently stop manufacturing or distributing products, and products circulating in the market will flow into the black market. Pharmaceutical factories are the source of medicines—we must distribute raw materials to them and thoroughly investigate the remaining raw materials and products of the factory so that it can continue to manufacture and distribute.

Standardization

Standardization of all medicines includes registration, purchasing and distributing. We know that the amount of goods consumed by the right consumer is unrelated to the price of goods. The purchase and distribution are described below.

Buy Raw Materials—All materials, such as Vaseline, baking soda, must be re-registered, no matter if they have been previously registered and sealed. Those who resist must have their goods confiscated and punished with multiple times the fine amount. The authorities must set up a purchasing organization and pool resources from major pharmacies. Goods must be purchased from everyone (those with names), because in the previous registration, many parties had commissioned pharmacies to register using false names. Many of the goods hoarded and not sold by large pharmacies must be bought. The raw materials of Western medicine dealers must also be purchased.

Check Finished Medicines—Finished medicines must also be registered in order to avoid having too many or too few items at the time of cutting off supplies. The volume of business of each pharmacy must be used to determine the amount of goods to be held and calculated against the average amount held by all pharmacies. The excess can then be deducted from later rations or directly purchased. Deficiencies can be supplemented.

Distribution—Distribute raw materials to factories after thoroughly checking the factory's products and the amount of raw materials consumed each month. The two are then compared. Especially needed medicines must be distributed with raw materials and a mandate to manufacture, and it must be strictly prohibited to hide or resell allotted raw materials or products. Then the products from each pharmaceutical factory are thoroughly calculated and rationed in a fair way with reference to the actual monthly sales. The retail price of each pharmacy is strictly limited with an appropriate profit margin.

The above are all ways to make laws within an absence of laws. It is best that medicine sources are clear, and if not, the next best thing is to plan details and put rationing into effect with speed and strictness. The results will be fruitful. Without thorough implementation, more problems than benefits will result. For example, limiting prices may lead to a phenomenon of high prices and no goods. Lastly, I would like to make a special appeal to doctors to make the most of circulating medicines and use substitutes for short-term goods.

### National Medicine Industry's Thrift Movement

— Chen Bomin

In this extraordinary period, the conservation of materials should be advocated, and this is something that everyone agrees with. Therefore, enlightened people are promoting thrift movements. As a doctor, I associate this with the national medicine aspect, where there is a great need for promoting thrift. My humble opinions are as follows:

National medicine merchants desire medicinal materials of excellent color and quality, hoping to sell them at a good price. Therefore, they often use sulfur to fumigate and bake the medicinal products. In this way, yellow can become white, and black can become white, thus doubling the selling price. As for merchants who only pursue profit, they naturally do not care about this. However, the nature of medicinal materials is changed due to sulfur fumigation, which is morally unacceptable. Moreover, sulfur is also a military supply, and its price is extremely high. The cost ultimately falls on the consumer. I believe that medicinal materials should only be required to originate from authentic regions, focusing on suitable quality. Why take this unnecessary step?

National medicine shops often seek the beauty of decoction pieces, often applying a layer of wax to the surface of the medicinal product, such as Cyperi rhizoma slices, and Sennae Folium, etc. This is an unnecessary procedure, which does not help anything, only increasing the burden on the patient.

Furthermore, another point that should be reformed is that the medicinal slices are cut extremely thin, like membranes. This wastes too much effort, and the selling price is often calculated accordingly. Examples include Pinellia Rhizoma Praeparatum, raw White Peony Root, Arisaema cum Bile, Aconitum carmichaeli Debx, and Aconitum kusnezoffii Reichb., etc. National medicine shops have a saying: "Aconite slices fly to the sky, betel nuts must be cut into one hundred and twenty-eight slices." In this atmosphere of advocating thrift, the decoction pieces should focus on authentic compatibility, why seek formal prettiness? There is a great need to change the current slicing method to a thicker, more original slice. Recently, there have been frequent reports that the public is suffering from the burden of medical expenses. As a member of the medical profession, medicine and pharmacy are inherently linked. In order to support the extraordinary period's thrift movement and consider the burden on patients, I humbly offer my views to my colleagues in the industry. I simply feel like speaking out to relieve what's on my mind, whether you agree or disagree, let it be.

### Antang Hospital Relieves Impoverished Patients. Hope all Circles Hasten to Aid with Funds.

Antang Hospital, affiliated with the Renai General Hospital at 149 Luban Road, Wangzhi Road intersection, was founded by French Catholic nuns and has been in operation for 56 years. It specializes in treating impoverished patients. For minor illnesses, it provides diagnosis and medication; for severe cases, it provides hospitalization and treatment, with all expenses completely waived. In recent years, it has been treating more than 200 inpatients and 700-800 outpatients every month. All regular expenses were previously covered by donations from abroad, with no fixed funding. Since the outbreak of the war, transportation has been blocked, and the source of funding has been interrupted. The hospital's patients have been reduced from three meals a day to three servings of thin porridge a day. Rice is like pearls, firewood like cassia, and income is nowhere to be found. Relying on past savings, it has barely managed to survive to this day, but is now running out of medicine and food. The hospitalized elderly, weak, poor, and sick are facing imminent death.

Following the principle of mutual assistance and extending care to others, I dare to make an urgent appeal to all sectors, sincerely hoping that all philanthropists will generously donate to help the general impoverished and sick to avoid starvation and death. This kindness will be akin to rebirth, and the merit will be immeasurable. Please send donations to the Renai General Association at 149 Luban Road, Wangzhi Road, or call 81570 to notify the hospital, and they will immediately send a nun to receive it. If there are old clothes, torn quilts, etc., that are discarded and not used, the hospital also welcomes donations.

The hospital has always adhered to a pragmatic approach, working diligently and earnestly, focusing solely on practical results, and not using the beautiful name of charity as a banner. Quietly in a corner, it serves the impoverished and sick, and therefore is very isolated from the outside world. Now, to allow the outside world to recognize the hospital and gain a clearer understanding, we welcome all sectors to visit and inspect. The hospital's board will naturally provide sincere hospitality. (Xia Yufen)

Also, the hospital is organizing a Sino-Western soccer charity match to raise funds for medicine, inviting the East China and West Union teams to compete. It was originally scheduled to be held at the Aurora University stadium at 5:00 PM this (24th) afternoon. However, due to the fact that all preparations have not yet been completed, it has been decided to postpone the event. Once a definite date has been determined, it will be announced again.

### Wooden Spinning Machine on Public Display

The Shanghai Improved Wooden Spinning Machine Training Institute has temporarily closed due to the expiration of the rental period of its location, but the improvement work is still in progress. Jiang Jun, a graduate of the first term, has also designed, patterned, and supervised the construction of a spinning machine, and the trial spinning results have been quite promising. Mr. Jiang adheres to the purpose of the institute, aiming to promote cotton spinning to benefit rural areas, and is not secretive. He welcomes visits and guidance. The spinning machine is currently displayed at the Dafugui Gift Shop, 129 Tianjin Road.

### Joint Youth League Charity Sale for Education Concludes Accounts

The charity sale for education by the League initially encountered several setbacks, and the license was not approved until the end of last month. On the first day of the charity sale, the Jiande Child School sent more than ten children to assist, and later received a lot of help from Mr. Shang Xiaofeng, Zhang Chaoyu, Yu Ruiqing, Zhu Bingmin, Wang Tongxin, and Wang Yaoying. We hereby express our gratitude. This charity sale concluded on the 20th of this month. The income and expenditure accounts are listed below: The total proceeds from the flower sale amounted to 8,611.05 yuan. Necessary expenses, excluding 1,457 yuan, and the retail donation to the First District Public Office of 172.2 yuan (temporarily stored in the Youth Association), leaves a net surplus of 6,981.3 yuan. 3,490.65 yuan will be allocated to the Shenbao Scholarship, the same amount will go to the Xinwenbao Scholarship.
