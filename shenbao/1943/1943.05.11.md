### Deliberations on the New Morality

Yesterday's discussion on "The Practice of New Political Morality" proposed three principles, all of which are expectations for the government authorities. However, in our study of history, we find that the prevalence of any trend, the commencement and effectiveness of political or social movements, are half due to the demonstration and advocacy of the authorities from top to bottom, as the saying goes, "The wind over the grass must bend." The other half is due to the conscious and spontaneous practice of the general populace, creating a trend "from the bottom up." Generally, in primitive societies or feudal times, advocacy from top to bottom was particularly emphasized. The saying, "The people can be made to follow it, but cannot be made to understand it," was especially suited to that era. As for the evolution of humanity, up to modern times, the general populace has been influenced by the trends of the times, consciously or unconsciously recognizing the environment of the times and their own responsibilities. Thus, a force can be formed that can influence the political or social atmosphere of the time. Therefore, one cannot rely solely on the advocacy and demonstration of the government authorities, but also requires the conscious and spontaneous action of the general populace, who, under the premise of loyalty to the country and support for the government, should not lightly relinquish their right to supervise and oversee. Our country, on the one hand, is in a new era of civilized progress, but in reality, compared with the great powers of the contemporary era, its backwardness cannot be denied. Therefore, we believe that the establishment of a new morality should still be mainly in the form of top-down leadership. At the same time, the government should strive to cultivate the new morality of the people, and those who are "the first to know and the first to awaken" among the people should also bear more responsibility, advocating and practicing to create a new moral atmosphere among the people. In this way, with mutual encouragement from above and below, and mutual exhortation from everyone, we can ultimately achieve the ideal of the new morality and complete the goal of national rejuvenation.

With the premise clarified, let us now discuss the main contents of the morality of the people in the new era:

First, it is necessary to develop from the morality of the family to the morality of the nation. For the past two or three thousand years, the social organization of China has not escaped the two words "patriarchal clan," which is the so-called family-centered system. The actual moral center is still only the responsibility to one's own family. As long as you fulfill your responsibility to the family, the so-called "glorifying ancestors and benefiting descendants" is considered a remarkable achievement, or the greatest expectation of fathers and elder brothers for their children throughout the ages. As for whether they have fulfilled their responsibility to the country, it is not given much importance. In the past, in an era of extremely simple international relations, this moral view centered on family interests naturally had special advantages that cannot be completely dismissed. However, in the 20th century today, especially in a period of severe world wars and national liberation wars, this old moral concept that overemphasizes family interests is naturally no longer adapted to the needs of reality. We do not need to eliminate the old morality of family-centeredness, but we must expand it to become a new morality centered on the nation. Because in today's great era, every citizen should be aware that the interests of the family should be subordinate to the interests of the nation. Everyone should be awed by the ancient teaching, "When the nest is overturned, are there any intact eggs?" Everyone should have the awareness of "country first, family second." Everyone should take the practice of fulfilling their responsibility to the country as the foremost morality of the moment. Anything that is detrimental to the country and the nation, even if it is temporarily beneficial to personal wealth and life, should never be done. Anything that is beneficial to the country and the nation, even if it means self-sacrifice, should not be retreated from. This is the first-class new morality that we expect from the people of our country today.

Second, it is necessary to develop from individual private morality to social public morality. Throughout history, how many sins have not originated from only planning for personal interests? Generally speaking, such as social vices like adultery, theft, and lawlessness, which one does not arise from "a moment of selfishness?" Everyone only knows that there is self and does not know that there are others, which is really the greatest enemy of social evolution and human civilization. The rejection of Yang Zhu's philosophy by Confucianism, though inevitably tending to be extreme, has its necessity. Although we do not need to oppose the morality of self-respect and self-love of individualism today, and we have no intention of advocating an altruistic doctrine that ignores reality or an empty cosmopolitanism, for the sake of the construction of a new society, for the sake of the liberation of China and the East Asian nations, we cannot but call on the people to move from individual private morality to attach importance to social public morality. Everyone should take compliance with public order and maintenance of public interests as the basic morality of being human. Anything that sacrifices the interests of the public to benefit one's own must be regarded as a public enemy of society. Similarly, anyone who sacrifices his own fame and fortune for the sake of the public interest, and disregards personal safety, that is, the so-called "sacrificing oneself for the group," is a model of the new morality and should be praised by public opinion. This is the most important new morality that we expect the people of our country to practice.

Third, a healthy physique, a correct outlook on life, and a minimum level of national education are also the standards of the new morality that the people of our country must possess today. In investigating the strength of the advanced countries of the world and the weakness of China, the key lies in this. The biggest shortcomings or weaknesses of the Chinese people are three: first, a weak physique; second, the spirit of Ah Q, self-anesthetization that leads to desperation; and third, the low level of education, with everyone unaware of the immensity of the world and the evolution of the times, ruining their lives in confusion. The vast majority of the people suffer from these three problems, and it can truly be said that it is "unreasonable" if they do not accumulate weakness and poverty. In response to these three morbid states, we must first establish a healthy physique as the first condition of national morality. To achieve this, we must launch a movement against the spirit of Ah Q, oppose the so-called "spiritual victory method," oppose "self-anesthetization," oppose exaggeration, superficiality, greed for petty gains, and playing petty tricks, oppose not distinguishing right from wrong, not asking about truth and falsehood, oppose disregarding reality, and fearing seriousness. We must advocate a down-to-earth, serious approach to work, and an active spirit of vigor and achievement. Finally, every one of our citizens should receive a minimum level of national education, possess the basic knowledge essential for life, possess a correct outlook on life, understand the times, and understand their own position and responsibilities. In the past, the people of our country did not pay attention to the above three points. In the future, we must take these three as the basic moral conditions of the people, so that the realization of all the country's excellent policies will be guaranteed.

The issue of new morality is a major issue related to the survival of the Chinese nation at present. The issue of the new morality of the Chinese people is a major issue related to the mutual assistance of East Asian nations and the construction of a new world order in the future. Whether we can get rid of the bad habits of the past, eliminate all current obstacles, and establish the foundation of the new morality is a major issue that determines the future destiny of our country. Therefore, we believe that raising the issue of new morality at this time and place is of great significance. We hope that everyone will work together to form a trend. The establishment of the new morality is certainly a "century-long plan" that cannot be achieved overnight. However, we in the press dare not belittle ourselves, and the entire country should seem to catch up as soon as possible. Otherwise, whether there will still be a place for our old Chinese nation in the future world is really a big question!

### Battle Line at Dongting Lake: Japanese Army Prepares for Large-Scale Offensive, Army and Air Force Cooperate Skillfully, Conducting Encirclement and Suppression Operations Around Nanxian

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, a certain elite unit of the Japanese army, which was conducting a secret operation, echoed the Japanese army's southbound units pursuing the Chongqing army along the north bank of Dongting Lake. With a number of boats, they launched a sudden attack, circling around the central peninsula of Dongting Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they successfully carried out a surprise landing at Kenjiawan and other places 24 kilometers south of Anxiang. Other units broke through the positions of the 589th Regiment of the 179th Division of the Chongqing army guarding Xiaowenzhen, and further shifted their sharp edge through Mucah Lake, Penghu Lake, Dongjiang Lake, and West Dongting Lake. On the morning of the 9th, they advanced to Tianxin Lake and launched a courageous landing operation in the Ouchi Canal tributary area on the opposite bank of Nanzui. At noon on the 9th, the advance ground offensive units advancing south from Anxiang completely cut off the retreat of the Chongqing 161st and 77th Divisions, which were in a state of panic in the area, and launched a fierce attack on them. Furthermore, the Japanese surprise attack units advanced from Tianxin Lake towards Sanxing Lake at the mouth of the Jiudu River and carried out a landing offensive on the afternoon of the 9th. The collapse of the Chongqing army at that location is said to be imminent.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line, with the skillful cooperation of the Japanese army's land and air forces, the retreat of the Chongqing 161st and 77th Divisions was completely cut off, and a fierce attack was launched on them. Furthermore, the Japanese surprise attack units advanced from Tianxin Lake towards Sanxing Lake at the mouth of the Jiudu River and carried out a landing on the afternoon of the 9th, contacting a certain unit that advanced south from Nanxian along the Jiudu River, flanking the main force of the Chongqing Provisional 5th Division near Sanxing Lake. The Chongqing army was panicked by the sudden appearance of the Japanese surprise attack units in the west of Dongting Lake. The collapse of the Chongqing 29th Army Group is said to be imminent.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, with the skillful cooperation of the Japanese army's land and air forces on the Hunan front line, the main force of the Chongqing 29th Army Group is now on the verge of collapse. On the 9th, a large formation of Japanese army aviation units braved torrential rain and took off from a certain base, fiercely strafing the Chongqing army group attempting to break through, inflicting heavy damage on it. It was also detected from the air that the Chongqing army's attempt to escape by water had been completely crushed due to the Japanese aircraft's fierce bombing of Chongqing army boats on the 7th and 8th. The detailed results of the Japanese aircraft's fierce bombing of Chongqing army boats on the 7th and 8th are as follows: three large Chongqing ships were hit and burned, more than 70 boats were sunk, and about 70 were heavily damaged.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the southern front line of the Taihang Mountains on the 10th, the Japanese army units, in sweeping away the remnants of the (24th Army Group), had previously fiercely pursued the remnants of Yu Longwu's unit (40th Army) in the mountainous areas of Shanxi Province. However, according to the confessions of prisoners, it was learned that the army commander was bombed to death near Nanling Village, 2 kilometers northeast of Lingchuan, on the border of the province, on April 30th. Furthermore, according to a thorough investigation by the Japanese army, it was also proven that the army commander was indeed bombed to death.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Hunan front line on the 10th, after launching a fierce attack on the main force of the Chongqing "161st Division," the elite units of the Japanese army are now compressing and encircling the southern area of Nanxian. Because Nanxian was in imminent danger, the main force of the Chongqing "161st Division," numbering about 3,000, began to flee south along the Jiudu River on the morning of the 8th. However, because their hiding place had been lost, they held on to Hehua City, 10 kilometers southwest of Nanxian, for a last-ditch resistance. However, because the Chongqing army could not withstand the fierce attacks of the Japanese army, they disregarded international law and used poison gas from the night of the 8th to the morning of the 10th in a final struggle. However, because the Japanese army was equipped with scientific equipment, the Chongqing army was ultimately annihilated.

Hunan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army units, centered on Xiaojiawan and Sanxian Lake, formed an encirclement circle with a diameter of only 10 kilometers, trapping the Chongqing army inside. They are now gradually shrinking the encirclement circle and conducting encirclement and suppression operations everywhere. The Japanese army advancing from a certain direction, after breaking through the stubborn Chongqing army near Hehua City, then defeated 800 Chongqing soldiers guarding Banzui (20 kilometers southwest of Nanxian), and is now fiercely pursuing about 3,000 Chongqing army remnants in the Sanxian Lake area. Furthermore, the Japanese army pursuing from Baibukou, together with the waterborne mobile units navigating the Changhe River, surrounded and attacked a Chongqing remnant army regiment of about 1,200 people near Yong'anjing (22 kilometers southeast of Baibukou) at dawn on the 9th, inflicting heavy damage on them.

Hunan Front Line, 10th (Central News Agency) - On the morning of the 9th, the Japanese army suddenly launched a fierce attack on a certain side of Nanxian. The Chongqing army at that location was caught off guard, and the Japanese army advanced rapidly to the south. Furthermore, the Japanese boat mobile units advancing south along the Dou Canal also echoed this, attacking step by step, and finally captured the county seat at 4 pm that afternoon.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the front line in Hebei, Henan, and Shandong provinces on the 10th, after the Japanese army began operations simultaneously on the 6th, the eastward advancing units

Jinan, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese army previously fiercely attacked the Chongqing and Communist armies on both sides of the Yellow River in the northern parts of Shandong, Jiangsu, Henan, and Anhui provinces, inflicting heavy damage on them. The comprehensive war results of the Japanese army in April are recorded as follows: number of engagements 520, of which 182 were with the Communist army. Chongqing and Communist army strength 135,251, of which 24,489 were Communist army.

Taiyuan, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the Japanese army launched the second phase of this year's Taihang Mountains spring operation, it has occupied all the important strongholds in the Chongqing and Communist military regions of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan. This operation has not only crushed the operational command system of the Chongqing and Communist armies but has also destroyed the military facilities of the Chongqing and Communist armies. The Chongqing army previously established various factories on both sides of the Qingzhang River, boasting that it was a self-sufficient land for resisting Japan. Now the Chongqing and Communist army in that area has been defeated and collapsed, and it is impossible to rebuild them. The main factories and military facilities destroyed by the Japanese army in this campaign include 5 ordnance factories, 3 weapons repair factories, 2 armories, 4 ammunition factories, 5 hand grenade factories, 4 grain factories, 2 iron factories, 2 pharmaceutical factories, 3 textile factories, 2 silk factories, and 4 clothing factories.

Furthermore, the sweeping operation against the remnants of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing army is still continuing. The remnants of the Chongqing army are exhausted, and the number of those being annihilated and surrendering is increasing daily.

### Japanese Army Achieves Great Results in Assisting the Chiangbei Clearing and Suppression Work

Central News Agency, Shanghai - The Japanese army units in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River previously assisted the National Government in expanding the clearing and suppression work. Since the beginning of April, the National Government has further promoted the first phase of the clearing and suppression work in the Jiangbei Triangle area. The Japanese army also immediately swept away the remnants of the Chongqing army and fiercely attacked the Chongqing army attempting to make trouble, achieving great results. The number of Chongqing army soldiers captured and surrendered is increasing daily. In total, the Japanese army engaged the Chongqing army in 250 battles in April, the Chongqing army's strength was 46,000, 3,637 corpses were left behind, and 3,660 were captured and surrendered.

It took preemptive action and launched a surprise attack on the main force of the Chongqing army gathered north of Yongcheng on April 24. After several days of fierce attacks, it killed 1,151 Chongqing army soldiers and seized a large number of munitions. (3) The New Fourth Army north of Hongze Lake had previously suffered heavy losses in the Battle of Hongze. Later, 1,500 remnants of the 2nd Division of the New Fourth Army sneaked into the area, attempting to make trouble. The Japanese army then started operations again on April 15, surrounded them south of Muyang, and inflicted heavy damage on them. They are currently continuing to sweep them away.

### Japanese Army in Western Hebei is Expanding the Results of the War

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Since the Japanese army launched the annihilation operation against the "Third Military Subdistrict" in the Western Hebei Military Region, it has been ten days, and the enemy army in the area has been trapped in military encirclement. Furthermore, since the 8th, they have tightened the encirclement net and swept away small groups of Communist army everywhere, advancing towards the central part. The collapse of the enemy's "Third Military Subdistrict" is imminent. The comprehensive results achieved by the Japanese army on the 8th are as follows: 266 enemy corpses were left behind, 113 were captured, and the Japanese army intercepted 120 rifles, 1 mortar, 32 hand grenades, 3 grenade launchers, 83 bayonets, 83 earthen cannons, 27 pistols, and a large amount of other grain and ammunition, destroying 9 enemy barracks, 1 clothing warehouse, 21 grain warehouses, and 1 landmine factory. Furthermore, the annihilation operation launched by the Japanese army against the enemy headquarters of the Fourth Military Subdistrict in the Western Hebei Military Region since last month and the blitzkrieg launched against the Third Military Subdistrict in the Western Hebei Military Region since the 1st of this province are collectively called the Western Hebei Operation.

### Japanese Army Near Shexian is Conducting Sweeping Operations

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Jin-Ji-Yu border region on the 10th, after the elite units of the Japanese army launched a general offensive against the Communist army in the area near Shexian at dawn on the 9th, they have now secured all the key points along the Qingzhang River. The Japanese army in the area of Suozhuang (the central hub of the Jin-Ji-Yu Red Border Region), has overcome the steep terrain of about 60 kilometers in just four days, and the annihilation operation against the Red Border Region has now entered the final stage. The situation of the war is recorded as follows: (1) A certain unit of the Japanese army, centered on Shexian, joined forces with another unit north of Shexian and conducted a sweeping operation in the area near Suobao Village (8 kilometers north of Shexian) to completely destroy the Communist army's facilities. (2) The Japanese army, which was conducting a sweeping operation in the area near Retu Valley in Matianzhen (8 kilometers west of Matianzhen), destroyed a large-scale ordnance factory of the Communist army in a village southwest of Matianzhen.

### Japanese Chief of Staff Talks About the Course of the Anxiang Operation

Anxiang, 10th (Central News Agency) - The chief of staff of a certain unit of the Japanese army, in this Hunan operation, captured Anxiang and surrounded tens of thousands of Chongqing army soldiers, establishing unprecedented meritorious service. On the 10th, in Anxiang County, he delivered a speech on the significance of this operation and the course of the battle, saying: the plan for this offensive operation was ingenious and exceeded the expectations of the Chongqing side. The Chongqing army relied on the rivers and lakes, believing that the Japanese army could not attack, but the Japanese army overcame these natural obstacles, using them to cut off the retreat of the Chongqing army. This point is the greatest feature of this operation. We also used this waterway to break through the Chongqing army's strong defensive positions with powerful assault units, and equipped powerful units on both sides, at the time of the attack, impacting the flanks of the Chongqing army, making it unable to fight back. Because the Japanese army's attack was rapid, the Chongqing army was in a state of panic. Cadres and other escorts [missing text] units took boats and fled. The retreat covering units had their morale demoralized. Since the beginning of the army's actions, in just three days, it broke into the territory of Anxiang County, and the Chongqing army abandoned 1,500 corpses, giving the Chongqing army a crushing defeat in a short period of time [missing text]. The Chongqing "Sixth War Zone" army, which was responding to the war, was regarded by the Chongqing side as its only elite army. Now that it has been hit, the impact on the Chongqing regime's future resistance is said to be great.

### Military Inspection Group Leader Ye Peng Broadcasts to Compatriots in the Motherland from Japan

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - General Ye Peng, head of the Chinese Military Inspection Group, delivered a broadcast report to compatriots in the motherland titled "Japan's Chances of Victory." He pointed out that based on the conclusions drawn from this military inspection in Japan, he firmly believed that Japan would be victorious. This speech was broadcast by this radio station via recording on the evening of the 8th, and will be rebroadcast by the Nanjing Central Radio Station in two or three days. The gist of the speech is recorded as follows: "Brothers and colleagues of the Military Inspection Group were ordered by the Chairman to visit Japan. Although we saw many places in a short period of ten days or so, it was only a glimpse of Japan. Even with what we observed, we may not have grasped the essentials or been entirely accurate. I truly feel ashamed to report to the people of the country about Japan's state of readiness for decisive battle in this way. Today, what I am broadcasting to the people of the country is only the situation regarding Japan's chances of victory. I will use a general method to simply separate my impressions and observations for discussion: (A) Japan's basic conditions. In my opinion, Japan first has its basic conditions, and then generates its conditions for decisive victory. Therefore, I must first list Japan's basic conditions, which are (1) the unity of spiritual civilization and material civilization. Among the countries of the modern world, countries that lean towards spiritual civilization are not adapted to the modern environment and will inevitably lag behind, as is the case with our China. Countries that lean towards material civilization are numbed by utilitarianism and will inevitably fall into fantasy, as is the case with countries like Britain and the United States. I now observe that Japan is the only country in the world that can unite spiritual civilization and material civilization, maintaining the spiritual civilization of the East while catching up with the material civilization of the West, integrating and understanding them thoroughly. This is also the spirit of the Doctrine of the Mean. (2) The spirit of 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' (一生懸命). The spirit of 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' translates into Chinese as the spirit of desperate effort. The Japanese are not more intelligent than people of other countries, nor are they stronger, but they all practice 'Ichi-sho Kenmei.' With 'Ichi-sho Kenmei' alone, nothing is impossible and no enemy cannot be overcome. Just look at their desperate research on modern machinery, and they finally achieved improvements that other countries cannot match. This is the achievement of the Japanese people's 'Ichi-sho Kenmei.' (3) 'Zuibun Hokoku' (隨分報國). The Japanese people are either serving the country at the front or serving the country at the rear. This includes what is called 'labor service to the country,' 'production service to the country,' and even 'cultural service to the country,' 'childbearing service to the country,' etc. Regardless of gender, age, occupation, or whether they are soldiers, merchants, workers, or farmers, all take serving the country as their thought and deed. Every citizen and every activity is in the high tide of serving the country. This is genuine 'Zuibun Hokoku' and is a unified 'Zuibun Hokoku.' In terms of manpower, it would be a great mistake to only consider quantity. In my opinion, the above three conditions are the elements and driving forces of the Japanese spirit and national power, and therefore, they are called Japan's basic conditions. (B) Japan's conditions for decisive victory. The so-called conditions for decisive victory are the necessary conditions for modern warring countries. Japan has the following conditions for those necessary conditions: (1) 'A country with forests of chimneys.' In modern times, places with few chimneys are colonies, and places with many chimneys are rich and powerful countries. This is common knowledge. As soon as we entered Japanese territory, we saw forests of chimneys and coal smoke covering the sky, especially when passing through the Osaka-Kobe area, where they are everywhere. It is said that Osaka City alone has 30,000 named chimneys, and countless unnamed chimneys. The chimneys throughout Japan are a measure of Japan's wealth and power. (2) 'Highly armed through advanced industry.' The construction of modern land, sea, and air forces is not in barracks, ships, and airfields, but in military factories. Japan has long been highly industrialized, and in wartime, factories can switch their production capacity to military supplies. No matter what enemy propaganda says, it is really not inferior to Britain or the United States. Therefore, Japan's land, sea, and air force equipment is complete, which goes without saying, and the entire country has formed a complete high degree of armament in all national defense facilities or defense systems. (3) (Self-sufficiency in military resources). The importance of modern military resources goes without saying. Japan already has a large amount of preparations and reserves, and Japan also has rich occupied lands, such as the South Seas. Although wartime transportation is inevitably difficult in any country, Japanese factories, with their large-scale production, show no signs of a shortage of raw materials. (4) 'No lack of living materials and assets.' Japan, which strives for production on one hand and vigorously practices economy on the other, has achieved amazing results. In terms of the exchange of materials, there is not only domestic production, but also many sources. Even if there is some waste, there is no shortage. However, Japan vigorously practices economy, and its control and distribution are extremely effective, and the uniform and arduous distribution is especially commendable. In this way, there will never be a shortage of living materials. (5) 'Stability of finance and currency.' The situation regarding the Japanese people's savings, government budgets, and digestion of public bonds shows that Japan's finances are very stable even in the high tide of war, and there are no signs of inflation or currency devaluation. In short, Japan under the state of decisive battle has transformed its entire country into a whole, great, strong barracks. Everyone, everything, and every matter is organized under the military and has truly achieved the extreme of mass warfare and total warfare. With these conditions for inevitable victory, the Japanese people have formed a belief in inevitable victory. I believe that the completion of the Greater East Asia War is really not a problem. Our compatriots, under the leadership of the Chairman, are participating in the war in cooperation with the allied countries to sympathize with the Greater East Asian war of national liberation, to solve the problem of our semi-colonial status, and to follow the legacy of Pan-Asianism. Although success or failure is a small matter, hearing about Japan's chances of victory, as reported by me, will naturally bring the joy of a shared victory among allies and encourage greater cooperation. Compatriots, we must not only pledge to cooperate even more for the Greater East Asia total war, but also learn from Japan and share the responsibility of building a new order in East Asia together."

### Economic Advisor Ishiwata Inspects Suzhou

Suzhou, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Sotaro Ishiwata, economic advisor to the National Government, arrived in Suzhou by express train from Shanghai on the morning of the 10th to understand the general economic situation in the "pacified areas" and to collect information on the economic facilities of Jiangsu Province for research purposes. The heads of various departments of the provincial government went to the station to greet him. Mr. Ishiwata first visited the highest unit of the allied forces stationed in Suzhou, and then visited Governor Li at noon at 12:00. Governor Li personally received him and they had a long conversation. Governor Li also hosted a banquet. In the afternoon, Mr. Ishiwata visited scenic spots in Suzhou such as Lingyan Mountain and the Lion Grove, and returned to Nanjing by train at about 5:00 PM.

### Ministry of Finance Prohibits Trading in Enemy Currency - Including Coal Mine Sterling and Hong Kong Dollars

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - It has been reliably learned from the Ministry of Finance that the buying, selling, trading, or remittance of enemy currencies such as US dollars, British pounds, and Hong Kong dollars has long been strictly prohibited by the allied authorities. It is now found that there are still transactions involving the buying and selling of the above-mentioned enemy currencies on the market in various places, which is completely wrong. The Ministry of Finance issued a public notice on May 10th stating that from today onwards, all buying, selling, trading, or remittance of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and promissory notes and checks denominated in these currencies should be strictly prohibited. If there is any possession or holding of the above-mentioned currencies, it should also be strictly investigated and dealt with. Anyone who deliberately violates this rule will be punished severely once verified. It is also heard that the areas of implementation are Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Jiangxi, Wuhan, and various regions in North and South China, and notifications have been sent to the provincial and municipal governments to investigate and ensure compliance.

Statement Issued by the Japanese Embassy

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - In response to the National Government's Ministry of Finance's announcement on the 10th of the immediate implementation of measures to ban enemy currencies, the Japanese Embassy in China issued a statement on the same day, stating in essence that the buying and selling of US dollars, British pounds, Hong Kong dollars, and checks, including small checks, denominated in these currencies, as well as all other transactions, carrying, transporting, and remittance activities, had already been prohibited by a public notice issued by the Supreme Commanders of the Japanese Army and Navy in Shanghai on July 14th of last year. Now, the National Government has again issued a public notice today by the Ministry of Finance, prohibiting not only the transaction but also the possession of these currencies. Anyone who dares to violate this rule will be severely punished. The National Government has previously completed the work of currency unification in the peaceful areas, and the adoption of this measure now is an effective and appropriate response to the implementation of the militarized yen unification work in Hong Kong by the Japanese side from today onwards. It aims to eradicate the black market trading of these enemy currencies, to assist in the work of overthrowing British and American forces in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This fully demonstrates and expresses China's determination to participate in the Greater East Asia War, and the Japanese side is deeply grateful for this.

### New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masami, Departs for China

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Tani Masami, the new Japanese Ambassador to China, after receiving his orders, consulted with the Greater East Asia Ministry and other parties on all matters. In view of the need to actively promote Japan's policy towards China, he departed from Tokyo at 9:00 AM today, accompanied by Counselor Ota of the Japanese Embassy in China. According to the new Japanese policy towards China, taking China's participation in the war as an opportunity, Japan will vigorously assist the National Government to strengthen its political power. China's autonomy and independence are being gradually realized with Japan's active cooperation. Since China shares life and death with Japan and comprehensively cooperates to complete the task of the Greater East Asia War, the future policies must be vigorously promoted. After Ambassador Tani takes office this time, Japan's policy towards China will become more concrete, and the relationship between China and Japan will inevitably be further strengthened. Ambassador Tani is scheduled to visit the Ise Grand Shrine on the way, and is expected to arrive in Nanjing, the capital of our country, around the middle of the month.

### Major Victory on the India-Burma Border - Japanese Army Occupies Buthidaung

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 5:30 PM on May 10th: Japanese army units infiltrated Buthidaung on the upper reaches of the Mayu River at 7:00 PM on May 8th. After fierce fighting, they occupied it and are now mopping up the remaining enemy forces.

Southernmost Front on the India-Burma Border, 10th - In order to defeat the British Indian Army's activities on the India-Burma border, the Japanese army launched an offensive on the banks of the Mayu River, maintaining the initiative of the battle with skillful jungle warfare. After a fierce attack through thorny and rugged roads, they broke into Buthidaung, the last stronghold of the enemy army, at 7:00 PM on the 10th and occupied it, approaching 20 kilometers into the India-Burma border. After the Japanese army eliminated the enemy's stubborn resistance with a heroic night attack on May 4th, they captured a key point 5 kilometers west of Buthidaung. In this battle, the enemy army left behind 150 corpses, abandoned 30 cars, 300 horses, and other military equipment and ammunition, and retreated towards Buthidaung. As a result, the enemy army's supply line connecting Kyauktaw and Buthidaung was cut off, and Buthidaung was isolated. Because the enemy army's retreat route to Maungdaw was cut off, they fled in panic to Buthidaung, using it as a base to gather their forces and attempt a final resistance. The Japanese army bravely pursued and continued their fierce advance. Another Japanese unit bypassed the upper reaches of the Mayu River on May 6th and attacked 10 kilometers east of Buthidaung. In this way, the two routes echoed each other, and finally broke into Buthidaung. The enemy army had previously used Buthidaung as a long-term base for attacking Burma, so they defended it with all their might. At that time, the sound of artillery fire from both sides rumbled, shaking the banks of the Mayu River. The streets of Buthidaung were struck by fierce Japanese artillery fire, and the flames soared into the sky, creating a tragic scene.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The elite Japanese army, which had previously thwarted the British Indian Army's attempt to recapture Kyauktaw by defeating their main force in the Indian area of the India-Burma border, is now continuing to fight in the hot mountains and plains, fiercely attacking the enemy's stronghold of Buton on the left bank of the Machu River on the India-Burma border. After fierce fighting, they completely occupied it. This was announced by the Japanese Imperial Headquarters on the 10th. Buthidaung, occupied by the Japanese army this time, is located about 40 kilometers north of India on the India-Burma border and is a key British military site. Since the British army attempted to recapture Burma and attacked Kyauktaw last year, it has become an important logistics base for them. After the British Indian Army failed in the battle on the Kyauktaw front, they consolidated their positions in Buthidaung and gathered considerable forces in the vicinity, including several divisions of fresh troops and other remnants, attempting to counterattack the Japanese army. The Japanese army launched a siege centered on Buthidaung, starting from both banks of the Machu River, and crushed the new attempt of the British army. The British Indian Army's dream of recapturing Burma and attempting to start a commotion was completely shattered by this Japanese attack.

### Axis Forces Move Towards Cape Bon - Fierce Rearguard Action in Progress - Small Boats Secretly Cross the Strait of Sicily at Night - All Large Military Installations Completely Destroyed

Bern, 10th (Central News Agency) - According to today's news: The Axis forces are now maintaining a triangular front line to cope with the attacks of the anti-Axis forces. Most of the German and other troops in Tunisia are gradually withdrawing towards Cape Bon at the tip of Tunisia. According to estimates from anti-Axis aerial reconnaissance, there are about 50,000 Axis troops moving towards Cape Bon, who are now retreating into the isthmus there. Because the rearguard action is extremely fierce, its entrance and exit have not been blocked. According to a Reuters report: The British 6th Armored Division is now advancing towards Suleiman inside the entrance to Cape Bon and has crossed Menmon Libre. Another British armored division and French armored units are also advancing towards this area in an encirclement formation. At the same time, the anti-Axis naval and air forces are active at sea, hoping to intercept Axis ships within the Strait of Sicily. However, the Axis forces have the advantage of favorable weather conditions and are secretly crossing the strait by small boats under the cover of darkness. Anti-Axis sources also said that German and Italian aircraft, destroyers, torpedo boats, and ferries regularly travel back and forth between Tunisia and Sicily. According to news from the British side: There was still fighting in the Bizerte area on Saturday morning. After fighting bravely, the German army began to withdraw to the mountains west of the city. Several thousand main force troops are now moving along the bay and coastal highway towards Boro Farina. American forces are finding it difficult to clear out the German assault troops in the city of Bizerte. Reuters correspondent Blanc said that the German army would make a strong defensive battle, and the German assault teams in the city streets were very active, while the German artillery on the small mountains across the strait also opened fire and bombarded. German tank units are now stationed at a more southern location to prevent American tank columns from moving around the east bank of Bizerte. In addition, the German side has moved 2,500 troops into Porto Farina. The power plant on the west bank of Lake Bizerte was destroyed on Saturday afternoon. The electricity for the city of Bizerte and its suburbs was supplied by this plant. Many other military installations in Bizerte were also destroyed by the German army before the withdrawal.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German News Agency reported that the Fuehrer's headquarters issued a war report stating: (1) South of Bizerte, the enemy army used new and larger tank columns and powerful air forces to attack the Axis forces. The Axis forces resisted bravely until the last bullet. In the southeastern area of Tunis and the southern Axis forces of Tunisia, they continued their fierce defensive battles. The enemy army launched several large-scale attacks, which were all repelled, and the enemy suffered heavy losses. (2) German planes attacked Bon Harbor last night, causing large fires on the shore and in the ships in the harbor. (3) The German and Italian air forces and anti-aircraft guns shot down a total of 20 British and American planes over Sicily. During the air battle, German fighter planes lost three aircraft.

### Fresh German Troops Reinforce the Eastern Front - The Front Line Extends 2,000 Miles - The Possibility of a Major War Breaking Out at Any Time - Soviet Offensive in the Kupiansk Area Repelled

Stockholm, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German army is gathering a large number of new forces at many strongholds along the 2,000-mile front line from the Arctic to the Black Sea, so the Soviet side may launch a major war at any time. Reuters correspondent King in Moscow reported last night that the German command had consolidated the German army's positions and created a well-organized and deep defense system, and that the German army had moved new forces into these new defenses.

### Current Situation in Wartime China – Symposium – Translated from "Reconstruction" May Issue (1)

Date: April 9, Year 32 (1943)

Location: Imperial Hotel, Tokyo

Attendees: Chen Gongbo, Okawa Shumei, Tachibana Shiraki, Matsumoto Shigeharu, Yamamoto Jitsuhiko

Yamamoto: Next, regarding various specialized matters, I believe Mr. Okawa, Mr. Tachibana, and Mr. Matsumoto all have various opinions to express. However, I would like to ask one more question, and that is the future of the current reserve certificates or currency, and the issue of military construction. How will these types of issues be handled? Mr. Chen is a proponent of controlled economy in China, so he must have insightful views on how to implement various new organizations in the peaceful areas regarding economic and financial matters. Now, please Mr. Chen, share your thoughts.

Chen: Then I will answer that. First, let's talk about the issue of reserve certificates. In my opinion, it is best to have only one type of currency in circulation. I believe it is not feasible to have various currencies coexisting. As you all know, the resources of North China do not flow to Central China, and similarly, the resources of Central China do not flow to North China. The economic conditions are independent of each other. Because resources do not flow, for example, the Nanjing and Shanghai areas, hoping to obtain resources from North China, after various negotiations, finally manage to transport some of the desired resources over. Then they must remit money. However, when remitting money, because there is more than one type of currency, there are fluctuations in exchange rates and other difficulties. As a result, the economies of North and Central China are isolated. I believe this is also an issue that the authorities of both countries should work together to study and resolve in the future.

Now, this ideal is gradually being realized. For example, the issuance of military currency has been stopped. However, this issue is naturally being studied by the financial authorities of both countries. I am not a financial authority, so I can only answer a few thoughts on the question just raised.

Next, let's talk about the issue of military construction. In my opinion, spiritual education is the most important thing, and it is the foundation of military construction; the second is the issue of weapons. The Central Military Academy has now been established in Nanjing, and the first class of graduates will be produced this September. People from both China and Japan are very satisfied with the performance of that class of graduates. Chairman Wang personally gives instructions once a week, and every student can often hear the Chairman's instructions. Therefore, they understand their responsibilities. Why be a soldier? What should a soldier do? – They are very clear about this responsibility and purpose. They also thoroughly understand national policy. Like this, the foundation of military construction is being consolidated day by day.

However, what remains is the issue of weapons. Currently, the reorganization and training of the national army are being carried out temporarily in various places. However, the temporarily assembled troops can only be responsible for maintaining public order at present. Then what is the best way? I believe that a large number of graduates from schools should still be added to various armies, and then, with the assistance of your country, seek to enrich the weapons. If this can be done, then it will certainly enable the national army to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. This point relies heavily on your country's understanding and assistance. Not to mention those in power in your country, but also those of you who are out of office, if you also advocate the idea that the National Government's military construction is intended to contribute to the Greater East Asia War, and that it is now fully engaged in spiritual training, striving to consolidate its goals, and therefore should be assisted with weapons – then the National Government's military construction issue will have great hope for the future.

Next is the issue of economic control. Many people believe that the principle of economic control is to buy and distribute: I believe that it is to implement planned production, buy up the produced materials, and then distribute the bought-up materials reasonably. As long as it can be done smoothly, the goal of economic control can be achieved. If we examine the controlled economy of the past, we know that it does not conform to the purpose of production, but is some non-productive economic control. Also, regarding buying, it is also unplanned buying. If you want to ask: Since the new policy of material control was improved last month, has China been engaged in planned production? – Then I will answer: It has not yet entered that period; but it can be said that it has entered a promising stage.

The purpose of the production policy is to benefit the Greater East Asia War; this is the greatest purpose of production. In the past, it was just because the local area was stable and the war had stopped, so they just tried to do it. In fact, production that benefits the Greater East Asia War as its greatest purpose has not yet been done. However, it can now be said that it has entered such a period of brewing. Also, the so-called lack of planning in the buying method is that partial control has been implemented until today, so the materials in Shanghai cannot be transported to Suzhou, and the materials in Suzhou cannot be transported to Wuxi, and they are in a state of small blood circulation with each other. Then, after the implementation of this new policy, has planned buying been carried out? – Speaking of this, I can answer: It has definitely not been carried out to that point. However, it will naturally reach this point after the new policy is improved. Everyone says that although the plan has not been established, if the new policy is implemented, materials will naturally be bought. I believe that this kind of natural buying is unreliable. In any case, the state must establish a certain plan, make an overall plan for the materials necessary for the war, and then ensure that the state can use the materials necessary for the war at any time. Also, materials that are not necessary for the Greater East Asia War should be circulated among the people in order to stabilize the people's lives – I believe that this kind of planned buying should be implemented.

Next is planned distribution. Examining the current state of rationing, only rice rationing is being carried out in China, and even the method of distribution has not been put on track. However, that is not without reason. Because it has only been twenty days since the implementation of the new policy on material control, one cannot demand that it be realized rapidly. Therefore, the true function of economic control has to await the next stage.

Yamamoto: Mr. Tachibana, you are very busy, please raise your questions first.

Tachibana: (To Mr. Okawa) Mr. Okawa, do you have any questions?

Okawa: No, I don't.

Tachibana: Then I would like to raise the issue of economic control. I believe that there are very important elements in the government's implementation of economic control. Therefore, when the National Government implements economic control, no matter how perfect the government's plan is, if there are no corresponding economic facilities or economic institutions below, then the agency is equivalent to being nominally there but not functional. That kind of force that acts in accordance with the government's wishes below, in China, I believe should be sought in the elders groups in the local society, and the national capitalists in Shanghai who are based on those elders groups. The reconstruction of China is not just about permeating economic control into the people, but the entire work is also non-existent without being based on China's local society. Not to mention the Yan'an regime, even the Chongqing regime, I believe, has not been able to devote its efforts to this point. Those who have this qualification are the Kuomintang, which is guided by Mr. Jingwei, and the National Government under its guidance. In a word, it is the National Regime. There is no other. I think we should contribute our help as much as possible in the capacity of those out of office. Regarding this point, Mr. Chen's opinion, in expecting the penetration of the controlled economic policy, what kind of brilliant insights does he have regarding the elders groups and national capital that constitute the local society? I would like to ask Mr. Chen about this.

Chen: Regarding this issue, we have repeatedly discussed and considered it in detail. To give a concrete example, the agency for implementing the new policy of material control – the National General Association for Commercial Control – has already been organized. This agency is by no means an agency of officials of the National Government, but is entirely an organization of civilian economic groups. The government has nothing to do with it; the government only gives guidance and direction. The central figures in organizing this National General Association for Commercial Control are the trade associations in Shanghai or other trade associations in various places. Moreover, there are also Japanese organizations joining this Commercial Control Association, that is, Japanese organizations have also become a cell of the National General Association for Commercial Control. Therefore, the organization of this agency is very appropriate. And according to the purpose of the National General Association for Commercial Control, it can implement the items regarding material control. Because if the people do not understand the meaning of material control, then even if many organizations for material control are created, the people will still not follow. That is certainly not okay, so the people must first understand its meaning, but before making them understand, it is better to let them implement it first, and let them do this matter themselves, which is the fastest way to get results.

Tachibana: Substantive...

Chen: Therefore, the above-mentioned civilian organization was created to let the people implement it themselves. Therefore, that agency is definitely not being implemented solely by the government, but the government is only standing in a guiding position, and it is the people who are automatically implementing it.

Tachibana: That's great. So, as I said just now, whether it is the Kuomintang or the National Government, it is precisely relying on the substantive, autonomous, and enthusiastic efforts of the people to build a new China, and then to move towards the construction of Greater East Asia. However, before that, the opponent of the great cause of the National Regime, I believe, is actually the local society, which is the foundation of the elders groups and national capitalists mentioned just now, and is also their territory. In this way, then the so-called local society is actually the life of China's reconstruction, and is the source of political power. How did Sun Yat-sen grasp this important foundation? – Turning over Mr. Sun's surviving documents, we can see that the so-called Chinese society is actually based on the family as a very important foundation. Families gather to form clans, and clans gather to form a nation. Therefore, if we want to unite the Chinese people, who are like a sheet of loose sand, into a strong nation or state, we must consolidate the clan that serves as the medium between the family and the nation. In this way, it occupies five or six pages, and discusses the issue of the rational organization of the clan from various points of view. Therefore, I believe that what Mr. Sun grasped was this meaning. Is Mr. Chen's hometown also Guangdong?

Chen: Yes.

Tachibana: Mr. Sun is also from Guangdong. In the area of Guangdong and Fujian, the so-called clan over there has a very large influence; however, as it gradually reached the north, the so-called clan's influence also followed, whether political or economic, and declined. Therefore, in terms of Guangdong and Fujian, it is completely the same as what Mr. Sun said, but further north, it is not the clan that becomes a blood-related society, but the local society that includes the society of variegated colors with a broader meaning. There is a Chinese saying, "xiangdang," which in our Japanese terms, is the local society. Therefore, the clan that Mr. Sun said, if used in a broader sense, I think it is better to use the term "xiangdang" or local society to call it, which is easier to understand. In this way, then Mr. Sun's nationalism, the result of which is strong – not loose sand-like – a nation and a national society, is it not formed by the local society?

Chen: To talk about the Three Principles of the People, it is a long story that cannot be finished in a short time. Now, let me talk about a part of it that is related to the points of your inquiry. Chinese society is based on agricultural society, and it can also be said to be mainly based on agricultural society. Needless to say, the family is the most important in agricultural society. The family is really the most valued. People who are related to the family are regarded as family members. People who live in the same building are of course family members, but many people who are related to it, even if they do not live in their home, are also interpreted as family members. In Chinese agricultural society, valuing the family is very reasonable.

In the north, there are many villages scattered here and there. In the south, there are many villages that become groups. And in the south, there are often thousands or tens of thousands of people living in one village, becoming a group; it is not like this in the north. Because of this reason, Mr. Sun Yat-sen wanted to find a way to make the Chinese people realize national unity, but he did not have a word that could explain it. Because the Chinese people are mainly based on the family, he started from the family. Then he gradually made the family, the clan, and the nation easy for people to understand. Or, in this family, it may contain the meaning of the so-called local area in the north. To say it in a broader way, it is the clan. In short, starting from the family is because China attaches importance to the family, and wants to form a nation from the family. Therefore, from the family and clan aspects, the concept of the nation is emphasized.

Tachibana: Yes.

Chen: Also, for reference, let me give another example. In the northwest of China, the influence of the Communist Party is now very large. However, when the Communist Party implements its politics, it strives to not implement policies that violate the traditions of Chinese society. It does not do anything that opposes the family. Therefore, it also hangs the banner of nationalism based on the family. So, at the beginning of this war, the Communist Party hung up the banner of "Look, the Japanese came to China to oppose our nationalism, so let's all fight!" and practiced its communist politics. People in the north have the same concept. Especially farmers, and even city dwellers, have such a concept. Therefore, for example, if someone's land is confiscated, even if only one person's land is confiscated, it will have the following impact. That is, not to mention someone's brothers, their ancestors, their fathers, and other relatives, old friends, or cousins, or people with the same surname who branched off from tens of generations ago, these people will all express sympathy for that someone whose land was taken away. For example, if someone's land is taken away by the Communist Party, then many people who are related to that person will oppose the Communist Party. Also, suppose someone's land is taken away by the army, then not to mention the family living in their house, but all those who are related to them will sympathize with that someone. Originally, there was such a state of affairs.

The person who came up with this theory was Sun Yat-sen. He believed that if the principle of the family is grasped first, then the principle of the nation can be emphasized. Therefore, he started from the family and realized the policy that consolidates the origin of a country.

### Important Correction

From the sixteenth line of the second grid to the eighteenth line of the fourth grid in yesterday's text, that is, "so that China and Japan will encounter...another opportunity," is connected to the third line of the sixth grid, after "…is because Chiang Kai-shek colluded with the United Kingdom and the United States." and before "For example, the establishment of peace between Japan and China…" Because it was arranged upside down by the typesetter, the tone of the sentences was chaotic. We express our apology to the readers.

### Various Groups Appeal for Strict Punishment of the Culprits in the Zhang Case; Special Second Court Opens Investigative Hearing This Morning

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) The case of French Inspector Millet of the French Concession Police killing young Zhang Jinhai has been formally prosecuted after the French Consulate Court concluded its investigation. Five million citizens throughout the city are now unanimously and closely watching the legal sanctions. Yesterday afternoon, the French Consulate Court held an on-site performance at the French Police Department. The Procuratorate of the Special Second Court is scheduled to open a hearing this morning. Details are recorded below.

On-Site Performance

After the French Consulate Court repeatedly opened hearings on the case of Zhang Jinhai being forced to death by torture, it was deemed that the culprit, French Inspector Millet, was guilty. Based on Article 309 of the French Criminal Code, a formal prosecution was filed. Yesterday afternoon at 3:00 p.m., Judge Corbin of the French Consulate Court, accompanied by Secretary Lege, Consul Judicial Police Chief Lebrun, the accused culprit Millet, Chinese detectives Zhu Songcheng and Guo Shiyuan, and another victim, Peng Shuanglong, went to the Criminal Division of the Lujiawan General Police Station on Xuehua Road for an on-site investigation. At the same time, the beating situation was re-enacted, and photos were taken on the spot as evidence. It was not until after 5:00 p.m. that it was completed.

Hearing This Morning

The family members of Zhang Jinhai, who was brutally murdered, submitted a report to the Second Special District Court. The Procuratorate of the court recently issued a summons, scheduling a hearing to begin at 9:00 p.m. tonight (the 11th) in the court of the court. At that time, all the accused will be present in court on time to await questioning. However, the accused and others are still detained in the French Police Station and must be transferred to the court this morning.

French Response to the Peng Case

As for Peng Shuanglong, a seventeen-year-old apprentice who was also beaten and injured, who is being treated at Guangci Hospital, it was suddenly reported yesterday that he refused to meet with his family members, which increased the public's indignation. The French Police Department responded to this matter, saying, "After Peng Shuanglong was released on April 30, he voluntarily went to Guangci Hospital for treatment. If Peng's family members are dissatisfied with the hospital's regulations and food, they can transfer to another hospital on their own, and there is no need for special permission from the Police Department."

Family Members of the Deceased Run Around Appealing

Yesterday afternoon, accompanied by lawyer Gao Yunlu, Zhang Jinhai's family members continued to petition various parties, going to the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Chinese Ratepayers' Association of the Public Concession, and news agencies. First, they visited Minister Luo at the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Judicial Administration, and the Minister sent a representative to meet them. Then they went to the Chamber of Commerce, where Director Yuan Lvden met them. He attached great importance to the case and had the Chamber of Commerce send a telegram to the central government to seriously negotiate, hoping to achieve the purpose of punishing the murderer. They will certainly provide assistance in the future.

Various Groups Petition the Municipal Government

The Shanghai Branch of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of the Chinese Nation, the Anti-Communist League of East Asia, the United Chinese Hongmen Society, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the International Anti-Communist League, and the Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai jointly sent representatives to visit Mayor Chen Gongbo at the Municipal Government at 11:00 a.m. yesterday (the 10th). Mayor Chen specially sent Secretary-General Zhao Shibiao to meet them, expressing his attitude towards the Zhang case and expressing his opinions. Finally, the representatives of the various groups successively stated the legal viewpoints of the principal murderer Millet's criminal behavior and requested Secretary-General Zhao to forward the request to Mayor Chen to extradite the criminal Millet to the Chinese court for trial as soon as possible in accordance with diplomatic procedures, and to punish him with the crime he deserved, so as to quell public anger. Secretary-General Zhao immediately expressed his acceptance of the opinions and said that he would forward them to Mayor Chen for consideration and handling. It is also learned that various groups have hired four famous Shanghai lawyers, Jin Xiongbo, Fang Kangnian, Zhou Enzhan, and Tao Aixian, to provide opinions on the Zhang case and provide legal defense.

Secretary-General Zhao Expresses His Opinion

When Secretary-General Zhao represented Mayor Chen in meeting with representatives of various people's groups, he expressed his attitude towards the Zhang case, saying, "After this incident occurred, firstly, the public opinion in Shanghai expressed indignation and upheld justice, which has attracted close attention from the citizens and has been quite effective. Secondly, the court has formally filed a public prosecution based on the legal supervisory position, and there will be an appropriate disposition soon. Thirdly, the municipal government has also lodged a serious protest with the French authorities. In the future, we hope that the people's groups, the court, and the municipal government can take consistent steps and jointly plan the progress. It is expected that the resolution of the Zhang case will achieve satisfactory results."

Telegram to Minister Luo of the Ministry of Judicial Administration

To Luo, Minister of the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, and Chen Junjian, President of the Shanghai Second Special District Court, we have learned that in the case of the Shanghai French Concession patrol police torturing Zhang Jinhai, an apprentice at the Chengji Socks Factory, to death, the public is indignant and public opinion is in an uproar. Foreigners have historically abused their powers and disregarded human life by relying on extraterritoriality and concession relations, which is a heinous crime. Our association cannot ignore this in order to protect human rights and maintain judicial authority. Moreover, the National Government is now working with friendly neighbor Japan to build a new order in East Asia. Shanghai, in particular, is where all eyes are focused, and we cannot allow such an inhumane and humiliating incident to occur again. Therefore, we hereby telegraphically request your Excellency to seriously negotiate with the Shanghai French Concession authorities as soon as possible, and to ensure that they fulfill the following conditions based on the judicial position: (1) All criminals shall be handed over to the Chinese court for trial, (2) The family members of the deceased and injured shall be compensated, and (3) It shall be guaranteed that the same incident will not occur again in the future, so as to redress the grievances and uphold justice. As for Guo Shiyuan, Zhu Songcheng, and others, who abuse their power and oppress their compatriots, they should be punished with the most severe penalty to serve as a warning to those who rely on foreign forces to oppress their compatriots. The telegram is filled with grief and indignation, and we look forward to your urgent attention. The Shanghai Branch of the China General Association of the East Asia League, the Anti-British and Anti-American Association of China, the Anti-Communist League of East Asia, the United Chinese Hongmen Society, the Chinese Construction Youth Corps, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Zhenjiang Fellow Villagers Association, respectfully.

Zhenjiang Citizens Telegraph Shanghai for Justice

"Having read the reports in various newspapers revealing that the Shanghai French Police Inspector Millet and others tortured Zhang Jinhai to death and severely injured Peng Shuanglong, who is under the legal age, the behavior is tragic and extremely cruel, making it unbearable to read. The various Zhenjiang groups in Shanghai have unanimously expressed their support and aroused public anger, which shows that the facts are true and not fabricated. At a time when the return of extraterritoriality by friendly nations is being realized, such a tragic case has occurred, which is shocking and contrary to public reason. Moreover, the police station has a history of illegality, and it is difficult to enumerate the oppression suffered by our people. If the chief culprit is not severely punished according to the law, the family members of the deceased are not compensated, and the police station is not held responsible for guaranteeing that the same incident will not occur again, then what is humanity, and how can we warn others? We hereby telegraphically request that you respectfully report to the Ministry of Judicial Administration of the National Government, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and the Jiangsu Provincial Government to seriously negotiate and achieve the aforementioned objectives, so as to value human life and uphold justice. We cannot express our urgency enough. The Zhenjiang County Chamber of Commerce and various industry associations, the Zhenjiang County Clean Countryside Work Support Association, and all the people of the county respectfully."

Shanghai Groups Continue to Voice Support

Many people from the Municipal Farmers' Association and other five groups have applied to join the association for Zhang Jin. Participating groups include the Women's Welfare Association, the Chinese Society of Law and Politics, the Shanghai West Citizens' Federation, and dozens of groups such as the Anhui Fellow Villagers Association in Shanghai. The Shanghai Special City Branch of the Chinese Lixie Church, the Hot Water Bottle Manufacturing Industry Association of this city, the Auction of Secondhand Goods Industry Association, the Research Association of the National Central University, the Overseas Chinese Public Opinion Agency of this city, and the Nantong News Agency have also successively voiced their support for the Zhang case.

### Please Temporarily Exempt Teachers from Income Tax

— Ni Weiqiu

At this time when teachers' lives are extremely difficult, we suddenly hear that the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has explicitly ordered the collection of income tax from teachers. According to the notice issued to various schools by the Shanghai District Collection Bureau, this is based on the provisions of "Category II Free Professions and Other Practitioners' Salaries and Remuneration Income," so teachers should also be subject to income tax. It is also stated that the income tax due from January 21st to the end of April of this year must be deducted retroactively; starting in May, it will be deducted monthly and handed over to the Central Reserve Bank, which is a major blow to teachers. Teachers are squeezed by speculators and hoarders and are simply unable to make a living. Try asking a three-foot-tall child on the road; "Who is the most miserable person today?" They will surely answer, "The teacher who sits on the cold bench." Today, teachers at all levels of schools have meager salaries. Their monthly income is only used to pay rent, buy rice and flour, and the simplest vegetables; there is no extra money to buy books and newspapers, and there is no extra strength to buy clothes and socks; whether it is mental or material life, they are unable to obtain satisfaction. The government has tried to provide relief, and people from all walks of life have expressed sympathy, or provide free medical treatment, or provide assistance, and the meaning is nothing more than this. The reason why teachers are willing to endure hardship and continue to teach is nothing more than to maintain the cause of education and prevent the vitality of the country and the nation from being broken! Although there are occasionally one or two principals who aim to make profits, the teachers are really without fault; although there are occasionally a few teachers who also engage in speculation and hoarding, most teachers can still work hard and devote themselves to teaching students. Therefore, if you still want to collect income tax from teachers today, it is tantamount to forcing teachers to the road of death and causing the education industry to collapse. Therefore, teachers cannot be treated as the same as general self-employed people, and in this situation where salaries cannot rise at the same time as prices, teachers cannot be treated as the same as general self-employed people. We believe that the financial authorities who love and support the cause of education will definitely be able to understand this situation and give teachers preferential treatment by temporarily exempting them from income tax.

Even more, I can't help but say that it is appalling that the notice orders schools to retroactively deduct teachers' income tax from January 31st to the end of April of this year! According to the "Monthly Taxable Income Calculation Table" attached by the Collection Bureau, the tax rate is very detailed and I will not copy it one by one. Let's assume a monthly salary of 500 yuan, with a monthly deduction of 5.5 yuan. From January 31st to April of this year, there are a total of sixteen months, which means a deduction of 248 yuan; this number is equivalent to half a month's salary, so how will this half-month of life be maintained? Therefore, I deeply hope that the financial authorities can also exempt the income tax for the sixteen months.

Millions of teachers who are waiting for relief will inevitably be panic-stricken after hearing the notice that income tax must be deducted and that sixteen months of income tax must be deducted retroactively. If teachers' income tax cannot be temporarily exempted, then teachers' lives will become more difficult. If the financial authorities can understand the hardships of teachers' lives and explicitly order temporary exemption, then the teachers will be fortunate! Education will be fortunate!

Economic Commentary

### Second Thorough Investigation of Commodity Hoarding

Mr. Shotaro Ishiwata, the Supreme Economic Advisor to the National Government, after inspecting the recent economic situation in Shanghai, stated to reporters the day before yesterday: "As for the issue of hoarding, it is of course appropriate to take decisive measures." This "succinct and to the point" statement precisely reflects the urgent demand of the people for the government in the past two months.

However, the latest development in the issue of thoroughly investigating commodity hoarding is: "The National Government recently dispatched a second batch of key personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate commodity hoarding and is determined to punish hoarders," and "Shanghai's economic circles also deeply hope that this investigation will produce more concrete facts so that they can cooperate with the National Government's wartime economic policies." We believe that the results of the first thorough investigation of hoarding can only be regarded as a formality; now that we are starting anew, it is appropriate to prescribe the right medicine for the ailment, without being bound by the habit of "bringing the original prescription for a follow-up visit." In other words, this thorough investigation "must be absolutely impartial and break through all considerations of sentiment; if those who should be punished have more powerful backgrounds, they should be punished even more severely." We hope that the second thorough investigation of illegal hoarding can be carried out based on such a spirit of impartiality. Then, with swift and decisive action, government orders will not be difficult to implement thoroughly.

Secondly, regarding this continued dispatch of key personnel to Shanghai to thoroughly investigate hoarding, "some people in the economic circles greatly hope that the scope of the investigation will be further expanded and that supervision can be applied to factories producing cotton yarn, silk, and cotton cloth." The explanation of this expression of intent is that to eliminate hoarding, it is necessary to address both the symptoms and the root causes. The shortcut to addressing the root cause is to register all goods stored in warehouses and depots, so that hoarders fundamentally lose their means of concealment. Then, even if they want to take advantage of loopholes, they will find it impossible to do so. Fortunately, the government "is now, with the Ministry of Industry as the center, studying the registration law, and once the review is completed, it will be promulgated by the National Government." All of these things—including the "Regulations on Punishing the Hoarding of Major Commodities"—must be fulfilled and effectively implemented, which is the most important thing. Yesterday, the press was invited to report on the progress of the preparations.

### National Commercial Control Association: Flour and Wheat Special Committee to Be Established Soon. Yesterday, the Press Was Invited to Report on the Progress of the Preparations

The Flour and Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has been organized under the supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Food and the National Commercial Control Association and will be officially established around the 20th of this month. To make its mission clear to all sectors, the committee invited the city's press to a meeting at Room 309, No. 2 Beijing Road, at 1:00 PM yesterday (the 10th) to report on the progress of preparations and the future direction of work. More than 20 reporters from Chinese and Japanese newspapers attended. Mr. Sun Zhongli, Chairman of the Special Committee, gave a speech.

He stated briefly: "Our committee, under the command, supervision and guidance of the Ministry of Food and the National Commercial Control Association, has been largely organized. In the meantime, great efforts have been made in contacting and leading domestic colleagues and in consulting and negotiating with colleagues in friendly countries. Fortunately, it has been relatively smooth and satisfactory. This is sufficient to demonstrate the sincere cooperation between the authorities and colleagues on both sides, and it can be a matter of satisfaction to all sectors. The work of control was originally intended to meet the needs of wartime, and food, in particular, is of utmost importance to military needs and people's livelihoods. Among the main food items, apart from rice, are flour and wheat. Previously, the purchase and distribution of flour and wheat were handled by government and business officials from friendly countries. Now, in accordance with the principle of equality agreed upon by the authorities of the two countries, we will cooperate sincerely and hand it over to this committee. Therefore, the composition of this committee is based on the joint association of flour and wheat colleagues from both China and Japan, and the joint association is formed by the flour and wheat trade associations in various places. As for the nature of this committee, it is actually one of the professional committee organizations of the National Commercial Control Association. Its organization consists of a chairman, two vice-chairmen, four executive committee members, eight committee members, one chief supervisor, and four supervisors elected by the aforementioned joint association of colleagues from both China and Japan. Under the chairman, there is a secretary-general and two deputy secretaries, who are responsible for departmental affairs. It is planned to set up eight sections for general affairs, finance, wheat flour bran, review, transportation, factory, and improvement. Each section will have a section chief and a deputy section chief, as well as a number of staff members and assistants, to be responsible for their respective tasks and to achieve the effect of division of labor and cooperation. As for the tasks of this committee, naturally they are the purchase and distribution of wheat, the transportation and sales of flour and bran, the adjustment of prices, the inspection of quality, and other matters concerning the increase and improvement of production, all of which will be handled separately by this committee. In short, the main task of this committee is control, and it is by no means business. This point should be made clear to all parties. Regarding the promotion method, branches will be established in Beijing, Shanghai, and the two municipalities of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to strengthen purchase and manufacturing. An appropriate high price for wheat will be set to encourage production, establish a sales system, and distribute it evenly to prevent speculation and hoarding. Adjustments will be made from time to time to eliminate competition, and strict inspections will be carried out to improve quality. Although I, Mr. Inoue, and Mr. Yang Yingmao are relatively familiar with the historical business conditions among our colleagues, we are sincerely grateful for the endorsement of the responsible officials and the senior talents in the industry. We really dare not shoulder this heavy burden, but we feel the importance of the people's food and that we should solve it reasonably. Moreover, commercial control is related to national policy, and we are even more grateful to all parties for their earnest responsibility based on righteousness. Therefore, we have to reluctantly accept the difficult task for the time being. However, we always take responsibility for our work and have an open mind. We will never be perfunctory or careless. This time, in order to serve the community, we should adhere to this principle and be wary of walking on thin ice. We can also let other talents take over at any time. I hope that our authorities and our colleagues will appreciate our sincerity and understand us."

Internal Organization

The internal organization system of the association is divided into one office and eight sections below the committee members to handle tasks, including the Secretary's Office (divided into secretary specialists), General Affairs Section (divided into general affairs, documents, and personnel divisions), Wheat Section (divided into purchase and distribution divisions), Flour Section (divided into transaction and local divisions), Finance Section (divided into accounting and cashier divisions), Review Section (divided into enterprise, capital, investigation, and statistics divisions), Factory Section (divided into construction, materials, and inspection divisions), Transportation Section (divided into transportation, warehouse, and insurance divisions), and Improvement Section (divided into inspection and research divisions).

### Investigation of Concession Warehouses Completed

The Materials Control Bureau of the Public Works Department, in order to understand in detail the quantity and content of various materials stored in the warehouses in the concession, conducted an investigation of 175 warehouses in the concession. It is now known that this investigation work has come to an end, and the data obtained from various investigations are being actively organized, which will take about a month.

### National Government Re-investigates Hoarding. It Is Now Underway

The National Government authorities are determined to thoroughly investigate illegal hoarding in Shanghai's financial and industrial circles. Last time, Financial Vice-Minister Chen Zhishuo was sent to Shanghai to conduct a thorough investigation, and Futong Commercial Bank was the first to be punished by being ordered to cease operations. However, the authorities not only did not stop the investigation work, but also decided to send senior officials to Shanghai again to conduct a more thorough investigation in order to strengthen the effect of the investigation. It is reported that the second investigation by the National Government authorities has begun, and the dispatched senior officials have also arrived in Shanghai and are now rigorously carrying out various tasks in order to achieve the greatest effect from this investigation. It is also known that after the completion of the investigation in the future, the highest government authorities will impose extremely severe penalties on hoarders in this city, regardless of which side they belong to.

### After Supplementary Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, Applications for Movement Are Allowed

The National Commercial Control Association previously held a registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which was of a relatively short duration, and holders may have been unable to register in time. However, in order to take into account the actual difficulties of merchants, the association's board of directors and supervisors specially resolved to allow a supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in Shanghai Special City. After this supplementary registration period expires, a spot check will be carried out. If unregistered cotton yarn and cotton cloth are found, they will not be allowed to enjoy the rights of buying, selling, and moving, and they will be punished according to law. It is reported that the supplementary registration period will run from yesterday (the 10th) to the 15th.

It is also reported that for cotton yarn and cotton cloth that have already been registered, if they need to be transported outside the Shanghai area (i.e., the control line), they may apply for a permit from the Materials Movement Permit Office of the association in Hamilton Building in accordance with Article 6 of the Provisional Regulations on the Control of Wartime Materials Movement, and then be allowed to move out. The Municipal Government Ordered the Economic Bureau to Send Personnel to Attend

### The Ministry of Industry Convened the Spring Cocoon Evaluation Meeting. The Municipal Government Ordered the Economic Bureau to Send Personnel to Attend

In order to evaluate the price of cocoons for this period in view of the imminent arrival of spring cocoons, the Ministry of Industry has scheduled to convene a cocoon price evaluation committee in the ministry on May 15 to jointly discuss issues related to the sales of silkworm eggs in various places, the price of mulberry leaves, labor costs, and miscellaneous expenses, as well as the production cost materials of spring cocoons. The Municipal Government of this city has approved the ministry's request and has ordered the Economic Bureau to assign personnel to attend and provide various relevant materials for transfer.

### Hong Kong to Ban the Circulation of Hong Kong Dollars from Next Month

Hong Kong, 10th (Central News Agency) In order to consolidate security, revive and develop the general livelihood of the people, the Hong Kong Governor's Office has decided to use military currency as the sole currency from June 1 and to ban the circulation of Hong Kong dollars in the jurisdiction. Governor's Order No. 26, the "Currency Regulations for the Occupied Territory of Hong Kong," was promulgated on the 10th, and at the same time, a public notice was issued regarding the exchange of military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes after the implementation of the regulations. However, the exchange of Hong Kong dollars with military currency and Central Reserve Bank notes was also announced on the same day in Public Notice No. 29. The exchange amount and import and export amount that do not require permission are set at 200 yuan, and the exchange rate is 18 yuan of Hong Kong military currency for 100 yuan of Central Reserve Bank notes. The exchange period for holders of Hong Kong dollars will end from the 10th to the 31st. Hong Kong dollar deposits will also be converted to military currency deposits. The settlement of general debts will also be based on military currency, and the exchange settlement ratio will be one to four. Such unification of currency within Hong Kong's jurisdiction will not only stabilize the economic circles under its jurisdiction, but will also be quite promising for the upward development of its capabilities in the future. Moreover, the fact that no premiums were applied this time when the circulation of Hong Kong dollars was banned is sufficient to demonstrate the Governor's Office's policy of adapting to the actual situation and respecting the people's sentiments.

### Chinese Stocks to Resume Operations Next Week

Yesterday, the Public Works Department suddenly sent personnel to the 15 Chinese stock companies that had already obtained licenses issued by the Shanghai Special City Economic Affairs Department to tear off the seals that had been affixed earlier. Most of the stock companies are now preparing to resume operations no later than Monday of next week. However, after the market opens, companies that have not been unsealed and do not have licenses will be treated as trustees and clients and are currently being discussed. The list of stock companies that have been unsealed is recorded below: Yongchang, Wufu, Xinfeng, Changxing, Wufeng, Xingye, Huashang, Xinfu, Baofeng, Cunde, Zhongguo, Changcheng, Dagong, Xinchang, Chengde

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks turned from strong to weak, because the prices had already been raised high on the afternoon of the last weekend, and soon they were suppressed by those who wanted to sell to cash out. The stock prices are still hovering within a narrow range. The official resumption of operations is approaching, and people's minds have stabilized. New pharmaceutical companies traded the most actively, with Xin Asia Pharmaceutical Factory being firm and unwavering. China-France Pharmacy was slightly sluggish. Department stores saw highs and slightly sold off. Wing On and Guohuo Companies saw slight gains, while Sincere Company was flat. Underwear rose slightly. Wing On Textile Factory rose slightly. Meiya Silk Factory traded well. The market was also firm. The transaction prices of the cultural industry's Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Bookstore were thin and stagnant. The public utilities Zhabei Water and Electricity and Huashang Electric are still falling, with supply exceeding demand. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company has not shaken off its sluggishness, and Great China Match is flat. Jiu'an Industrial has made slight progress.

### Fundamental Countermeasures to Eliminate Speculation (2)

— Xi Lin

(4) Comprehensive price limits should not be tolerated. Regional price limits in the past are no longer sufficient. Now that the restrictions on the movement of materials have been relaxed, comprehensive price limits are even more urgent. Because, due to the thorough investigation of hoarding and the limitation of prices, speculators will use the relaxation of the restrictions on the movement of materials to move materials to places with higher prices and looser controls. The movement of materials, in essence, is to destroy the control system. Therefore, the crackdown on hoarding and the limitation of prices should be consistent nationwide in order to be effective. Comprehensive price limits should be set by the National Government authorities based on the production cost of each material in its place of origin, so that all regions can use this as a standard, and they should also refer to the special sales conditions and freight costs in each region to make appropriate increases or decreases to serve as the official price in each region.

(5) The people's understanding of control and their cooperation in eliminating hoarding should not be ignored. The above four points all use the power of the government to eliminate hoarding. However, it is not enough to use only the power of the government to do this difficult work. In addition, we must rely on the cooperation of the people, so that the advancement can be smooth. For the people, we can say it in two ways: First, we must expand propaganda to make the people have a clear understanding of control in order to eliminate past misunderstandings. And actively encourage the people's patriotism. Make them understand the responsibilities that the people should bear in wartime. The psychological correction and the enrichment of recognition are also sufficient to reduce the occurrence of speculation and hoarding. Second, when speculation has gone crazy and national accumulation has become rampant, for the sake of thorough investigation, we must rely on the cooperation of the people. For this point, we should pay attention to the following points: (A) Strengthen the people's organization to strengthen the relationship between the government and the people; (B) Launch a "Hoarding Tiger Elimination Week" to guide the people to work together with the government and jointly participate in the struggle to eliminate hoarding; (C) Reward people's reporting; (D) Use the Baojia system to make people supervise each other, and let the Baojia head be responsible for investigating whether the inventory of each family exceeds normal needs. If hoarding or exceeding normal needs is found, it must be reported to the authorities, otherwise the Baojia head will also be severely punished. This is also of great help to the elimination of hoarding.

In short, speculative hoarding must be thoroughly eliminated and fundamentally eradicated, otherwise, not only will economic disturbances be unimaginable, but also in politics, there may be adverse consequences. We sincerely hope that the Changju will no longer ignore its seriousness and no longer have perfunctory and irresponsible actions such as "catching small fish and letting go of big fish."

### Don't Waste Yourself

— Yale

Malnutrition, poor mood, and various other factors can easily make people age, wither, and even die easily. This situation is especially serious after the war. But in addition to nutrition and mood, many people do not know how to cherish themselves, casually wasting their precious mental and physical strength, resulting in a decline in appearance and the full exposure of disease symptoms, which is also a common fact.

Since the rampant prevalence of hoarding and speculation, the atmosphere in the cities has become even more filled with decadence. Places of waste are everywhere, such as all-night mahjong games, hedonistic flower-sniffing and willow-seeking, and drunken revelry reminiscent of Li Bai... These kinds of things are commonplace among the wealthy, and even in ordinary gatherings, there is a frenzied atmosphere. Strictly speaking, this way of seeking pleasure at the expense of oneself is extremely harmful to the body and mind.

People who are full and warm all day long and have nothing to apply their minds to are inevitably addicted to their hobbies and used to lingering. They are especially prone to going down the road of waste. Although they have the money to eat nutritious food rich in vitamins and can often take supplements, for people who waste themselves on a daily basis, the supplementation and consumption offset each other, and in any case, it is "not worth the loss." This is because the result of waste will gradually numb your nerves, relax your muscles, and disrupt the normal function of your metabolism. No wonder, according to eugenics, people who are well-fed and well-dressed, because they "waste time and neglect their duties" and live a life of drunken stupor, are generally weak and incompetent in terms of their mental intelligence and physical strength.

A person's weakness and illness naturally have to do with congenital deficiencies or acquired imbalances, as well as complex factors such as economics. However, indifference to physical education, which promotes the average development and harmony of the body and mind, and never exercising, is also a major reason. As for those who not only do not pay attention to physical education but also casually waste their body and mind, the result of harming their ambitions and damaging their nature is even more boundless. We have seen some people who were originally healthy and strong and full of energy, but due to the influence of frequent waste, they became decadent and unrecognizable in less than a year or two. There are also young people who, after running a few more steps or climbing a few flights of stairs, will gasp for breath, and sometimes they will find it difficult to bend over and turn sideways to pick up things that have fallen on the ground. It is even more incomprehensible that they have formed an inexplicable connection with strange and bizarre diseases.

Although people who do not waste their body and mind may also have a pale complexion in form, this is probably due to having experienced hardships or "laboring their muscles and bones and afflicting their minds." Therefore, it does not matter if a person looks a little older in form, as long as they do not waste their body and mind and use their precious mental knowledge and abilities to benefit themselves and others, then they will feel at ease and justified, which is much better than those who are well-fed and well-dressed but are "outwardly strong but inwardly weak."

If the body and mind are not wasted but only exercised in youth, the spiritual vitality will definitely be abundant and vigorous, and there will definitely be great achievements. And if you reach old age, you can at least reduce a lot of pain in terms of mental and physical health. But to achieve this, you must have pure ideas, because only in this way can you recognize the "long-term significance."

### "Jealousy" and "Shooting Cold Arrows"

— Ji Wei Yi

"Jealousy" seems to have become a common ailment among people in society, taking deep root. Because of "jealousy," society does not know how many disputes and how many misfortunes have occurred. But "jealousy" still spreads widely.

"Jealous" people are often inferior to others (not absolutely).

People with heavy "jealous" hearts tend to be extremely concerned about other people's affairs. If others are unsuccessful, they will take a cold, hard look at it with an attitude of "rejoicing in misfortune." If others succeed and surpass them, then "jealousy" will arise. Usually, two kinds of results will occur.

The cause of "jealousy" is because of being inferior to others, so when they see the success of others, they will spontaneously develop a competitive heart, wanting to work hard to advance before others, or at least "keep pace." This is a positive and aboveboard result.

The other kind of result of "jealousy" is completely different. He tries hard to find some small mistake of the successful person, even if this mistake is as small as a hair. As long as he can "nitpick" and "talk nonsense," he will not hesitate to use despicable means to shoot a few cold arrows and slander others... This attitude is unacceptable.

We are young, we need a life full of "enthusiasm," and we need solemn faces that are kind and friendly. If when we first enter society, we see only cunning and sly faces that are neither smiling nor not smiling, it is natural that we will suffer a major setback.

Although a person always has to suffer some setbacks before success, this kind of deliberately formed obstacle is largely unnecessary under a sound system. If this world is full of "jealousy" in the form of "shooting cold arrows," what would this world become?

In a movie theater, two young men, properly spaced, occupied three seats, with one empty in the middle, with a sign on it.

Old men, strong men, young men, and children all asked in turn.

"Someone," they got the same answer. A pretty miss came over: "Is anyone sitting here..."

"No one, no one. Please sit, please sit." Quickly, gently, and unanimously.

### Knowledge and Action

— Zhen Qiao Ge

In the first paragraph of the second part of Hai Lun Jun's article in this journal on the 28th, it is written that "theory and fact are completely two different things," and it also says, "So we must develop the habit of saying and doing." Here, we have to add something.

Although, "having only theory and not working down to earth" will "never become a reality"; however, I believe that "simply working down to earth" without the guidance of "theory" is blind work. Perhaps there will be the hope of "when the mountains and rivers are exhausted and there seems to be no way out, willows are dark and flowers are bright, and another village appears," but this hope is too slim! The result of doing without theory is definitely small and will "be realized."

"Being able to do what you say" seems to be "beneath" the "scholars" (?) in China. Didn't Mr. Sun Yat-sen say, "It is difficult to know but easy to do"? Therefore, some "scholars" who believe that "everything is inferior, only studying is superior" consider themselves to be small "theorists." They are only responsible for the establishment of "theory" and not responsible for the responsibility of practice. "Action" should belong to the farmers, merchants, workers, and soldiers who are "everything is inferior"! Therefore, all meaningful movements are "only heard the sound of the floorboards, but no one is seen coming down." Regarding what Mr. Sun Yat-sen said about "it is difficult to know but easy to do," we must recognize that Mr. Sun Yat-sen told us that after we know—that is, after the "theory" is established—as long as we are willing to work hard and are willing to sacrifice, things will definitely succeed; however, it does not mean that after we know, things will naturally succeed! This point, we cannot not recognize!

Therefore, theory is the basis of practice, but practice must be attached to theory. Therefore, we must turn "theory and fact" into one thing, that is, "say and do," which is also Wang Yangming's "unity of knowledge and action."

### Respect Women

— Yu Huai Rui

In a crowded tram, a young man sat sideways, leisurely looking at the city streets outside the window.

A frail old man, pleadingly smiled: "Sir, can you please move over a little?"

"Look, how can I squeeze in!" The reply was full of impatience.

The car stopped, and a beautiful miss came up.

The young man stood up suddenly, and with an ingratiating smile: "Miss, please sit down."

At the side of a not-very-wide escalator in a certain building, Xiao Zhang and Lao Huang were preparing to step up when a pretty miss came up behind them. Xiao Zhang pulled Lao Huang to the side very politely.

Lao Huang: "What's wrong? Have you broken your creed of 'first come, first served' that you have always followed today?"

Xiao Zhang: "Fool, I can enjoy the scenery... let my eyes eat ice cream!"

Lao Huang: "Um..."

### The Family Life of a Salaried Class

— Jian Qing

The changes of the great era, like a drama, become more and more tense as it plays out. Those who make a fortune from the nation's troubles, and those greedy and insatiable hoarders and manipulators, each use their skills, performing one trick after another with great enthusiasm, exceeding all limits. However, for the salaried class, it is already extremely difficult. With a fixed income, they struggle to cope with the infinitely rising black market, barely making ends meet, living beyond their means. Savings are out of the question, as the so-called "good times get better, hard times get harder." In the past, I transitioned from business to politics, only to encounter a disaster that left me with nothing. In the spring of the twenty-seventh year [of the Republic, i.e., 1938], I moved from my hometown to Shanghai, relying on others. My income barely covered my expenses. Four years ago, living in Shanghai with a family of seven, we could still afford to hire a maid, which was just enough to maintain a basic standard of living. In recent years, the cost of living in Shanghai has skyrocketed, and our family has grown by two, naturally increasing the burden of clothing and food. We dismissed the maid long ago, and I struggle with household chores myself, getting up before dawn, sweeping and washing dishes, starting the stove, and folding quilts. Everyone, young and old, cooperates and shares the work. After the children finish their tasks, they wash, have breakfast, and go to school. We instill in them the spirit of endurance and hard work from a young age. On my part, I am frugal and cautious, never daring to indulge in smoking, drinking, gambling, or prostitution. I have no time to frequent entertainment venues. I am heavily burdened by the pressures of making a living in this era. Even though my monthly salary is now 1,200 yuan, it is difficult to manage and often feels like robbing Peter to pay Paul when trying to cover family expenses. Food alone accounts for 70% of my monthly salary (because the monthly ration of rice for urban residents does not meet our needs, and we must buy an additional eight dou [approximately 80 liters] of black market rice each month). Daily vegetables, oil, sugar, and miscellaneous expenses account for 55%. Rent and school fees account for 15% (four children in school). Socializing, purchases, and medical expenses are not fixed monthly, averaging about 30%.

Based on the above allocation, and by stretching and patching things together, I still run a deficit of 700 to 800 yuan each month. However, I dare not show weakness to my relatives and friends, at least not outwardly. The pain of hidden poverty, how can it be expressed? I imagine that many salaried people share the same lament. I still remember when I lived in the capital, with a family of six and two servants, eight people in total, my monthly income was only one or two hundred yuan, yet we lived comfortably and felt at ease. I truly can't bear to look back. All I can do is sigh helplessly. (No compensation received).

### An Overview of the Relief Work of the Shanghai Municipal Poverty and Sickness Relief Association

Currently, prices are soaring, and life is becoming increasingly difficult. The various charitable organizations in the city are operating many shelters and care institutions, with a large number of people eagerly awaiting food, some even facing starvation. The urgency of the situation is beyond what ordinary people can imagine. We sincerely hope that leaders from all industries and philanthropists from all walks of life will quickly contribute donations to support this good cause, so that the Association can continue to carry out its subsidy and relief work, allowing the remaining population after the war to avoid starvation. Saving the people and saving the nation, how can the merits be measured?
