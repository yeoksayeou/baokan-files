### International New Situation and East Asia

More than a week has passed since Roosevelt and Churchill concluded their meeting in Quebec, and the situation in Europe is still undergoing subtle evolutions. Militarily, since the shift of Axis forces in Sicily and Kharkov, both sides are preparing for the second phase of the war. The center of gravity of the Eastern Front is moving south, with the Soviet army clearly advancing into the heart of Ukraine, especially vying for control of the Black Sea. Because if these two moves are secured, they are prerequisites for dominating the Balkan Peninsula. However, here it will encounter not only the German military's steel hammer but also the Anglo-American iron tongs. That is to say, there will be not only military but also political resistance.

Secondly, on the Western Front, the retreat of Axis forces from Sicily has created a new situation, which is not the continued advance of the Anglo-American forces, but the consolidation of the Axis forces' defense capabilities in Italy. Undoubtedly, the lull in the fighting is what the Axis forces hope for. The more days the Anglo-Americans hesitate, the more days the Axis forces have to prepare. However, to blame the Anglo-Americans for not opening a second front in the west, as the Soviet Union does, is somewhat impatient and morbid, because the Anglo-Americans are planning for their own hegemony, not for the Soviet Union. Their ambition also lies in the struggle for the Balkans; they are even more afraid of being communized. Thus, the Western Front has fallen into a temporary lull again, and the troops in North Africa and the Mediterranean are stirring. There are even rumors of a shift eastward.

The contradictions in the strategies of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union caused the much-anticipated Quebec Conference to end with an unnatural announcement. The focus of the contradiction is definitely not the issue of Europe first or the Pacific first, as claimed in their communique, but only the location, timing, and strategic issues of the so-called second battlefield. In terms of location, although the Soviet government has never made any public statement, its newspapers and magazines have published strategic articles by well-known military commentators. They do not recognize the battles in North Africa and Sicily as the second front, and even deny in advance that the attack on mainland Italy is the second front. They believe that only an offensive centered on London, towards France, Belgium, the Netherlands, or Denmark, is the most ideal second front, paying particular attention to the direction of the offensive across the not-very-wide English Channel. But Britain does not recognize these, and they believe that it is best to advance towards the Balkans. As for strategy, the Soviet side has repeatedly stated that indiscriminate bombing from the air cannot determine the outcome of the war and that an invasion of the mainland is necessary; the Anglo-Americans, on the contrary, believe that a large-scale advance is only possible if it is towards the Balkans. In terms of timing, the Soviet Union advocates opening the Western Front immediately, while the Anglo-Americans believe that mainland operations cannot be spoken of rashly until next year.

We should point out that, to this day, the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union are indeed trending towards intensification. However, they are still limited to the above-mentioned political and strategic conflicts. There has been no complete rift in the overall operational policy. Therefore, to declare the breakdown of the three-nation relationship when the Soviet Union withdrew Maisky and Litvinov is premature. Today, it is only natural for the United States and Britain to begin guarding against the Soviet Union, and it is also inevitable for the Soviet Union to use the summer offensive to conduct communist diplomacy. However, given Britain's own weakness and the United States' concerns about being attacked on both the eastern and western fronts, it is clear that the masters of Downing Street and the White House today have no choice but to accommodate the Soviet Union. Eden hurriedly tracked Maisky to London in Cairo, and Davis also rushed to participate in the Eden-Maisky talks. Under the pressure of the overall situation, the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries seem to be finding a temporary compromise. Therefore, the Axis countries' warriors should not focus their attention on the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union. Instead, they must raise their vigilance, use the enemy's contradictions to buy time, and prepare for the decisive battle.

In the communique of the Quebec Conference, which was hastily released during the development of the contradictions between the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union, it was actually declared that the focus of this meeting was to discuss a "major counter-offensive in the Pacific." Anyone with a little common sense knows that this is a new type of diplomatic rhetoric, because if you really want to do something, no one would disclose their strategy to the other party! However, we cannot completely ignore the meaning behind this announcement. First, this announcement by the United States and Britain can, to some extent, appease the Soviet Union's anger at the United States and Britain's delay in opening a second front, and pave the way for opening up new channels for three-party negotiations. Second, at a time when the fighting power of the Chongqing side is weakening and the fighting spirit is declining, this announcement can, to some extent, dispel some pessimistic and disappointed emotions. Third, the rainy season in Myanmar is about to end, and the Japanese army may break through the gates of India at any time. Chandra Bose is leading the Indian Independence Army, preparing to fight for the restoration of India. The hearts of the Indian people are restless. This declaration also contains the effect of frightening and suppressing India.

In fact, the so-called counter-offensive in the Pacific by the United States has been constantly attempted since last autumn. However, in addition to the sacrifices of the fleet and air force, it is still confined between the gates of Australia, and has not been able to cross the Solomon Islands and New Guinea. Especially today, with the military assistance of friendly Japan's diplomatic and political battles, the gradual realization of our country's sovereign integrity, the restoration of Thailand's homeland, the success of Burma's independence, the participation of East Indian natives in politics, the preparation for the independence of the Philippines, and cooperation in the Indian national liberation movement, all of these facts are the greatest guarantee for the stability of the Greater East Asia situation. The support of the people's hearts is truly what is meant by "the three armies can be deprived of their commander, but a common man cannot be deprived of his will." Even if the United States plots a counter-offensive by force, can it break the unity of the East Asian nations today? Although, with the United States' years of operation of the Alaskan Highway, its war preparations for the Aleutian Islands, its recent military activities in India, and its use of Chongqing's air force bases, we cannot underestimate the activities of these forces. Eliminating the idea of complacency, boosting the fighting spirit, uniting the 1.1 billion compatriots of Asia, sacrificing and struggling, and striving for the victory of the East Asian national liberation war should be our highest goal today.

### The Central Government Solemnly Commemorates the Martyrs Who Sacrificed Themselves for the Peace Movement; Chairman Wang Reports on the Significance of Commemorating the Martyrs

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - September 1st is the Commemoration Day for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement. In addition to flying flags at half-mast to express grief, the central government held a solemn Commemoration Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement in the Grand Auditorium of the National Government at 9:00 a.m. today. Present were the heads of the various departments, ministries, commissions, and agencies of the National Government, as well as the members of the Executive and Supervisory Committees of the Central Party Headquarters. On the rostrum were the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation, and there was a shared table. On the shared table were the spirit tablets and flower baskets of the martyrs of the Peace Movement. Flowers were placed in front of the stage, creating a solemn and dignified atmosphere. At 9:00 a.m. sharp, the solemn ceremony began. After the Chairman took his seat, everyone stood at attention and sang the national anthem in unison. Then, they paid the highest respects to the national flag and the portrait of the founding father of the nation. After the Chairman respectfully read the will of the founding father of the nation, he led everyone in bowing to the spirit tablets of the martyrs of the Peace Movement to express their condolences and observed a moment of silence to express their grief, and respectfully presented flower wreaths. At that moment, mournful music was played in unison, and the auditorium was filled with a solemn atmosphere. After the music stopped, the Chairman reported on the significance of commemorating the martyrs of the Peace Movement. Xu Wenguan read the speech on his behalf, and the words were poignant, inspiring the entire audience. Finally, the Commemoration Song of the Martyrs of the Peace Movement was played. At about 11:00 a.m., this solemn ceremony ended in mournful music.

Original Text of Chairman Wang's Speech, Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - At 9:00 a.m. this morning, the central government held the Commemoration Ceremony for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement in the Grand Auditorium of the National Government. Chairman Wang led the officials from various departments, ministries, and commissions in holding the ceremony and delivered a speech. Because the Chairman had a slight stomachache and sore throat, he asked Chief Secretary Xu Wen to read the speech on his behalf. The full text of the original speech is as follows:

Since the first National Commemoration Meeting for the Martyrs of the Peace Movement was held on this day in the 29th year of the Republic, today is the fourth time. Recalling the past, examining the present, and looking forward to the future, I feel very excited in addition to grief.

The martyrs of the Peace Movement devoted their hearts and souls to the Peace Movement, and then gave their lives for it. They based their actions on the highest ideal and the strongest belief, using them as the guiding principles. What are these ideals and beliefs? They are the founding father of the nation's Great Asianism. The martyrs of the Peace Movement knew that there was no other way to revive China and revive East Asia. To realize Great Asianism, China must work hard itself. Because if China cannot work hard to achieve independence and freedom, it will not be qualified to share the responsibility of East Asia. At the same time, in addition to its own efforts, China must also cooperate with Japan. Because Japan is an advanced country in East Asia, China must stand on the same line with Japan and move in the same direction. Even if disputes arise temporarily due to inconsistent military and diplomatic policies, efforts must be made to improve the situation so that they can jointly deal with the enemies who invade East Asia, the British and American imperialists.

The above is the noble ideal and firm belief shared by every martyr. At the beginning of the Peace Movement, the people of the country could not understand this ideal and belief, and therefore encountered many hardships. As a result, many martyrs sacrificed themselves. The comrades who died later followed in the blood-stained footsteps of the martyrs and continued to struggle, moving forward step by step. On January 9th of this year, China participated in the Greater East Asia War, which means that China and Japan are already standing on the same line and are moving forward hand in hand in the same direction. This is what patriots of the two countries have been seeking day and night for decades. Having achieved it today, we are willing to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Peace Movement with the utmost sincerity and respect.

At the same time, in order to fulfill its promise to assist China in achieving independence, friendly Japan signed an agreement with China on January 9th of this year, returning the concessions ahead of schedule and abolishing extraterritoriality. By August 1st, there were no more concessions in the entire country, and the abolition of extraterritoriality had also begun. Reviving China and reviving East Asia are one and the same thing, which is further proof of this. Today, we are willing to comfort the spirits of the martyrs of the Peace Movement with the utmost sincerity and respect.

The hardships and obstacles of the past were fully experienced by the martyrs of the Peace Movement, who sacrificed themselves one after another and still illuminate us with their spiritual light, allowing us to be encouraged to move forward. Our hearts are connected to the hearts of the martyrs of the Peace Movement from afar, without a moment of interruption. Today, the understanding of peace among the people is gradually becoming widespread, and the number of troops returning is also gradually increasing. We believe that overall peace will be realized sooner or later, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War will be achieved sooner or later. We can only follow the road illuminated by the martyrs of the Peace Movement with a spirit of perseverance, hard work, courage, and diligence, and move forward.

The atmosphere was tense and enthusiastic, and the meeting closed at 10:00 a.m.

### Chairman Wang Declares for the Government's Purchase of Yarn and Cloth; Deadline for Applying for Sale is Approaching

Nanjing, 1st (Central News Agency) - In order to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, the National Government previously approved the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth at the 174th meeting of the Executive Yuan, with a deadline of the 15th. After the deadline, the goods will be confiscated according to law. The Executive Yuan ordered the National Commercial Control Council to comply with the order. After receiving the order, the Commercial Control Council issued a notice through the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office, setting August 27th as the starting date for the work and handling the supplementary registration, and in accordance with the order of the Executive Yuan, decided to close the registration on September 6th, with no further extension. Now that the deadline is approaching, Wang Jian, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan, issued a second statement to reiterate the government's determination to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, as follows:

On the 9th of last month, the government decided to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, purely for the purpose of suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood. The interests of legitimate holders of cotton yarn and cloth have also been taken into account. In addition to setting a price, the key points of the statement issued by the head of the purchasing office are as follows: At that time, the black market price of 20-count yarn was as high as 40,000 yuan per package, and other yarns and cloths were similar. It was impossible for ordinary people to buy a bolt of cotton cloth at the official price. The hardship can be imagined. Because of this, cotton yarn and cloth were no longer daily necessities for the people, but were used by speculators. Production stagnated and the economic situation became precarious. The government has long wanted to implement a purchase policy, but the only consideration is that if a large amount of national currency is used for the purchase, there will inevitably be a panic of currency inflation in the market. Fortunately, friendly Japan, in view of this difficulty, provided strong assistance, and it was decided to use half gold and half national currency for the purchase. In this way, the panic of currency inflation can be avoided, and the merchants will benefit more from receiving gold. The price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count yarn may seem too low, but it should be known that the 40,000 yuan in the black market is actually an illegitimate profit, which is difficult to satisfy. At that time, the black market price of each tael of gold was as high as 120,000 yuan. Now, the program has decided that each tael of ten taels is only 40,000 yuan, which means that the price of 10,000 yuan for 20-count yarn is actually higher than 10,000 yuan. Perhaps merchants have insufficient capital and find it difficult to make deliveries in installments. It should be known that if deliveries are not made in installments, the drawbacks of currency inflation will still be difficult to avoid, and the public interest must be taken as the priority. Or it may be feared that the government will abuse the cotton yarn and cloth after purchasing it. It should be known that the government is implementing this policy for the sake of economic revival, using it domestically to purchase food, cotton, and other industrial raw materials, and externally following the principle of barter trade to obtain soybeans, rice, and other grains. In this way, the people's food can be adjusted, and agriculture and industry can be revitalized, which is of great significance. Based on the above, it can be seen that the policy of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth is related to the national interest and the people's welfare. The government will implement it quickly and effectively with the greatest determination. A supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth has been carried out to alleviate the difficulties of merchants, with a deadline of the 15th, which will end on the 6th of this month. A special telegram was sent to the National Commercial Control Council on that day, reiterating the determination not to extend the deadline. The deadline for applying to sell cotton cloth is also the 6th of this month. It is heard that some people are still taking a wait-and-see attitude, hoping for another extension. This is actually due to insufficient understanding. Therefore, I solemnly declare that I hope that our merchants will take the overall situation as the priority, abandon personal opinions, assist the government in implementing the policy, and handle the application for sale procedures before the 6th of this month. Do not think that there is still a possibility of extension, so as not to harm yourself and the overall situation. Concurrently, President of the Executive Yuan Wang Zhaoming.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in Henan

Kaifeng, 1st (Central News Agency) - From the 21st to the 14th, the Japanese army attacked and attempted to subvert the Qian Xuezhong unit of the Chongqing army, the 51st Army Independent Regiment, with 1,500 people, 150 kilometers southeast of Guide County, Henan. The oversea troops left 205 corpses, including one battalion commander, and 80 were captured. The Japanese army captured two heavy machine guns, nine light machine guns, and one hundred and sixty-one rifles.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Italian Cities

Rome, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Italian military headquarters announced in its war report today that enemy aircraft carried out drought in Salpica, Pescara, Salerno, and Koshenchai yesterday, causing heavy losses and sufficient civilian casualties.

### Fierce Air Battle Over Bogenville; Half of 50 Enemy Aircraft Lost

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - On the 30th, the enemy forces in the Solomon Islands used a combined formation of approximately 50 fighter-bombers to attack the eastern end of Bogenville Island. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, and a fierce air battle ensued. Twenty enemy unified-style B24 bombers and Bell P/39 Porter-Szigoski (B4U) fighters were shot down and many others were damaged and repelled. The Japanese side lost two aircraft in this battle.

Tokyo, 1st (Central News Agency) - The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 6:15 p.m. on the 1st that multiple enemy aircraft attacked Minami-Tori Island (formerly known as Marcus Island) at dawn today, and enemy ships also shelled the land.

### Situation Extremely Tense on Various Parts of the Eastern European Front; German Army Conducts Effective Defensive Warfare

Stockholm, Sweden, 1st (Central News Agency) - After the German army withdrew from important strongholds such as Kharkov, Afgulga, and Taigandrog, the situation in the southern region of the Eastern Front became tense. Taking advantage of the German army's shortening of the front line, the Soviet army launched major offensives west of Kursk in Sefsk and west of Vyazma. Currently, they are repeatedly attacking the new German defense lines in Smolensk, Bryansk, Poltava, Krasnodar, Stalingrad, and Mavepo, engaging in fierce battles with the German army. The Soviet Union's war report on the 31st stated that the Soviet army in the Smolensk area broke through part of the enemy's defense line and occupied Yermovo, an important transportation hub 45 kilometers east of Smolensk, on the 31st, and continued to attack west and southwest of Kharkov. According to German news reports, the German side stated that the German army was conducting an effective defensive war against the superior Soviet army on the entire line, so it is still unclear where the Soviet army has advanced. According to a United Press International report from Moscow, the Soviet army in the Sefsk area had advanced 60 miles west of Kursk to Rylsk and Glukhiv on the 30th, penetrating northern Ukraine. It was also said that the German army's counter-offensive west and southwest of Kharkov was extremely fierce, preventing the Soviet army from advancing. The Soviet army in the Stalingrad area had great difficulty in breaking through the German army's meticulous defenses.

Germany Concentrates Large Forces to Reinforce Coastal Areas

Berlin, 1st (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities stated that in order to conserve manpower, the German army on the Eastern Front sometimes makes regional advances. Therefore, the German command was able to concentrate its forces in other parts of Europe, guarding against all unforeseen events in the coastal areas of Europe. However, this does not mean withdrawing forces from the Eastern Front. Rather, a large portion of the newly formed elite units within Germany over the past six months were transported to the Eastern Front and deployed in various parts of the European continent. Moreover, these units are highly mechanized and can be transported to the Eastern Front immediately if necessary. Therefore, the German command can successfully conduct defensive warfare with just the reserves on the Eastern Front and does not need assistance from Western Europe. Therefore, the success of the German army's defensive war on the Eastern Front further increases its importance.

### Churchill Delivers Broadcast Speech in Quebec; Strongly Advocates Convening a Three-Nation Conference

Buenos Aires, Argentina, 1st (Central News Agency) - British Prime Minister Churchill gave a broadcast speech to the world in Quebec on the evening of the 31st of last month, focusing on pleasing the Soviet Union and Stalin throughout. In his broadcast, he strongly advocated holding a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The gist of his speech is as follows: The Quebec Conference was mostly focused on strengthening the war against Japan. However, since the Soviet government still has a neutrality treaty with the Japanese government, the British and American governments have not yet decided whether to invite Chairman Stalin to the meeting. However, holding a three-person meeting with Chairman Stalin is what President Roosevelt and I urgently hope for. The fact that a three-person meeting has not been held in the past is by no means because the British and American governments have not made every effort. Rather, it is because Chairman Stalin must personally direct the Soviet army's operations on the Eastern Front and cannot easily leave his country. However, President Roosevelt and I both believe that not only should a meeting of the foreign ministers of Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union be convened to review various important issues, but also a meeting of the heads of the three countries is necessary. Moreover, it is absolutely necessary to make the opinions of the United States, Britain, and the Soviet Union increasingly consistent. Churchill also mentioned the Soviet Union's request to establish a second front, saying that the Soviets had asked the British and American governments to shoulder half of the burden. They were angered and dissatisfied and criticized the fact that the second front had not yet been established, and I did not make any accusations against the Soviet Union. In addition, he said that, apart from the second front, the North African campaign would inevitably be regarded as an extremely treacherous campaign. The American, Australian, and New Zealand armies were fighting the Japanese army in the Pacific, but the important task in the Indian theater would be borne by the British army. The joint operations command composed of the naval, land, and air forces of the British and American armies would definitely achieve its intended purpose. Finally, Churchill said that he was considering it and predicted that the air offensive against Germany would be intensified in the coming days, but he refused to predict the end date of the war, as such speculative speculation was of no benefit to the war effort.

Maisky and Eden Held Another Long Talk Yesterday

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to reports from London, Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Maisky, who was in London to bid farewell to the British government, had a long talk with British Foreign Secretary Eden yesterday. It is believed that this was related to the results of the Quebec Conference and preparations for a three-party conference to be held in London or Moscow. Maisky returned to London on Saturday evening and had a private meeting with Eden once before making an official visit yesterday.

### Resignation of the Danish Government to the King; Failure of Indirect Strategy between Britain and America

Berlin, Central News Agency, 1st – According to a report from the Hutung News Agency: Well-informed sources here confirmed yesterday that the Danish government has submitted its resignation to King Christian. The Danish government has instructed all officials to continue performing their duties as usual for the sake of the nation’s interests. There is currently no need to establish military tribunals based on martial law. The German special envoy, Best, is still in Denmark. Regarding the recent unrest in Denmark, the Foreign Ministry is paying close attention to the British side’s statements and the response from British authorities concerning whether British or Danish paratroopers landed in Denmark. The response stated that the matter concerns military affairs and must be kept secret. Based on this, the British side’s refusal to clarify is tantamount to acknowledging that foreign secret agents are indirectly or directly responsible for the unrest in Denmark. On August 28, a spokesman for the BBC, Lesay, made a similar admission, saying that the recent increase in strikes in Denmark was due to the help of British paratroopers. The London "Star" also said that the outbreak of assistance to Denmark was still premature. The BBC spokesman later added that the recent unrest in Denmark was almost the first link in the chain of a planned uprising in the German-occupied territories, and the date of its launch was set by the Allied Command. German Foreign Ministry officials continued that the Danish incident was indeed premature, and the German authorities were able to thwart the Allied plan in time. People here believe that this plan is the "indirect strategy" advocated by the "Daily Telegraph" on August 30. Its purpose is as follows: to intimidate civilians; Britain wants to carry out its traditional policy of enticing people from other countries to fight for it; and to incite people to disregard danger and take hostile actions against the occupying authorities.

### New Situation in the Atlantic War: Improvement in Submarine Defense Warfare

According to recent joint announcements by the British and American sides, the number of German submarines sunk by Britain and America between May, June, and July was described as "the best record since the beginning of the war." According to their announcement, the number of British and American ships sunk by submarines in the eight months since January of this year has decreased by one-half compared to the second half of last year, and by one-quarter compared to the first half. Another enemy propaganda claim stated that 2,500 ships were used in the Sicilian landing campaign in the Atlantic and Mediterranean, of which only one million tons were sunk by submarines. British and American authorities are jubilantly saying, "The greatest threat from enemy submarines has now been lifted. The surge in ship production this year is expected to exceed the number of sinkings."

Of course, their propaganda cannot be fully trusted. However, in the "Atlantic War," German submarines are considered to be temporarily in a difficult battle, and in recent months, they have not been as active as before. This is often pointed out by German naval personnel themselves. So, where does this difficult battle come from?

New Convoy System

Simply put, it is because the enemy has strengthened air attacks. Currently, the German army is being forced into a difficult battle in the British and American bombing of Germany, on the Mediterranean front, and on the Eastern front. The biggest reason for this seems to be aircraft, and the new situation in the "Atlantic War" now also seems to be due to aircraft. In any case, submarine warfare is ultimately one of Germany's greatest weapons. German Navy Commander-in-Chief Dönitz said at a banquet this spring: "That (referring to submarine warfare) may not have immediate effects, but it is unknowable; but a little bit of bleeding can lead to death. Similarly, submarine warfare can reduce the enemy's strength and make the enemy surrender." The enemy feels a headache about this danger, and since the beginning of the war, they have racked their brains for countermeasures to deal with submarines. As a result, a new escort system that began to be implemented at the end of last year has emerged. From North America across the Atlantic to the British mainland, aircraft closely escort at any time and any place. This is considered by the British as a 'base-to-base' system. Large-scale implementation of aircraft escort on submarine warfare began at the beginning of this year. This is only possible with the mass production of aircraft and the construction of small aircraft carriers.

The core of the new escort system, correctly speaking, lies in these small aircraft carriers rather than aircraft. When the initial convoy departed from North America, it was escorted by new aircraft such as the Ventura, Hudson, and Liberator belonging to the US and Canadian Air Forces from the aircraft base near Nova Scotia, but they could not patrol beyond 900 kilometers from the coast. Similarly, the Sunderland, Halifax, and Liberator aircraft dispatched from the British coast to meet them are also limited to the above-mentioned distance. Thus, the 800 to 950 kilometer section in the middle of the Atlantic is a kind of gap in air escort. Filling this gap is the job of small aircraft carriers. The arrangement of the convoy is as follows:

Merchant ships are located in the center of the convoy, with a small aircraft carrier attached. Outside of this, destroyers, submarine chasers, and other escort ships are assigned. Outside of them, a second row of escort ships is attached. Sunderland Catalina-class aircraft often fly from small aircraft carriers to patrol for the appearance of submarines.

Submarine Offensive and Defensive Warfare

In the defensive warfare of submarines, attention must also be paid to the technological improvements of Britain and America, such as the improvement of escort destroyers, or the direction-finding equipment equipped by destroyers to counter Saaland-style submarines, or the use of helicopters (vertical take-off aircraft) to attack submarines, etc. In short, the British and American total mobilization of productivity and technological power have gradually escaped the fatal threat of submarines today. If Germany can come up with a new weapon or new method to defeat this British and American escort system, then this situation will simply change. But at present, what Germany should strive for first is to maintain the production of one ship a day without interruption, and second, to do its best to train submarine crew members. There is no need to elaborate on the necessity of greatly supplementing these crew members now. The German authorities recently claimed: "We have now come up with new methods to counter British and American escort ships." We trust this statement, and we are waiting for Britain and America to once again cry out "Crisis is coming!" in the "Atlantic War!" (Xiang: Translated from the August 25 "Asahi Shimbun".)

### Reorganization of the First Police Bureau: Re-division of Precinct Jurisdictions

(2) Sales between retailers are not regarded as retail sales. (3) When entrusted to sell, if the trustee is responsible and plans the commission, it should be calculated based on the actual number of the trustee. If the entruster is responsible and allows the trustee to rent a shop, it should be calculated based on the actual number of the entruster. (4) The amount of the goods that the applicant hopes to be exempt from purchase, such as the amount entered in the "Applicant's hope to exempt from purchase" column on the store application form, shall not exceed the average monthly amount of retail sales in the first half of this year.

Report on the actual number of manufacturing and processing (B); Manufacturing and processing enterprises use the actual number report form (i.e., the factory application form).

### Miscellaneous Grain Household Powder on Sale Starting Today

Change of Operation Agency for Household Rice; Business Control Association and Municipal Business Association in Consultation

Datong News Agency reported: Rice shops in the 182 district obtained miscellaneous grain sales orders from the Rice and Flour Allocation Section yesterday, and have exchanged them for warehouse orders. They are picking up goods from Shunfeng, Hengkang, Hengyi, Huang Changshun, and other rice mills. They can be sold universally today. Each person can purchase half a liter of barley, sorghum, naked barley, red grain, or corn with the second ticket of the miscellaneous grain purchase certificate, paying a price of two yuan in Central Reserve Bank coupons. The household powder for the 46th period is all No. 2 flour, designated to be picked up from the Yuxin Second Factory on West Suzhou Road and the Fufeng Factory on Moganshan Road. It has been on sale since today. One and a half catties can be purchased with the 46th period flour purchase certificate, paying a price of ten yuan and five jiao in Central Reserve Bank coupons. As for the household rice for the 46th period, due to the change of the rice and grain operation agency, the Business Control Association and the Municipal Business Association are in consultation on the transportation method. With the cooperation of reputable people, the food problem of the city can be restored to normal.

Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company to Be Dissolved; After the Sixth Materials Control Review Committee decided to transfer the rice and grain purchase agency and assign all matters related to rice and grain purchase to the food special agency organized by the Business Control Association, the current Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company will be dissolved. After the approval of the Executive Yuan meeting, a clear order will be issued. The Commercial News Agency learned from relevant parties that at the beginning of the organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, the relevant authorities originally intended to entrust the company with full power over food purchases. However, after the organization was established, the company, on the one hand, was unable to undertake this major mission due to its own capabilities, and on the other hand, the joint ventures in various places encountered resistance in purchasing and were unable to advance their work according to plan. At the same time, due to the backward culture of Chinese businessmen and the lack of unity, the organization of joint ventures in various places was unsound. For these various reasons, the organization of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company was reduced to a formality. The Materials Control Review Committee, in view of this, decided to place all the powers of food purchase and allocation with the Business Control Association and organize a specialized agency to handle it. As for the Southern Control Association's organization of a food special agency, it will generally follow the organization of professional committees such as flour, wheat, and cotton, absorbing Chinese and Japanese businessmen to make them one piece. The person in charge of this special agency is said to have been internally designated as Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the Shanghai Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

### Methods for Collecting and Penalizing Delinquent Income Tax

Since the return of the two concessions, the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of Income Tax of the Ministry of Finance has been actively promoting various taxes. From January to mid-July of this year, it collected more than 20 million yuan, which is several times more than in the past, and can continue to increase in the future. The bureau found that some businesses in the first category of management profit and business income tax have not yet filed and paid. It has selected staff to conduct door-to-door inspections and collections by street and industry. If the businesses delay in filing, make false and concealed reports, or refuse to check accounts, they will violate the provisions of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax. The bureau has decided to determine the amount of tax payable and report it to the judicial authorities to enforce the enforcement rules for collecting and penalizing income tax. Once the tax amount is determined, it should be paid within the time limit. If the tax is owed and not paid, a fine of more than one time the amount of tax owed will be imposed. At the same time, the bureau has now agreed with the courts in the city to implement the method of penalizing and collecting. Now that the two concessions have been recovered, it is also planning to collect income tax from foreign merchants. It is expected that this tax revenue will definitely be considerable in the future.

### A Visit to the New Society of Wandering Daughters: Mother of God Convent, Part One

Orphanage · Elementary School · Education and Upbringing Combined

Clinic · Celebration Hall · Helping the Poor and Educating the Community

At the intersection of Yangshupu Road and Ningwu Road, surrounded by factories of all sizes, stand quietly two Western-style buildings with red roofs, making them appear so bright and magnificent against the blue sky dotted with white clouds! This is the new society for wandering daughters that we are introducing to our readers today – the Mother of God Convent.

Mother of God Society – An Extraordinary History

Mother of God Society's China District First Chairwoman, Mother of God is a female religious figure full of love for people and with a calm mind and talent for handling affairs. Talking about the history of the Mother of God Society is fascinating.

In the nineteenth century, after the Industrial Revolution in European countries, the monster of capitalism began to run rampant in the world, driving hundreds of thousands of civilians to factories, leaving their children uncared for in poor streets and alleys. These wandering children lost the opportunity to receive education and upbringing from an early age. When the children's parents had their sweat squeezed out of them and returned with tired skin and resentment, what family fun could they give to their children? In this society and environment, children died, wandered, and even committed wrongdoing, becoming a source of disaster for the country and society. This situation slowly spread throughout Europe, to Asia, and many other places. The defect of this human world could not be filled, and the cries of wandering children were everywhere!

At that time, there was a great Italian saint of the previous century, Father John Bosco, who struggled out of poverty and displacement. He came from the wandering masses and deeply understood the suffering of wandering children. He also understood that wandering children possess unlimited talent, causing unlimited losses to society. He was unwilling to have limited strength, so he "saved poverty with poverty," striving to help wandering children, giving them the necessary education, freeing them from the sea of wandering, and seeing the great road to human rebirth. From then on, the nurturing Father Bosco Young People's Association soon spread to countries all over the world.

Among the wandering children, girls suffered the most. There were also many orphaned female factory workers whose power to survive was even weaker, so the situation was even more tragic. Therefore, Saint John Bosco established a convent, led by the female religious figure Maria Mazzarello, dedicated to the education and upbringing of wandering daughters. This happened in 1872. That female religious education cause has changed countless poor girls and women who used to wander without support into good and promising members of society. The disabled were taken care of, and the sick were treated. It attracted the attention of people in society, gained publicity, and generous assistance from philanthropists. Mother Maria Mazzarello and the members worked even more diligently, and the cause developed. At first, it was only in Turin, Italy, but soon it spread to various countries in Europe, America, Asia, and Africa. Almost everywhere there was a Salesian Association of Don Bosco, there would also be a Mother of God Society. Recently, the number of members has increased to more than 12,000, and there are more than 800 convents.

### Temporary Increase in Tuition Fees; Subsidies Cannot be Changed

Impoverished Students Eager to Study; Hoping Schools Will Provide Convenience

As the fifth round of the newspaper's student aid fund is about to end, a few students have sent letters, complaining that schools have suddenly announced a temporary increase in tuition fees, which is difficult for impoverished parents to afford. The staff of the newspaper's student aid fund office sends their sincere sympathy, but the procedures for requesting an increase in funding are complicated, and they cannot favor one over another. The subsidy funds have a fixed amount, so they cannot approve the increase for each student, for which they are deeply sorry. They hope that the schools that have temporarily increased tuition fees can understand the eagerness of impoverished students to study and provide them with convenience, which would be a great benefit to impoverished students and a contribution to society.

Preferential Treatment for Books

To reduce the burden on impoverished students, major bookstores in the city, such as Commercial Press, China Bookstore, World Bookstore, Datong Bookstore, and Kaiming Bookstore, will jointly donate coupons for a 10% discount on books purchased by students approved by both this newspaper and the Xin Shen Daily. They are currently being printed and will be distributed as soon as they are ready.

Donations Received Yesterday

Yesterday, the newspaper received 2,000 yuan from Teacher Wu as a student aid fund, as well as donations from various circles. We thank them all. The list of student aid funds received yesterday is as follows: Teacher Wu, 2,000 yuan; All workers of the Chuxia Road Valais Company (savings from the Taiping Gongjiao), 500 yuan; Sun Jiahang (returned subsidy), 150 yuan; Yao Zhong, Ji Shishen (bonus given as double wages), 114 yuan; Huamei Knitting Factory, 100 yuan; Qin Tingying, Pu Qiting (wishing that the house of good deeds will surely have surplus), 10 yuan each. The total received was 2,904 yuan in deposit certificates. The remaining balance is 1,969,764 yuan.

Application to Change Schools; Supplementary Approval of Subsidies

The following students have canceled their subsidies: Wang Zhongde (Junior High 2), Ni Jiarong (Junior High 3), and Xu Xinghua. The following students have applied to change schools: Wu Dongzhu (Junior High 3) has changed to Renwu Tutoring School. The subsidy remains the same. Li Cuiying (Business Group) has changed to East China University, subsidy 700.500 yuan. Huang Shouwu (University Group), Datong University, 800 yuan. Fang Ruoxu, Cheng Zheng Literary Society, 500 yuan. Jin Shiqing, Nantong College, 700 yuan. Zhang Jifan (Industrial and Commercial Group), Mingxin Accounting School, 300 yuan.

Commentary

### Practicing Decisive Battle Living

In order to thoroughly implement decisive battle living, the Japanese Consul-General has resolutely implemented restrictions on the sale of alcohol. At the same time, the municipal government's proclamation also stipulates that, starting yesterday, restrictions on the operating hours of bars and dance halls will be enforced, and all gambling dens in Zhabei will be closed. This shows that under the slogan of shared suffering, our ally and our country can no longer tolerate the bad habits of "eating, drinking, and frolicking" and "extravagance" that existed before the resumption of jurisdiction over the foreign concessions, which have caused the entire country to no longer know what decisive battle living means.

The key to decisive battle living is that the entire country can endure hardship, and the conditions for its implementation are that there should be no time, no matter, and no object that does not emphasize economy. Therefore, wartime living must include the extension of working hours, the promotion of production, and the conservation of materials. Restaurants, dance halls, opium dens, and gambling dens are in absolute opposition to decisive battle living. Besides wasting time, abandoning careers, and consuming materials, all kinds of criminal, speculative, adventurous, and shameless behaviors in society can be traced back to these kinds of places. They are factors that poison wartime living and cannot be tolerated by a wartime nation. Therefore, we sincerely hope that the authorities will be determined to expand the anti-poison campaign. What does it mean to expand? For example, when it comes to gambling dens, everyone will ask: Are the most magnificent, most public, and most widely attractive gambling dens only in the South City and Zhabei? If not, then no matter how magnificent their current organization is, they should all be closed to show thoroughness and impartiality.

### Trade Associations Launch Investigation Work; Reviewing Whether Past Price Limits Meet Standards

In order to stabilize prices and prevent members from illegally raising prices and making profits, trade associations in the city have established price evaluation committees to be responsible for evaluating standard prices and notifying all members to comply. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation: All trade associations intend to eliminate the practice of selling goods at high prices. On one hand, they will hold meetings to review whether the previous price limits meet the standards. They have successively notified all members to submit their sales information to the association from now on.

The items to be filled in include: the name of the trade association and the business name, address, nature of business, purchase price, retail sales status, inventory, and the signature and seal of the manager. All businesses must submit each item after receiving this notice and must not deliberately delay. The purpose of the trade associations taking this measure is to transform retail prices into standardization and reduce the burden on the common people. It is also learned that the stores currently have no intention of hoarding goods, because the authorities' investigation work is becoming more strict, and they are afraid of being punished. As a result, the distribution of goods seems to be becoming more stagnant.

### Materials Investigation Committee Investigates Knitwear

Since the Materials Investigation Committee began investigating hoarded materials, it has now completed the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth hoarded in 581 public and private warehouses throughout the city, and the results of the investigation are currently being reviewed based on the quantity of yarn and cloth registered with the Municipal Economic Bureau and the Trade Control Order. In view of the recent continuous rise in the market prices of foodstuffs, the committee convened its third meeting and decided to expand the scope of the investigation, increasing the number of investigators from 60 to 100, to investigate the reasons for the high market prices of meat and eggs in the city. It is learned that after completing the investigation of yarn and cloth and meat, the committee, in addition to continuing to investigate eggs and cooking oil, has also sent personnel to investigate the hoarding of knitwear from yesterday onwards. All knitwear factories and businesses in the city will be investigated.

### Company Supplementary Registration Deadline Extended by Three Months

The Ministry of Industry announced the Interim Measures for Company Supplementary Registration and Correction Registration on June 1, 1942, which expired at the end of August this year. After receiving requests from local trade associations to extend the deadline again, the ministry, after reviewing the situation, approved a further extension of three months, from September 1 to November 30.

### Grain Department Bans Illegal Friendship Association

The Ministry of Food believes that the "Shanghai Special City Oil, Salt, Sauce, and Wine Industry Friendship Association" discovered in the city does not comply with current laws and regulations and has requested the municipal government to strictly ban it and order the Municipal Food Bureau to promptly announce that all companies and firms in the former concession area must join legally organized trade associations as members.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Hua stocks were still declining in a roundabout way. The tight money situation at the end of August has passed, but the various sectors of the market are still small due to the lack of confidence. In the department store sector, Wing On fell from a high point. Sincere and National Goods and China Company also showed small declines. China Underwear declined sharply due to selling pressure. There was some buying at low prices for King Fook shirts and socks, but King Lun's transactions were rare and also weak.

In the industrial sector, Jiu'an Industrial and Xin'a Construction were the weakest. In the other sectors, Lianhua, Xinyi, and Wing Hing all traded lower, transactions in the Securities and Fabric Exchange were very small, and the financial sector was also weakening. Shanghai, Zhejiang Xing, Jin Cheng, and Salt all had transactions.

### Materials Control Review Committee Shanghai Office Relocated and Established

In order to facilitate the review of controlled materials in Shanghai and to establish close contact with the Trade Control Committee, the Materials Control Review Committee established a Shanghai Office, appointing Shen Liangzhao as director and Chen Guangzhong as deputy director. They initially set up a temporary office in the Hua Mao Hotel on the Bund. After active preparations, they determined the second floor of the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road as the office address. After the arrangements were completed, it was officially established yesterday (the 1st) and began operations. The internal organization is divided into a secretariat and two sections. A public announcement will be made soon. It is reported that the mission of the office is important. For all future material control issues in Shanghai, the office will contact all parties to exchange opinions and resolve all doubts. In addition, it is understood that various Chinese and Japanese executives under the review committee will participate in the office to assist in promoting the control mission.

### Special Collection of Citizen Opinions on the Construction of Greater Shanghai, Part Two

Contributions to the Municipal Authorities

At the beginning of the new Shanghai, everything is waiting to be done. I would like to offer a few points that I have seen intuitively to the municipal authorities, hoping that they will make improvements and innovations so that the municipality can "renew itself daily, day after day, and again renew itself." Then the citizens will be fortunate.

Remove All Iron Gates

The iron gates were originally set up by the old concession authorities to discriminate against the citizens of our city. Now that the concessions have been recovered, they should all be removed. In this way, the appearance will be renewed, and the prosperity of the city will depend on it.

Unification of Administration

The staff employed by the former concession authorities had certain standards for their physique and education, their uniforms were neat, and in general, they all had the appearance of martial men, and their salaries were also quite satisfactory. However, there were also a few regrets, namely, due to the influence of foreigners in the past, they developed a bad habit of "bullying others and despising their compatriots" and lacked rationality and good character, resulting in incidents such as the Zhang case. I hope that our police administration after the recovery of the concessions can pay attention to this point and give the police officers appropriate mental and rational training so that they can become a perfect police administration. At the same time, the police in the old city area must also eliminate the weak and retain the strong, correct their spirits, and the uniforms must be unified in each district, and the salaries must be equal.

Roads and Sanitation

In the past, the concession authorities spared no effort in the paving and repair of roads. Cleaners were busy on the streets all day long, carrying out their cleaning work, so the residents enjoyed the benefits of sanitation. In recent years, due to the war, it has been far inferior to before the war, but looking back at the roads in the old city area, it is not the same. I hope that the current municipal authorities can sweep away the bad habits of the past. Not only must they maintain the status quo so that it does not deteriorate, but they must also strive to make progress and devote all their efforts to construction.

Rectify Taxes

In modern countries, taxes are focused on income tax, business tax, and inheritance tax. Today's other books directly increase the burden of consumption. In the future, if the municipal finances are insufficient, they may coordinate with the Ministry of Finance to levy business tax, income tax, and inheritance tax, which the former concession authorities could not collect, to make up for it. In addition, for those who are illegally rich, a considerable exorbitant wealth tax should be levied, and it is not too much to take it. As for the land appreciation tax, it is even more the clear testament of our late Premier Sun Yat-sen. When is it not appropriate to levy it?

Crack Down on Opium and Gambling Dens

Even a three-year-old child knows the harm of opium and gambling dens. However, in the past, the South City had the reputation of being an entertainment district. The places near the opium and gambling dens were crowded with traffic all day long, and the electric lights were as bright as paintings at night. They should be cracked down on as soon as possible. As for the return ball court and the dog racing track, they are also a kind of gambling and are no less harmful than opium and gambling. In the past, under the protection of the concessions, even if public opinion opposed it, it had no effect. Now that the concessions have been recovered, these harmful traps should be resolutely banned.

Develop the Transportation Network

In the past, the North and South urban areas had streetcars and buses, but the war destroyed them all. The citizens' transportation almost entirely depends on walking, which restricts the revival and prosperity of the urban area. I think the city government should coordinate with the relevant agencies to discuss and restore them at the opportune moment. Or restore a part first, or restore the streetcars first and then the buses, and restore the simpler and easier ones first to facilitate citizen transportation. Moreover, once the transportation between the North and South cities is restored, the crowded phenomenon of the two districts of 18 will also be alleviated.

Distribution of Materials

Daily necessities such as soap, matches, towels, cloth, shoes, salt, oil, sauce, and wine must be distributed fairly and effectively. Although sugar, oil, rice, and flour have long been distributed according to the population, it is still not perfect in strict terms. For example, delays from time to time or temporary reductions, etc., are not consistent. Although the reasons may vary, it cannot be denied that those who are in charge have not been loyal to their duties. The distribution of materials is directly related to the survival of the people, and indirectly to the survival of the country and the government. Therefore, the government should appoint officials who distribute materials more cautiously to ensure that it achieves practical results. It is not just a simple appointment that can fulfill their duties. They should carefully examine whether the official or member is indeed honest, upright, and loyal to their duties before solemnly appointing them.

Strictly Enforce Price Limits

In recent years, prices have been rising in a straight line, one after another, without any end. Illegal merchants only seek their own interests and ignore the difficulties of the people's livelihood. Although the former Public Works Bureau and the Public Concession Bureau had issued earnest warnings and imposed strict prohibitions from time to time, they only restrained themselves for a while, and soon the old habits reappeared. The reason is that they have not been punished severely. On July 30, the city government issued a notice strictly prohibiting exceeding the price limits. In the future, I hope that the authorities will enforce the laws and severely punish those who violate them. In this way, prices can gradually fall, and the serious threat to the lives of the people can be gradually eliminated. I hope that the authorities will take action to address it as soon as possible.

### Several Prerequisites for Building a New Shanghai

— Ni Xiaotong

1. Do Not Err on Personnel

Now that China has achieved its desire to recover the concessions, how should we carefully plan future municipal facilities to achieve the ideal of building a new Shanghai? The municipal institutions after the Incident have already had a history of six years, and it can no longer be considered a short period. However, has the achievement of municipal facilities reached the level expected by the general public? Has it reached the purpose expected by the authorities? I think that in the future, with regard to personnel, we should "choose people for the job" and never "choose jobs for the people." In the past, some redundant institutions only increased the burden on the people. Now that the new Shanghai is under construction, we dare to say that the authorities should weigh the importance, priority, and urgency of "people" and "things."

2. Actively Transform the Mentality of Citizens

For a hundred years, the citizens of Shanghai have been too deeply poisoned by Europeanization. Sensuality, money, and gambling have confused and intoxicated the citizens. This crazy situation should now come to an end. History tells us that each country has its own national character and national essence. The mentality of Shanghai citizens in worshiping European and American material civilization has taken root, and the awareness of the country and the nation has become numb due to fading memories. Therefore, if we want to make Shanghai a model for the whole country in politics, economy, culture, education, and public order, we must start with transforming the mentality of the people. To transform the mentality of the people, I think we must start with reviving our country's inherent national character and national essence. Here, I dare to propose our country's inherent culture as the initial stage of transforming the mentality of citizens.

3. Implement Pro-People Policies

If the government wants to implement a certain policy, as long as it is indeed for the benefit of the people, we dare to believe that the people will stand in a supporting position and make greater contributions to the government in terms of human and material resources. The officials and the people should develop the virtue of being affectionate and sincere. That is to say, the rulers should treat the people as their own children, and the people should respect the rulers as their fathers and brothers. Only in this way can the implementation of policies be smooth.

### Thoroughly Transform It

— Ding Ding

Having lived in Shanghai for twenty years, I am delighted to see the recovery of the concessions and the wiping away of a century of shame. I would like to offer some humble opinions on municipal construction:

Improve the Police Administration

Under the evil influence of the British and Americans, the police administration in the concessions was too dark. I hope that the police administration will be thoroughly reformed today when the concessions are recovered.

Close Gambling Dens

All improper businesses must be ordered to be closed, not to mention gambling dens. The authorities must know about them. I heard that they will be cleared up "in the near future." How slow and circuitous!

Improve Treatment

The treatment of civil servants is too poor. When it is difficult to support a family, they will inevitably commit corruption. However, the cost of living is soaring, and how many people can work without eating? Improving the treatment is imperative.

Build Up the South City

In general, the situation in the South City and Zhabei is inferior to that in the concessions. After the recovery of the concessions, I hope that the municipal administration in the two districts of 18 will be more refined and advanced, and the South City, Zhabei, West Shanghai, and Pudong will be actively built up and the city appearance will be renovated.

### Establishing a Large Library to Supply Spiritual Food

— Shen Fengwei

Both spiritual and material food are equally needed by the citizens of Shanghai. The universal supply of spiritual food, besides revitalizing the publishing industry, is particularly well served by libraries. As publications are prohibitively expensive, libraries become even more essential. However, it is doubtful whether the existing libraries in Shanghai are sufficient to shoulder the mission of widely distributing spiritual food. As far as I know, the only public and independent library in Shanghai today is the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library on Fuzhou Road. All other libraries are either privately owned or affiliated with organizations and groups. The collection of the former Shanghai Municipal Council Library consists mainly of English books, with very few Chinese books. It is also insufficient for general reference. Among the English books, there are too many popular novels, and the academic reference books are also inadequate. Furthermore, admission to the library requires payment and a guarantor, making the procedure cumbersome and not an ideal place for reading. Other privately owned or organization-affiliated libraries, such as the Modern Scientific Library on Sichuan Road, have mostly Japanese books. The New Asia Library in Cishu Building has a too-low standard. The borrowing procedures are also imperfect. Although the collections of Hongying, Aurora, and the Customs libraries are relatively rich, the admission procedures are cumbersome, or fees are required, making them unable to meet the needs of the general public. Therefore, it seems very necessary to establish a larger-scale municipal library.

It is only natural for a large city to need a large-scale library; however, this is especially urgent for Shanghai today. Because ordinary citizens are unable to afford books under the high pressure of life, a library is necessary to relieve this hunger for spiritual food.

### Prohibiting the Solicitation of Key Money for Rented Housing

— Wu Chengliang

Solving the Housing Problem in New Shanghai

Housing is an indispensable and major problem in life. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the prosperous Shanghai port, with its densely populated areas, experienced a situation where the demand for housing exceeded the supply. General sub-landlords, seeing the need for housing in the market, disregarded the public interest and only sought personal gain. They immediately and privately raised rents, adding on again and again, making it difficult for tenants to bear the burden.

In order to prevent rents from increasing continuously, the authorities previously established a registration system for sub-landlords (which is still continuing), stipulating that the total profit income of sub-landlords shall not exceed two and a half percent, otherwise they would be punished. This was a heavy blow to the general black-hearted sub-landlords, and its effect was immediately visible at the time.

However, recently, seeing that there was no profit to be made, general sub-landlords have changed their approach and started by collecting so-called "key money." When a tenant initially moves into a house, in addition to the monthly rent, they must also pay a certain amount of key money. Considering that in the past, landlords and tenants never had this kind of "key money" in addition to the monthly rent, the amount of "key money" is determined by the bustling location and the size of the house. This is indeed an undeniable fact for the citizens of Shanghai today.

Recently, even more black-hearted sub-landlords have used the excuse of taking back the house for their own use as a threat, forcing the original tenants to move out within a limited time and then re-renting the original house to others, so that they can obtain a large sum of key money.

Now is the time when the concessions have been taken over, and Greater Shanghai has been unified. The authorities are currently engaged in construction and improvement matters. It is urgently necessary to strictly prohibit the solicitation of key money between sub-landlords and tenants.

Only when clothing and food are sufficient can people know propriety and righteousness. First, the issue of clothing, hoping for rationing; second, the issue of food, hoping for an increase; third, the issue of housing, hoping for "affordable housing"; fourth, the issue of transportation, connected transportation.
