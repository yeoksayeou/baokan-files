### Lessons Learned from the Sinking of the Huatai Steamer

The sinking of the Huatai steamer has turned into a major tragedy in the transportation sector, which is heartbreaking. The aftermath and liability issues are currently under investigation and review in various aspects, and it is hoped that strict and comprehensive measures will soon be formulated and implemented. Although the dead cannot be brought back to life, the inner pain we suffer from this tragedy will never be healed. However, tragedy must be the result of debauchery and laziness. If we can learn lessons from the tragedy, cultivate perseverance, eradicate the real root causes of this tragedy, and prevent similar incidents from happening in the future, or even pursue truth and reason from the tragedy, draw inferences about other cases, and expand the effectiveness of what we have learned, so that we know how to plan for the future in various situations, then even though the dead may harbor boundless regrets, they will still have made some contribution after all, and even though the living may suffer great pain, they will still be somewhat comforted. Otherwise, tragedies will continue to emerge and become more and more tragic, and eventually we will share the fate of the passengers on the Huatai steamer, sooner or later suffering the disaster of drowning. Although the forms may vary, their sorrow will be the same.

The function of transportation must meet certain conditions (see the editorial in this newspaper on the 2nd of this month) before it can be fully utilized, and safety must be the top priority for passenger transport. In addition to docks or temporary piers at larger locations, inland river steamers in China often make do with whatever is available, directly using sampans for passengers to embark and disembark, and sometimes in the dark of night, everything is shrouded in obscurity. Even if the crew and passengers strictly abide by the rules, it is already extremely dangerous, especially for women, the elderly, and the weak. The situation in Xingan is also the same, so improvements in equipment should be paid attention to in the future to ensure safety.

All regulations must be strictly enforced. If temporary accommodations are sought, or to facilitate the fulfillment of private desires, resulting in the executors and supervisors regarding the regulations as mere formalities, it will inevitably lead to tragedy. For example, the passenger limit of the Huatai steamer was 538 people, but in fact it exceeded that by more than double, which is simply absurd. Therefore, we should promote the spirit of abiding by the law to seek rectification, and this is not limited to the transportation sector!

According to the surviving passengers, the crew demanded tips from the passengers and piled goods on the deck like a mountain, making the ship prone to tilting. Once it tilted, it was impossible to maintain balance, which led to the disaster. At that time, the crew took advantage of their position to exploit the passengers, and they were complacent and full of self-satisfaction. When they negotiated and extorted, their faces were ferocious, like tigers preying on lambs, leaving no room for mercy or pretense. The company also happily pretended to be deaf and dumb, and took advantage of their ability to extort on the spot without considering improving the crew's treatment. The crew's disregard for the law was caused by the company's indirect indulgence. Now that the ship has sunk, the company has lost its operating tool, and many of the crew members who died with the passengers must also be buried in the bellies of the fish. If the dead could know, the crew's regret may be even greater than that of the passengers. In the same boat in the middle of the river, sharing life and death, why put people in a place where they cannot breathe, until they perish together. There are many fools like these crew members today, but it is a pity that they have not realized their mistake until the "water enters the side door", and they still insist on their perverse behavior. It will be too late to regret it when they "sink to the bottom". We really have no time to mourn for the passengers and mourn for the crew, or even have no time to mourn for the crew and mourn for ourselves. All those who are in a group with common interests should reflect on themselves, and hopefully not use the strong to bully the weak, and restrain their behavior a little. This is the biggest lesson that should be learned from the sinking of the Huatai steamer.

### Second Anniversary of Japan-Thailand Alliance Celebrated Yesterday, Both Countries Determined to Strive for Liberation with All Their Might

Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - The new Thai government held a commemorative ceremony at 10:00 AM this morning to mark the second anniversary of the Japan-Thailand alliance. Japanese officials were also invited. Prime Minister Pibulsonggram, Defense Minister Prayoon Phamonmontri and all cabinet ministers, political and military leaders, Japanese Ambassador Teiji Tsubokami, Commander Shiba, Army Attach√© Yamada, Ogura, etc. attended. Prime Minister Pibul gave a speech expressing his determination, followed by Ambassador Tsubokami's reply. Then they all went to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs to raise a glass in celebration. Because today is also the first anniversary of the ratification and exchange of the Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement, the Thai side held a celebratory tea party at the National Academy of Arts at 4:00 PM, and a celebration party for the second anniversary of the alliance at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs from 7:00 PM.

Bangkok, 21st (Central News Agency) - The main points of Prime Minister Pibulsonggram's speech and Japanese Ambassador Tsubokami's reply at the ceremony commemorating the second anniversary of the Thailand-Japan alliance are as follows:

Thai Prime Minister's Speech

Thailand clearly recognizes that the Empire of Japan is aiming to establish the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere based on mutual respect for freedom and independence, and has the lofty spirit of thoroughly eliminating evil labor. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, it resolutely rose up and vowed to live and die with Japan. In the past, Thailand, like other Asian countries, had constantly resisted the oppression of imperialism, and therefore deeply knows its hardships. The Thai people also understand that all Asian nations hope to realize friendship in the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, two years ago, they signed this alliance treaty with Japan. Since then, the two countries have fully cooperated in military, political, economic, and cultural aspects. At the same time, other East Asian countries are also cooperating with Japan with all their strength. I believe that our cooperation will surely achieve the final result.

Japanese Ambassador's Reply

In the first year of the Japan-Thailand alliance, we achieved unprecedented great war results. In the second year, we also achieved great results comparable to the first year. At the same time, the enemy's attempts to launch a general counterattack in East Asia have been frustrated everywhere, further promoting the construction of our Co-Prosperity Sphere and the preparation for long-term offense and defense. Moreover, the enemy camp is increasingly suspicious of each other after being defeated, and its internal conflicts are deepening. On the contrary, the fighting spirit and unity of our camp are becoming more and more vigorous and strengthened. The war situation in the past two years is completely consistent with the long-term fixed combat plan. These facts make us more convinced of victory. Japan is pleased to recognize Thailand's merger of the four Malay states and the entire Shan states. Thailand shares the war front with Japan, either through economic cooperation or by providing bases to Japan. In the past, Japan and Thailand's desire to liberate Greater East Asia has been gradually realized through two years of hard struggle. Today, East Asian allies are expressing their feelings and have reached a consensus on the exemplary role of the Japan-Thailand alliance in East Asia. They have joined alliances with Japan, which led to the holding of the Greater East Asia Conference and the publication of the Five Great Principles. Here, I, Ambassador Tsubokami, and Prime Minister Pibul solemnly declare on behalf of the people of Japan and Thailand that we will devote all our efforts to the struggle for the survival and liberation of Greater East Asia in the future battles.

Japanese Foreign Minister's Congratulatory Message

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki jointly hosted a luncheon party to commemorate the Japan-Thailand alliance at the Foreign Minister's residence on the 21st. In addition to Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki, participants included Thai Ambassador to Japan, Hada Young, Thai military attach√©s from the army, navy, and air force, Japanese Director General of the Information Bureau Amau, Navy Minister Shimada, Chief of the General Staff Sugiyama, Chief of Naval Operations Nagano, and many others. During the luncheon, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu and Ambassador Hada Young gave congratulatory speeches respectively, expressing the determination of Japan and Thailand to complete the Greater East Asia War. The main points of Foreign Minister Shigemitsu's speech are as follows: Japan's fundamental policy is to maintain friendly relations with East Asian countries. Therefore, following the Japan-Thailand alliance treaty, there are also the Japan-Burma, Japan-Philippines treaties, and the China-Japan alliance treaty, which mutually respect the sovereignty and independence of each other and cooperate to build Greater East Asia. This friendly relationship between neighboring countries has been actively promoted and has formed the foundation for world peace. The previously published Greater East Asia Joint Declaration has already stated this. Japan and Thailand are both located in East Asia. The failure to maintain naturally friendly relations in the past was due to the invasion of a third party. Today, Asia has awakened. No matter how the enemy implements strategies, propaganda, and tactics of intimidation and separation, it will be useless. Recently, the enemy has revealed its plight due to the failure of its counterattack. The Japanese army is capable of crushing any enemy attack. The ambitions of Britain and the United States lie in extracting and invading East Asia and controlling the new world. Our war aims, on the other hand, are to defend our homeland and contribute to the advancement of the world. We are confident that our just cause will be achieved through our determination and strength.

### Japanese Greater East Asia Minister and Thai Foreign Minister Exchange Broadcasts Yesterday

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Japanese Greater East Asia Minister Aoki exchanged broadcasts with Thai Foreign Minister Direk on the 21st. The main points are as follows:

Greater East Asia Minister Aoki

The broadcast stated: In November of this year, representatives from various countries in Greater East Asia gathered in Tokyo to hold the Greater East Asia Conference. The conference stated that the cause of this war was the attempt by Britain and the United States to control East Asia. In order to complete the war, all countries expressed their determination to cooperate with each other. Although Britain and the United States have repeatedly suffered defeats in this war, they continue to counterattack, but they have been crushed by the Japanese army. The momentum of Japan's inevitable victory has become more consolidated. Since the beginning of the war, Britain and the United States have suffered a loss of 400,000 in manpower, and in terms of materials, they have lost a total of 2,200 ships and about 11,000 aircraft. The number is extremely large. The British and American rulers have even forbidden the public holding of funerals for the war dead and do not allow the families of the dead to wear mourning clothes. It is the good British and American rulers who know that in this war against Japan, both personnel and materials have suffered severe losses. In order to cover up their mistakes, they sell special deceptive tricks to the people. Now that they are discussing the purpose of the war in their own countries, it is natural. Therefore, they are now extremely anxious and eager to launch a large-scale counterattack, but Japan has already anticipated this and has sufficient countermeasures. Especially after next year, the enemy's expansion of productivity will be limited. On the contrary, Japan's productivity and combat power will be enhanced due to the strengthening of the domestic decisive battle system. Japan's strategic position will also become more consolidated. At that time, we will have full confidence in completely sealing off and thwarting the enemy's counterattack attempts. Therefore, the enemy, Britain and the United States, are gradually losing confidence in the future of the war, and recently they have been actively implementing strategic propaganda. However, the unity of the Greater East Asian nations based on morality and faith is extremely consolidated and will never be influenced by the self-interest propaganda of Britain and the United States. This goes without saying.

Thai Foreign Minister Direk

The broadcast stated: On the anniversary two years ago, we stood with the Japanese people on a common destiny, striving to liberate the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia and build the Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, the Thai government and the Thai people have made all kinds of sacrifices, and the Thai army has since stood on the same line with the Japanese army. In economic and cultural aspects, we have also concentrated all our efforts to cooperate with Japan in order to implement the war. In addition, the joint declaration passed by the Greater East Asia Conference is the most important political, diplomatic, and cultural event in the history of the world, because the various countries of Greater East Asia are united in accordance with the principles of mutual respect for independence, respect for cultural customs, and economic mutual assistance, so that the entire Asian compatriots have more and more consolidated the belief in the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and the inevitable victory of the war. Under the leadership of Prime Minister Pibul, the entire Thai nation is fighting on the common front with our ally Japan, and we are confident that we will achieve the final victory. At the same time, today is also the anniversary of the ratification of the Japan-Thailand Cultural Agreement. It can be said that the Cultural Agreement is a milestone in the friendly relations between the two countries, paving the way for the future glory and happiness of the two countries.

### Sudden Revolution in Bolivia, New Government Declares Establishment, Villarroel Elected Provisional President

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report, a coup d'√©tat has suddenly occurred in Bolivia. President Castillo has been overthrown. An officer commanding five soldiers arrested the president and several of his relatives the day before yesterday. The coup d'√©tat was launched by the "National Revolutionary Movement" and army officers, led by Tapaga Easton Solo and others. Civil aviation has been cut off, and two cabinet members have also been arrested.

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since the strike of tin miners in Bolivia, some people in the country have become increasingly dissatisfied with President Castillo's anti-Axis policies. Therefore, at dawn on the 20th, the National Revolutionary Party led by Easton Solo revolted and surrounded and occupied the presidential residence and other locations within four hours. At 7:00 PM, they declared on the radio that "the revolution has been victorious" and placed President Castillo, Defense Minister, and Chief of Staff under house arrest. It is reported that Easton Solo and others have formed a new government, but the city of La Paz is still under martial law. Troops are stationed in all newspapers to prevent publication. President Castillo is 51 years old. During the Bolivia-Paraguay War, he served as Chief of Staff of the Bolivian Army. Later, he was elected president with the support of the Bolivian Army. Because he is pro-American, he is very anti-National Socialist and advocates war against the Axis powers.

Madrid, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from La Paz, the new government of Bolivia has been organized by the revolutionary party headed by Major Villarroel.

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a Reuters report from La Paz: After fierce debates in government offices for several hours, the Bolivian rebels elected Major Villarroel as the provisional president of Bolivia. National Party member Easton Solo was appointed Minister of Finance. He is one of the leaders of the National Revolutionary Movement that launched the coup. The new government issued a statement to the public, stating that the revolution was completely successful, and the old regime that oppressed the people has been overthrown. The establishment of the new government is purely out of patriotism and for the benefit of the people. It will start with the economic liberation of the country, and the Atlantic Charter and Bolivia's international obligations will be respected. Foreign policy will not be changed. Former President Castillo issued a statement yesterday, stating that he had resigned in accordance with the wishes of the people and the army. The rebels occupied government offices the night before and arrested Castillo, Defense Minister General Conde, Interior Minister Cervetti, and Chief of Staff, etc. They were all detained in private residences. Two brothers of former President Castillo who had just returned from the United States were also arrested. Due to the prohibition of the revolutionary government, no newspapers were published yesterday. The National Party expressed dissatisfaction with Bolivia's policy of relying on the United States. The government's measures to suppress the general strike in the Catavi mining area were considered only beneficial to the United States. The National Party and army officers also opposed Bolivia's recent declaration of war on the Axis powers, which they considered the result of former President Castillo's visit to the United States. Major Villarroel, the leader of the revolutionary government, has taken office as the new president. The capital of Bolivia was very active yesterday. When the people heard that the government had been overthrown, they gathered in front of the government offices. Member of Parliament Easton Solo gave a speech to the crowd, stating that the National Party will guarantee the freedom of the country and improve the current social conditions. The people must base their criticisms of the new government on facts. The crowd then dispersed. Conflicts occurred in the suburbs. The air force, which participated in the new government, sent airplanes to circle over the capital to suppress opponents. It is believed that the rapid success of the coup was due to long-term preparations.

### Background and Causes of the Bolivian Revolution

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: Easton Solo, leader of the Bolivian Nationalist Movement and Minister of Finance of the new government, recently delivered a radio address, explaining the purpose of the revolution in the country. It is said that after former President Castillo stepped down, Bolivia has passed the shameful era, the deceptive policies of the ruling class have become a thing of the past, and the expenses of wandering abroad can also be saved. Bolivia will no longer belong to the Castillo family. Solo continued that the most offensive thing was Castillo's recent order to protect national security, the purpose of which was nothing more than to extend the ruling class for another four years. Under these circumstances, something had to be done. The National Youth Officers' Movement decided to fight against the capitalist entrepreneurs and conspirators. We rely on the assistance of the people, and our actions are motivated by patriotism.

### United States Had No Prior Knowledge

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to German News Agency: According to a Washington report, the United States had no prior knowledge of the overthrow of the Bolivian government. Officials are not commenting on the matter for the time being. Secretary of State Hull refused to answer questions about the matter at a reception for the press today. Bolivian Ambassador to the United States, Garcia Quiroga, also refused to make any comment.

Although this tax increase is centered on direct taxes such as income tax, considering the purpose of the tax increase, we also decided to increase other indirect taxes to a considerable extent.

### The Dnieper River Freezes Over, Winter War Begins

German Troops Retreat from Kherson Bridgehead

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) ‚Äî The German authorities announced on the 20th: German troops have withdrawn from the Kherson bridgehead in the lower Dnieper River.

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) ‚Äî The German News Agency reported: The winter war on the Eastern Front has now begun. Due to the frozen ground in the past few days, both German and Soviet heavy troops can pass unimpeded. The war has been launched along the entire Eastern Front, except for the northern war zone. The center of the fierce fighting the day before yesterday has now become the focus of the battle. The nature of this year's winter war is slightly different from the two winter wars from 1941 to 1942 and 1942 to 1943. This is because it is not only an offensive by the Soviet army, but the German army will not be limited to defensive operations. They will use the current time to conduct extensive military operations. At a certain key point, the German army has regained freedom of action. This danger to the Soviet army will force the Soviet side to use its strategy of shifting the focus of the war. This can be proved by the Soviet army's southward offensive towards Nikopol, Nevel, and Dnepropetrovsk. The German army's eastward offensive towards Zhitomir and Korosten, and the advance from Kiev towards its target, is possible because the hard ground allows heavy tank units to deploy. The enemy did not notice the German army's movements in Kherson and Cherkasy. The German command's operational objectives in this area are still unknown. The German army's counteroffensive in the Kirovograd area is noteworthy. If Marshal von Manstein's strategy is successful, the Soviet army will be in trouble. The Soviet side places great hopes on the winter war, hoping to achieve goals that could not be achieved in the summer and autumn. Therefore, the Soviet army's new offensive clearly aims to break through, and it has engaged in more cautious preparations. The German army has overcome many difficulties by adopting a flexible strategy. Therefore, it can be inferred that this tactic will cause great attrition to the Soviet army. The Soviet army's advance on the Nevel front has now become stagnant, while the German army's counter-pressure north of the city continues to increase. Experience shows that large-scale offensives, unless they achieve significant progress in the first offensive, will tend to stagnate even with partial success. The German side believes that the fighting in the Nevel area has not yet reached its peak.

### Eighty Anti-Axis Aircraft Attack Bulgaria

Sofia, 21st (Central News Agency) ‚Äî The German News Agency reported: The official gazette stated that eighty enemy aircraft flew high over Bulgarian territory on the 20th and dropped bombs on several locations, causing casualties among the civilian population.

### German Aircraft Attack London, Dropping Heavy Bombs; German Territory Suffers Another Terrorist Air Raid

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) ‚Äî The German News Agency learned from military sources: German aircraft attacked military and industrial targets in the London area with heavy bombs on Sunday night and Monday morning.

On their return flight, the German aircraft saw large fires and smoke billowing in many places, indicating severe damage. Only one German aircraft did not return to base.

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) ‚Äî The German News Agency reported: On the night of the 20th, many British terrorist bombers attacked residential areas in several locations in southwestern Germany, dropping explosive and incendiary bombs, causing significant losses and casualties among the civilian population. German air defenses, taking advantage of favorable weather conditions, engaged the British aircraft in fierce fighting. The final report on the number of enemy aircraft has not yet been received. Another report stated that London official broadcasts acknowledged that twenty-five British Flying Fortress and Liberator aircraft were missing from yesterday afternoon's operation against northwestern Germany. Also, a large formation of powerful American bombers invaded the German Bight yesterday, encountering concentrated German artillery fire.

### The Future of the North China Development Company and the Central China Promotion Company (1)

Sino-Japanese Alliance and

The Future of the Two Companies

The Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty stipulates that the two countries cooperate in the construction of Greater East Asia and ensure stability on the principle of mutual benefit and equality. As a result, the right to station troops stipulated in the old Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty signed in November of the 29th year of the Republic of China (1940), and the economic specificity of North China, Mengjiang, and the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, were all eliminated. Article 6 of the old treaty contained this clause: "The two countries shall cooperate closely in the development of North China and Mengjiang's specific resources, and shall cooperate closely in promoting trade and commerce in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River and rationalizing the supply and demand of materials between North China and Mengjiang." There is no such provision in the new alliance treaty, only Article 3: "Your country shall implement close economic cooperation based on mutual benefit."

If the purpose of this new treaty is thoroughly implemented, the two national policy companies, North China Development and Central China Promotion, should be given considerable consideration. The two companies, established in November of the 27th year of the Republic of China (1938) in the early stages of the China Incident, aimed to prevent the uncontrolled advance of our capital into the mainland and to implement the rational development and reconstruction of North China's industry. They have invested, financed, or managed important businesses such as public utilities of transportation, transportation, ports, communications, electricity, and gas, mineral production, and fisheries, and their achievements to date are quite commendable. However, this business system is the so-called "key industry" of China. Therefore, if one wants to implement the purpose of the new treaty and establish China's independent and autonomous posture, it should naturally be transferred to the Chinese side for independent management. At this time, the tasks borne by the two companies will be to supplement the insufficient capital on the Chinese side, provide technical assistance, and guide Sino-Japanese economic cooperation. However, the emergence of this situation is only possible when full peace is realized and the state of war ends, so it can also be regarded as a future problem.

Current Path

Although the above fundamental changes are a future problem, the progressive steps towards this stage have already begun. The exchange of notes in the new treaty also stated that "Although the state of war continues, fundamental adjustments should be made gradually by agreement between the two countries in accordance with the spirit of this treaty, as circumstances permit." This is in accordance with the new policy towards China that has been unfolding since China's participation in the war on January 9. It is currently being implemented.

The North China Development and Central China Promotion companies have already begun to adjust their affiliated companies. The adjustment policy for Central China Promotion was decided in March of this year, and Central China Silk and Central China Industry are the first companies to implement the adjustment. In North China, the situation is slightly different from that in Central China, so the concretization of the adjustment of its affiliated companies has not yet been heard. Only with the transfer of old enemy property, the Zhongyuan, Dairukou, Shanxi, Cixian, Jiaozuo, and Liuquan coal mines managed by the North China Development Company under commission have been changed to Sino-Japanese joint ventures.

Reduced Revenue

Increased Investment

This kind of adjustment of affiliated companies will continue to be carried out in the future. This will naturally directly reduce the revenue of the parent company. For example, in the case of Central China Promotion, Central China Silk has a dividend of 8% and Central China Industry has a dividend of 10%. Both companies have quite good results among the affiliated companies, so from the perspective of the promotion company's revenue, it cannot be said to be a considerable sacrifice.

Due to this adjustment of affiliated companies, not only is revenue reduced. As everyone knows, price increases in North China and Central China are very fierce, and wages and other expenses naturally tend to increase. Therefore, the situation of each company is quite difficult. Last year, the internal river transport of Central China was reduced from 10% to 8%, and the Huainan coal mine was reduced from 7% to 6%, all due to increased expenses. In the future, this situation of declining revenue is bound to continue to increase. In the future, these two companies will have to stand up for the establishment of new businesses to contribute to strengthening combat power. In North China, new industries such as the Xijin iron, light metals, and the chemical industry are currently under construction. These new industries require huge investments or loans, and their investments do not immediately generate revenue. During the construction period, capital must be in a dormant state and cannot generate revenue. Even if they start operations, they cannot but supply products to the mainland at low prices. Of course, in that case, adjustment funds will be paid. Can it ultimately offset the high construction costs and achievements?

In this difficult situation, both companies are moving towards national policy. When the new president of Central China Promotion, Kikuji Takashima, took office, he said: "Sacrifice the revenue of the promotion company to stand up for national policy." The true face of the national policy company is here.

Strengthening the Business

Group Character

It is said that the business funds for North China Development this year are 423 million yuan, and 63 million yuan for Central China Promotion. To raise these funds, the policy of issuing bonds is used. Collecting private shares is also being considered, but the amount is small, and most of the shareholders are soldiers on expedition and their families, and the unreliability of revenue is as mentioned above. Therefore, for various reasons, it cannot be realized. As a result of relying solely on issuing bonds to raise funds, it will reach the bond issuance limit of five times the existing capital. Therefore, this limit will be expanded.

Thus, it is virtually impossible to rely on share-based funds to raise funds. In addition, if the situation is foreseen, dividends on shares will certainly not be made independently. In the 81st Congress, the government has decided to extend the supply period. The two companies have had a five-year period since their establishment, that is, until the end of this year. For private shares, a 6% dividend is received from the government as a supply. But for the sake of the future, it will be extended for another five years.

At that time, the heads of the city's economic, food, and police bureaus, as well as the Business Control Association, Rice Control Association, Cotton Control Association, and the economic offices of the first and eighth districts, will attend the meeting.

### Grain Control Association Announces Rice Distribution Situation; Rice Adjustment Association Handles Distribution

Central News Agency: Recently, because the allocation period of household rice in this city has been delayed repeatedly, there has been much criticism from the outside. In order to understand the actual situation, the reporter specially visited the Rice Grain Control Committee yesterday. According to the person in charge of the association, the allocation of household rice in Shanghai was originally the responsibility of the association. However, with the establishment of the Shanghai Food Adjustment Committee, it was decided after consultation in early last month that the total amount of rice for household use in Shanghai each month would be allocated by the association to the Shanghai Grain Adjustment Committee, which would then be responsible for the distribution. As for transportation, it would also be entrusted by the association to the Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association. In addition, on the 10th of last month, the Rice Grain Adjustment Committee sent a letter to the association requesting the allocation of 1,688 tons (equivalent to 276,880 dan) of rice for the household use of Shanghai citizens in December. After overall planning, the association replied to the committee on the 25th of that month, allocating 159,119 dan, 2 dou, and 5 sheng before November 30, 84,564 dan, 7 dou, and 5 sheng before the 20th of this month, and 32,989 dan and 1 dou and 4 sheng of rice transferred from the former Rice Grain Joint Management Association, totaling 276,673 dan, 1 dou, and 4 sheng. Transportation passports have long been issued, and all have been allocated to the Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association for transportation to Shanghai and delivery to the Rice Grain Adjustment Association for distribution of household rice. In the future, the distribution of household rice in Shanghai will be handled in accordance with the above-mentioned methods. The association's responsibility is to purchase rice for the household use of Shanghai citizens. It will overcome all difficulties and do its best. At present, various purchasing areas are actively engaged in purchasing large quantities of rice. Including purchasing areas A, B, and C, no less than 1.4 million dan have been purchased.

### Foreign Rice Households in Districts 1 and 8 to Begin Universal Sale Tomorrow

One Sheng of Rice to be Paid for Each Ticket: Regarding the 28th period of grain distribution by headcount in each district within the blockade, except for Districts 1 and 8, the Grain Bureau has stipulated that ordinary sales will begin in each district tomorrow, with full distribution, with each person receiving one sheng of rice as planned. The selling price will remain unchanged at 8 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes. Citizens can purchase from designated rice shops with their rice tickets for this period from the 23rd of this month until the end of the month.

### Manchukuo Consulate Shows Films of Manchukuo Tourism

Since its founding, Manchukuo has made rapid progress in construction. This time, the Manchukuo Consul General in Shanghai, in order to introduce the latest domestic heavy industry development, specifically scheduled the screening of news films such as "Manchukuo Tourism" from 4:00 PM to 6:00 PM on the 22nd at the Hua Mao Hotel, 8th floor, Bund, Nanjing Road. Beforehand, it specially invited the heads of various Chinese, Japanese, and foreign institutions and celebrities from all walks of life in this city to watch the screening. In addition, a heavy industry photography exhibition will be held at the Shanghai Gallery on Nanjing Road on the 23rd, welcoming visitors from all walks of life.

### The Meaning of the Martyrdom of the Garrison Troops on Tarawa and Makin Islands: Interview with the Head of the Matsushima Fleet Press Department

Central News Agency: After the Japanese General Headquarters announced that the Japanese garrison troops on Tarawa and Makin Islands, including General Shibasaki and 4,500 soldiers and military dependents, had all loyally sacrificed their lives, Colonel Keizo Matsushima, head of the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, issued a statement. The main idea is that Tarawa and Makin Islands, where General Shibasaki's garrison troops were martyred this time, are our forward outposts. The enemy paid a great sacrifice to recapture the two islands, and the mission of the garrison troops in that area has also been completed. Minister Matsushima first stated: From a strategic point of view, Makin and Tarawa Islands are forward outposts of our Marshall Islands and are not basic positions. Their main purpose is to search for enemy information and to restrain the enemy in that area. If the enemy attacks, they will rise up and destroy its power. In addition, they also undertake important tasks such as supplying Japanese troops operating in that area. From this point of view, the garrison troops on the two islands, who all loyally sacrificed their lives this time, have fully completed the mission of the forward outposts, inflicting significant damage on the enemy. At the same time, they learned about the enemy's strategic intentions and weapons, which gave us valuable information and made a great contribution to guiding future operations. We firmly believe that all the heroic spirits of the soldiers will also be satisfied in their hearts about this point. However, being on this frontline, hot, miasma-ridden, isolated island, suffering from hardship and poverty for a long time, until finally all were martyred, the hard work of General Shibasaki's garrison soldiers and military dependents is not difficult to imagine. When thinking of the heroic sacrifice of all the soldiers, we, as the people of the whole country, will continue to follow the heroic spirits of the martyrs and be more determined to avenge and repay the country.

### Owners of Gambling, Opium, and Dance Halls Should Quickly Suspend Business Voluntarily: Speech by Mr. Zhang Yipeng at the Thrift Movement

Central News Agency: Since the teenagers in the capital launched the movement to eliminate opium, gambling, and dance halls, it has caused a sensation. Teenagers in Shanghai have also responded at the same time. The reporter believes that this movement is directly and indirectly related to the current emphasis on thrift by the government and the public. Therefore, he visited Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the president of the Shanghai Thrift Movement Association, and Mr. Zhang explained his personal opinions in detail. The main points are revealed as follows: Before the closing of the inaugural meeting of the association, it was proposed to ban opium and gambling. Telegrams were sent to the National Government and the municipal government urging immediate implementation. Although dance halls were not included in the same category, they were long regarded as a luxury, and they should be earnestly advised at any time and any place. Now that the youth groups have put the three things together, it is appropriate. The people of this association should take immediate action, gather strength, and strive to achieve the goal of complete elimination. However, my personal opinion is that it is better for the owners of opium and gambling halls and dance halls to voluntarily close their businesses than to have outsiders interfere and force them to do so. Why? In this extraordinary period of wartime system and scarcity of materials, every aspect of thrift is still feared to be insufficient. If the people cannot earnestly implement it, the national power will inevitably be used to strictly stipulate laws and promote them vigorously. The business owners will be forced to stop one day, and the losses will be unimaginable. This is the first reason. The social economy is increasingly depleted, and it is still difficult to obtain proper food and clothing. Therefore, it is also expected that the number of people who frequent opium, gambling, and dance halls will decrease to the point of extinction. The business owners will suffer the natural elimination, and it will be difficult to recover the capital losses. This is the second reason. Even more unfortunately, if they encounter ambitious young people with vigor and blood, who are indignant at the tragedy of harming the society and disregarding the national crisis, and have no choice but to take destructive actions, the business owners will feel even more compelled to regret it. This is the third reason. With these three dangers, it is better to announce the closure of the business immediately. The buildings and equipment can be reorganized into thrift canteens, thrift auditoriums, thrift schools, and other facilities in order, operating one business to gain both reputation and benefit. I think the perfect strategy is no more than this. I hope that each and every one will think about it carefully.

### Taking Advantage of Mealtime to Sneak in and Steal

On the 8th of this month, a Japanese man named OTA Teruo, who works at the Yokohama Specie Bank at No. 12 Huangpu Bund Road, left his overcoat, hat, gloves, and other items on a chair in his office during lunchtime. When he returned after his meal, the items were gone. After investigation, it was discovered that the thief had sneaked into the office while the owner was out and, after stealing the items, wore them out, so he was not seen by the gatekeeper or other personnel in the office. Similar cases have been frequently reported recently, and all sectors of society should pay close attention.

Brief Comments

### Rice

Yesterday, we addressed the current food problem, advocating for the elimination of private trading and black markets and, with a sincere and objective attitude, examining the responsibilities of the Rice Control Committee in regulating rice supplies. Today, the responsible party of the Rice Control Committee issued a statement clarifying that the responsibility for allocation lies with the Food Adjustment Committee, the responsibility for transportation lies with the Central China Rice Grain Allocation Association, and the Rice Control Committee is actively engaged in purchasing. Regarding this issue, we have no intention of engaging in petty arguments. However, from the people's perspective, we must reiterate our views:

The Rice Grain Control Committee, in terms of its organization, objective needs, and the meaning of control, is absolutely responsible not only for purchasing but also for transportation and allocation. We advocate for a simple structure, efficient operations, the elimination of unnecessary branches, and the centralization of authority.

In the past four months, household rice rations have been only eight periods of eight liters each. The recent black market price of rice has been as high as √ó√ó√ó√ó√ó. These are facts. Therefore, the people consider the explanations between the management agencies to be untrustworthy and pointless. The people need real improvements.

The original purpose was to safeguard the common interests of producers and consumers and to minimize intermediate exploitation. The Shanghai urban area is entirely a consumer area. Currently, purchasing one stone of rice costs √ó√ó√ó√ó√ó√ó, while the producer in the rice-producing area only receives over eight hundred yuan. The greater the difference, the more unscrupulous the profiteers become, and the more Shanghai citizens and farmers in rice-producing areas are exploited, thereby affecting production. Therefore, we advocate for a simple structure and clean personnel to vigorously reduce intermediate exploitation. The Rice Control Committee, as the sole agency for controlling rice supplies, should assume full responsibility.

Finally, we hope that citizens who are suffering will contribute concrete suggestions regarding the food problem and expose the crimes of those who exploit the middle ground. [We] collect [suggestions for] research and provide them to the authorities. We demand the improvement of the people's food supply and, consequently, the suppression of prices.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### Rationing of Essential Goods

Yesterday, [we] discussed investigating essential goods, and today [we] discuss rationing essential goods, because the goal of the investigation is precisely to smoothly ration them. However, the effectiveness of rationing depends not only on the completion of the investigation but also on the subsequent [clarification] of the rationing of essential goods after the investigation is completed. Therefore, [we] must discuss rationing essential goods.

Rationing is a manifestation of control work, and at the same time, it is also a manifestation of the exchange of currency and goods, which is closely related to the public's livelihood. If the rationed goods cannot meet expectations, the general result will be universal disappointment with the prospect of rationing. At the same time, the black market for all essential goods will not only never be eliminated but will also intensify, making the suffering and threats faced by the people in their daily lives increasingly severe.

Among the many necessary conditions, we feel that a basic condition within the rationing mechanism is that retailers selling essential goods should, according to the type of their business, such as textiles, food, fuel, and other daily household sundries, organize single business associations or guilds under the guidance and supervision of the rationing authorities. At the same time, existing baojia systems should be utilized as representatives of consumer groups, and then the business associations and consumer groups should closely cooperate to be responsible for carrying out rationing matters for consumers in each area. As for guilds of a commercial nature, their task should be joint wholesale, storage, and transportation, and their goal should be to assist the government in adjusting consumption and suppressing prices. If profit is still the premise, then the foundation of the rationing mechanism will be the first to become corrupt. How can we talk about the completion of the rationing cause?

### Financial Affairs Inspection Office Held Meeting Yesterday to Discuss Standardizing Accounting Subjects

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, considering that the names of accounting subjects used by financial institutions in the city are quite inconsistent, which hinders financial management policies and operational efficiency, convened a meeting yesterday (the 21st) at 2:00 PM. After collecting and studying the names of the subjects currently used by various financial institutions in detail, they drafted a unified accounting subject name proposal and invited those with accounting experience from banks, money shops, and trust companies to exchange opinions and discuss everything. Representatives from China, Communications, Zhejiang Industrial, Central Trust Company, and the Four Banks Association, totaling dozens of people, attended. First, Vice President Qian Dagai of the Central Reserve Bank gave a speech explaining the necessity of unifying accounting subjects. Then, Qiang Zhonghuan and Zhang Guru of the Financial Affairs Inspection Office reported on the drafting process. Representatives from the various banks and money shops unanimously expressed their approval. As a result, it was decided that each bank and money shop should submit written opinions to the Financial Affairs Inspection Office before January 5 next year. Another meeting will be held on January 11 to discuss the matter in detail and decide on the unified accounting subject names to be adopted.

Summary of Market Conditions

Categories A, B, and E all saw slight declines, and Category D was still not open for trading.

### Tonight, West Youth Basketball, Huaying vs. Sanlun, Huanan Meets Mounauk

In the West Youth Basketball League, there are two Group B games starting at 6:15 PM tonight: Sea Whale vs. Shantou B and French Business vs. Baoqing. Following that, there will be two Group A games. First, Mounauk vs. Huanan. Mounauk is a local team in the West Youth League and has many advantages. As for Huanan, since its inception, it has been unfortunately defeated by the Oriental team, but it has won all four other games. In the West Youth Cup, its record is second only to Hua, and it can despise all other teams. The collaboration between Jin Guigui, Jiu Quan, and Liu Jiakun is unique. Although Mounauk is tricky, it is spared from signing a treaty of surrender with Huanan. Next is Sanlun vs. Huaying. Through hard work, Huaying's skills have improved rapidly, and its momentum is extremely strong. Since Sanlun's freedom, although all four games have been lost, the opponents have been strong. Tonight, they meet Huaying, and it is difficult to predict who will win. The order is as follows:

Sea Whale vs. Shantou B (B1) 6:15 PM, French Business vs. Baoqing (B2) 7:10 PM, Mounauk vs. Huanan (A) 8:00 PM, Sanlun vs. Huaying (A) 9:00 PM. Yesterday's report time was 7:10 PM.

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road Shanghai Nanyang Hospital Visit Notes

Nanyang Hospital has always been able to do all clinical tests themselves. Let‚Äôs take a look at the testing questions. This place, full of academics, gives the participants the most interesting lesson. Recently, Dr. Wu Zhaoren, a famous Chinese bacteriologist, joined, expanding the original laboratory. For bacterial culture, all kinds of businesses are still among the best in China. Dr. Gu Kai said that they have recently started adding clinical laboratories to the wards so that general interns can more easily obtain the necessary medical insights. Although this is a huge burden for the hospital, on the left on the third floor, all are surgical groups, including a "large operating room", two "small operating rooms", one "labor room", one "delivery room", and a high-pressure steam sterilization room, a sterilized dressing room, a doctor's changing room and a bathroom, etc. All rooms are so-called "meat rooms" [surgical related areas] Unfortunately, there are troubles such as bathing and changing clothes. Otherwise, is it not extremely rare to visit the "surgery"? Taste However, just not entering the operating room is enough to make people's hearts beat. Look, the knives, saws, and pliers displayed inside are shining, which is especially interesting. To count as the "shadowless lamp" and short-wave coagulation machine, oxygen machine, etc., are more rare in ordinary hospitals. However, these are all scientific weapons to save people!

Strong Organization and Lineup

In "Chiba Hall", the history and achievements of Nanyang Hospital can be seen from the calligraphy and paintings of celebrities, and how it was praised by those who were saved. However, they are not complacent with past achievements, and are always paying attention to improvement, especially in the organization and physician lineup, never slightly involved in vagueness. Dr. Gu Kai said: Nanyang Hospital is purely a private sole proprietorship. There is no board of directors or other public or private social groups to assist. Since the 29th year of the Republic of China, in order to organize and strengthen the promotion force, the board of directors began to be planned, and Wen Lanting, Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Xu [missing character] Qun Pan Yangyao and other five courtyard directors were hired. The interior of the hospital is divided into three departments: medical, [missing word], and general affairs, to promote the medical business.

### Navy

Youth (2)

"Oka, Mr. Tani..." Oka's mother, very kindly, led Zhenren into the living room. This is not the house where Longfu usually lives, but an eight-mat guest [room] facing the courtyard. In front of the [missing word] treasure table, Longfu's father was already waiting.

"Ah, congratulations..." With a [missing word] and a mustache, he looked very happy, talking to Zhenren and his own son. At the same time, Miss Zhizi, who had just turned eleven this year, tremblingly offered the dishes with her little hands. Staring, as if not very clever, but with a very cute face.

Soon, dinner began. Sashimi of cast fish, pork soup, stir-fried bamboo shoots, it looked delicious, but Zhenren didn't like chopsticks very much. This was the first time in his life that he had eaten with people he was not very familiar with in such a formal setting. His body and mind were restrained.

"So, I said I didn't like this." Although he wanted to prepare Longfu like this in his heart, he chatted with his parents and sister nonchalantly.

"Zhenren-kun, what are your aspirations after graduating from middle school?" Because Zhenren was silent, Longfu's father asked him this.

"Well, I haven't decided yet." Of course, he didn't want to talk about the inside story of his family.

"My brother [missing word], the Navy..." Zhizi cleverly added.

"The Navy is good, because he is [missing word] I hope he will be an official or a industrialist in the future..." At that time, there were still many mothers who said this kind of thing.

"No matter what my mother says, I have already decided on the Navy." Longfu argued with his mouth bulging. Zhenren was taken aback. Taking this attitude towards his mother was unimaginable in his family‚Äî

"Ah, good... If Longfu wants to join the Navy, he must strengthen his body. There is no national cadre as thin as that." The father laughed loudly. Thus, the [missing word] also restored a kind atmosphere.

After the meal, they ate waxberries. After-dinner fruit was rare for Zhenren. The luxurious living room, the oil table area, were all things that towns have. He really felt very free.

"Let's go to Tenpozan to play!" Longfu suggested this, which was a good opportunity.

"I bothered you." Zhenren, whose legs had become paralyzed, stood up straight and said goodbye.

"Brother, won't you take me?" Linzi followed behind the two of them.

"It's not a place girls can go:" Bathing in the warm spring sunshine, Longfu said in an adult-like tone.

### Our Newspaper's Readers Respond to the Anti-Smoking, Gambling, and Dancing Movement

The original telegram on the gambling and dancing movement, motivated by the enthusiasm of justice, is inspiring. I, due to the influence of a bad environment, have also been slightly infected with this kind of bad habit, indulging in sensuality, and immersed in the stains of smoking, gambling, and dancing. I deeply regret it. From now on, I will be determined to eradicate it, wash away past mistakes, so as to serve the country and society, and I hope that fellow citizens who are infected with this bad habit will also strictly practice self-discipline.
