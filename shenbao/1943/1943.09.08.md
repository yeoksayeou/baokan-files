### Urgent Expectation for a New Food Organization

A Central News Agency dispatch from August 31st reported that all matters regarding food control, purchase, and allocation have been decided to be handled by a food organization established by the Commercial Control Council. The candidates for the preparatory team have been largely finalized, and personnel with extensive experience in the flour food industry have been assigned to be responsible for the preparation.

A Central News Agency dispatch from this city on the 3rd of this month quoted a person in charge of the National Commercial Control Council as saying: "Although the authorities had long intended to transfer the matter of rice procurement to this council, this council felt the responsibility was too great and requested that another organization be established to handle it. This has now been approved by the Executive Yuan, and a Rice and Grain Control Committee will be established separately. Yuan Ludeng has been appointed by the Executive Yuan as the chairman of the committee, and the remaining members and organizational regulations are still being discussed."

Another Central News Agency dispatch from the 5th of this month quoted a responsible person from the Commercial Control Council as saying that the Executive Yuan specially appointed Mr. Yuan Ludeng, a leader in the Shanghai business community, as the chairman of the Rice and Grain Control Committee to be responsible for all matters of procurement and allocation. It is fortunate that a capable person has been found for food administration, and it is hoped that society will assist. As for how to procure and allocate, and where the organization will be located, it will be decided by Mr. Yuan.

We have been counting the days, and it has been almost ten days since the 31st of last month. It will also be a week from the 3rd of this month to today. However, the discussions had begun much earlier, certainly more than ten days ago. Time is constantly moving forward and will not wait for people to make slow and delayed plans. The "Rice and Grain Control Committee," which all citizens are eagerly awaiting, is still only a promise with no action!

However, the food problem is a problem that concerns the lives of the masses, and the price of food is a problem that concerns the general price level. The sooner this problem is resolved reasonably, the sooner the lives of the masses will be stabilized to a large extent. Conversely, the longer the solution to this problem is delayed, the more the masses will suffer. These words are by no means alarmist or exaggerated. If you were to ask any citizen, we dare say that they would absolutely agree.

The food problem is so important, and the food problem in Shanghai is particularly serious now. The urgency with which citizens are expecting adjustments is like longing for rain during a severe drought. Therefore, the establishment of a new food organization is an extremely urgent matter. Moreover, since the government has entrusted the task of establishing it, it should be done swiftly and respond quickly to the situation. If "leisurely and unhurried" is used as an excuse for "careful planning," then there should also be an appropriate limit to it, and it should not be that nothing happens after ten days. If "slow and dull" is excused as "calm and meticulous," it is even more misleading to oneself and others, and we really dare not echo this sentiment. As the saying goes, "A hasty illness meets a slow doctor," which is an unfortunate analogy. Today's food problem is indeed like suffering from a "hasty illness," and we hope that the one who is called in is not a slow doctor. How fortunate that would be!

Here, we sincerely urge the leaders of the new rice and grain organization to recognize the urgency of the objective environment's needs, to organize as quickly as possible, and all future measures should be absolutely clear, decisive, and respond quickly to achieve success. In addition, according to news reports, the leader of the new organization is Mr. Yuan Ludeng. Although we have not yet seen a formal announcement from the Executive Yuan, we dare not confirm it yet. However, if the reports are true, we, on behalf of the citizens, are overjoyed that a capable person has been found. This is because Mr. Yuan is old and respected, and has long been known for his integrity. He has lived in Shanghai for decades and has always been loved and respected by the citizens. He is also enthusiastic about public welfare, has led social work for a long time, and is a devout believer in religion, and his spirit of service is even more proactive. This is something that most Shanghai citizens know. Managing food administration is originally a social work that serves the masses, solving the most needed food problem in people's lives, which is even more proactive and broad than general social service work. Now that Mr. Yuan, who has always been enthusiastic about public affairs, is in charge, it is undoubtedly the most suitable and meets the expectations of the people.

However, we are by no means complimenting Mr. Yuan's past achievements and reputation. We expect Mr. Yuan to use the talent and spirit that created his past achievements and reputation to manage the current food administration and carry it forward. We certainly admire Mr. Yuan's past achievements and reputation, but we especially hope that Mr. Yuan's future achievements and reputation will not decline. This is the true meaning of caring for Mr. Yuan. We earnestly hope that Mr. Yuan will understand this deeply, and we hope that those who care for Mr. Yuan will also understand it.

Now, the establishment of a new rice and grain organization is imperative. In addition to hoping for strict attention to seizing time and establishing it as soon as possible, we made a few suggestions in the editorial a few days ago, and now we will add a few more humble opinions as follows:

In addition to Mr. Yuan presiding over the new organization, it is said that social leaders in this city such as Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, and Zhang Yipeng are also participating. The government's deep trust and expectations for these elders who have always enjoyed a good reputation in society for this issue of people's livelihood can be imagined. How should Mr. Yuan first consult with them, jointly plan the process, gather ideas, and strive for perfection? This is the most urgent prerequisite. At the same time, strictly examine and select middle- and lower-level cadres, and must use competence, integrity, and loyalty as the criteria for selection.

In the process of handling the matter, the interests of the people should always be valued as the premise, and the people should be allowed to participate in the opinions and accept the good opinions of the people at any time. At the same time, the failures of the food administration in the past two months should be examined and studied, and efforts should be made to avoid repeating the same mistakes.

Because Mr. Yuan has been engaged in social leadership work for a long time, the relationships in all aspects of society, especially in personnel, are extremely complex. In this regard, it is necessary to take into account the importance of food administration, and in terms of personnel, select people based on the work, strictly examine and select them, and never be hindered by personal relationships, so that unqualified people do not fill the positions. The establishment of the purchasing office for cotton yarn and cloth this time, with Nie Lusheng and Cao Boquan in charge, was quickly organized, and the personnel were strictly selected. Therefore, the work was carried out in a proactive and smooth manner. This is the best practical model to follow.

In short, handling food administration is a social work that serves the masses, and it can be said that it is the right person, the right thing, the right place, and the right time for social leaders to take on this responsibility. In view of the repeated failures of food administration in the past, which have greatly burdened the people's livelihood, we will never allow it to fail again this time. The preservation of personal reputation and the establishment of people's livelihood stability depend on this one action. How can we not be careful!

### Large Formation of Japanese Naval Aircraft Bombs Enemy Boats in Hobart; Attacks Enemy Aircraft in New Britain, Shooting Down Three

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The enemy forces attempting to invade the north are stubbornly continuing their counterattacks and have landed in Hobart, northeast coast of New Guinea. On the morning of the 5th, a joint large formation of fighter-bombers from the Japanese naval air force urgently attacked the enemy's landing site, launching an attack on two enemy 2,000-ton transport ships and two extra-large landing craft. As a result of the bombing, one transport ship and one extra-large landing craft were sunk. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Approximately 30 enemy B25 and B24 aircraft attacked Zealbou in New Britain Island at 9:00 AM on the 3rd. The Japanese air force immediately intercepted them and shot down three B25 aircraft. Japanese losses were minimal. New York, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuter's dispatch: General MacWhorter is currently directing the US military's landing operations in New Guinea. The Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that the Anti-Axis Commander-in-Chief believes it is necessary to personally command the New Guinea operations.

### Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama Broadcasts: Japanese Army Has Reached the Doorstep of India and Australia; Must Prepare for a Major Offensive

Tokyo, 6th (Central News Agency) - Lieutenant Colonel Akiyama of the Japanese Army Headquarters Military Information Department broadcast on the Central Radio Station tonight, saying: "The Japanese army has now reached the doorstep of India and Australia. Therefore, Japan must engage in material and military preparations to launch a final large-scale offensive against these regions. The enemy is currently engaged in guerrilla bombing in the southern region to hinder Japanese construction in that area, but the Japanese side will repel these attacks and accelerate preparations for a second large-scale offensive or air raid. The United States is mobilizing its material resources in the hope of using Australia as a base to launch a fierce counterattack in the Southwest Pacific, but they have not taken into account the traditional spirit of bravery and warfare of the Japanese army. The Japanese army is fighting bravely in various locations and does not fear the enemy's numerical superiority and unfavorable terrain."

### Chief of Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China Makes His First Broadcast Speech - Our Expectations for China Policy -

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Chief of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in China, Mr. An, gave his first broadcast speech on the Central Radio Station on the evening of the 7th, entitled "Our Expectations for China Policy." He gave a sincere speech on China policy and Sino-Japanese relations, the main content of which is as follows: "It has been almost three years since the National Government returned to the capital, and it has fully demonstrated its development posture. Japan, Manchukuo, Italy, Thailand, and thirteen other countries have recognized it, and it has now gained a solid international position. On January 9th of this year, it also declared war on Britain and the United States, joined the Axis camp, and engaged in joint operations with a determination to share life and death. Our country quietly expresses its heartfelt assistance to this as a comrade. In order to complete its transformation into an autonomous and independent modern country, it will give full cooperation. When China joined the war, it also assisted it with various new policies. This new policy is generally called the new China policy. However, how significant a turning point has this new policy actually caused? In fact, it is nothing more than the implementation of the principles signed on November 30th of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), and it is not a change or revision of the China policy.

Regarding the abolition of extraterritoriality and the return of concessions, Article 5 of the Basic Treaty states that 'the Japanese government, in order to adapt to the development of the new Sino-Japanese relationship, should abolish all extraterritorial rights in China and return the concessions.' This is merely faithfully fulfilling the promise in this treaty. However, in terms of implementing this measure, the Japanese side has made many sacrifices, especially the Japanese residents in China. As for why the Japanese government is willing to make such significant sacrifices, it is because it hopes that China will move forward on the path of growth and strengthening. This is the first manifestation of mutual cooperation between China and Japan, and it is believed that China and Japan should start their cooperation on an equal footing, and the primary goal is for China to complete its autonomy and independence as soon as possible. In June of the 31st year of the Republic of China (1942), Prime Minister Konoe said in a broadcast speech welcoming Chairman Wang's visit to Japan: 'Japan has three methods for dealing with China: one is to invade China by force, the second is to jointly divide China with a third country of strongmen, and the third is to recognize China as an independent country and further strengthen cooperation with China.' The first and second methods above are the easiest and require the least sacrifice from Japan, but Japan has abandoned them and chosen the most difficult third method. This is indeed the

national moral spirit

that drives Japan. This kind of thinking is by no means the British and American style of invasion, nor is it a policy that changes with the times. In this regard, there may be erroneous ideas or slight dissatisfaction among the Japanese people regarding the so-called new policy. First, the rights and interests of the Japanese in China were built by the Japanese residents in China through difficult and arduous efforts, and once they are returned without compensation, it is indeed a result of the idea of sacrificing the individual for the greater good. Secondly, the reason why Japan adopted this new China policy is not a manifestation of Japan's weak national power. In the future, Japan will continue the war for five to ten years, and there will be no fluctuations in the military, political, and economic directions. Or some people think that implementing the new policy, abolishing extraterritorial rights, and returning concessions are a manifestation of Japan's retreat from China. Prime Minister Tojo said at the 'Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation Symposium' in March of this year: 'Today is not the time to preserve rights and special rights, but the time to develop the economy with China on the basis of coexistence and co-prosperity.' From this, it can be seen that Japan's abolition of special rights in China is a further step in Sino-Japanese cooperation. Recently, when Hankou was bombed by American aircraft stationed in Chongqing, Japanese residents rescued injured Chinese people, which also proved the reality of mutual cooperation between the two countries. In short, the people of China and Japan should immediately move from physical cooperation to actual connections from the heart, which is what is greatly hoped for."

### Mr. Tanihagi Talks about the Future of the East Asian War Situation: Retaking Burma Is No Different from a Fool's Dream

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - Major General Tanihagi, Chief of the Army Information Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, issued a statement on the 7th, saying: The Southeast Asian Anti-Axis Command was established on August 25th, with British Navy Vice Admiral Mountbatten as Commander-in-Chief. It is reported that Mountbatten is currently in London, discussing war matters with Indian Governor-General Wavell and Chongqing representative Gu Weijun. It is expected that they are discussing the issue of retaking Burma. However, what we should pay attention to is that the Chongqing army has in fact been placed under the command of Mountbatten. Roosevelt and Churchill issued a statement after the Quebec Conference, saying that the United Kingdom and the United States should cooperate with Chongqing to eliminate all Japanese troops and strive for final victory. Judging from the meaning behind their words, they do not intend to cooperate with Chongqing side by side, but obviously want to place the Chongqing army under the command of the United Kingdom and the United States to sacrifice them in the East Asian operations. For example, the commander of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, Chennault, once declared that their mission was to air raid the Japanese mainland, not to cooperate with the Chongqing army, and said that in order to complete this mission, they would freely use the Chongqing airfields, etc. Now there are various concrete facts to prove that the US military will not recognize the sovereignty and independence of the Chongqing side during the operations. As for the military power commanded by Mountbatten, based on past experience, the British army is actually weaker than the Chongqing army. It is no different from a fool's dream for an army dominated by the British army to shout "retake Burma," "eliminate the Japanese army," and "strive for final victory." Furthermore, regarding the inside story of their combat troops, it is still doubtful whether the British officers and soldiers will obey the command of Mountbatten, who is only 43 years old. Also, the cooperation between the British army and the US troops stationed in India is also worthy of attention. How can the proud American troops be subject to the command of the British army? Moreover, the Indian troops have witnessed the independence of Burma and deeply felt the oppressive policies of the United Kingdom, and they will certainly not be willing to be driven by the British. From this point of view, the coalition forces commanded by Mountbatten are actually a rabble.

### Executive Yuan Routine Meeting

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - At 9:00 AM on the 7th of this month, the Executive Yuan held its 177th meeting. Among the reporting items, there was a request for instructions on the matter that all owners of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, whether registered or not, must submit a sales application in accordance with the law. If they fail to submit it within the time limit, even if they have registered, it will be considered unregistered, in order to show the restriction. In addition to approving the request as mentioned above, the National Commercial Control Council was ordered to comply. It was also reported by the Ministry of Industry that it intends to add a hemp industry association and a joint industry association, and also plans to revise the list of main commodities. It is requested that the matter be reviewed, etc. It is still feasible, and the above-mentioned revised list of items has been announced and implemented by the Executive Yuan, and the instructions have been followed. The Ministry of Social Welfare reported that the disaster situation in Quanjiao, Anhui is serious, and it is proposed to allocate 150,000 yuan from the unallocated funds for relief projects to the Anhui Provincial Government to handle emergency relief; among the discussion items, there was a proposal by the President that, with the approval of the Military Commission, the Education Director of the Central Army Officer Training Corps, Hao Pengju, has other tasks, and it is proposed to have Xiao Shuguan, an adjutant of the Corps, concurrently serve as the replacement. The resolution was passed. Hao Pengju was appointed as the Security Commander of the Suhuai Special Zone. Regarding appointment and removal matters, the President proposed, according to the report submitted by Governor Yang of Hebei Province, it is proposed to appoint Yang Shusen as the Director of the Security Department of this province. The resolution was passed. Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance proposed that Li Chun be appointed as the Deputy Chairman of the Internal Revenue Tax Committee of the Ministry. The resolution was passed. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry proposed that Ji Shangming be appointed as a Counselor of the Ministry. The resolution was passed.

### President Wang Is Concerned About the Breach of the Huai River

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - President Wang, who is also the President of the Executive Yuan, is deeply concerned about the breach of the Huai River this time. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Construction to jointly plan the damming and prevention with the local government, and ordering the Ministry of Social Welfare to allocate funds for relief, he also sent a special telegram to Yu Jinhe, the Director of Construction in North China and the Director of the Zhengzhou Huai River Breaching Prevention Committee of the Yellow River, ordering him to quickly plan fundamental and stop-gap measures to remedy the situation. The original telegram is recorded as follows: Director Yu, General Construction Department of Beiping, Brother Yougeng: I recently received a report from Minister Chen of the Ministry of Construction that the water level of the Huai River has been rising continuously since the beginning of August. By the 2nd of this month, there have been several breaches in the river embankment. The flooded areas include Fengyang, Chuzhou, Lingbi, Wuhe, Fengtai, and Suzhou counties, and the disaster situation is serious. The flood season has not yet passed, and the Yellow River water is pouring into the Huai River, which is of great importance. In addition to ordering the Ministry of Construction to jointly plan the damming and prevention with the local government, and the Ministry of Social Welfare to quickly plan relief, the entry of Yellow River water into the Huai River has been one of the most concerning events in recent years. The Yellow River Zhengzhou Breaching Prevention Committee was once sincerely led by Director Tong Sheng and you brother, and now you brother are in charge, and the preparations are being made daily. Due to the obstruction of the Chongqing side, the prevention project has not been implemented, which has ultimately led to this huge disaster, which is deeply regretted. I hope that you will do your best to quickly plan fundamental and stop-gap measures for the problems and ends, and I hope that you will reply, Wang Zhaoming, sunny.

### Members of the Rice and Grain Control Committee Have Been Appointed

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The matter of rice and grain procurement and allocation was originally handled by the Ministry of Food. It has now been resolved by the sixth meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee to be transferred to the National Commercial Control Council for continued handling, and the government has ordered the council to do so. The Commercial Control Council is also preparing to establish another Rice and Grain Control Committee. The position of Chairman has been assigned to Yuan Ludeng by order of the Executive Yuan. After receiving the order, Mr. Yuan immediately took on the responsibility of preparation, and the handover procedures will be formally carried out within a few days. All the staff members have been decided and announced by the Executive Yuan, and their names are as follows: Chairman Yuan Ludeng, Members Lin Kanghou, Luo Nazi, Dai Jilu, Chen Guangzhong, Chen Zhiyi, Yang Heqing, He Quansheng, Ji Hua, Yan Jiyun.

### Japanese Commander Ono Visits Minister Chu

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The newly appointed Commander of the Japanese Expeditionary Army in China, Major General Ono Hiroichi, visited Minister Chu at the Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 10:20 AM on the 6th, making his first meeting after taking office. Minister Chu happened to be away from the capital on official business, so Vice Minister Zhou represented him in receiving the visitor, and they had a pleasant conversation.

### Tanaka Seiichi Promoted to General

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Ministry of the Army announced on the 7th that Lieutenant General Tanaka Seiichi of the Army has been promoted to General. General Tanaka graduated from the Army University in the 5th year of Taisho (1916). In March of the same year, he was sent to the United Kingdom to study military affairs. After that, he successively served as the military attaché of the Japanese Embassy in the United States, commander of the infantry brigade, and commander of the military police. In the 14th year of Showa (1939), he served as the commander of the Japanese troops stationed in China. In August of the 17th year of Showa (1942), he served as the supreme commander of the Japanese army in the Philippines. In May of the 18th year of Showa (1943), he returned to Japan from the Philippines and served as a member of the General Staff Headquarters until today.

### Anti-Axis Aircraft Blindly Bomb Munich

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuters learned from authoritative sources: British aircraft fiercely bombed Munich last night, dropping many incendiary bombs and fragmentation bombs. Many buildings were destroyed there, including residential buildings, churches and schools, and three hospitals. Many British bombers, obstructed by German air defense facilities, were unable to approach the city and blindly dropped their bombs in several uninhabited areas and rural areas.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - On the night of the 5th, the British Air Force launched an air raid on Mannheim and Louisport in western Germany, losing 37 heavy bombers. On the morning of the 6th, the US Air Force attempted to attack western Germany through northern France, and encountered a German fighter squadron. A fierce air battle ensued. Although the American squadron penetrated the southern part of Germany, it was defeated by the brave attacks of the German fighters and suffered heavy losses. A number of American aircraft invaded Swiss airspace, dropped bombs in various villages, and then fled.

### German Troops Stationed in Denmark Strictly Prevent Spies

Copenhagen, 7th (Central News Agency) - Reuters reports: The commander of the German troops stationed in Denmark announced to the Danish people that espionage and sabotage will be punished with the death penalty or the highest penalty. Anyone who knows of the occurrence of such events and does not report them to the authorities will also be guilty of the same crime. Anyone who attempts to incite strikes will also be treated as an enemy.

### Strategic Intentions of British and American Forces in Southern Europe Are Unclear; There Is an Attempt to Invade the Balkans

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters military reporter Sertorius: No major battle has occurred in Calabria, because Germany and Italy are only using a small number of troops to engage the enemy in order to cope with the pressure of the enemy troops by means of "delaying resistance." Once these pressures become too strong, the Axis forces will exert their flexible combat characteristics. As for where the Axis forces will dispatch stronger troops, it will be determined by the actions of the enemy. Since the weekend, the enemy has expanded bridgeheads on both sides of Reggio, San Giovanni, and Melito, occupying a stretch of land between Spartivento Point and Palmi on the west coast of Calabria. The Allied forces in the interior of the province have also advanced. The rearguard and the British vanguard clashed in the Aspromonte area east of Reggio on Sunday. If the enemy can occupy this peak, which is 1,800 meters high, it will serve as a base for advancing north and northeast. The enemy's target is not yet very clear. Whether they intend to attack Naples or Taranto is not yet clearly indicated. In short, the landing in Calabria may be the beginning of the struggle for the lifeblood of Italy. However, if Montgomery leads a large army straight to Taranto, then his purpose is to establish a springboard to attack Albania in the Balkans. Both of these are possibilities. But at present, it is difficult to say what the enemy will choose. What should be noted is that the enemy in Calabria is only a part of the enemy on Sicily, and a large number of fresh troops, including the US Seventh Army, remain in Morocco, Algeria, Tunisia, etc. It can be seen that the Allied forces may still have plans to land elsewhere. Therefore, unless the Allied forces land in central Italy or Apulia on the opposite coast of Albania, their movements will be impossible to speculate. Currently, the British and Canadian troops in Calabria are only about two to three divisions, less than half of the British Eighth Army, which is also one of the reasons why there has been no major battle in southern Italy.

### Axis Forces in Southern Italy Continue Strategic Withdrawal, U.S. Seventh Army Disembarks from North Africa

Berlin, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German authorities announced yesterday that the Axis forces, based on a pre-arranged plan, have withdrawn from southern Calabria, with all military supplies having been transported back and all civilians evacuated.

Rome, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Italian High Command announced this afternoon: yesterday, Axis forces in the coastal region of Calabria, at the southern tip of Italy, continued their slow and orderly withdrawal. The vanguard of the anti-Axis forces engaged in several fierce battles with the rearguard of the Axis forces, but the Axis lines remained intact. Both sides' air forces were highly active. The German Air Force bombed the port of Bizerte on the North African coast. Several enemy four-engine bombers heavily attacked the central area of Naples, causing significant damage.

Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to news carried by the American news agency last night: the majority of the Seventh Army embarked the night before from a certain location in Algiers, bound for a destination yet to be announced. Authorities are maintaining strict secrecy regarding the destination of the transports. The report indicated anti-Axis forces are conducting landing operations in other areas of the Mediterranean. Another report supplementing this news stated that air activity between North Africa, Sicily, and Malta has greatly increased. Military observers infer from this that the anti-Axis forces are currently preparing to complete an aerial umbrella to protect this apparently ongoing landing operation.

### Anti-Axis Convoy Sails Eastward in Mediterranean

Aghios Nikolaos, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - It has been learned here that seventy-two anti-Axis merchant ships, escorted by three destroyers and four patrol ships, left the port yesterday, sailing towards the Mediterranean. The convoy was loaded with a large quantity of military supplies when it was in port.

### Anti-Axis Commander-in-Chief for Europe to be Marshall

Lisbon, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - U.S. Army Chief of Staff General Marshall will be appointed as the anti-Axis Commander-in-Chief for the European theater, commanding all military operations invading Europe from a base in Britain.

### German Forces Continue to Adopt Flexible Defense, Soviet Offensive Unsuccessful

Berlin, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German authorities on the 6th issued the following statement regarding the Eastern Front: The Soviet army is currently continuing to launch a large-scale offensive on a vast front stretching from the Sea of Azov in the south to the Moscow-Smolensk highway in the north. The German army is employing flexible defense tactics to prevent the Soviets from achieving a large-scale breakthrough. Therefore, despite the Soviet army's continuous reinforcement with fresh troops and continued attacks, they have not succeeded. On the "Bryansk Front," the Soviet army's attempt to encircle the city was unsuccessful, and the situation there has now reached a stalemate. On the "Northern Ukraine Front," German and Soviet forces are engaged in a back-and-forth attrition battle in the entire region upstream of the Desna River, south of Bryansk, and in the vicinity of the cities of Siversk and Konopplablomne. The Soviet army has massed large forces in this area, and continues to launch attacks under air cover. The German army is currently engaged in fierce counterattacks. On the "Kharkov Western Front," the Soviet army's attempt to attack the city of Krasnograd is currently developing into a fierce tank battle. On the "Donets Front," Soviet forces south of Izyum launched a large-scale attack on the 4th, attempting to advance through the Donets River towards the bend of the Dnieper River. The German army, employing flexible defense tactics, has defeated the Soviet army. The German army on the Donets front began shortening its lines from the 3rd, moving westward to new positions, and is currently continuing to conduct an organized withdrawal.

### British Diplomatic Activities in Turkey

Istanbul, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to a dispatch from the Shihsin News Agency: British diplomats are currently making every effort to persuade Turkey to abandon its repeatedly declared policy of neutrality and to assume the status of a non-belligerent. British activity in Ankara has been very evident in recent weeks, with the main objective being to persuade Turkey to take a closer step to Britain's Soviet policy. London believes that the time is ripe to establish British-Soviet relations, and is therefore applying pressure to Turkey in an attempt to make Turkey a "bulwark" for British and American operations in the Balkans, but the plans for British and American operations in the Balkans have not yet been understood by Stalin. Britain hopes to reach the Bosporus Straits earlier than the Soviet Union, but Turkey has always maintained a calm and indifferent attitude, using its freedom of decision as a means of resistance, and will continue to resist in the future, as Turkey has already realized the danger of this development. At the same time, the continuous Soviet offensives on the Eastern Front have also caused Turkey considerable pain. In fact, British diplomats have not yet achieved their goals, and Britain's frustration is difficult to conceal. Moreover, the United States' current foreign policy towards the Soviet Union is not in alignment with that of Britain, further increasing Britain's frustration. The United States' objective seems to be to persuade Turkey to join the American fold.

### An Observer Explains the Current World War Situation, Axis Operations Outlook Extremely Optimistic

Nanjing, July 7th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Recently, an observer here explained the current world war situation as follows: The German-Soviet war has entered its third year. In the past two years, Germany launched summer offensives. It was generally speculated that Germany would launch an Eastern Front offensive again this summer. Since the beginning of summer, the Soviet offensive has been very fierce, while Germany has switched from offense to defense. Germany had prepared a large force at the beginning of this summer to launch an offensive, but due to the Allied landings in French North Africa, followed by the invasion of Sicily, Germany, in order to consolidate the Western Front, adopted a flexible defense tactic on the Eastern Front, switching from offense to defense. Although the Soviet Union has launched a large counteroffensive for several months, and has also recovered some territory, strategically speaking, Germany is using small pieces of land to exhaust a large number of Soviet troops, and the Soviet Union is losing more than it gains. Germany has already achieved the expected results of its attrition strategy. Today's war is a long-term war, and in a long-term war, replenishing one's own resources and depleting the enemy's forces is the key to victory in the war. The situation of the German-Soviet war in July is not unfavorable to Germany, but is a predetermined procedure in Germany's strategy. Some people are doubting the future of the Axis due to the coup in Italy, which is a nervous and erroneous concern. The strategy that Germany can quickly adopt has already shifted from external line operations to internal line operations. The advantages of internal line operations are that the distance from the front is shorter, the rear is well-supplied, and military cooperation is close. The edge of Germany's predetermined internal line operations is the Alps in northern Italy. Conversely, the Allied forces landed in southern Italy, and the distance between the front and the rear is very far, transportation is slow, and replenishment of supplies is very difficult. Germany is in an advantageous position to deal with the Allied two-front war with internal line operations. Moreover, Germany's food, military strength, and troop reserves are very abundant, so the outlook for Axis operations is extremely optimistic. As for the Greater East Asia, our ally Japan has established the foundation for victory in the past year, and is focusing its efforts on the development and construction of the ocean this year. In recent months, there has been very little news of Japanese offensives in the Greater East Asia. This is in fact Japan's current military strategy of waiting for the enemy to wear themselves out. Even if Allied forces launch a large-scale offensive, they will give Japan the opportunity to deplete the enemy's forces. In short, today's world war has two theaters, East and West. The forces of the Axis are distributed differently.

### Japan's Wartime Social Policies

Guiding Principles of Wartime Social Policy

The term "social policy" has two inherent interpretations, broad and narrow, and thus the scope of problems it involves also differs significantly. In any case, so-called social policies are policies that address, both directly and indirectly, the general problems arising under various conditions from the deficiencies of modern economic organizations, and aim at social solutions. These are measures to solve labor problems, poverty relief, child protection, social education, and other social pathologies. The ideological background lies in the idea of social equilibrium, aiming only to harmonize the relationship between the strong and the weak in society; this relationship is inevitably created by the laissez-faire policies of blind forces regulating society. However, the content expressed by the term "wartime social policy" is very different from this. The starting point of wartime social policy lies first in the recognition that modern war is a total national war. It has concrete objectives, is governed by a noble overall perspective, and therefore possesses a conscious and planned character. This differs from the passive wartime social policies of the old era, which aimed to protect the lives of the people and maintain their peacetime state in response to the impact of war. Modern wartime social policy, which mobilizes total national strength, takes the maintenance and cultivation of human resources, the foundation of carrying capacity, as its highest guiding principle, and aims to ensure the wartime stability of national life in order to achieve this highest goal.

Strengthening Social Administration and Improving Social Legislation

In Japan, since recognizing the national character of the China Incident, the various departments of social policy have been unified under a single administration. The necessity of establishing a comprehensive national policy implementation agency for the maintenance and cultivation of human resources was keenly felt. Thus, in January of Showa 13 (1938), the Ministry of Health and Welfare was established by unifying the related affairs of various ministries. At that time, the weekly report issued by the cabinet stated: "Unifying physical education, health, preventative protection administration, social welfare, relief, employment, labor protection, and labor insurance social administration, and resolutely implementing the fundamental improvement of the nation's physical strength, which is currently our country's greatest deficiency." This clearly indicated the goal that all wartime social policies should ultimately achieve. However, the goal was still less proactive than today's social policy goals. The improvement of national physical strength was aimed at maintaining existing human resources in the total war phase. Later, in January of Showa 16, the Outline of Population Policy was established as one of the basic national policies, and the goal of Japan's wartime social policy, as mentioned earlier, acquired a noble proactive character due to the highest guiding principle of pursuing the long-term development of the nation through the population policy. The administrative organ responsible for the comprehensive operation of social policy, the Ministry of Health and Welfare, was established, and most of the social policy laws and regulations that had been formulated and implemented previously were placed under the jurisdiction of the ministry. Many of these laws and regulations carried a strong so-called protective legal tone. Subsequently, among these laws and regulations, amendments and repeals were carried out, all with the aim of reflecting the active national will. At the same time, new laws were enacted, including the Store Law, Social Enterprise Law, National Health Insurance Law, People's Bank Law (1938), Judicial Protection Enterprise Law (1939), National Physical Strength Law, National Eugenics Law (1940), Laborer's Pension Insurance Law, Housing Corporation Law, Loan Association Law, Medical Protection Law (1941), National Medical Law, Wartime Disaster Protection Law (1942), and Pharmaceutical Affairs Law (1943). Japanese social policy has been moving toward its goal through the application of these many laws and various administrative measures.

Population Policy and Social Policy

The concept of population has long been a subject of social policy, discussed in relation to unemployment and food supply issues. While population problems arise from population growth, the focus has been more on passive measures to reduce mortality, such as public health initiatives, rather than active pro-natalist policies. Since the establishment of the National Population Policy, social policies have taken on a distinctly proactive character, centered on promoting marriage and childbirth. In Showa 15 (1940), the government established Marriage Counseling Centers in Tokyo, and in Showa 16 in Osaka. By the end of Showa 16, local governors were instructed to disseminate marriage ideals, encourage and mediate marriages. From Showa 18 (1943), large-scale Marriage Patriotic Consultation Meetings were planned. Regarding childbirth, since Showa 15, there has been recognition of families with many healthy children (currently 13,269 families), and from Showa 16, upbringing support for their children (currently 971 people). Since Showa 17, meritorious mother and child protection programs have also been recognized. The state directly protects over 300,000 pregnant women and nursing mothers annually, and prevents over 60,000 miscarriages, premature births, and stillbirths annually, which are considered most important for reducing congenital disabilities. In July of Showa 17, the government promulgated the Ministry of Health and Welfare Ordinance for Pregnant and Nursing Mother Records, strengthening health guidance for pregnant and nursing mothers, and giving special consideration to priority allocation of resources, rest, and reduced labor. Infant protection was not heavily emphasized before the Incident, but since Showa 14, infant medical examinations and free health consultations have been implemented. Since Showa 17, compulsory examinations and physical fitness records have been implemented based on the National Physical Strength Law. In Showa 16, 83% of infants examined required attention, and in Showa 17, the percentage was over 92%. The percentage of infants requiring attention is decreasing annually. Mobile health guidance is becoming more active, resulting in a significant drop in mortality rates. The day care center system is also being greatly expanded, and the Empress donated private funds to day care centers in May.

The Medical Security System

Health centers are the central agencies for national health guidance. In Showa 13, only 49 were planned for construction, but there are now 239, and another 80 are planned for construction by the end of this year. Public health nurses are the main agents of health guidance. There were approximately 4,000 after the Incident, and today there are over 7,000. Their quality is also improving due to the Ministry of Education ordinance regulating health nurses. To meet this health guidance system, the medical system is also being established. The National Medical Law, which establishes a groundbreaking medical system, was enacted and promulgated in Showa 17. Based on this law, the Japan Medical Corps was established. The medical corps has a business fund of 600 million yen, and its three major tasks are the prevention and eradication of pulmonary tuberculosis, the elimination of medical deserts, and the improvement of medical content. It plans to establish central, prefectural, and local general hospitals, local clinics, and their branches. At the same time, it plans to complete 80,000 tuberculosis beds in the three years from Showa 17, and together with the existing 20,000 beds, eradicate pulmonary tuberculosis.

Tuberculosis is related to population policy. Before the National Physical Strength Law was enacted, tuberculosis policy only had the passive Tuberculosis Prevention Law, which targeted those who were sick and transmitting the disease. 150,000 people die from tuberculosis every year, making the tuberculosis problem a serious social problem that has a big impact on people. Tuberculosis is a disease of the living environment, making the problem even more serious in Japan. The National Physical Strength Law especially targets tuberculosis in youth, and a system for early detection and early treatment is being developed. In addition to the construction of beds mentioned earlier, the cabinet also decided on the Outline of Tuberculosis Countermeasures in August of Showa 17. In order to provide rest for mild patients, 1,394 Health Training Centers will be established nationwide this year to promote active treatment. At the same time, general public screenings will be strengthened to prevent the spread of tuberculosis.

The Pharmaceutical Affairs Law, as part of the medical and health system, was promulgated in March of this year and is scheduled to be implemented this year. Similar to the medical law's regulations regarding doctors, it strengthens the national obligations of pharmacists. The sale and manufacture of medicines will all proceed from a national standpoint, with the goal of ensuring national health.

### United Rice Association Undergoing Reform, Current Status of Rice Distribution, United Association Issues Certificates for Second Batch of 150,000 Bags of Rice Yesterday, First Batch of Rice Distribution to Shanghai Disclosed

Yesterday, rice shops in the 18th and 2nd districts extracted household rice from the Roosevelt Warehouse and the Yaxing Warehouse on Lilan Road. It is expected that all of it can be extracted this morning and distributed universally from this afternoon, based on the 46th period rice purchase certificate, with each person purchasing one liter at a price of six yuan. The distribution will continue until the 15th of this month. A Central News Agency reporter learned that the household rice for this period is supplied from a branch grain center allocated as a temporary loan, because the Rice United Association still has no rice supply. The internal organization of the Grain Control Committee is currently being reformed.

Information on the First Batch of Rice Distribution

Shanghai News Agency: The Shanghai Rice United Association has completed the distribution of its first batch of rice. Yesterday, it received a shipping certificate from the Ministry of Food for the second batch of rice and has dispatched personnel to negotiate transportation. Because of the past delays in public food supply, efforts will be made to improve and speed up the process this time. The details of the distribution are as follows: The first batch of rice was designated by the Ministry of Food, including 20,000 bags from Yangzhou District, 30,000 bags from Huzhou District, 16,000 bags from the Songjiang Changjia District of Suzhou, 8,000 bags from Songjiang, 18,000 bags from Jia Pu, 8,000 bags from Jia Yu, 10,000 bags from Wuxi, 2,800 bags from Pinghu, 8,000 bags from Chongpu, 800 bags from Taicang, 16,000 bags from Jinshan, and 1,200 bags from Dangshu. Except for the 3,520 bags short from Yangzhou District due to transfer to Japanese conscripts, the 18,790 bags short from Huzhou District due to water transportation delays, the 4,960 bags short from Jinshan, and the 49 bags short from Zengshu, a total of 122,680 bags of rice were transported. All of them are brown rice and seven-part rice, but there is no red rice or japonica rice. The Shanghai Rice Distribution Association decided to distribute 68,246 bags to the First District Public Office, 33,696 bags to the Food Bureau, and 19,695 bags to the special institutions allocated by the Temporary Allocation Association. A total of 121,637 bags were distributed, with 1,044 bags in storage.

The Second Batch of Rice is Still Being Negotiated for Transportation. The association received the shipping certificates for the second batch of rice, totaling 150,000 bags, yesterday. The association has dispatched personnel to inquire about the distribution of unemployment in various places and will begin transportation soon. In the first batch, the Dakang Company, which was responsible for the transportation, was not without shortcomings due to the initial establishment. This month, the same situation should not occur again. Most of the United Associations in various places have not concentrated the rice in one place, and it is necessary to temporarily collect it during transportation, as well as to carry out inspections in a few areas that are delayed. It is hoped that the authorities will improve this.

Nanshi Has Universally Opened

The 22nd period of household rice allocation in the Nanshi District has been allocated by the City Government and the Food Bureau. Each person, regardless of age, is entitled to one liter of rice, sold at the same price of six yuan. All public offices in the Nanshi District have been ordered to handle the distribution. According to a Central News Agency reporter, the public offices are now distributing rice. Starting yesterday, rice purchase certificates will be universally reissued. After the deadline, the rice in that period will be invalid. Other districts will also issue and sell them separately in the coming days.

### Applications to Sell Must be Submitted When Registering Cloth, Otherwise Registration is Considered Invalid

The Commercial Control Association's Cloth Receiving Office is handling the registration of cloth applications. The intent of this cloth registration and supplementary registration is to be considerate of business difficulties and facilitate government collection of fees. According to the relevant provisions of the "Implementation Rules for Collecting Fees on Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth," all owners or occupants of cotton yarn and cotton cloth shall submit a request to the Commercial Control Association in accordance with the rules of the county in order to handle the matter. It is known that the Executive Yuan, in response to a request from the Ministry of Industry, approved that the Commercial Control Association, during the supplementary registration period, whether or not registration has already been completed, if an application for sale has already been submitted, the effect is deemed to be the same as immediate registration. If an application for sale is not submitted within the period, even if registration has already been completed, it will be considered invalid registration, so as to show restriction and facilitate fee collection. The Executive Yuan has approved the handling of the matter as argued and has transferred the order to the Commercial Control Association for implementation.

Registration of 500,000 Bags of Cloth

The National Commercial Control Association's office for buying cloth has been handling the supplementary registration procedures for cotton yarn and cotton cloth for several days. As of the day before yesterday (the 6th), it has been completed as scheduled. Yesterday, any cotton yarn and cotton cloth that has not been registered will be unconditionally confiscated once discovered by the authorities. It is learned that as of 5:00 p.m. the day before yesterday, the Commercial Control Association's office for buying cloth had completed the registration of approximately 320,000 bags of cloth. Japanese merchants had applied to the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Management Office of the Japanese Embassy for approximately 200,000 bags of registration. The total of the two is that there are currently more than 520,000 bags of cotton yarn and cotton cloth stored in Shanghai.

Methods for Taxing Cloth Purchases

Should the cloth purchased this time be subject to unified tax? The Commercial Control Association and the Tax Bureau have repeatedly negotiated on this matter. It has now been learned by reporters that regarding the taxation methods for this purchased cloth, the principles decided by the Ministry of Finance and the Director of the Tax Bureau are as follows: For cotton yarn and cotton cloth that has not yet been taxed upon leaving the factory, tax will be levied according to the purchase price, which will be temporarily recorded by the Commercial Control Association. For those that have already been taxed upon leaving the factory, there is no need to supplement the tax according to the purchase price. Since the cloth has now been nationalized, cloth that has been out of the factory for more than one year will be exempt from re-taxation. It is heard that the above taxation procedures are being drafted by the Tax Bureau and will be notified to the Commercial Control Association separately for implementation.

Planning and Implementing Rationing by Headcount

Datong News Agency: The office for buying cotton yarn and cotton cloth of the National Commercial Control Association, the quality and price of the cloth being purchased have been reviewed and determined at small group meetings convened separately by the Quality and Price Assessment Committee jointly organized by the Chinese and Japanese cloth purchasing agencies. According to Datong News Agency reporters who have learned from reliable sources, the relevant authorities are now actively planning to implement a system of cloth rationing by headcount, with prices cheaper than the market prices before the 6th. At the same time, it is also rumored that the quality of the cloth being rationed may be divided into different categories, and residents can freely choose one according to their gender, age, economic strength, and other factors.

### Talk by Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani

(Central News Agency, Shanghai Dispatch) After the Japanese Ambassador to China, Mr. Tani, arrived in Shanghai from Nanjing on the 3rd, he repeatedly held talks with the Commander of the Japanese Garrison in China, Mr. Yoshida, as well as the heads of various Japanese military and civilian organizations in the area, and powerful figures in the Chinese economic circles, including Finance Minister Zhou and Mayor Chen. He also inspected the construction of the new Shanghai after the recovery of the concessions, and the progress of emergency economic countermeasures, mainly the purchase of cotton yarn. He is scheduled to return to Nanjing today. Yesterday, at the Broadway Mansions, he met with a group of reporters and gave an important talk on the development of China and current political and economic issues, as follows:

Purchasing Yarn and Lowering Prices

"The purpose of my visit to Shanghai this time is to inspect the progress of the new Shanghai municipal administration after the recovery of the concessions, and the progress of emergency economic measures. Therefore, I met with Mayor Chen and other important figures. I am delighted to see the construction of the new Shanghai and the implementation of emergency economic measures proceeding smoothly. In particular, I deeply respect the National Government for the success of this major economic measure, thanks to the efforts of Chinese related parties and the Commerce and Trade Commission, and the assistance from the Japanese side. However, the mission of purchasing cotton yarn and its importance depend on how it will be handled in the future. What degree of contribution this major measure will make to lowering prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods will be clear depending on how China and Japan cooperate in the future. Mr. Honma expresses his earnest expectation that the authorities of China and Japan will make their best efforts. The return of the concessions or the implementation of emergency economic countermeasures is only one concrete manifestation of Japan's new policy towards China. From the perspective of the new policy towards China or the ultimate goal of the Greater East Asia, it is only a part of it. The construction of Greater East Asia is the manifestation of Japan's founding ideals. Concretely speaking, Japan's assistance to India, Burma, and the Philippines in achieving independence, its enabling India to participate in politics, its so-called assistance to Thailand in expanding its territory, and especially its persistent request to China for its own independence are all manifestations of Japan's ideals. There is no element of utilitarianism in this, and there is no other intention except to seek the coexistence and co-prosperity of all countries and all ethnic groups.

New Policy for Building East Asia

I firmly believe that this is the great path of Greater East Asia, and at the same time, it is the great path to world peace. Recently, the number of people in China who understand Japan's grand strategy and express resonance has greatly increased, and they are beginning to question the war efforts of the Chongqing side. This is a natural trend. Some Chinese warriors say that the Chinese revolution was successful, but construction failed. However, this failed construction work has been assisted by Japan, so Chinese people should deeply appreciate Japan's new policy. If the United States and Britain, as they say, respect the independence and freedom of other countries, then the United States and Britain should immediately advise the Chongqing side to quickly cooperate with Japan. No one in the world can raise objections to the ideal of building Greater East Asia. In the past, the United States and Britain, adhering to the Atlantic Charter, expressed to Song Ziwen the hope of reopening the Burma Road. Now they are advocating assisting the Chongqing side and shouting slogans of resisting Japan. All of this is enough to show their internal contradictions. They are in fact an obstacle to the construction of China, completely and blatantly revealing their ambition to destroy the billion-strong nations of East Asia. Given the attitude of the United States and Britain, the significance of the Greater East Asia War is very clear. Japan's ideal of building Greater East Asia by seeking the autonomy and independence of various countries is in stark contrast to their ambition to control East Asia. The difference between the two is extremely clear.

In addition, the purchase of Shanghai yarn has already had a positive impact on general prices. However, in order to maintain the low-price policy, it is necessary to take similar measures for important essential materials other than cotton yarn. Therefore, the government authorities are currently drafting a concrete plan, and I believe the price issue will gradually be resolved."

### Sixth Round of Household Sugar to be Sold Starting Today, Half a Catty for 2 Yuan and 35 Cents

The Shanghai Sugar Merchants Cooperative Business Office has recently received approval from the military distribution authorities to sell the sixth round of household sugar and foreign sugar starting today. Sugar will also be allocated to various industries for business needs. In order to alleviate the burden on food households, the sugar price will remain temporarily unchanged. The announcement from the district office is recorded as follows: From September 8th to September 18th of this year, citizens can purchase sugar with the No. 6 coupon of their sugar purchase permit. Retail stores should sell half a catty of white sugar (crystal white sugar or granulated white sugar) for 2 yuan and 35 cents upon receiving each No. 6 coupon marked with the store's number. Packaging will be charged separately. Retail taxes on white sugar will be temporarily waived. From September 8th to September 18th of this year, citizens can purchase sugar with the P coupon of their sugar purchase permit. Retail stores should sell two catties of white sugar (1,000 grams or approximately 2.2 pounds) for 9 yuan and 40 cents upon receiving each P coupon marked with the store's number. Packaging will be charged separately. Retail taxes on white sugar will be temporarily waived. The sugar distribution method for the Eighth District is completely the same as that of the First District.

### Construction in the First District: Two-Pronged Approach; Existing Mezzanines Not Forcibly Demolished; Rooftop Construction on Balconies Will Not Be Approved in the Future

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency who visited a responsible authority yesterday regarding the construction situation in the First District Public Works Department:

Conservation and Construction Simultaneously

Regarding public works construction in the First District, the current decision is to adopt a two-pronged approach of conservation and construction. The former focuses on completing unfinished projects, such as the underground drainage project along Dahua Road, which will be completed in the shortest possible time. The so-called conservation is by no means a static approach. Demolishing dilapidated buildings and repairing necessary projects require manpower and resources. Regarding new projects, it is not easy to carry them out during this wartime when material resources are generally scarce.

Private Construction Remains Unchanged

For example, the necessary raw materials for general buildings, such as cement, steel plates, stone tiles, and wood, are difficult to obtain. Large-scale construction projects can only be discussed after the economy improves and sources become smooth. In addition, the procedures for applying for permits for private buildings remain unchanged.

Dilapidated Buildings Will Be Demolished

All buildings that are朽 (dilapidated) and in danger of collapse, and that endanger public safety, will be ordered by the owners to be demolished and rebuilt to ensure safety if reported by citizens and verified by investigation. Regarding the demolition of mezzanines, due to the dense population and the difficulty in finding housing in Shanghai, those that have already been built and are inhabited will not be forcibly demolished for the time being unless reported by residents. Rooftop construction on balconies is strictly prohibited. Those that have already been built will not be investigated or banned unless reported. However, future reconstruction will not be approved.

### Minister of Propaganda Lin Returns to Nanjing Yesterday Afternoon

Minister of Propaganda Lin Bosheng, who recently came to Shanghai to preside over the China-Japan press forum and jointly hosted forums with Mayor Chen for the drama and cultural circles, has completed his mission and returned to Nanjing at 4 pm on the 7th.

### Cooperatives to Sell Second Batch of Goods Today

The Shanghai Citizens' Consumption Cooperative will distribute its second batch of goods, totaling twenty-one items, in ten districts starting today. According to the cooperative's general manager, Mr. Dong Kai, the quantity of goods obtained this time varies. However, in order to avoid crowding and ensure smooth promotion, the date of distribution is indicated on the notification slip. Members must collect the required goods at the designated date and distribution point. If the quantity is small and has been sold out, members who arrive later will not be able to purchase them. It is hoped that there will be no misunderstanding. The cooperative will prioritize the distribution to these members when the third batch is released to ensure fairness.

### Reception for the Departing and Incoming Naval Press Officers; Joint Banquet by the Propaganda Department and Various Newspapers

(Central News Agency Dispatch) The Municipal Propaganda Department, relevant propaganda agencies, and newspapers jointly hosted a farewell banquet for the outgoing Director of the Press Division of the Japanese Naval Fleet, Colonel Kamata, and welcomed the incoming Director, Colonel Matsushima. The banquet was held at the Cathay Hotel at 6 pm yesterday. The attendees included the outgoing Director of the Press Division of the Naval Fleet, Colonel Kamata, the incoming Director, Colonel Matsushima, Lieutenant Tanaka, Trustee Saka, Deputy Director of the Propaganda Department Feng Jie, Director of the Municipal Propaganda Department Liang Xiuyu, Director of the News Inspection Office Liu Shike, and representatives from various newspapers, including Xu Liqiu from the China-Japan Daily, Yang Huilang from the Central News Agency Shanghai Branch, Chen Bin (something) from the Shendu News Agency, Cheng Zhongquan from the Xinwen News Agency, Zhu Yongkang from the Guomin Xinming News, Lu Guangjie from the Ping News, and Wang Ping from the New China News, totaling approximately 30 people. First, the Deputy Director gave a speech, saying, "Colonel Kamata is our best friend, and Colonel Matsushima is a poet and has achieved many military accomplishments. He will also be China's dearest friend in the future. Facing our good friends, we only have a simple sentence: We wish Colonel Kamata all the best in the future and hope that Colonel Matsushima will be China's dearest friend." He raised a glass to wish both of them health. Then, Colonel Kamata delivered a speech, saying, "I am being transferred back to Japan this time, and I am very grateful for the warm hospitality of the Shanghai authorities in charge of propaganda today. I have been working in the Press Division for two years and have received your help. However, due to my limited talent, I have not made a significant contribution. I hope that you will cooperate with the new Director, Colonel Matsushima, and I hope that you will work even harder on propaganda work. I wish you all good health." Finally, Colonel Matsushima delivered a speech, saying, "When I arrived in Shanghai this time, my first thought was that Shanghai is my second hometown. Today, I hope that you will all cooperate more in the future."

Economic Commentary

### Talks with Various Industries

The Economic Office of the First District Office of Shanghai Special Municipality, in order to control prices and stabilize people's livelihood, has decided to convene talks with responsible persons of various industry associations starting today to exchange opinions on stabilizing prices. The first talks will be held today with responsible persons of the department store industry association, single department store association, and food industry association. This has a dual meaning. Originally, solving the price problem must start from the foundation, and industry associations are the foundation for setting price standards. Secondly, the priority for solving the price problem is the daily necessities of the people. Today, the Economic Office is first convening the three industries that are closely related to the daily necessities of the people. It can be seen that it is weighing the urgency and importance of the matter.

Communicating the opinions among various industries, especially communicating the opinions between the authorities and various industries, is what we have always advocated. More than a month ago, we also held a symposium with responsible persons of the Commerce and Trade Commission. At that time, we had a common opinion, which was to hope that we could have more contact and discussions with responsible persons from the industrial and commercial associations. The significance of this coincides with the talks with various industries convened by the Economic Office this time.

What we hope for in the talks with various industries is that, in an atmosphere of mutual understanding, the authorities understand the inside story of various industries, and the various industries understand the good intentions of the authorities - to frankly exchange opinions, in order to achieve a realistic result in stabilizing prices.

### Registration of Sino-Japanese Joint Ventures Directly Handled by the Ministry of Industry; Order to Send to Local Government for Record

Applications for registration of companies should be submitted by the competent government in the area to the Ministry of Industry in accordance with the company registration rules to obtain a license.

The National Government has returned to the capital (name illegible) All the files of the former Ministry of Industry have been transferred to the Ministry of Industry for takeover and continued processing. Therefore, for companies that have been directly approved and registered by the former Ministry of Industry, the applications for capital restructuring and other registration of changes, the local government has no case to (name illegible). For the sake of convenience, history has

Referred to the old case

The Ministry of Industry will continue to handle them directly. Now, Sino-Japanese merchants are jointly establishing companies, and they are still following the precedent, first directly applying to the Ministry of Industry for registration and issuing a license. The Ministry of Industry approved the organization of the companies, or to meet the needs of society, or to use the original factory base and machinery, and all must obtain the permission of the competent authorities of the friendly country to operate. The circumstances are special, and the business is important. At this time, the production, transportation, and sale of materials are subject to control. If ordered to follow the procedures to be handled by the local government

Ministry of Industry

The business operation may not be decided by the local government, or there may be a need to contact other relevant agencies first, which cannot be resolved by the local government. It is feared that the transshipment will delay the opportunity. The Ministry of Industry (name illegible) is the Executive Yuan. The application for registration of this type of Sino-Japanese joint venture should be approved in accordance with the precedents, and handled by the ministry. After the Ministry of Industry approves the registration and issues the license, it will send a copy of the registration documents to the competent government in the place where the company is located for record.

It is also reported that among the raw materials (coal dust) allocated to coal briquette factories, 80% can be used to manufacture coal briquettes, and 20% is (name illegible) for small pieces (lump form).

### Economic Bureau Investigators Are Equipped With Badges

According to a notice from the Economic Bureau, recently, there are unscrupulous people who are borrowing the name of the Economic Bureau to investigate whether various shops and factories have registered. If there are unregistered ones, they will solicit business and offer to handle the registration. The previous situation is very hateful. Therefore, we hereby notify all Baojia chiefs to inform the shops and factories in their jurisdiction to pay attention.

Furthermore, the personnel dispatched by the Economic Bureau, in addition to having badges, also have travel permits. The travel permit is stamped with the director's signature and the seal of the issuing department for verification.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday, the market continued to fluctuate. The current issue was firm at the start, with the final price at noon slightly better than the previous day. The Wuchen issue fluctuated. There were quoted prices for the other three issues (A, B, and C), but no transactions.

Grains: Market prices generally trended lower, as new rice and grain from the producing areas had entered the market. Shipments to Shanghai were steady, and rice shops were more willing to sell, causing prices to gradually decline. Oil grains also declined as concerns rose about potential control measures in the Tianjin-Hebei area. Those holding goods were generally unwilling to hold them for long, fearing full control in the future, so many sought to sell, causing prices to fall sharply.

Medicinal Materials: Sales remained sluggish. Local shops had sufficient inventory and were not proactive in purchasing. Customers were also uninterested due to inconvenient shipping. The market showed no signs of improvement.

Southern Goods: Due to very few shipments of dried longan from Xiamen, arrivals were scarce. Therefore, new crops would not be available in the short term. Only a small amount of old stock had arrived, so the market remained tight. As for dried longan pulp, arrivals were also limited, and most of the inventory was in cold storage. With high shipping costs, the cost price was even more expensive, resulting in only a few transactions at high asking prices.

Sugar: According to banking sources, a batch of Fujian sugar was expected to arrive, which would slightly increase the supply of sugar in the city.

Woolen Fabrics: Except for goods from established sources, which remained stable, most other woolen fabrics frequently declined. Yesterday, Malan Ni, Tospine, Watani, Straight Tweed, Ivory Ni, and Guang Mao Hua Ni were all sluggish, and the market was weak and lifeless, leading to significant price drops within the limit.

Daily Necessities: Stable mixed with unstable. Buying and selling remained slow. Phoenix brand matches showed a slight improvement. Soap trading remained quiet, and there was little change in foreign candles. British American Tobacco, Old Knife, and Fairy cigarettes were still active in sales. Japanese cigarettes were flat and weak, while other miscellaneous brands were ignored.

### Japan's Wartime Social Policy

(Continued from page 2) Expansion of the Social Insurance System

The Insurance Bureau, established for the purpose of comprehensively managing various social insurance facilities, was established on the same day as the Ministry of Health and Welfare. At that time, social insurance included simple life insurance, health insurance, and workers' accident compensation liability insurance. These insurance undertakings became the basis for the comprehensive expansion of various social insurance systems thereafter. National Health Insurance, Employee Health Insurance, Seafarer Insurance, and Workers' Pension Insurance were established one after another, completing the extremely brilliant development of Japan's social insurance system.

The Health Insurance system was implemented from January of Showa 2 (1927), and the Employee Health Insurance system was initiated from June of Showa 15 (1940). These two types of health insurance fully exercised the function of short-term insurance for workers. In April of Showa 18 (1943), they were unified, and their content was greatly expanded. The Workers' Accident Compensation Liability Insurance system, which did not fall under the Health Insurance system, was based on the Workers' Accident Compensation Law for workers in civil engineering and construction, and was the insurance undertaker's compensation responsibility. It began to be implemented from January of Showa 7 (1932) and proceeded very smoothly. In addition, regarding farmers and fishermen who were not the object of various social programs, the National Health Insurance system was closed from July of Showa 13 (1938). Because this type of insurance system targets the majority of the population, special attention was paid to its popularity. By the end of Showa 10 (1935), there were 4,379 cooperative unions with over 1,432,000 insured individuals. This year, it is planned to have all the remaining farmers and fishermen complete the National Health Insurance system (a three-part plan). The Seafarer Insurance system, which targets seafarers, was implemented from June of Showa 15 (1940) and has made significant progress. This year, the Seafarer Insurance Law was also amended to ensure that seafarers are fully protected during wartime. The Workers' Pension Insurance system, which is desired by the general public, is a unique goal of social policy and was finally fully implemented from June of Showa 17 (1942). Its subsequent popularization has been quite successful. With the realization of the above various social insurance programs, Japan's social insurance system has been temporarily completed. What remains is the expansion of the content of each insurance system. Regarding this point, gradual revisions are being made, and future developments can be expected.

Improvement and Protection of Life

Previous social policies targeted the system of protection programs, which Japan had already put in place before the China Incident. That is, regarding relief, disaster relief, mother and child protection, and juvenile protection, the Relief Law, Disaster Protection Law, Water Disaster Relief Law, Mother and Child Protection Law, Juvenile Protection Law, Child Abuse Prevention Law, and Juvenile Law have already been implemented. In addition, regarding the social education sector, facilities such as correcting customs, harmonizing public sentiment, and judicial protection have also been opened. However, in today's wartime, the meaning of these laws and facilities is not as important as before. The demand to enter the war with all-out effort does not permit individual capital to sacrifice the weak in pursuit of profit. Social evils resulting from the survival of the fittest under liberalism are gradually decreasing. As a result of the national labor force being in a state of complete storage, the social relief problem caused by unemployment has been largely resolved. However, in terms of relief, it is necessary to establish a wartime disaster insurance system to directly withstand the destructive power of the war. Regarding this point, the peak is also expanding and strengthening various measures and legal systems. Military assistance, which previously belonged to the field of social relief, has now been organized into a large system and is unrelated to this. The improvement of national life that inevitably occurs in the process of building a highly national defense state leads to the realization of a completely new social policy, and its guiding principle, through its revision process, boils down the handling of all problems to the enhancement of combat power. For example, the housing problem, due to restrictions on construction materials and increases in building prices, the focus of new housing construction must be distributed and the burden of construction costs reduced at the same time. For example, the creation of housing management groups, or the improvement of the national clothing life, due to the enactment of the National Clothing Order and the designation of standard clothing, in order to prepare for clothing prevention, are all manifestations of this method of handling. The social policy significance of the rationing system for food and other materials, even if the purpose of the self-reliance of the controlled economy is put aside, is extremely important. If social policy still starts from its original meaning and aims to solve the social problems caused by the shortcomings of modern economic policy, it cannot fundamentally be entrusted to controlled economic policy. From this point of view, the meaning of the mission borne by social policy in the new positive field can be clearer! (The proportion of labor policy in social policy is the largest, but everything here is not far-reaching): (Xiang: Translated from "World League Weekly" No. 1222)

Social Services

### Collection of Chaozhou-Shantou Funds Ends; Winter Relief Campaign Begins

Donations in August were not very enthusiastic.

This office collected a total of 4,441.20 yuan in Chaozhou-Shantou accounts, which has been sent to the Chaozhou-Shantou Disaster Relief Association. The collection will be stopped from now on, and future donations from all sectors are requested to be sent to No. 105 Yanghang Street, inside the Chaozhou Guild Hall. As for the eighteen landscape paintings of China's eighteen provinces painted by the old man Xing Fen, which were donated by Shao Geng's donation to the disaster relief charity sale, they were sold for 36,000 yuan. In addition to 30,000 yuan for Chaozhou-Shantou relief, the remaining 6,000 yuan was allocated to Shangyu emergency relief according to Mr. Xi's order, and the money has been sent to Meta Enterprise Company at No. 159 Beijing Road for collection.

In addition, this office has been affected by the donation campaigns for emergency accounts in North China and South China in recent months, resulting in not much income from various donations. However, with more and more people waiting for assistance and less and less savings, the weather is turning cold in the blink of an eye, and the poor and sick will inevitably be trapped in poverty and cold. It is hoped that kind people from all walks of life will donate as soon as possible as the winter account fund for this office, so that the poor and sick will be very grateful. The income and expenditure report for August is as follows:

Poverty Relief Fund: The balance at the end of July was 47,284.70 yuan. The income in August was 3,270.00 yuan. The expenditure was 1,200.00 yuan. The balance was 49,354.70 yuan.

Small Loan Fund: The balance at the end of July was 6,725.00 yuan. The expenditure in August was 850.00 yuan. The balance was 5,875.00 yuan.

Small Education Medical Assistance Fund: The balance at the end of July was 40,857.50 yuan. The income in August was 2,000.00 yuan. The expenditure was 3,726.00 yuan. The balance was 39,131.50 yuan

### Expenses of Various Adoption Organizations Soar

Due to the recent soaring prices, the expenses of municipal adoption organizations have increased sharply, making it difficult to maintain them. According to Ding Bingnan, the general affairs director of the Chinese Child Welfare Association, the association runs two educational and upbringing institutions, accommodating more than 400 children. According to the average educational and upbringing expenses from January to June of this year, each child costs about 150 yuan per month. However, according to the average statistics for the most recent July and August, each child costs 265 yuan per month, which is almost double the educational and upbringing expenses per child per month compared to the first half of the year.

### The Eighth District Tram Fare Increase Problem

The reconstruction of Greater Shanghai is what every citizen of Shanghai hopes for, and the most practical and urgent thing is to stabilize people's livelihoods - to lower prices.

Recently, due to the purchase of gauze, all prices seem to be on the downstream scarf. At this time, the French-owned Leiche in the Eighth District actually raised prices again on September 1st. In the past, we were unable to intervene because there was no unified government, but now such a thing can happen, and it is happening at a time when Leiche is promoting the reduction of prices. It is really incomprehensible to us citizens that the authorities would approve their price increase.

Leiche in the Eighth District has no reason to raise prices, regardless of any excuse, because before this price increase, it was already more expensive than the tram in the First District, and the practice of skimming profits was not as popular as in the First District, so the income should have had less leakage, and all expenses were not necessarily greater than in the First District. In short, this price increase is unreasonable, and it is hoped that the authorities will correct it. (Sun Shunhua)
