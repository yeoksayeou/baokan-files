### On the Relationship Between Currency and Hoarding

Mr. Yoshida Seiji, a member of the Japanese economic mission to China, published an article in the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun after returning to Japan, regarding the problem of commodity prices in China. (A translation of the article appears in today's edition of this newspaper.) Mr. Yoshida previously served as the head of the Shanghai branch of Mitsubishi Bank of Japan and is currently the head of the research department at the head office. He has always been highly regarded for his familiarity with China's economy and finance.

After carefully reading his article, we couldn't help but break out in a cold sweat, admiring how he, in just a few days of observation, pinpointed the focus of our high commodity prices, directly hitting the nail on the head. It shows how deeply and accurately they study our economy, unlike our own casual and even blind attitude.

Mr. Yoshida concluded: "The reason for the high commodity prices in Central China does not lie in simple economic principles." He also said: "The abnormal phenomena in China's economic circles recently, especially the high commodity prices, cannot be attributed solely to economic principles." As for the reasons beyond economic principles, he believes they are the psychological effects of the public, with the most powerful forces dominating public psychology being the Chinese public's observation of the global war situation and the effectiveness of the economic conspiracies orchestrated by the enemy. We believe that the reasons beyond economic principles are better described as "insufficient political power" rather than "the psychological effects of the public." Perhaps Mr. Yoshida's reluctance to criticize Chinese politics is a matter of courtesy, placing the responsibility entirely on the public's psychology.

Indeed, the public's psychology can cause commodity prices to rise beyond economic principles. However, the formation of the public's psychology also has its reasons. The general public's psychology is originally like a flawless piece of jade, completely shifting with social customs. If social customs value sentiment over law, then the public's psychology will also form valuing sentiment over law. If social customs only care about private interests and disregard public welfare, then the public's psychology will also form only caring about private interests and disregarding public welfare. Zeng Guofan once said: "The depth or shallowness of customs, what does it rely on? It relies on the behavior of one or two people!" Social customs can influence the public's psychology. Therefore, creating good social customs is particularly important. Thus, government officials and social leaders have an unshirkable responsibility for establishing good public customs.

For example, regarding the problem of high commodity prices, the lack of resources and currency inflation are economic reasons. Hoarding and speculation are social customs. Hoarding and speculation were initially led by upper-class elements, gradually becoming a social custom. Upper-class individuals hoard for speculation and seek exorbitant profits, while ordinary people hoard to prevent famine and price increases. As a result, all goods are hoarded, and everything rises in price. Upper-class individuals hoard large quantities, and as the tide rises, they reap huge profits. Ordinary people hoard small quantities, and their goal of preventing famine and price increases ultimately cannot be sustained. Instead, they suffer the bitter fruit of high prices, while the practice of hoarding has become widespread. Therefore, to correct the public's psychology, it is necessary to first improve social customs. And social customs, as deeply ingrained as they are today, cannot be improved by the empty words and exhortations of one or two people. It is necessary to use political power and take strict measures to achieve a swift and comprehensive change, with everyone having a sense of caution, and social customs will be renewed from then on, and the people's psychology will be corrected accordingly. This is the way to eliminate the causes of commodity price problems beyond economic principles.

Secondly, we believe that the currency problem, an economic cause, is also an important factor affecting the public's psychology. Moreover, whether currency credit can be stabilized and whether the public's psychology can develop trust are closely related to whether hoarding and speculation can be effectively suppressed. Because the crime of hoarding is enough to turn resources that are balanced in supply and demand, or even oversupplied, into a shortage phenomenon where demand exceeds supply, fundamentally overturning the normal role of resources in commodity prices, thus causing commodity prices to skyrocket. This directly affects the decline in the purchasing power of currency. Commodity prices rise step by step, and the purchasing power of currency declines step by step, which also means that the public's trust in currency weakens step by step. Even if the currency issuance is absolutely reasonable and not a malignant inflation, it will inevitably be affected by hoarding, fundamentally overturning the normal role of currency in commodity prices. Therefore, if hoarding and speculation cannot be completely eradicated, sufficient resources will become scarce, and stable currency will become an inflated phenomenon. Resources and currency will forever suffer unjust grievances.

Currency credit occupies a very natural, very widespread, and very important position in the public's psychology. It can also be said that the degree of public trust in the government that represents currency credit plays a decisive role. Therefore, the government should not only eliminate hoarding and adjust commodity prices for the sake of people's livelihood but also eliminate hoarding to strengthen its own power and gain public trust, thus establishing currency credit in the public's psychology. In this way, for its own reputation, currency must be settled with "hoarding"!

Peiping, 8th (Central News Agency): The North China Provincial and Municipal Mayors' Conference was held at the Diplomatic Building here at 9:30 am on the 8th. Attendees from the provinces and cities included Governor Du of Hebei Province, Governor Tian of Henan Province, Governor Tang of Shandong Province, Governor Feng of Shanxi Province, Mayor Zhou of Beijing Municipality, Mayor Zhao of Qingdao Municipality, Mayor Wang of Tianjin Municipality, and others. From the Political Affairs Commission, there were Chairman Wang and the supervising officials of various General Offices. During the meeting, Chairman Wang first delivered an address, generally stating that the National Government, in order to adapt to Japan's new policy towards China, has decided to promote new construction in North China for a period of three months starting in September and that all the people of North China should deeply understand the intentions of friendly nations and work together to solve the most pressing food problem at present, so as to implement the grain policy promoted by the government, and to implement measures such as promoting price stabilization, transportation, and distribution, so that the people's food can be sufficient. At the same time, Chairman Wang also encouraged the provincial and municipal mayors to work hard. Then, detailed instructions were given on general administrative affairs, reference materials, commodity prices, and other issues. Next, the supervising officials reported separately on the matters they were responsible for. After a short break at 1 pm, the meeting continued, exchanging views on the grain problem and various strategies for the construction of North China, and finally adjourned at 5 pm.

Peiping, 8th (Central News Agency): The National Government's North China Political Affairs Commission held a meeting of provincial and municipal mayors at the Diplomatic Building on the 8th. Chairman Wang immediately stated the policy direction and resolved to rectify the North China grain problem. The general idea was that since the establishment of the North China Commodity and Price Handling Committee, the grain policy has moved from the preparatory phase to the implementation phase, the key points of which are to increase production and to control purchasing. The future operational strategy will be based on the opinions of the provincial and municipal mayors and the local situation, establishing a suitable direction, and the resolution of the people's food problem will be the basis of all administrative measures. The Japanese authorities have stated their determination to vigorously assist North China in solving the grain problem. However, the operation of grain is a major responsibility of the people of North China. It is hoped that local officials will make the greatest efforts to rectify North China's grain situation, so as to relieve the people's worries and secure the foundation of the country.

### The Center of the Eastern Front Shifts to the Kharkov Area; German Troops' Clever Defensive Tactics Make Soviet Attacks Futile and Sacrificial

Stockholm, 8th (Central News Agency): Since the German troops on the Eastern Front retreated from Orel on the night of the 4th, the center of the Eastern Front has shifted to the Kharkov area. In that direction, the Soviet troops have recently actively mobilized powerful tank and infantry units, launching fierce attacks on the German outer defensive areas of Kharkov. According to news from the front line on the night of the 7th, the Soviet troops are currently concentrating their main forces, attempting to encircle Kharkov from Gotnya, northeast of Kharkov, via Bieber Galoret along the Donets River to Tiyuguyevo. However, due to the clever defensive tactics of the German troops, this move by the Soviet troops is only sacrificing their strength in vain. According to the German authorities' announcement on the 7th, the Soviet troops are gradually pressing towards the Galoret area and have begun a new offensive in the Tiyuguyevo area, southeast of Kharkov, to attack Kharkov from both sides. Based on this, it can be seen that the battle for Kharkov will become even more intense in the future.

### The Anti-Axis Forces in Sicily Make Little Military Progress; British Troops Attacking in the Central Atna Valley Suffer Heavy Losses from German Artillery Fire

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency): According to the General News Agency, as of yesterday afternoon, the situation in Sicily remained unchanged. On the eastern front, General Montgomery's vanguard is trying to break through the German artillery fire net and clear the German positions on the southern slope of Mount Etna, which are guarded by landmines. British and American warships are bombarding the coastal roads and nearby German positions. In the center, American and Canadian troops are continuing to advance, attempting to break through the area west and southwest of Trogina. Enemy troops who attacked on the previous day were repelled by the Axis forces and suffered considerable losses. American troops attacking along the northwestern coast of Sicily have made little progress despite the assistance of the Navy. It is believed that the Allied command is conducting a large-scale troop deployment, the purpose of which seems to be to send reinforcements to the central front, as the number of Allied casualties is very high and urgently needs to be replenished.

Berlin, 8th (Central News Agency): According to the Berlin News Agency correspondent in Sicily, Beller, the activities on the Sicilian front on Friday have diminished in intensity. As the German and Italian forces moved into new positions to shorten the front line, the American and Canadian forces did not eagerly pursue them. The American military observers' report that the Canadian troops are advancing slowly also applies to the American troops. In the area of Viana Gavila, only localized battles occurred. News came that British troops in the area launched an attack on the highway leading to Etna from two strongholds in the central Simeto Valley. When the British troops approached the winding mountain road, the German rear guard fired from the mountains and suffered heavy losses, with the British troops being blocked on the highway clogged with wrecked vehicles.

### Investigation into the Problem of Commodity Prices in China

—Yoshida Seiji

It has been four years since I left China. This time, I unexpectedly became a member of the Sino-Japanese economic exchange mission, revisiting the old place. The traces of the drastic changes in these four years have become objects of amazement. The inside and outside of Shanghai and Nanjing have been renovated and enriched, showing a sign of restoration. The desolation after the disasters I saw four years ago has now disappeared. What made me most happy was that the Chinese people I knew said to me:

"Recently, we have begun to understand the true intentions of Japan. Today, all doubts have been dispelled. There is no hindrance in dealing with Japanese people, and business seems to be going very smoothly."

The overall situation is optimistic

The recent surge in commodity prices in China is indeed an alarming phenomenon, and many Chinese people are worried about it. I am by no means completely opposed to this pessimistic view. But from the overall perspective, I prefer to take an optimistic view. At least I can say that the future of the Chinese economy is by no means easily collapsing. If appropriate measures are taken in the future, I believe it will inevitably move towards revival, stability, and improvement.

Now, I will briefly describe the reasons for my optimism from the perspective of practical observation.

Shanghai is unprecedentedly prosperous

One night, I was invited to a banquet at the International Hotel near the Shanghai Racecourse. The table was filled with delicacies that could not be finished. Stepping out of the banquet hall, the ordinary young men and women were crowded in the dancehall, listening to the melodious music and dancing merrily. They did not stint spending a hundred or two hundred yuan on a plate of dishes. Stepping out of the International Hotel onto the street, cars, rickshaws, and pedicabs were lined up in a long queue waiting. I walked alone to the Cathay Hotel, where I was staying. It was about half-past nine to ten o'clock, and there were still many people on the road. Most of the shops were already closed, but the ones that were open were all restaurants. Even the shops that had closed had their display windows brightly lit, displaying various products that were not available in Tokyo, with shockingly high prices. It is no exaggeration to say that Shanghai is benefiting from unprecedented prosperity, and the owners of goods are increasing the value of their assets every day.

Agricultural resources are also rich

This spring, a company employee who had served as a doorman for many years died. The company was asked to donate more than a thousand yuan. His only son, who was only 20 years old, received this amount and immediately used it to buy soap, becoming rich due to the recent rise in commodity prices. As a result, his life was far more comfortable than when his father was alive. The rise in commodity prices is not limited to urban areas. It is also the case in the rural areas of the interior, and high-priced goods in the interior account for the majority. A friend of mine recently went to Jiangsu and Anhui to inspect the actual situation in the rural areas. Everywhere he went, there was no shortage of resources. It was only because the commodity prices and purchasing methods were not good that people stored resources instead of selling them. Moreover, the people's hearts were very peaceful, and they were very friendly to the Japanese, and they liked to invite the Japanese to eat with them.

Perhaps the people in mainland Japan will misunderstand the above, and there may be reasons for skepticism. At the same time, if the people in mainland Japan are not familiar with the above situation, the basis for judging the reality of China will be wrong.

The commodity price situation is complicated

In short, the current state of the Chinese economy is very complicated and difficult to understand. In terms of the situation where commodity prices rise by thousands in an instant, it is difficult to prevent the rise. Judging from the general rules of economic phenomena, the principle of rising commodity prices should be due to insufficient resources and increased currency issuance. But the current commodity prices in China are not enough to explain this. Examining the resources, there is no absolute state of shortage. Therefore, it can be inferred that there is a large amount of hoarding. Cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and cooking oil, which have a relatively large inventory and no urgent need, have risen more drastically than urgently needed items and items that are in short supply. For example, when there is malignant currency inflation, it is generally believed that food rice is the fastest and most drastic item to rise in price, but the price of rice is lower than that of other commodities, and the extent of its increase is not very drastic. Also, from the perspective of the region, the commodity prices in the city and the commodity prices in the interior are lacking in principled correlation. The trend of rising commodity prices in the interior seems to be more serious than in the city.

### The Situation of Rice Leaving the Warehouse in This Allocation Period; Remarks by the Chairman of the Joint Operation Society

Shanghai News Agency: Yesterday, there was a rumor that the Shanghai United Operation Society requested an increase in the price of rice for the 43rd phase of household rice in the first and second districts and did not hand over the warehouse receipts, causing the rice shops to be unable to pick up the rice. A Shanghai News Agency reporter, considering that this matter concerns the food of the people in this port, went to inquire about the truth of the matter from Lu Wenshao, Chairman of the Shanghai District Rice and Grain United Operation Society, who said the following: "Regarding the sections reported in the newspapers, they are all inaccurate. The determination of the price and the allocation of the quantity of rice transported by our society are all decided and ordered by the Shanghai Food Allocation Adjustment Committee. Our society cannot decide on its own. The so-called failure to hand over the warehouse receipts is even more unfounded. After receiving the order from the Adjustment Committee, the rice transported by our society has been allocated in full, and the rice shops have already picked up the goods from the Xingye Warehouse on the 7th. However, there was this inaccurate news disclosed in the evening newspapers on the 7th. At this time of year when the new crop is not yet harvested and the old crop is running out, and the people's food is difficult, it is enough to agitate people's hearts and stimulate the price of rice. It is also contrary to the government's painstaking efforts to maintain the people's food. Even today (the 8th), which is Sunday, the warehouse is still shipping goods as usual, and our society is still working as usual. The saying that the warehouse receipts have not been handed over is definitely not the truth."

### The Director of the Economic Affairs Department Talks About Thrift and Commodity Prices

Chen Riping, Director of the Economic Affairs Department of the First District Public Office, told a Thames News reporter yesterday that in order to suppress commodity prices in the future, he has decided to conduct a thorough study of the economic situation and asked all residents of the city to cooperate with the authorities as much as possible and make another attempt to stabilize commodity prices. If everyone can be thrifty and increase production so that hoarding households can come out, the current economic situation is expected to improve. Regarding the punishment of those who hoard and make exorbitant profits, Chen advocated strictness but said that the scope of such penalties must be decided by the government. The scope of the Economic Affairs Department's administration is much broader than the old Bureau of Works' Materials Control Department, which shows that the authorities are eager to solve the commodity price problem.

### Commander Yoshida of the Japanese Fleet in China Returns to Shanghai

According to news from the press department of the Japanese Fleet in China, Commander Yoshida of the Fleet in China has been inspecting the various units in Weihaiwei, Zhifu, and Lianyungang since the 4th of this month. The work has now been completed, and he returned to Shanghai on the 8th.

### Good Hobby Society Auctions Sun Yat-sen's Surviving Calligraphy; Mr. He Jialin's Righteous Act, the Son of Mr. He Zhensheng

Because his father had done many charitable deeds during his lifetime, in order to carry on his father's legacy, he specially handed over two pieces of calligraphy by Sun Yat-sen, which his father had treasured, to the Good Hobby Exhibition Society for auction, with a price of 30,000 yuan. He designated 20,000 yuan to be donated to the relief of poor children handled by the newspaper's social service office, and 10,000 yuan to relieve poor relatives and friends in He's hometown. He is benevolent, happy to do good, and worthy of admiration. Sun Yat-sen's calligraphy is a rare treasure. It is hoped that it will not be missed.

### City Thrift Movement: Originator Meeting of "Thrift Day" Today

The Shanghai News Federation, in order to strengthen national power during wartime and correct social morals, initiated a thrift movement. After extensive publicity, it has aroused enthusiastic responses from all parties and achieved significant results. The Federation strives to further strengthen the thrift movement and promote thorough implementation among all citizens. A thrift committee was convened a few days ago, deciding to invite the local cloth merchant association, the Citizen Welfare Association, the Federation of Industry and Commerce, the Bankers Association, the Money Dealers Association, the Baojia Committee, the City Christian Youth Association, the City Journalists Association, the City Women's Association, and other powerful organizations to jointly initiate and organize the "Shanghai City Thrift Movement Committee." The first originator meeting will be held on Thrift Day (the 9th) at the conference room of the News Federation at 160 Edward Road.

### Preventing Hoarding and Profiteering of Medicines: Organizing a Rationing Cooperative; Pharmaceutical Factory Products Will Be Sold Directly to Patients

Medicines are essential for patients. However, due to manipulation by speculators, prices have soared, making it impossible for patients to afford them, which has a profound and significant impact on society. The Municipal Government has carefully studied countermeasures to alleviate the suffering of the people. According to news from relevant national sources, the municipal authorities and the pharmaceutical industry are currently planning to organize a Central China Pharmaceutical Rationing and Control Cooperative. The members of the cooperative will be pharmaceutical manufacturers, pharmaceutical importers, and pharmaceutical retailers. The capital has been pre-determined to be 30 million yuan, and it is expected to be established this month. The organizational structure will be a committee system. Although pharmaceutical retailers will be allowed to join, they will be restricted. It is reported that after the establishment of the cooperative, products from pharmaceutical factories will be sold directly to retail stores and then to patients, avoiding unscrupulous merchants hoarding and profiteering.

### National Government's Declaration of War

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War in December of the year before last, the National Government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with its friendly nation, Japan. Since then, it has embarked on a New National Movement, engaged in safeguarding public order and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of enhancing national power and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, countries such as Britain and the United States continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, becoming increasingly aggressive. They have even colluded with elements from Chongqing to participate in the so-called Anglo-American war effort, sending troops to Burma and India to have East Asians kill East Asians. Recently, their forces have been successively defeated by the land, sea, and air forces of our friendly nation, Japan, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost. They are now resorting to even more cunning schemes. They are also jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's controlled areas and instigate elements from Chongqing to constantly harass us in order to hinder the progress of various construction projects. They even directly use their own planes, based in Chongqing, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, harming civilians. The elements in Chongqing, willingly driven by Britain and the United States, are shamefully acting as rebels against East Asia. Britain and the United States, with their deliberate and meticulous planning for East Asia, are doing everything they can to sow discord and division in order to achieve their ultimate goal of annexation. This is something that the nations of East Asia should be united against. The National Government hereby declares that, from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States. It will devote all its strength to cooperate with its friendly nation, Japan, to sweep away the brutality of Britain and the United States, in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchuria and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share a common desire for the prosperity of East Asia. In the future, they should further cooperate with each other in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. Germany and Italy, our friendly nations, have been dealing with the forces of Britain and the United States in the West for many years, and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and should coordinate with them in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our citizens should know that this is the only time to realize the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the grand vision of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity, and the attainment of world peace all depend on this. Let us unite as one, work together, and carry out this great mission of the era!

January 9, Year 32 of the Republic of China Chairman Wang Zhaoming

### Thrift and Savings Week Starts Today: Banks Accepting Deposits

Regarding the issue of promoting thrift and savings, industrial and commercial circles have unanimously promoted it. Japanese banks have been accepting thrift savings deposits since last month. It is reported that Chinese banks and money houses, in order to respond accordingly, are following the five implementation measures decided by the Joint Conference of Money Dealers. It is stipulated that the period from the 8th of each month onwards will be Thrift and Savings Week within Shanghai. The business hours of each bank will be extended by one hour. This extended time is specifically for accepting thrift savings deposits. According to reporters' inquiries with banks and money houses, the first Thrift and Savings Week will start today (the 9th), Monday, and will end on Saturday, the 14th. Due to the one-hour extension of business hours, the business hours from Monday to Friday will be until 4:00 PM, and on Saturday until 2:00 PM. Each bank will set up a special thrift savings group. Anyone can apply to open a thrift savings account in accordance with the regulations. Both fixed-term and current accounts are available, and the interest rate is higher than ordinary deposits in order to encourage savings. The use of thrift savings funds will be handled in accordance with government laws and regulations.

It is also reported that Japanese banks in China, including Yokohama Specie Bank, Bank of Taiwan, Sumitomo Bank, Mitsui Bank, Teikoku Bank, Bank of Chosen, Hankow Bank, Shanghai Bank, and Japan Hypothec Bank, are also responding to the thrift savings movement. In addition to extending the working hours of the deposit department by one hour each day, they are also giving prize coupons for fixed-term deposits during the promotion week. The first prize is 5,000 yuan, and there are dozens of other prizes.

### Ten Banks and Money Houses, Including Zhonghua, Increased Capital Last Month

In order to rectify financial institutions and effectively promote financial control, the Ministry of Finance has specifically stipulated that the capital amount of banks and money houses (i.e., those organized as limited liability companies) must be increased to at least 6 million yuan, with the paid-up amount being 3 million yuan. For ordinary commercial banks also engaged in trust business, the capital amount must be at least 5 million yuan (3 million yuan for bank funds and 2 million yuan for the trust department). If the legal requirements are not met by the deadline, they will be ordered to merge or suspend operations. Therefore, after receiving the order, various banks and money houses have successively implemented capital increases. According to reporters' inquiries, the capital increases of various banks and money houses last month are as follows: Zhonghua Bank increased by 3 million yuan, Tailin Money House increased by 2 million yuan, Zhongda Commercial Bank increased by 1.5 million yuan, Zhenya Commercial Savings Bank increased by 6 million yuan, Tongji Bank increased by 3 million yuan, Kaitai Money House increased by 2.5 million yuan, Wanchun Bank increased by 4 million yuan, Wufang Money House increased by 5 million yuan, China Enterprise Bank increased by 3 million yuan, and Dayou Money House increased by 4 million yuan.

### Authorities' Strict Measures Effective: Yarn and Cloth Prices Plummet

Inventory Exceeds 600,000 Bales; Brokers Intervene in Transactions

According to the person in charge of the Yarn and Cloth Industry Association yesterday: Recently, the authorities have made unremitting efforts to clear cotton yarn and cloth inventory, and domestic traders have been severely threatened. They have been lowering prices to sell, but buyers are not willing to add more stock. As a result, there is little demand for large quantities of spot goods, supply exceeds demand, and market prices have plummeted. Cotton yarn and cloth are essential items for citizens, and in recent years, cotton production has decreased, attracting the attention of merchants who hoard and speculate. Now that the authorities' measures have achieved significant results, it is expected that the cotton yarn and cloth market will remain stable for a long time.

Inventory Reaches Over 600,000 Bales

It is also reported that the total amount of cotton yarn and cloth stored in this city still reaches more than 600,000 bales. These inventories, in addition to being gradually released into the market by the various operating firms and companies from their warehouses, are also held by domestic traders who are not engaged in the industrial production of cotton yarn and cloth. They entrust brokers to buy warehouse receipts for cotton yarn and cloth, hoping to sell them at high prices. It is reported that the above inventory is sufficient for the city's needs for several years. Even if the factories are unable to increase production in a timely manner, it is not a cause for concern.

Banning Brokers from Intervening in Transactions

In order to assist the authorities in stabilizing the cotton yarn and cloth market, the industry associations have strictly stipulated that if factories intend to sell their finished products, they must transport them to the industry for trading. If the industry intends to sell spot goods, they must sell them directly to the shops. Brokers are not allowed to be entrusted to intervene in transactions. On the one hand, this can avoid profiteering, and on the other hand, it can prevent black market transactions. In this way, transactions among peers can gradually enter the right track, and illegal transactions can be completely eliminated.

### Reforming Shanghai's Foundation: Rectifying the Financial World First - Editorial from Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun

### Reforming Shanghai's Foundation: Rectifying the Financial World First - Editorial from Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun

Tokyo, 8th (Central News Agency) - The Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun published an editorial on the 7th, titled "The Rectification of Shanghai's Financial World," commenting on the issue of Shanghai's economic reconstruction. The main points are as follows: The Shanghai Public Concession has been taken over by the Chinese National Government. How to reform it in the future and whether it can be reformed satisfactorily are attracting attention from all parties. The Shanghai Public Concession has been a nest of Anglo-American ideas for a century. It will be quite difficult to reform it in the future, as most of the Chinese people living in the Concession have been anglicized and americanized. All financial and economic institutions such as banks, money houses, and shops in the Concession have also been imbued with Anglo-American free economic thought. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, these institutions engaged in absurd behaviors such as speculation, hoarding, and raising prices with the capital they possessed that had lost its way out. Therefore, in the future, the National Government's work to reform the old Shanghai Public Concession must thoroughly eliminate the Anglo-American ideas of the general residents and the free economic thought of the Shanghai financial world. Before the takeover of the Concession, the authorities of the Public Works Department also implemented a fixed price system for important materials in order to suppress prices, prohibiting price increases, exposing malicious hoarding, and prohibiting speculative lending, etc., but the results were not effective. Therefore, prices are still rising day by day. However, why can't the rise in Shanghai's prices be suppressed? It is because the source of raising prices, the free thought of the financial world, and the Anglo-American financial people who are the main culprits have not been completely eliminated. Therefore, today, rectifying the financial world is a major foundation for reforming Shanghai, and the National Government must go all out. If it continues to neglect the fundamentals and pursue the superficial, then the realization of a new Shanghai will be difficult.
