### Women's Day Message

Every year on this day, women celebrate their own festival. My sisters across the nation must also have fervent emotions today. Looking back on the past and forward to the future, there should be endless emotions and great hopes. However, Chinese women today should celebrate their festival with even greater significance, because we are at war, and a new mission is bestowed upon every educated woman. We must take it upon ourselves.

Wartime women should be the most important determining force for national victory. Whether it is Japan, Germany, or the Soviet Union, the women of these countries have already been ________ for their country's war, replacing men on farms, in factories, and in transportation agencies to shoulder important tasks. They go to the front lines to offer comfort, they prepare spiritual and material comforts for the soldiers at the front, and they work to maintain stability in the rear, to relieve refugees, to educate orphans, to assist in air defense, and to maintain public order. They are active on the front lines and in the rear, as brave as men, and even more worthy of boasting about than men: their hard work, patience, and law-abiding spirit. But, looking back at the women of our country, what about them? It goes without saying for the generally ignorant and unknowledgeable. Even among those who have received higher education, some are active on the political stage, but their purpose is only to use their political position to satisfy their own desire for wealth and honor. How many men do things that harm the country and the people in order to satisfy their wives' endless desires? How many men create social evils because of women's excessive extravagance? Today, we should address this phenomenon and appeal to educated women to lead by example. Negatively, they should not do things that harm social customs and hinder national policies, such as extravagance and waste. On the other hand, they should actively rise up, call on women across the country to participate in wartime work, participate in wartime social welfare undertakings, and promote the movement of women serving the country. Looking at the facts of the women's circles in Japan, Germany, and the Soviet Union fighting for their countries, can we not strive to become stronger?

Secondly, we want to solemnly point out that, apart from the extremely small number of intellectual women in the upper class and the wealthy and noble women in the upper echelons, the vast majority of women in our country are in a state of ignorance and are suffering from hunger and cold. We hope that women's groups across the country will cooperate closely to promote several major events that are urgently needed at present: First, is the expanded relief movement for women in poverty and illness, which is also the relief movement for the motherhood of the next generation of our Chinese nation. Women's charitable organizations should strive to make their institutions more sound and developed. Hospitals, obstetrics hospitals, etc., should have special preferential measures for poor women, and strive for their universality and practicality. Second, we further expect the government and the social system to cooperate closely to set up more free maternity hospitals and nurseries, etc., to relieve the domestic shackles of ordinary women, so that they can devote more strength to society and the country. Third, we call on the authorities and various factories, companies, and stores to give preferential treatment and protection to female workers and female employees. Fourth, we hope for the development of general women's education, especially the universal development of literacy education for the common people, supplementary education for adult women, wartime service education for women, and vocational education for women. Whether as housewives or preparing to serve society and the country, women of the new era must have literacy, newspaper reading, writing, and a skill necessary to maintain life. Moreover, the work in the rear during the war and the construction of the new country during the war are still waiting for our women's circles to work hard together with men.

Awake, Chinese women! Arise, invigorate and unite, new Chinese women! The future of the new China requires the cooperative struggle of more than 200 million women!

### Germany's Submarine Offensive and Defensive War Against Britain and the United States

According to a special communique from the German High Command on the 26th, in February, the German submarine fleet sank 80 enemy ships, totaling 534,300 tons. This shows the failure of the anti-submarine warfare that Britain and the United States have been anxious about since last December. If this situation continues, the food problem in Britain itself, the problem of assisting the Soviet Union, not to mention, even the Allied landing operation in Europe will inevitably have a very serious adverse effect.

On January 30, the promotion of submarine fleet commander Admiral Karl Dönitz to commander-in-chief of the German Navy was proof that Germany focused on submarines in the ocean. On February 5, according to a statement by US Navy Secretary Knox, Germany builds one submarine every day, and he admitted that this shipbuilding rate is higher than the rate at which British and American ships are sunk by German submarines. Navy Secretary Knox also said that the number of German submarines operating in the Atlantic Ocean is now higher than in June last year. Moreover, in addition to the increase in quantity, the performance of German submarines has also been significantly improved. The use of submarine oil tankers, submarine depot ships, etc., and new tactics in patrolling, detecting enemies, and attacking, especially the use of group submarines in combat, have further increased the power of German submarines. In response, the British and American sides have used methods such as strengthening escort warships, improving the specific defensive equipment of escorted ships, and continuing to bomb German shipyards and bases. However, based on the fact that the German submarine record in January and February was not inferior to that of last December, the efforts of Britain and the United States have not had any effect. Since the previous escort system could not fulfill its mission, many people proposed increasing the speed of transport ships from the current 11 knots to 15 or 17 knots. However, even if the speed is increased by 4 knots, not only are there various inconveniences in shipbuilding and many disadvantages in cargo tonnage, even if these problems are solved, there are still many _______ points for the high speed of the latest submarine's surface speed of 23 knots. Even if Britain and the United States build many ships and send the escort system to the above-mentioned level, under the current situation of being sunk in large quantities on the seabed, they will ultimately fail to make a significant change in the situation.

When the British and Americans send large armies to the European continent, assuming that each soldier needs a ship of several tons, then _______ soldiers are expected to require 8 million tons. Britain and the United States do not have this capability now, so from this point alone, the position currently occupied by Germany and Italy on the European continent cannot be easily shaken. In other words, submarine warfare can both control Britain's lifeline and protect the weapons of continental Europe. (翔: Translated from the February 28 Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Axis Forces Launch Offensives at Both Ends of Tunisia Fierce Battles Unfold East of the Mareth Line British Forces Withdraw from Settanane

German Führer's Headquarters, Havas News Agency, 7th. This afternoon's military communique stated that on the southern Tunisian front, German and Italian forces are engaging the enemy in the battlefield, and have gained the upper hand.

Rome, Havas News Agency, 7th. The Italian High Command issued a war report today stating that in yesterday's Tunisian theater, Italian forces shot down five enemy aircraft in air combat, and destroyed many enemy aircraft in surprise attacks. Enemy tanks and armories were hit in the surprise attacks. Yesterday there was only positional warfare on the Tunisian front.

Lisbon, Allied News Agency, 7th. According to Allied news from the Tunisian front received here last night, the British First Army led by General Anderson has been retreating 12 kilometers along the main coastal highway towards Tamoura, unable to withstand the pressure of the German forces under General Arnim in northern Tunisia. At the same time, news from the Allied Forces HQ in North Africa said that German General Rommel in southern Tunisia launched a large-scale offensive against the British Eighth Army led by General Montgomery in front of the Mareth Line. However, this news has not been confirmed by the Axis powers, nor is its detail is known. Earlier news only said that both sides were continuing to assemble large armies in this area, and that patrol and artillery activity had increased significantly on Friday. Regarding the British retreat in northern Tunisia, a Reuters correspondent stationed at General Eisenhower's headquarters cabled that British forces were forced to withdraw after fierce street fighting in the village of Settanane (20 kilometers south of the coast and about 40 kilometers west of Mateur). The British First Army in the coastal area has now retreated to Tamoura, which is easier to defend than Settanane. The Reuters correspondent also warned that if the military continued to advance 10 kilometers in this area, it would reach Kiff el Apirot. If the German army occupied this mountain, it could control the important road from Tabarka to Beja (100 kilometers west of Tunis). According to news from Berlin, the German army won a victory in the Settanane area and was able to reach the area southwest of Cape Serrat (70 kilometers west of Bizerte). Before the British army withdrew westward, the German army defeated the many with the few, and the battle was particularly fierce. German anti-tank guns destroyed three tanks, and the remaining British tanks led the British infantry in a hasty retreat. To the south of the Settanane area, General Arnim led his troops on Friday to attack on the road from Mateur to Beja, launching a surprise attack on the outskirts of Medjez el Bab (50 kilometers southwest of Tunis). Today, British and German artillery are still on the east side of the area, shelling each other across the stream. American troops in southeastern Tunisia mistakenly entered a minefield laid by Axis forces before their retreat, suffering heavy casualties. The minefield greatly hindered Allied movements. American troops are currently moving slowly and cautiously between Kasserine and Faiid.

Bern, Havas News Agency, 6th. It is learned that General Rommel's troops launched a fierce attack on the British Eighth Army near the Mareth Line in southern Tunisia. The offensive began at dawn and was attended by a large number of tanks. The details are not yet known. The Allied High Command announced today that in the central Tunisian route, Allied forces occupied the city of Pison, 30 miles southwest of Kairouan, but also admitted that Allied forces had abandoned the city of Settanane. In addition, General Armin's troops continued to advance along the Mateur-Béja railway, attempting to occupy the Béja-Tabarka area. Tabarka is the only port between the port of Bizerte and the Algerian border, so it is extremely important.

Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 7th. A Reuters correspondent stationed at the Allied Forces Headquarters in North Africa cabled that General Rommel mobilized tanks and infantry and launched an offensive against the British Eighth Army at dawn yesterday. Fierce battles are now underway.

Stockholm, Havas News Agency, 7th. London telegram. The offensive launched by General Rommel south of the Mareth front line has greatly shocked the British people. Although the newspapers admit that there are a large number of German tanks attacking, they still want to make readers think that it is not worth paying attention to.

Lisbon, Central News Agency, 7th. Rommel's army suddenly launched a fierce offensive against the British Eighth Army on the 6th. According to a cable from Algiers, the two armies ______ launched a fierce battle 62 miles east of _______ . German mechanized units are constantly attacking the enemy.

### New Offensive by Japanese Forces in China Has Achieved its Wartime Objectives - Asahi Shimbun Commentary

Tokyo, Allied News Agency, 7th. The Asahi Shimbun commented on the new offensive by Japanese forces on the Chinese mainland, saying that the Imperial Army had defeated enemy forces in northern Jiangsu and the Hankou area within half a month and had achieved its wartime objectives. The area north of the Yangtze River between Yuezhou and Shashi, which is controlled by the Japanese army, is a rich agricultural area and has become a strategically and economically important location. At the same time, controlling the Yangtze River between Yuezhou and Yichang can prevent Chongqing from replenishing its combat power and allow the Japanese army to obtain various supplies. Once these areas are occupied, the unfinished roads abandoned by Chongqing before the war can be completed, and the exchange of materials between Central and North China will be smooth. Sino-Japanese cooperation and maintaining stability are prerequisites for managing these newly occupied areas. In recent battles, the Chinese National Government has shown its spirit of cooperation through its actions, and the residents of the war zone have given the Japanese army their full cooperation. This is a confirmation that the people are now breaking away from Chongqing's constraints in China. As the peaceful areas gradually expand, the Chongqing forces in each area will inevitably be eliminated.

### Japanese Forces in North China - February War Situation

Beijing, Central News Agency, 7th. The Japanese Army in North China today released the main combat situation in February as follows: The Chongqing army in North China took advantage of the attempt to counterattack on the Burma front to repeatedly try to harass the peaceful areas, but the Japanese army had long been waiting in strong positions and would never allow it to move rashly. Moreover, because of the Japanese army's spring offensive operations, it has been in a state of shock and panic. After several rash actions, due to the Japanese army's serious vigilance and continuous active suppression, its attempts have been crushed. The entire revitalized North China is now carrying out a two-pronged operation with unwavering spirit. In particular, the recent activities of the Security Army and other armed groups devoted to the peace movement have made a great contribution to the suppression and construction of North China. A summary of the main combat situation in February is as follows: Since June last year, when Hebei Province was designated as a special administrative region, it has been actively engaged in establishing security work. With the efforts of the North China Political Affairs Commission, the Jizhong Plain has established a new posture. On the Shandong Province front, the Japanese army's operations against the Chongqing and Communist armies in the Wuding Zhou Tong area north of the old Yellow River in northern Shandong have become increasingly fierce since February, and are expanding their attacks. In addition to annihilating the Chongqing 337th Brigade south of Huangxian in southern Shandong, the Japanese army also annihilated the Chongqing 113th Division and the Second Advanced Detachment of Li Wenti in Peichang (55 kilometers northeast of Yishui) in the mountainous area of central Shandong in mid-February, capturing its division commander Han Zigan Li Wenti and killing many other cadres. In this battle, the Chongqing army abandoned its corpses and those captured amounted to more than 2,000. In the Hanji area (70 kilometers north of Guide) in western Shandong, about 3,000 members of the Communist Army's 7th Training Brigade were defeated. On the Henan Province front, in mid-February, Japanese army units in the southeast of Maliangji (18 kilometers northwest of Dangshan) repelled and inflicted a devastating blow on the Chongqing 5th Ninety-second Army, which attempted to go north. On the Shanxi Province front, in late January, Japanese army units annihilated the Chongqing Army 18th Group Army's 1st sub-district army in Qinyuan, killing its deputy commander.

### Xu Liang Arrives in Beijing

Beijing, Allied News Agency, 7th. Xu Liang, the Chinese ambassador to Japan, went to Nanjing to discuss with his government and said here yesterday that China should cooperate closely with Japan to show its appreciation for Japan's unchanging policy of maintaining extremely friendly relations with China, as shown by Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China. Japan is now devoting all its efforts to bring the Greater East Asia War to a successful conclusion and hopes that China and Japan will act in unison and fight to bring the current war to a victorious end. If China wants to win the war, it must have unity in the government and the people and an inseparable unity with Japan, and Chinese youth should be given thorough training.

### Prosperity Restored to Guangzhou Bay and the Leizhou Peninsula

Hong Kong, Central News Agency, 6th. It has been two weeks since the Japanese army was stationed in Guangzhou Bay. Chinese residents have been able to recognize the true intentions of the Japanese army and see through Chongqing's false propaganda. At the same time, they can live and work in peace under the protection of the Japanese army. According to someone who recently arrived in Hong Kong from Xiying, Guangzhou Bay, the situation in Guangzhou Bay and the Leizhou Peninsula after the Japanese army moved in is as follows: After the Japanese army entered Cunjin Bridge, public order in the city was immediately restored. The number of residents returning to Chikan and Cunjin Bridge is increasing day by day. Entertainment venues such as cinemas and wine shops are as prosperous as before. Prices in the leased area have risen slightly due to a shortage of daily necessities and food, but they have now fallen back. On the Leizhou Peninsula, security has also been rapidly restored after the Japanese army landed. Residents are assisting the Japanese army in efforts to restore the area. 95% of the residents in Leizhou City have moved back. The residents of Suixi have also returned one after another. Markets began trading on the 24th and 25th. Xiying was even more prosperous before. The people of Chikan Xiying dispatched personnel to various peaceful areas to work hard to maintain the trade in Guangzhou Bay, so the commerce there is thriving.

### English Courses in North China Schools Changed to Electives

Beijing, Havas News Agency, 7th. A decree was promulgated here stipulating that from April 1, all middle schools and commercial schools in North China must teach European languages for two years, but English has been changed to an elective course.

### Trainees of the Third Phase of the Sino-Youth Cadre School Enlisted and Formed into Squads This Morning

Nanjing, Central News Agency, 7th. The new students who passed the preliminary examinations in various regions for the third phase of the Sino-Youth Cadre School reported on the 6th.

### New York Magazine Publishes Letter from Lin Yutang Revealing Very Few Supplies to Chongqing - It Will Become Increasingly Difficult if They Do Not Quickly Seek to Increase

Buenos Aires, Central News Agency, 7th. The recent American weekly magazine "Republic" published an open letter from Lin Yutang to a New York evening newspaper, which exposed Chongqing's embarrassment. It said that although Chongqing had requested 100 transport planes from the United States at the beginning of 1942, only 40 actually arrived in Chongqing. However, 25 of them were detained in India en route. After several months of serious protests, they were shipped to Chongqing. At present, the aid to Chongqing is very small, and the amount is only 1% of that transported by the Burma Road. If the increase in transport volume is not quickly sought in the future, the transport obstruction in Chongqing will inevitably become increasingly difficult for the war against Japan. Moreover, Japan is also taking advantage of Chongqing's current poverty to attempt to attack. If the anti-Axis forces do not quickly find a way to help Chongqing, the connections of both land and air routes will be cut off by the Japanese.

### Chongqing Lacks Food

Macau, Central News Agency, 7th. According to Chongqing news, the Chongqing Food Department is now feeling the difficulty in coping with military food. Although it has implemented conscription, the fundamental problem is still insufficient production, which has created the current food panic. The food obtained by the Chongqing government through conscription from farmers each month can only sustain the military food supply for five days. The rest is either purchased or people are mobilized to donate food or other methods are used, but it is still felt to be insufficient, resulting in a lack of military food in some areas for more than seven days. As a result, the troops have been forcibly conscripting food locally, which has caused great resentment among the people. Therefore, Chongqing once ordered the troops to implement a food rationing plan, two bowls of porridge and one meal a day, which almost led to a mutiny. Therefore, the Chongqing Food Department feels extremely helpless in coping with this food problem. The severity of Chongqing's food problem can also be seen.

### The Battle for Various Lines on the Eastern Front Continues; The Situation in Western Caucasus Gradually Becomes Active

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from the German Headquarters, 7th: The German High Command announced today in its war report that the Soviet forces attacking on the Eastern Front yesterday were all repelled and suffered heavy losses. The German Air Force and its allied air forces expanded their operations and achieved great results. Only positional warfare occurred yesterday along the Kuban River and the Donets Front. German tank units inflicted heavy damage on the Soviet forces and captured hundreds. South of Kharkiv, German mechanized units broke through strong Soviet resistance, forcing them to retreat north. The Soviet Third Tank Brigade, Cavalry Brigade, and infantry units, which were surrounded by German forces, were defeated, and countless Soviet soldiers were captured. The Soviet forces attempted to launch attacks from various strongholds, but all attempts failed. In Stanislaviv, Soviet forces briefly penetrated our strong positions but were quickly driven back and suffered heavy losses.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: The battle for control of the Eastern Front continued yesterday. The Soviet forces suffered heavy casualties in various war zones without any achievements. German mechanized units south of Kharkiv broke through strong enemy resistance, defeated a brigade, and chased them northward. In the battles south of Kharkiv, nine Soviet tanks were destroyed. In the past two days in the Stanislaviv area, another twenty-eight Soviet tanks were destroyed. The Soviet 15th Tank Division and cavalry unit south of Kharkiv have been surrounded for several days and have been repelled. The Germans captured 225 artillery pieces, 61 tanks, 382 machine guns, and countless spare parts.

Havas News Agency Dispatch from Somewhere on the Soviet Border, 7th: In the past 24 hours, there have been no major developments on the Eastern Front. In the Caucasus, German forces are still holding the Novorossiysk base. The Soviet offensive south of the Kuban River stronghold has subsided. However, the Soviet side is significantly mobilizing troops in the North Caucasus, and it is expected that the Soviet army will attack again. The fighting in the Rostov and Taganrog areas has also subsided due to thawing. In the Donets River basin, German forces are still clearing out the remaining enemy. West of Kharkiv, the situation is relatively quiet, but in the Orel area, Soviet forces are attacking on three fronts. One route is advancing from the south along the Kursk and Orel line, and the other two routes are flanking the German rear from Sukhinichi and Sevsk. Fierce fighting is taking place in the northern Orel area. As for the British claim that the Red Army has cut the Vyazma-Smolensk railway, Moscow Radio has remained silent. Regarding Rzhev, the Soviet side claims to have crossed the Vosuga River and occupied the city of Vosuga.

Central News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: German forces at the mouth of the Kuban River suddenly switched from defense to offense on the 5th, causing the situation in the Western Caucasus, where the two sides were in a stalemate, to gradually become active. German forces are concentrating their main forces on the left flank to launch an offensive. On the 6th, they surrounded three Soviet divisions in the lake and swamp area, annihilating two divisions completely and severely damaging the other.

### Fierce Fighting in Orel and Other Places; The Soviet Offensive Has Been Thwarted

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: Fierce fighting is still taking place in the area northwest of Orel and Kursk, but the Soviet offensive has been thwarted. Although Soviet forces broke through German positions in several places, they were immediately repelled by German counterattacks. From a strategic perspective, the Soviet forces have achieved nothing. The Soviet forces have also launched repeated attacks between Orel and Luki, but with very limited forces. Their aim seems to be to hinder German movements or probe German strength. As a result, they have been severely damaged and repelled by German forces. The Soviet offensive near Rossosh has also failed. There are many Soviet troops concentrated on the Mius Front, suggesting a possible large-scale offensive in the near future. German forces recently annihilated many troops of the Soviet 58th Army near the lower Kuban River, further consolidating the German bridgehead east of the Kerch Strait.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: According to sources here, Soviet forces have been continuously attacking in the Orel area for four weeks, with 40,000 casualties and 350 tanks lost. According to front-line reports, Soviet forces launched an offensive in the Orel area on February 4th. Fierce fighting occurred on February 16th and 17th, when a Soviet infantry division, a tank regiment, a ski brigade, and other units concentrated their attack, attempting to break through the German left flank, but were defeated by German forces. German forces counterattacked on the 18th, annihilating the remaining Soviet forces, with over 2,000 Soviet soldiers killed. After that, Soviet forces launched two more attacks, with 6,500 casualties. The Soviet army continued its fierce offensive, with over 18,000 casualties in six days. The Soviet attacks from the south and southwest on the 5th of this month also failed.

### Heroic Bayonet Fights Break Out in Various Places South of Lake Ilmen

Central News Agency Dispatch from Stockholm, 7th: According to aggregated reports received here, since the 5th of this month, the weather south of Lake Ilmen in the Staraya Russa area on the Eastern Front has suddenly turned cold again. As a result, the offensive and defensive battles between the German and Soviet forces in the area have become more intense. Fierce bayonet fights seem to be taking place everywhere. General Timoshenko's forces are focusing their attacks on the east and northeast sides of the city. To secure the crossing points on the Lovati River, large numbers of troops have been repeatedly sent to attack in that direction. German forces are occupying a strategically advantageous position in the marshland, and they continue to resist. As of noon on the 6th, the Soviet army has not been able to set foot on the left bank of the river. South of Staraya Russa, German forces appear to be launching a fierce counterattack along the upper reaches of the Lovati River. There have also been large-scale mechanized unit battles near Kholm. German forces have destroyed 31 Soviet tanks. The overall situation is quite favorable for the German forces.

Allied News Agency Dispatch from Berlin, 7th: Official circles here stated last night that the Soviet 3rd Tank Army south of Kharkiv has been annihilated after a short, bloody battle. This tank army, composed of elite troops, was surrounded several days ago and repeatedly attempted to break out without success. German forces tightened the encirclement last week and finally cleared out the remnants of the tank army after a fierce battle on Friday. In another area of the front, a remnant tank regiment from a Soviet brigade escaped, but was intercepted by German forces and soon surrendered. To the east, German forces continued to sweep through the Slavyansk area. Soviet troops around Izium were heavily attacked by German aircraft, suffering heavy casualties and losing 17 artillery pieces and 90 transport vehicles. Soviet forces in other areas of the Eastern Front also suffered extremely heavy losses. On Friday alone, the Soviets lost 57 aircraft. On the Mius Front north of Taganrog, Soviet attacks were repelled. Soviet forces made several small-scale attacks on newly captured German positions on the Donets River, but were driven back. Soviet forces in the southwestern Caucasus have not suffered significant losses in recent days. For example, Soviet forces attempted to undermine German defensive positions downstream of the Kuban River but failed. Six divisions and three brigades of Soviet forces were annihilated or severely damaged. On Friday, German forces killed 1,900 Soviet soldiers, including the commander of the Soviet 77th Rapid Fire Division. In the Novorossiysk area, the Soviet side again attempted to reinforce their troops from the sea, but were repelled by German coastal defense artillery. In the Kursk-Orel area, Soviet forces continued their fierce attacks on Friday, breaking into German lines at several points, but were repelled by fierce German counterattacks. At the same time, German forces have strengthened their defenses south of Orel. On the central and northwestern fronts, Soviet forces repeatedly attacked, especially in the Staraya Russa area south of Lake Ilmen, but all failed.

### Stalin Appointed Marshal of the Soviet Union

Central News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 7th: The Soviet government announced on the 6th that Chairman Stalin has been appointed Marshal.

Haitong News Agency Dispatch from Moscow, 7th: Moscow Radio announced last night that the Soviet government has issued an order appointing Stalin as Marshal.

### Britain and the United States Exaggerate Their Offensive Propaganda, But It Is Actually Impossible

Central News Agency Dispatch from Buenos Aires, 7th: After Roosevelt and Churchill's meeting in Casablanca, the British and American camps appeared to be slightly revitalized and have been making exaggerated propaganda efforts at home and abroad. Churchill has claimed that a landing operation will be carried out in Central Europe this year, and Roosevelt has also said that an offensive will be launched to invade the Japanese mainland. But what is the true meaning of their active propaganda? What are the underlying plans of the meeting? If we look at this war, only the Soviet Union and China are fighting with all their national strength on the Allied side. However, both have been exploited by the Allies. Therefore, Chairman Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek are very dissatisfied with the cunning attitude of their allies, Britain and the United States. At the same time, the people of Britain and the United States also criticize their governments for being weak and incompetent, and they deeply doubt what the British and American forces are actually doing. Some even ask if the US fleet is only active on Hollywood film sets. All these criticisms have their considerable reasons. Although Britain and the United States launched an offensive in North Africa last year, the German and Italian forces in Tunisia have repeatedly won great victories, while the American forces have suffered significant blows. Therefore, Roosevelt's raving, "We must conquer each island one by one to invade the Japanese mainland," is hard for even his own citizens to believe. Roosevelt and Churchill feel that they must put on a sensational show as a stimulant, and thus the Casablanca meeting was held. However, because the heads of most of the other Allied forces also participated in this meeting, it can be assumed that Britain and the United States may take some action this year. If Britain and the United States still take no action, not only is there a possibility of a major reaction on the British and American home fronts, but the Soviet Union and China may also withdraw from their alliance due to the incompetence of Britain and the United States. In this critical situation, Britain and the United States are deeply distressed about how to start their operations. Thus, they are again engaged in propaganda, saying that a major offensive is about to be launched. Therefore, the motives behind this propaganda are nothing more than the following points: First, the ultimate goal implied in this propaganda by Britain and the United States, which will launch a major offensive against the Axis powers, is nothing more than to wage a long-term war of attrition with the Axis powers to the very end and to preserve their military strength. This is the basic principle of Britain and the United States to complete this war, and it is also the means by which they conduct the war. Second, the internal aspect of this propaganda of a major offensive by Britain and the United States is an attempt to depress the morale of the Axis powers and to alienate the solidarity of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Third, since the Casablanca meeting, although Britain and the United States have repeatedly propagated that they will take some action, in reality, they will only launch small-scale attacks at most. Fourth, in order to continue to sacrifice the Soviet Union and China, Britain and the United States are using the propaganda of an upcoming major offensive as bait, trying their best to win over the Soviet Union and China to participate in their anti-Axis camp. Fifth, Britain and the United States are not only trying to create an unstable atmosphere in the areas occupied by the Axis powers, but also trying to threaten the neutral policies of other countries. Recently, Britain and the United States have been actively carrying out plans to incite Turkey, Spain, Sweden, and other countries to abandon their neutrality, which is very obvious. The recent statement by the President of Turkey is enough to reflect that these conspiracies of Britain and the United States have progressed to a considerable extent in Turkey. Conversely, the British and American plans against Spain have been abandoned because there has been no hope of success. Regarding Sweden, Britain and the United States continue to extend their evil hands, trying to make it abandon its neutrality. In addition, the United States is secretly working hard to get Finland to negotiate a separate peace with Britain. At the same time, in Latin America, as a result of the United States' long-term political strategy, Chile has now been lured into severing diplomatic relations with the Axis powers. The countries of Latin America have been won over to participate in the anti-Axis camp. At present, Argentina is the only neutral country left in the Western Hemisphere. Under this situation, what their future strategy will be is already very clear. In short, the purpose of Britain and the United States' massive propaganda after the Casablanca meeting is actually a scene in their plan to wage a long-term war of attrition. Therefore, they are making this propaganda of an upcoming major offensive only to fulfill their delusion of prolonging the war.

### Agriculture and Fisheries in the Southern Regions Are Now Developing Smoothly; Report by Director Mizumachi at the Japanese Parliament

Allied News Agency Dispatch from Tokyo, 7th: Itaro Mizumachi, Director of the Southern Affairs Bureau of the Greater East Asia Ministry, stated yesterday at a meeting of the Accounting Committee of the House of Representatives that the development of agriculture and fisheries in the Southern Regions is now progressing smoothly. The Greater East Asia Ministry is in contact with military authorities and other relevant ministries and has formulated plans regarding agriculture and livestock farming in the Southern Regions, which are being implemented by military authorities in the Southern Regions. Regarding Japan's agricultural policy towards the Southern Regions, great importance is placed on supplementing the agricultural products that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere currently lacks. Agriculture is closely related to the lives of the local residents, so all matters related to agriculture must be considered. Many local people plant rubber trees and sugarcane, so drastic measures to reduce their production will not be taken. In areas under Japanese administration, efforts are being made to produce more lotus root, jute, and other textile raw materials, as current production is not sufficient to meet demand. Cotton planting in various places is developing rapidly due to favorable weather and cooperation from local residents. In a few battles, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be self-sufficient in cotton. There is currently a surplus of coconut oil and palm oil, and new uses are being sought to maintain their current production. The demand for sugar for making alcohol is quite high, so there is no need to reduce its production. Quinine is a specialty of the Southern Regions, and demand is also high, so efforts will be made to increase its production. Generally speaking, there is no shortage of food in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Under the current situation, efforts are being made to ensure that each region is self-sufficient in grain. Marapi wood and other useful timber produced in the Southern Regions are currently being used as materials for war and shipbuilding. Increasing livestock production is an important factor and is currently being carefully considered. Leather production is a military necessity. The production of raw materials and their industrial utilization must be handled by relevant Japanese authorities in order to save on shipping. Establishing a large food industry in the South is also for this reason.

### Japanese Military Advisor Elaborates on the Current Situation in the Philippines

Central News Agency Dispatch from Osaka, 7th: This day at the New Osaka Hotel, the highest advisor for the Japanese side on the Philippines, Marquis Yorimichi Dere, gave a talk on the current state of Filipino culture and the American administration of the Philippines over the years. The gist of his talk was that, although the United States claims to have given the Philippines complete independence, we have not seen any examples of this. Rather, the United States has implemented a policy of aestheticism in both economic and cultural aspects. For example, in terms of cultural policy, it absolutely does not allow any Filipino self-reflection and takes advantage of Filipino shortcomings by placing them in a state of decline with low-brow movies and seductive music. When Batangas was captured, I inspected the area. On the way, I saw Filipino sailors carrying water buckets passing by compatriots who were about to die of thirst, without any sympathy, and hurrying away. Therefore, although they are currently cooperating with Japan, there are still many people who harbor the skeptical notion of what Japan will give us. We answered that we will give you Filipinos the Philippines of Filipinos and the spirit of the independence of the Philippines of East Asians, and furthermore give them appropriate guidance based on this. Also, since the Japanese army occupied Batangas, they have deeply felt the power of the Japanese army, but they still harbor a sense of terror. Therefore, we must provide them with sincere and kind guidance, and we must expose the false propaganda of the United States in order to gain their sincere trust. This is the prerequisite policy currently being reviewed. Regarding education, we are making great efforts to eliminate the remaining American influence, and we have already achieved considerable results. Furthermore, intellectuals in the Philippines have always praised American material civilization. However, Prime Minister Tojo's statement has awakened great self-reflection in Filipinos and is gradually leading them towards the path of cooperating sincerely with the Japanese side. In short, we are currently using all our strength to eliminate the American influence in the Philippines and to make Filipinos rely on Japan and build a prosperous Philippines within the Co-Prosperity Sphere.

### Economic Control Agencies Cooperatively Implement Military Administration

Central News Agency Dispatch from Manila, 7th: Since the implementation of military administration in the Philippines, various economic measures have been established. A brief summary of the recent economic situation in the Philippines is as follows: (1) Establishment of various control mechanisms: The most important development in the Philippine economic world recently is the successive establishment of economic control agencies founded by both the government and the private sector, to cooperatively implement military administration. After the establishment of the Philippine Sugar Association on the 6th of last month, the Philippine Cotton Cultivation Association and the Philippine Tobacco Association, etc., were also established successively. These agencies, under the guidance of the Military Administration Department, aim to implement various important measures for the reorganization of agriculture in the Philippines. Filipinos and Spanish and German business owners residing in the Philippines have all joined. In addition, agencies such as the Cigar Tobacco Association and Chinese merchants engaged in purchasing and distribution have also joined as members. (2) Reorganization of the Philippine Sugar Industry: After the establishment of the Sugar Industry Association, the Philippine sugar industry, as one wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, is being reorganized in light of the Philippine situation. Currently, this reorganization work is in progress. As for changing sugarcane fields to grow cotton, it has largely been successful. At present, for the sake of rationalizing the sugarcane industry, plans are being made to harvest a large amount of sugarcane from a small number of sugarcane fields, and at the same time to improve sugar manufacturing technology to advance in accordance with the alcohol production increase plan. In addition, the conversion of enemy sugar factories to produce butane is almost complete. In the past, Philippine sugar was supplied to the United States. Regardless, the sugarcane industry has been reorganized and developed in accordance with the production system of converting to fuel alcohol and butane. (3) Second Year of Cotton Production: Last year's cotton production increase plan was successful. Harvesting has now begun. Also, purchasing prices are set according to the grade of the goods. Currently, all of the cotton is filling the warehouses in Manila City. This time the harvest results are excellent. The Military Administration Department announced the outline of the second year plan on the 22nd of last month, planning to increase the cultivation area threefold. The main cultivation areas have also been designated as Luzon Island, Panay Island, and Mindanao. (4) Promoting the Exchange of Foreign Capital with the Philippines: The export of Philippine materials has greatly increased. At the same time, daily necessities imported from Japan have arrived last month. Also, according to the trade agreement, large quantities of paper, cotton fabrics, and tobacco imported from Shanghai and Guangzhou have arrived one after another. The exchange of materials with various parts of the Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future is highly anticipated. The Military Administration Department also reorganized the Philippine Special Trade Association in early February within the scope of the Philippine Import and Export Association as an implementing agency for foreign exports. Its business is to transport surplus agricultural products to Shanghai, Hong Kong, and other places, and at the same time ensure the distribution of daily necessities within the island.

### The Value of Cooperative Spirit Lies in Spontaneity—An Example of Collective Effort in Building a Bridge

A section of the highway between Mingguang and Dingyuan in Anhui Province is very difficult to build, especially the bridge construction project in Meishi Town. Here is a beautiful story full of the spirit of shared destiny. The Mingguang-Dingyuan line (Mingguang-Dingyuan line, Anhui Province) project of the Central China Railway began construction at the end of last year. The most difficult section of this project is the construction of the bridge in Meishi Town, because the weather was very cold at that time, and the people did not know when the Mingguang-Dingyuan highway, which they relied on, could be completed and opened to traffic.

One day, someone went to visit Captain 〇〇 of the Garrison, who was none other than Zhong Shaoqing, the town head of Meishi Town. He had the demeanor of an elder and was loved by the villagers like a warm winter day and respected like a kind father. He knew that the bridge project in Meishi Town would not be easy, so he visited Captain 〇〇 of the Garrison and said very generously, "Let me do this project, because highway transportation is our lifeline, so I am willing to share the burden." Captain 〇〇 was greatly moved by his passionate speech and talked it over with the highway engineering department of the Central China Railway and asked him to help handle this matter.

Town Head Zhong was very happy to get such a result. He immediately went to the nearby residents' homes, one by one, to explain the reasons. His zealous heart touched the heartstrings of everyone. Then many residents brought shovels and ladders to Town Head Zhong's home, gathered together, and set off to build the bridge.

Under the united collective effort of the people, the town head personally supervised, rain or shine, and finally overcame all difficulties. As of the beginning of this month, nine-tenths of the project has been completed, and only a very small section remains.

It is planned to hold a grand opening ceremony after the entire project is completed. The Central China Railway highly commends Town Head Zhong's fearless spirit and his ability to sacrifice himself for the public good, and has decided to publicly commend his achievements at the opening ceremony.

### First Anniversary of Japanese Occupation: Overview of Burmese Revival - Establishing Security, Restoring Transportation, Striving for Increased Production with Excellent Results

Rangoon, 7th (Central News Agency) - March 8th marks the first anniversary of the Japanese occupation of Rangoon. Similarly, one year has passed since Burma began its reconstruction. It has now become a strong wing within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On June 8th of last year, when the Japanese forces pacified all of Burma, Lieutenant General Shojiro Iida, the highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, announced the implementation of military administration. Furthermore, to organize an administrative body for the Burmese people, he appointed Dr. Ba Maw and six others as preparatory committee members for the central administrative body. Major cities in central and northern Burma had been looted and set on fire by the Chungking forces. Consequently, almost all of Mandalay and other major cities were reduced to scorched earth. In addition, transportation was disrupted, and resources were severely lacking, causing the residents to suffer greatly. The extremely deteriorated sanitary conditions made the situation extremely worrying. Later, on August 1st, Dr. Ba Maw, under the command of the highest commander of the Japanese Army in Burma, was appointed as the head of the executive administration. He actively cooperated with the ministers of Interior, Finance, Agriculture, Commerce and Industry, Transportation, Water Conservancy, Forestry, Civil Engineering, Justice, Education, and Health. The first priorities of the administrative policy were establishing security, restoring transportation, and improving education and health. They also devoted their full efforts to repairing the highways and bridges destroyed by the British and Chungking forces. Consequently, within six months of the war, security in all of Burma gradually returned. At the same time, the Burmese executive administration, with the assistance of the military administration supervisory department, began to promote the revival of Burma's major industries, such as agriculture, forestry, and mining, and encouraged increased production. This year's rice production is comparable to pre-war levels. Teak wood is a major product of Burmese forestry, with a large portion being shipped to Japan before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The quality of cotton is also excellent, and efforts are currently being made to increase production, which will undoubtedly yield excellent results in the future. As for transportation, the two main railway lines, Rangoon to Mandalay and Rangoon to Prome, were both opened to traffic in May of last year. Domestic postal services in Burma were also restored in June of last year, and telegram services were opened in October. Postal and telegraph services between Burma, the southern regions, China, and Manchuria also began at the same time. Furthermore, in the past year, the political and military awareness of the Burmese people has been significantly heightened. Burma had been oppressed by the tyrannical British government, and the mental and physical suffering they endured is indescribable. Therefore, when the Japanese forces entered Burma, Burmese youths organized volunteer armies and fully cooperated with the Japanese forces, taking active actions and operating in various regions. After the Japanese forces pacified all of Burma, these volunteer armies, recognizing that their mission had been accomplished, were reorganized into the Burmese Defense Army. They cooperated directly with the Japanese forces, continuing to operate as a wing to defeat the Anglo-American enemies. The Burmese people's determination to destroy the Anglo-Americans has also grown stronger. In particular, the recent indiscriminate bombing of various regions of Burma by the Anglo-American air forces has caused extreme indignation among the 16 million Burmese people. People in various regions have spontaneously organized defense corps, with the Yangon Citizens Defense Corps being the most active and effective. As for the implementation of military administration, it has spread throughout Burma. The Burmese executive administration's central and local administrative organizations under the military administration have been able to better perform their functions. Since the Japanese government declared that it would recognize Burma's independence no later than this year, the Burmese people have been devoting their full efforts to defending Burma to thwart the Anglo-American counter-offensive and are advancing in cooperation with the countries of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere as one of its wings.

### Japanese Photo Exhibition Held in Berlin

Berlin, 6th (Central News Agency) - A Japanese photo exhibition, with the assistance of the German government, was held in Berlin on the 6th and received general acclaim. The content of the photos mainly consists of Japanese landscapes, religious ceremonies, architecture, and general life, totaling over 150 types. They were taken by members of the Cultural Department of the German Embassy in Tokyo and were all sent to Germany after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War.

### Rome Talks Determine Political Strategy

Berlin, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - Berlin believes that the talks between Germany and Italy in Rome are a major victory for the Axis powers in politics. Germany and Italy confirmed that the overall war situation will be decided in Eastern Europe, and that Tunisia is a bridgehead for the European continent, which must be defended with all efforts. They intend to use political power, with the new conditions after the war as bait, to lure the people of Europe. However, since the discord between Poland and the Soviet Union, the Atlantic Charter has completely lost its value. In contrast, the Axis countries have detailed explanations of their war goals and future order, allowing the people of Europe to understand deeply and without any doubt. They deeply know that they are shedding blood to defend culture, and at the same time, they are fighting for freedom, peace, and justice. Therefore, the political strategy determined by the Rome Conference has won the support of the European people.

### Finnish Prime Minister Issues New Appointments

Helsinki, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - Finnish Prime Minister Linkomies announced at the first cabinet meeting yesterday that, according to the Dutch constitution, Finance Minister Tanner and Defense Minister Walden have been appointed as members of the Foreign Affairs Committee. The Prime Minister and Foreign Minister are ex officio members of the committee. Agriculture Minister Koivisto has been appointed as a member of the Finance Committee. The Prime Minister and Finance Minister are ex officio members of the committee.

### French Rebellious Diplomats All Dismissed

### Two Brazilian Cargo Ships Sunk

Buenos Aires, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Rio de Janeiro, the Brazilian government announced on the 6th that a 3,540-ton merchant ship and a 6,075-ton cargo ship were each torpedoed by Axis submarines. The cargo ship was attacked on February 18th while sailing off the Brazilian coast, and the merchant ship was attacked on March 2nd. It appears that the crews of both ships have been rescued. The cargo ship was originally a German ship that sought refuge in the port of Santos when the war broke out. It was seized when Brazil declared war on Germany.

### Change of Commander for the Hawaiian Naval District

Lisbon, 7th (Allied News Agency) - According to reports from Honolulu, US Vice Admiral Ghormley has replaced Rear Admiral Baggley as Commander of the Hawaiian Naval District and Commander of the Fourteenth Naval District. Ghormley previously served as Commander of the Southwest Pacific Allied Naval Forces and was removed from his post last autumn, succeeded by Vice Admiral Halsey.

### Political Instability in Equatorial Country: Risk of Riots - Section of Pan-American Highway Completed - Brazilian Seaport Under Construction

Buenos Aires, 6th (Havas News Agency) - According to news from the capital of Equatorial Country, the political situation in the country is turbulent and unstable, with a risk of armed riots. However, the actual situation is largely unknown due to the authorities' strict control of newspapers and radio broadcasts. However, there are various reasons to believe that some officers of the capital's garrison are actually plotting to overthrow the government. There are two motives: (1) Dissatisfaction with the government's lack of response after Peruvian troops forcibly occupied a part of the eastern border area of Equatorial Country; (2) The rebels claim to adhere to left-wing ideology, with most of them belonging to the left-wing Socialist Party. Alba, who has been the party leader for two years, has been deported by the authorities, and many party members have been arrested. Cavalry troops are currently patrolling the streets of the capital. The President has personally visited the barracks of the capital's garrison and talked with the soldiers, urging them to be loyal to the current regime.

Buenos Aires, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - According to news from Managua, the highway between the capitals of Honduras and Nicaragua has been completed. This highway is a section of the Pan-American Highway and is approximately 265 kilometers long.

Buenos Aires, 7th (Haitong News Agency) - It is claimed here that the construction of a seaport in the capital city of Santos State, Brazil, is expected to be one-quarter completed by mid-May and half completed by June. At that time, large ships will be able to enter. The entire project is expected to be completed by the end of October.

### The British Empire in Wartime Economic Distress (Part 2)

— Long Fei

(III) Financial Expansion and National Burden

In April 1942, British Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, presented a budget of £5,286 million for the fiscal year 1942-43. This represents an increase of £510 million over the actual expenditure of the previous year, and is more than double the pre-war expenditure of £1,068 million in 1938-39. This is an unprecedentedly large budget in British financial history. During the previous Great War, the highest amount of British war expenditure was 64% of national income in 1918, while the current estimated national income of Britain is £8,500 million, and war expenditure already accounts for 64% of it.

British Finance and National Income Table

Estimated for the beginning of the year × Estimated in April 1941

Based on "The Economist" magazine, national debt is the figure at the beginning of the year

The total expenditure for the three years since the first year of the war, 1939-40, plus the budget for the previous year, amounts to a huge sum of £15,770 million, exceeding the total war expenditure of the previous Great War by 50%, or £1,500 million. In British finance, the role of tax revenue is higher than in other countries, with more than 40% relying on tax revenue, but it still cannot escape the reduction of national wealth. According to "The Economist", government expenditure and national consumption exceeded national income by approximately £950 million in 1940-41 and by £1,350 million in 1941-42. The reduction of national wealth is increasing day by day, and 60% of the £4,000 million in foreign assets before the war has been lost.

This trend is likely to increase further due to the increase in war expenditure in the future, and of the £5,200 million budget, £4,000 million in expenditures of £1 billion each in March, June, September, and October have already been approved by Parliament, leaving only slightly more than £1 billion of the previous year's budget. Furthermore, the average daily war expenditure has also increased from £12 million in June 1942 to £12.225 million in September and £15 million in October. Due to the increasing expansion of the war, there has been a more alarming increase recently.

In response to the increase in war expenditure, Chancellor of the Exchequer, Sir Kingsley Wood, proposed new tax increase proposals when presenting the budget for the previous year. These proposals stipulated increased taxes on beer, liquor, tobacco, theater tickets, and luxury goods sales, attempting to increase tax revenue by £150 million annually. It should be noted that increases in income tax and other direct taxes have not yet been implemented, presumably because the national burden has reached its limit. Looking at the reality of income tax, it has gradually increased from five shillings and sixpence before the war to seven shillings and sixpence, eight shillings and sixpence, and ten shillings. Currently, the combined income tax and surtax reach a maximum of nineteen shillings and sixpence, meaning that only sixpence is actually received out of one pound. In that case, how can it be raised further? Before the war, income tax revenue was £400 million, while the surtax in the 1942 budget is estimated at £980 million. On a per capita basis, the average tax burden has increased from £24 one shilling before the war to the current £51 fourteen shillings, and the tax exemption point has been reduced to £250.

Secondly, the wartime excess profits tax rate has increased by 10%, with an estimated revenue of £400 million. However, 20% of the excess profits tax is returned as post-war reconstruction funds. Including other property taxes, the revenue from direct taxes is £800 million. On the other hand, the revenue from indirect taxes, £200 million each from alcohol and tobacco consumption taxes, and a purchase tax rate of 33% to 66%, mostly 66%, is estimated at £84 million.

In addition, Canada contributed £1 billion (£225 million) in goods to the UK, which was included in the treasury income for the fiscal year 1941.

Of the £5,200 million budget for 1942, £2,500 million came from tax revenue, and the remaining £2,600 million had to be borrowed. This was supplemented by £1,900 million in national savings and £700 million in the depletion of foreign capital. However, it is questionable whether this doubled savings amount compared to the previous year can be fully met. Therefore, maintaining the huge wartime finance in the future will inevitably require further restrictions on national consumption, because there is no other way than to lower the national standard of living and save to supplement the shortfall.

Comparison Table of British Food Rationing and Pre-War Consumption

British Food Situation Table

Based on the Soviet "World Politics and World Economy" magazine

Average from 1934-1936

(IV) Problems of Prices and Wages

From the index of recent price trends in Britain, the index before the Second World War—the end of August 1939—was 138.9, which rose to 174.4 one year later, an increase of 25%; two years later, it rose again to 185.1, and continued to rise to 186.2 at the end of June 1942, an increase of 34% in the five months after the outbreak of the war.

However, looking at the various periods of various materials in the price fluctuations, the rise is not as slight as mentioned above. It can also be seen that the difficulty of imports, the shortage of labor, and the increase in military expenditure constitute an insurmountable factor in the rise in prices. According to the British Ministry of Commerce, from the outbreak of the war to the end of April 1942, during this period, prices rose, food prices rose by 77%, and manufactured goods prices rose by 56%. From the perspective of individual commodities, wool was 67.5%, cotton was 74.9%, and textiles were 70.7%.

In the rising prices, the reduction in quantity cannot be ignored. In the two years after the outbreak of the war, the total quantity of retail sales decreased by 25% compared with the pre-war period, which increased the burden on the national consumption life. Regarding these, according to the cost-of-living index published by the Labor Department (based on July 1941), it was 155 on September 1, 1939, 165 at the end of September, 199 at the end of March 1942, and further rose to 200 at the end of April.

As prices rise, wages should naturally follow suit, which is causing pain in various countries. The demands of coal miners for wage increases can be seen as a flaw in British price policy. Wage disputes began in April and May 1940, and were temporarily resolved based on the decision to establish a minimum weekly wage of 83 shillings in mid-June. However, the control of the coal mining industry caused dissatisfaction among capitalists, and on July 1, the government finally implemented national management of all coal mines. However, the imbalanced development of prices in both civilian and military vessels, the contradictions within, and its impact can be imagined.

In any case, it is undeniable that as price controls are strengthened in the future, deep social problems will inevitably arise.

The "British Empire," mired in wartime economic distress, is gradually heading towards destruction. (The End)

### The Anti-British and Anti-American Movement of the Past Year: Work Report of the Anti-British and Anti-American Association

Since our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War the year before last ("January 28th Incident"), the Chinese people have felt excited. The Chinese nation, which has suffered from the British and American aggression for over a century, is extremely willing to rise up and seek survival under the encouragement of the friendly nation, to wipe out the humiliation. Based on the needs of the times, the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association was established in Shanghai on February 25th of last year, gathering social leaders to devote themselves to promoting the anti-British and anti-American movement. Now that the association's first anniversary is approaching, the work report of the association's anti-British and anti-American movement over the past year is specially summarized and disclosed below:

(1) Enlightenment of Anti-British and Anti-American Sentiment

Since its establishment, the association has been engaged in the propaganda of the anti-British and anti-American movement. It held an anti-British and anti-American propaganda week around May of last year. The focus of its work was on the enlightenment movement against the British and the Americans. During this movement, in order to awaken the public and unite all Asian ethnic groups to work together against the British and the Americans, the association specifically solicited lyrics for the "Greater East Asia Ethnic Unity March" and produced 100,000 records of the "Greater East Asia Ethnic Unity March", which were distributed to radio stations, cinemas, and dance halls in the city for broadcast and singing. It also produced and printed various colored murals, which were posted on important streets and in shop windows to spread propaganda widely. Lantern slides exposing the crimes of British and American aggression against East Asia were shown in cinemas. In addition, a type of Greater Asia Pictorial and two types of books and historical paintings (namely the May 30th Massacre and the Opium War, etc.) were published and given to members of the public who came to the association to request them. There was no interruption every day. The first editions were given away completely in less than a month after publication. Furthermore, a symposium was held to entertain cultural, cartoon, and news circles, and leaders of various industries in Shanghai in order to establish ties, promote the association's mission, and achieve cooperation. Over the past year, the association's work has been implemented item by item according to the plan, thanks to the assistance of people from all walks of life, which has been truly significant.

(2) Holding Meetings of People from All Walks of Life

After holding the anti-British and anti-American propaganda week at the end of May last year, the association convened a grand meeting of people from all walks of life and representatives of various organizations at the racecourse on June 3rd. Those present included Section Chief Ling, representative of Mayor Chen, Feng Jie, director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, social leaders Yuan Ludeng, Yan Keding, Chen Fumu, and people from various organizations in the city, including agriculture, industry, commerce, students, drama, and entertainment, as well as Assistant Takahashi of the intelligence agency of a friendly nation, totaling tens of thousands of people. The atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. The Shanghai Electric Broadcasting Company specially installed two amplifying broadcasting machines on the spot. The China Film Company sent personnel to the spot to film newsreels of the meeting and entertainment. After the meeting, the whole group marched in the rain for a week along the Bund. Citizens enthusiastically participated, creating a sensation throughout the city. This meeting was unprecedented in Shanghai's history and was the city's first mass meeting since the Greater East Asia War.

### (3) Essay Solicitation on the Fall of Singapore

After the fall of Singapore last year, in order to encourage the people to rise up and strengthen their cooperation in the Greater East Asia War, the association held an essay solicitation on "The Fall of Singapore as the Pivot of Greater East Asia Construction, the Hopes and Feelings of the People After the Fall of the New Island." Jin Dingdong, Zhou Bangjun, Xu Jinghou, and other gentlemen were invited to be judges. More than 100 essays were submitted. The results of the evaluation were: first place, Zhao Ruheng; second place, Wang Yan. The association compiled the selected essays and 19 excellent works into a type of series of books with a total of 115,000 words and gave them to people from all walks of life to read in order to spread propaganda widely.

(4) Films, Music, and Drama

Over the past year, the association has held gatherings on important commemorative holidays to promote the current mission of the people to emphasize the anti-British and anti-American work and the construction of East Asia. It held a film and music gala on the fifth anniversary of the "July 7th Incident". On November 8th, it showed the "Malayan War Record" film at the Grand Theatre, inviting people from all walks of life to attend. People from all walks of life participated enthusiastically, and the atmosphere was extremely enthusiastic. December 8th coincided with the first anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The association specially prepared a drama propaganda to celebrate. On that day, the four-act anti-British and anti-American drama "Jiang Zhou Weeps Blood" was performed at the Grand Theatre, with the help of Zhang Shankun, general manager of China Union Film Company, and the support of the Army News Department of a friendly nation, and starring first-class film and drama stars. The plot was tense, and there were more than ten thousand spectators. Anti-British and anti-American sentiments were at their highest.

(5) Establishing a Broadcasting Lecture Series

In order to increase the effectiveness of anti-British and anti-American propaganda work, the association specifically established an "Anti-British and Anti-American Aggression Broadcasting Lecture Series" at the Shanghai Broadcasting Station in the city. From November 11th of last year to February of this year, a total of seven anti-British and anti-American aggression broadcasts were held. Celebrities and important government officials were invited to give lectures, and the lectures were broadcast to various places at home and abroad. A large number of listeners were expected, so that the awareness of anti-British and anti-American aggression could penetrate the hearts of people around the world.

(6) Assisting Indian Independence

Since the outbreak of the Indian anti-British movement, the association has expressed its sincere sympathy from the standpoint of East Asian ethnic unity and actively launched a movement to aid India. On August 7th of last year, it sponsored a symposium on Indian liberation, inviting representatives from China, Japan, Germany, and India to participate. The symposium was enthusiastic. In addition, it sent telegrams to comfort the leaders of the Indian Congress Party and sent personnel to participate in various conferences convened by the Indian Independence League in Shanghai. On October 12th of last year, it held a charity exhibition and sale of cartoons in support of India at the Daxin Company Gallery, soliciting works from painters throughout Shanghai. No less than 300 works were submitted. During the exhibition, more than 1,000 Chinese and foreign people visited. The results were excellent. The proceeds from the charity sale, excluding the artists' remuneration, were donated to Indian compatriots to fund the independence movement.

(7) Publishing Greater East Asia Monthly

In addition to the Greater Asia Pictorial, the association also publishes the "Greater East Asia Monthly" on a regular basis. It has now been published up to Volume 3, Issue 2. It has published three special issues on "The Indian Independence Movement," "The Greater East Asia War Commemoration," and "The Issue of Participation in the War," containing special articles on these issues, elaborating in detail on the future of the Indian movement, the prospects for the Greater East Asia Holy War, and the issue of participation in the war, encompassing everything.

(8) Supporting the Government's Participation in the War

On January 9th of this year, State Chairman Wang announced that the government would officially participate in the war against Britain and the United States. The association believed that the government's participation in the war was the actual practice of anti-British and anti-American aggression. The association's work over the past year has been met with the government's compassion, mobilizing the national people to strike at Britain and the United States. Therefore, the association was deeply moved by Wang's announcement and wholeheartedly supported it. That afternoon, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Zhou Zuomin, and others, the association's executive directors, sent a telegram to the government to support it and published a letter to the people and printed slogans, which were distributed to branches in various places and posted in the city's main streets. On January 31st, a lecture meeting on "Participation in the War and the People" was held at the Grand Theatre, inviting Chen Binhe, Li Quanshi, Zhang Yipeng, Lin Kanghou, Yoshida Toyu, and other gentlemen to lecture on the significance of participation in the war and showing the anti-British blockbuster "Flower Girl." More than 3,000 people attended the lectures, mostly middle school and university students. In February, the "Special Issue on Participation in the War" was published in the Greater East Asia Monthly to explain the true meaning of the government's participation in the war, thereby establishing a national consciousness against Britain and the United States and looking forward to the early completion of the Greater East Asia War.

(9) Destroying Bronze Statues and Changing Street Names

The association believes that the aggressive forces of British and American imperialism in East Asia have completely collapsed. The concession privileges that they relied on have also been successively taken over by our government. After the Shanghai Public Concession was adjusted by the authorities of a friendly nation, the various long-standing practices of British and American arrogance have also been completely changed. However, the remaining traces in the concession are still eye-catching. The existence of foreign street names, such as Gordon Road and Hart Road, are all famous figures who invaded our country in the past. The impression they give to our compatriots is extremely bad. Now that the East Asian nations are embarking on the path of unity and revival, and Britain and the United States have no place to stand in the Far East, the various traces they have left behind should be thoroughly eliminated. Therefore, the association has spared no effort in promoting the movement to change street names and destroy bronze statues in the past six months. The association sent a letter to the Public Works Department and, together with Shanghai celebrities Yuan Ludeng, Lin Kanghou, Zhou Bangjun, Chen Binhe, and hundreds of Shanghai citizens, jointly petitioned the Public Works Department of the Public Concession, suggesting that it be implemented as soon as possible. On February 17th of this year, the association sent representatives to visit the Public Works Department. Mr. Noguchi, the director-general of the Bureau of General Affairs, met with them and stated that the Public Works Department had accepted the association's recommendations in principle on the issue of changing street names and destroying bronze statues and is currently considering their implementation. Therefore, it is expected that the British and American remains in the city's concession will be cleared up in the shortest possible time.

(10) Recruiting Members and Establishing Branches

In order to unite comrades and strengthen the anti-British and anti-American forces, the association held a general meeting to recruit members last year and launched the organization of anti-British and anti-American branches in various places. The recruitment period was from September 10th to November 9th of last year. A total of 3,117 people joined the association. Most of the members were from the business community. Comrades from various places believed that to revive East Asia, it is necessary to thoroughly eliminate the British and American remnants in East Asia and awaken the compatriots to eliminate the mentality of relying on Britain and the United States. This is the prerequisite for the revival of the Chinese nation. Therefore, they have applied to organize branches one after another. As of the 31st year, branches have been organized in Guangzhou, Jiaxing, Changshu, Wujiang, Kunshan, Qingpu, Fengxian, Nanhui, Chuansha, Changzhou, and other places. The Wujiang branch was established on November 26th of last year. The other places are currently in full swing, and the date of formal establishment is very near.

(11) Harmonizing Chinese and Japanese People

Since its establishment, the association's various tasks have been able to be gradually promoted with the cooperation and support of the authorities of a friendly nation and people from all walks of life. However, because the people of the city are under the protection of the police authorities of a friendly nation, misunderstandings often occur due to various complex relationships in terms of language and culture. In order to promote the peaceful friendship between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, the association established a Harmony Department in September of last year, with Li Guohua as the director, responsible for mediation and liaison, assisting the police authorities of a friendly nation, and protecting the rights of the people. Director Li separately hosted banquets for the police chiefs of friendly nations in Shanghai and leaders of the city's business community, engaging in cordial talks so that law-abiding people could receive legal protection under the goal of harmony. Over the past year, this work has achieved considerable results, and the prospects for Sino-Japanese cooperation are becoming increasingly bright.

In order to further promote Sino-Japanese harmony and cooperation, the Harmony Department has published "The Voice of the Chinese People," an irregular publication to express the wishes of the Chinese people. Two issues have been published and sent to people in the government and opposition of both countries in China and Japan in order to emphasize the basis of cooperation between the two countries.

(12) Assisting Students Who Have Dropped Out of School

At the end of last year, the association realized that outstanding students in the city were unable to continue their studies. It specially raised funds to run a scholarship program. Since the start of registration, applicants have come one after another, very enthusiastically. The total number was 208 people. The association invited celebrities and education experts from outside the association, Zhang Yipeng, Shen Siliang, Lu Gaoyi, Pan Yangyao, Huang Jingwan, and other gentlemen, to review the registered students. The review of the students' grades was completed within January. A total of 148 people met the application standards, including 27 university students such as Hua Jinkun, 40 high school students such as Shi Zhimin, and 79 junior high school students such as Li Yongfu. The detailed list was published in the Shen Bao on February 10th of this year. The work of collecting scholarships was carried out on February 12th and 13th. Those who did not meet the application standards were assisted by the association with book fees of 20 yuan each in order to encourage them and express their condolences.

The above are the major anti-British and anti-American works that the association has carried out over the past year. However, due to space limitations, it is not possible to describe them in detail. After the National Government announced its participation in the war, the association's responsibilities have become even greater. The association's members are ashamed of their lack of talent and fear that they will fail to live up to expectations. They sincerely hope that social leaders and enthusiastic people will provide assistance so that the remaining forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia can be eliminated as soon as possible and the goal of the Greater East Asia War can be quickly completed. Then, the revival of China and the construction of East Asia can be expected in the near future.

### Coarse Grains Sold on a Fixed Schedule: Allotted Oil Divided Into Five Types; Prices Revised

The authorities and the edible oil wholesale office and the sugar merchants' cooperative have agreed on the distribution of oil, sugar, and coarse grains based on the population. Retail merchants selling household oil and sugar have been re-registered. Retail rice shops under contract will also distribute coarse grains. All retailers have been given a deadline to prepare. Oil and sugar can be purchased with a certificate starting on the 11th of this month, and coarse grains will be sold with a certificate starting on the 21st of this month. All retailers selling oil and sugar will mark their registration number, county license, quantity, price, and start and end dates. The authorities will announce the implementation at that time. As for the quantity of allocation, the allocation standard is the monthly approved amount by the military distribution authorities. The authorities' allocation of oil, sugar, and coarse grains after the distribution of food based on the population is deeply supported by the residents. After the implementation, the black market for oil, sugar, etc. will inevitably disappear.

### Fifth Phase of Sugar Sales Has Ended

The Sugar Merchants' Cooperative's fifth phase of sugar sales to retailers with house tax stamps has ended for (1) those who collect house tax stamps on even-numbered days, as of the day before yesterday, and (2) those who collect house tax stamps on odd-numbered days, as of yesterday. All further receipts will be stopped for the purpose of distributing sugar based on the population. The distribution of sugar certificates has been issued by the Public Works Department, the Public Concession Bureau, and the Food Administration Bureau. Residents are requested to purchase sugar from designated Class A retailers with the certificate in accordance with the authorities' announcement at that time. The cooperative will also notify all retailers that all sugar allocated in February should be properly stored for the purpose of distributing sugar based on the population. If there is any shortage, the amount of the shortage will be fined ten times the official price in accordance with the regulations of the authorities.

### Edible Oil Prepared for Distribution Based on Population

The Edible Oil Industry Wholesale Office has re-registered and announced the merger of all retailers in order to implement the distribution of oil based on the population. It is also preparing to issue the oil allocated by the authorities to the retailers for the purpose of distributing oil based on the population. The distribution quantity, the date of payment for the oil, and the place to collect the edible oil will be specified and announced to all retailers for compliance within days. If all procedures can be completed before the 10th of this month, oil can be collected with the certificate starting on the 11th. The oil allocated includes five types: rapeseed oil, raw oil, sesame oil, soybean oil, and cottonseed oil. The prices have been revised. After implementation, the legitimate needs of various industries will continue to be met.

### Coarse Grains Will Be Sold Exclusively by Rice Shops

The Shanghai News Agency learned from the rice industry that in order to fully maintain the people's food supply, the authorities have specially issued coarse grain certificates. The sale of coarse grains will be sold exclusively by the rice shops under contract. Those who receive coarse grain certificates will have the same rice shop specified on their certificates as the rice and flour certificates. It was originally scheduled to be sold starting from the 29th phase. Due to incomplete procedures, it has been decided that the retail of grains will begin from the 30th phase (March 21), with contracted rice shops selling the items. The allocated coarse grains will be collected at the same time as the rice and flour purchase orders are collected on the 15th of this month. However, the quantity and price of coarse grains will be announced by the authorities at that time. Each holder of the certificate can purchase in accordance with the regulations of the announcement.

### Surplus Agricultural Products From the Philippines Shipped to Shanghai in Exchange for Materials: Sugar, Cotton, and Tobacco Included; Newly Established Chamber of Commerce-Type Organization Handles Matters

According to well-informed sources in business circles, trade relations between Shanghai and the Philippines are expected to improve significantly in the future. In addition to the city's merchants in various industries currently seeking ways to request the authorities to improve shipping to maintain trade, in the Philippines, local business people have organized a chamber of commerce-type organization to work in conjunction with the existing Philippine Importers and Exporters Association. The purpose of the new chamber of commerce is to handle trade between the Philippines and regions outside the jurisdiction of the Importers and Exporters Association. On the one hand, it will obtain the goods needed by the Philippines, and on the other hand, it will ship surplus agricultural products such as sugar, cotton, and tobacco to Shanghai and other places in exchange for materials.

### Sixth Phase of Rationed Grain in Urban Areas: Opening of Sales in Zhabei

The Shanghai Food Administration Bureau has long been prepared for the sixth phase of rationed grain based on the population this year. Pudong, Zhabei, the city center, and other areas have started opening sales separately yesterday. Nanshi and Huxi districts have not been able to open sales earlier because some of the rice has not yet arrived. After all the rice has arrived, the sales will also be opened universally. It has been found that starting from this phase, all the previous methods of public sales of grain, where rice was issued first and then payment was made, have been effectively abolished by Director Zhang Xianzhis of the bureau. All public sales offices in each district have been able to follow the bureau's regulations of paying first and then issuing rice. In total, the rice payment paid in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and other districts in the sixth phase totaled 6,123,000 yuan, which prevented some of the bureau's funds from becoming stagnant. The rationed rice and flour certificates for March have also been completely printed and are currently being collected by personnel from each district for distribution to citizens in each district.

### Lifting of Enemy Property Disposition to End Tomorrow: Property Owners Should Apply Promptly to Exchange for Japanese Deed and Ownership Certificate

In order to maintain the property rights of true Chinese property owners, the authorities have allowed applications to lift the disposition of enemy property in accordance with the law. The application period ended on the 9th of last month. It has since been approved that applications may still be submitted in cases of special necessity that the authorities deem legitimate, but the deadline is tomorrow. Those who hold deeds registered with the British, American, or other enemy consulates, or deeds registered with other foreign consulates in the name of enemy nationals, should promptly apply to the designated agency for lifting the disposition of enemy property, exchange for a Japanese deed, and issue an ownership certificate.

### Changes in Household Registration Must Be Reported Within Three Days for the Sake of Equal Rations

The City Police Department recently found that the heads of households (i.e., second landlords) and sub-households (i.e., third tenants) in the city do not report population movements, births, and deaths on time. Not only is the statistical accuracy of the registered population inaccurate, but also the allocation of rationed rice per capita is impossible. It is learned that in order to thoroughly investigate the population statistics and to ensure the average allocation of rationed rice in the urban area by the City Food Administration Bureau, if there are any household migrations, including moving in and out, as well as population migrations, births, and deaths, all households must report to the household registration office of each sub-bureau nearby within three days in accordance with the regulations. No delays or intentional non-reporting are allowed. Otherwise, severe punishment will be imposed if found.

### Anonymous Elderly Man Generously Donates Scholarship Money of 2,000; Fox Fur Coat Already Returned to the Elderly Man

An anonymous elderly man has been a strong advocate for the newspaper's scholarship campaign in the past. This year, the elderly man continues to fully support it. He sent a fox fur coat to the newspaper, expressing his willingness to donate it to those who donate more than 5,000 yuan. His enthusiasm and righteousness are extremely admirable. However, the donors from all walks of life are generous and do not expect any reward in return. The elderly man admired the noble friendship of the scholarship donors and generously donated 2,000 yuan yesterday.

### Accident Involving Trolleybus on Kaifeng Road: Driver Arrested; Driving Quite Fast and Not Ringing the Bell

At 4:30 p.m. on the 4th of this month, the driver Ding Juemei, driving trolleybus number 18, was careless and caused an accident near Kaifeng Road and Rehe Road. He knocked down the six-year-old daughter Da Bao of Mrs. Dai Wang, who lives at 21 Kaifeng Road in Nanjing, injuring her vital parts.

### Post Office Actively Seeks Ways to Adjust Domestic Postal Routes;

Postal Services on the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Line Return to Normal;

Citizens' ID Required for Mailing Parcels;

The Shanghai Postal Administration has repeatedly sought to improve domestic mail delivery routes, mostly via land and water. However, due to the war situation in various regions, delivery times have been extended. This reporter learned from the Transportation Section of the Administration that they are actively seeking ways to adjust domestic postal routes to ensure prompt delivery and prevent loss or dampness.

Zhejiang-Jiangxi Postal Route:

The Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway line postal service was previously suspended due to the war. Letters mailed from Shanghai were stamped "Postal Route Blocked" by the local post office and returned to the sender, lasting about four or five months. Following consultations and solutions between the Shanghai and Zhejiang Postal Administrations, the service has now been restored. Letters mailed from Shanghai to Jinhua, Zhuji, Dongyang, Yiwu, and other towns can reach their destinations in less than ten days. However, registered letters will take about two weeks and are transported by land and water.

Parcels to Various Regions:

Due to transportation delays, the Post Office cannot fully resume accepting parcels to all regions. Currently, parcel acceptance is limited to Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and other areas. Services to northern Jiangsu and other places have been gradually suspended. Therefore, the Postal Administration's parcel service volume is low, significantly impacting revenue. However, recognizing the impact of suspending parcel services on local industry and commerce, the Administration is actively planning to gradually restore services. All citizens mailing personal parcels must present their citizen identification card.

### Jingwu Athletic Association;

Seeking Members for the 34th Term;

The Shanghai Jingwu Athletic Association was founded in the second year of the Xuantong era of the late Qing Dynasty, with a history of 34 years and over 3,000 members. It is a purely social service organization, focusing on physical education and emphasizing moral and intellectual development. Over the past three decades, it has continuously expanded its operations and garnered support and sponsorship from the community. The Association seeks to develop its activities and recruit members annually. This year's 24th membership drive will be organized by a recruitment committee, with Lin Kanghou as the chief director, Yang Youming and Shi Zhidang as chief consultants, and Zhang Wenkui and Jin Xinmin as chief executive officers. The committee will be divided into 30 teams, each with its own captain, deputy captain, consultant, executive officer, and members. The recruitment target is 150,000 points, with each team responsible for 5,000 points. The membership fee is 25 yuan per member (annual fee), meaning each team must recruit 600 members, totaling 1.5 million yuan. The Association is located on the fourth floor of the Shu Da Building, with a gymnasium equipped for basketball, handball, volleyball, badminton, Western boxing, and various other equipment exercises. Members can visit the Association at any time for various fitness or ball game exercises.

### Music Association;

20th Symphony Concert;

The Shanghai Music Association held its 20th symphony concert yesterday (7th) at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum Theatre on Route Tenant de la Tour in the French Concession. The conductor was Mei Baiqi of Datong Orchestra. The program was exceptional, including the Italian Symphony, and each piece received thunderous applause. During the intermission, tickets for the 21st symphony concert were sold. The 21st symphony concert will be held on the 14th at 5:30 PM at the Lyceum.

### Tramways in the Public Concession;

Average Daily Mileage of 30,000 Miles; Approximately 500,000 Passengers;

Tramways are the only means of transportation for Shanghai's 5 million residents. The Shanghai Public Concession Tramway Company operates seven streetcar lines and fifteen trolleybus lines.

Streetcar lines: 1 (Jing'an Temple to Embassy Office), 2 (Jing'an Temple to Waiyangjing Bridge), 3 (Macon Road to Dongxin Bridge), 5 (North Railway Station to Dongxin Bridge), 8 (Waiyangjing Bridge to Yangshupu), 11 (Waiyangjing Bridge to Embassy Office), 12 (Tilanqiao to Jing'an Temple). Trolleybus lines: 14 (North Railway Station to Zhengjia Muqiao), 16 (Sanyangjing Bridge to Caojiadu), 17 (Sichuan Road Orange to Great World), 18 (Great World to North Railway Station), 19 (Xiaoshadu Road to Changping Road), 20 (Simalu Bund to Zhaofeng Park), 21 (Sichuan Road Bridge to Macon Road), 24 (Fuxu Road to Xiaoshadu Road, Robert Sheng Road) run hundreds of times a day.

These tramways travel approximately 32,000 miles daily. Comparing this to the 4,500-mile distance from Yokohama, Japan, to San Francisco, USA, it is equivalent to three round trips between Yokohama and San Francisco. The daily ridership is approximately 500,000, with even more during the spring and autumn seasons, exceeding 600,000. This demonstrates the significant number of people who rely on tramways for transportation. On average, one in ten of the five million residents uses the tramway daily. Accidents are rare, averaging about three times a month for streetcars and twice a month for trolleybuses. This is due to the extensive training of the drivers and their commitment to "safety first," as well as the increased attention of traffic police. Currently, there are about 340 tramway vehicles and approximately 3,500 employees (ticket collectors, conductors, drivers). Compared to before the Greater East Asia War, everything feels like a different era. Even the number of passengers was at most 400,000 per day before the war.

When the British flag flew over Shanghai, there were British double-decker buses, but they disappeared with the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Everything has changed. Previously, all executives of the tramway company were from enemy countries, but they have been replaced by Chinese, Japanese, Spaniards, Portuguese, and Filipinos.

The current number of tramways is insufficient to meet demand, and the company is considering expanding routes and increasing the number of vehicles. Previously, there were first-class and third-class sections in the front carriage, but these have been abolished and all are now first-class. Recently, a new vehicle without first-class and third-class divisions was completed and is operating on Route 1. Five more are being prepared and are expected to be completed and operational in April.

To enhance employee knowledge and facilitate their work, the company provides comprehensive training and teaches Japanese. Many conductors on tramways running in Hongkou are now able to greet Japanese passengers in Japanese and announce street names, symbolizing the prelude to Sino-Japanese cooperation.

### Long-Term Residents from Other Regions Must Obtain Identification Cards;

Can Apply with Original County Resident Certificates;

To Enjoy Household Registration and Food Rationing Rights;

Shanghai is an important commercial hub with frequent travelers, which is quite convenient. However, since the authorities implemented food rationing based on population, people from other regions who come to Shanghai and intend to reside here for an extended period face the difficulty of not being able to purchase food rations without a local identification card. Recognizing this, the authorities in both concessions decided to remedy the situation. Anyone coming to Shanghai from the countryside who wishes to reside here permanently can immediately apply for a local identification card or residence permit from the local Baojia Affairs Office with their original Township Resident Certificate or County Resident Certificate. They must first fill out an application form, which will be approved by the police station, and then an identification card will be issued. With this card, they can enjoy the right to receive household food rations.

### Special Feature on Various Regions of Southeast Asia, Part Six;

The Emerging Burma (1) by Qinglian

(1) Magnificent Buddhist Country

Burma is located east of Bengal, bordering Bengal in India to the southwest, Thailand to the southeast, and the Chinese provinces of Xikang and Yunnan to the north. It covers an area of 231,000 square miles, or 600,050 square kilometers. Its residents are of the Mongolian Burmese race, further divided into Shans, also known as "Baiyi," Karens, Arakanese and Yangbilians, Tailayin people, Chinese, Kachins, Palaung people, etc., essentially the Miao, Yao, and Lolo groups of southwestern China. Foreigners residing in Burma are mostly Indians, Chinese, people of mixed Indian and Burmese descent, Europeans and people of mixed European descent, and other foreigners. A population breakdown by ethnicity is provided below:

(1931 Census, Units in Thousands)

Among these residents, Buddhists account for the majority, making up 84.3% of the total population. Other smaller groups include animists at 4.4%, Muslims at 4.0%, Hindus at 3.9%, Christians at 2.3%, and others at 1.1%.

The small population of Burma is mainly due to the oppressive policies of British imperialism, which resulted in cruel mistreatment and massacres of Burmese and Chinese people. Secondly, the indigenous people are predominantly followers of Theravada Buddhism, and their excessive religious devotion has also affected population growth.

According to the 1941 national census, the Burmese population has increased by 2 million in the last ten years, reaching over 16.8 million. The primary reason is increased immigration. Among these, Indians account for approximately 2 million, Chinese approximately 230,000, and Europeans a mere 30,000. The remaining indigenous groups are mostly farmers, accounting for approximately 80%. The majority of Burmese businesses are controlled by Indians and overseas Chinese. Most Burmese farmers are exploited by usurers and pawnshops. Industries such as oil, mining, and forestry are controlled by the British. Indians are also involved in general industries and trade. Indian workers account for more than half of the Burmese workforce.

Burma has an excellent climate. Even in the Himalayas, on the border between India and Burma, the annual rainfall reaches 200 centimeters. However, the coastal regions bordering the Bay of Bengal are rich in Southeast Asian tropical characteristics, filled with warmth and human and natural enthusiasm. Although there is still "miasma" in the mountains of the north and northwest, it does not have a significant negative impact on people's lives.

Not only is the coastline imbued with Southeast Asian flavor, but more importantly, Burma is a mountainous country, with the Himalayas cutting it off from south to north. Between the mountains lies the Irrawaddy River basin – Burma's equivalent of the Yangtze River – forming Burma's primary agricultural region, full of poetic and picturesque fertile land. The mountains of Burma are covered in forests, further enhancing the splendor and beauty of this Buddhist country!

(2) Abundant Resources

The northeastern, western, and northwestern sides of Burma are surrounded by steep mountainous regions. The southern side faces the sea, and the Salween River flows from north to south along the eastern border, which is rich in mineral resources. The Irrawaddy River basin in the west has numerous oil fields, and the downstream delta area is a rice-producing center. The dry areas of Upper Burma are suitable for cotton cultivation.

The cotton production in 1939 was 173,000 metric tons, a significant decrease compared to 272,000 metric tons in 1937. This was the result of the British authorities' policy on Indian food supply and the issue of labor shortage in Burma, leading to production cuts. However, in East Asia, Burma's cotton production ranks first, second only to China and Korea.

Rice production ranks fourth in the world after China, India, and Japan, and is the most developed in Southeast Asia. The output in 1938 was 81.6 million metric tons, making it the largest food supplier to food-deficient India, Ceylon, and other regions. Therefore, the fall of Burma would undoubtedly pose a major threat to the lives of the Indian people and exacerbate the British Indian problem.

In addition, Burma's agricultural resources include sesame and peanuts, with substantial annual exports.

Burmese oil, like rice, has always been a source of energy for India. In 1938, it produced 264 million gallons of crude oil, mainly in Annayatwen, Singu Island, Annayatwen, Lanywa, Indaw, Minbu, Chindwin, and Swemyo. It accounts for 4% of the world's production. The British Burma Oil Company holds a monopoly position, with subsidiaries such as Anglo-Burma Oil Company and Indo-Burma Petroleum Company, which are also quite powerful. In terms of equipment, Indo-Burma Petroleum Company is the most advanced. Oil is transported from the Indaw oilfield to the Pensa refinery, a distance of 27 miles. The Singu and Annayatwen oilfields are connected by a 4-inch pipeline, Singu and Annayatwen by an 8-inch pipeline, and Annayatwen to the Syriam refinery on the banks of the Rangoon River, a distance of 275 miles, by a 10-inch pipeline. In the Rangoon area, Anglo-Burma Oil Company produces approximately 2,500 barrels of oil per day, while Burma Oil Company produces approximately 2,000 barrels. The main product is kerosene, followed by motor gasoline. Due to equipment limitations, the production of aviation fuel is limited and of poor quality.

In terms of forestry, teak (suitable for shipbuilding) is the primary product. The estimated forest area is over 70 million acres, of which 22.2 million acres are protected forests directly under government control. The British government's revenue from forestry is considerable, and it directly and indirectly employs approximately 425,000 people, ranking third after agriculture and the textile industry. The majority of forest products are also exported to India.

Burma also has substantial production of tungsten, cobalt, nickel, and lead, which are crucial for the process of heavy industrialization. Tungsten production is 5,000 tons, second only to China's 12,000 tons, ranking second in the world. Cobalt production holds a monopoly position, on par with Canada outside of Africa. It also ranks first in East Asia. Nickel production is 900 tons, which is significantly less than Canada's 63,000 tons and New Caledonia's 8,000 tons. However, it can supply almost one-third of Japan's needs. (Japan's demand before 1935 was 2,500 to 3,000 tons). Lead production is approximately 83,000 metric tons, supplying more than one-tenth of Britain's needs. The recent production of these major minerals is shown in the table below. Although the status of oil, rice, and timber in East Asia is relatively low, the production of lead and tungsten is of considerable significance.

Burma's Main Mineral Production Table (Unit: Tons)

(Note) CWT, a unit of measure, is 112 pounds in Britain, one-twentieth of a ton, and 100 pounds in the United States.

(3) Historical Recollections

In the 13th century, during the Yuan Dynasty in China, Burma was affiliated with China. Later, it was sometimes independent and sometimes subordinate. By the 17th century, during the prosperous Qing Dynasty, it became a tributary state of China. In the 18th century, its territory expanded, extending to Siam on one side and Bengal on the other. At that time, Britain was developing India and had ambitions for the countries of the East, especially China. As a result, Burma, located between India and China, attracted the attention of the British colonial authorities, who began to encroach eastward from Bengal, initiating the history of British aggression against Burma.

Strictly speaking, British aggression against Burma began more than two centuries ago. The pioneers were traders, and the supporters were the East India Company. The initial center of British trade with Burma was in the Gulf of Martaban and the vicinity of Rangoon. With the development of commerce, British influence gradually penetrated Burma. The rich mineral resources of Burma ignited the covetous eyes of the British, sparking their ambitions for aggression. Furthermore, from a geographical perspective, Burma was the best base for managing India and tapping into the treasures of southwestern China. Thus, within peaceful commercial activities, the ambitions of British imperialism germinated, gradually supported by organized militarism, initiating the annexation and aggression of Burma. After three Anglo-Burmese wars in 1824, 1852, and 1885, Burma was "conquered."

In the early 19th century, the British threat to Burma intensified. To preempt, Burma attacked Bengal in 1824, successively capturing Mymensingh, Cachar, Chittagong, and other places. The British colonial authorities blocked the Burmese army and dispatched naval and land forces to occupy key coastal areas such as Rangoon and Tenasserim. The following year, they defeated a 60,000-strong Burmese army, and Burmese General Bandula was killed in action. The British army advanced to within 15 miles of the Burmese capital, Ava. The Burmese king was forced to sue for peace, and the Anglo-Burmese Treaty was signed on February 24, 1826. According to the treaty, the Burmese king relinquished sovereignty over Assam and ceded Arakan, Ea, Dafoi, timber yards, Tenasserim, and other places to the British. From this point on, the British gained control of important areas in Burma along the Bay of Bengal, and the Burmese king continued to rule only Upper Burma and Lower Burma's Pegu and its port of Rangoon.

In 1852, the British again used the pretext that the Burmese were anti-British and harming British merchants to send troops ashore from Rangoon and occupy the entire territory of Pegu. They formally declared Pegu to be a British territory, merging it with the previously occupied areas to form the province of Lower Burma, directly under the Indian government. At that time, the Burmese king was powerless to reclaim it and merely declared his opposition. Ten years later (1862), diplomatic relations between Britain and Burma were restored, but the issue was not addressed, implicitly recognizing Pegu's annexation by Britain. In 1867, Britain and Burma signed the Manchester Treaty, restoring all trade and diplomatic relations. In reality, Britain had already seized control of Burma and began to act as it pleased.

In 1878, the new Burmese King Thibaw ascended the throne and sought to prevent the expansion of British power by relying on French strength. He also hoped to benefit from the conflicts between Britain and France in Indochina. Therefore, pro-French sentiment prevailed in Burma, allowing the French to build a railway from Annam and Tonkin to the Burmese capital, establish a bank in Burma, mine mineral resources, and transfer the concessions granted to British companies to the French. British imperialism issued an ultimatum to the Burmese king on October 22, 1885, demanding that he cede Burmese diplomatic powers to the British Indian government. After the Burmese king refused sternly, Britain sent troops to invade Burma. On November 28 of that year, they captured the Burmese capital, Mandalay, and the Burmese king was captured. The British designated the existing Burmese territory as the province of Upper Burma, directly under the Indian government. Burma officially became a colony of British imperialism on January 1, 1886.

As mentioned above, Burma had long been a tributary state of southwestern China. China had every reason to defend its tributary state when Britain began to annex Burma. However, the Qing court turned a blind eye and instead signed the Beijing Treaty with Britain on June 23, 1886, recognizing British sovereignty over Burma. Britain also recognized that the Burmese could continue to pay tribute to China. In reality, the Burmese never paid tribute to China again.

### Cultural Renaissance Movement  Dongfeng

This time, the Shenbao Monthly published a collection of short essays under the theme "Today's Shanghai Cultural Scene," which received an enthusiastic response from readers. Due to the limited space in the monthly magazine, not all submissions could be included. We have selected several articles and reprinted them in this newspaper. - Editor's Note

As the flames of war spread across the world, a general decline and gloom has descended on culture, a universal phenomenon. Shanghai, having endured its own baptism of war, is no exception. However, Shanghai has always been the center of Chinese culture, and it remains so today. Moreover, Shanghai bears the responsibility of revitalizing the culture of a new China. Therefore, a cultural renaissance movement is urgently needed.

War is the archenemy of culture, causing immense destruction and often dragging culture backward. For example, Germany's recent total mobilization brought all cultural activities to a halt, demonstrating that culture cannot thrive in the heat of war. However, culture is still what drives war. Without Germany's advanced culture, how could it wage such a large-scale war? Although Shanghai is within the war zone, it also bears a war-related mission. Nevertheless, we can still find time for cultural activities. In short, we must engage in cultural activities whenever we have a moment or an opportunity, because people cannot exist without culture, except in extreme circumstances.

Let's first examine the factors that shape culture, which may provide guidance for our cultural renaissance movement. Historically, culture has always blossomed in an environment of ease and leisure. For example, the ancient civilizations of Babylon and Egypt arose in environments of abundant resources and comfortable living. Moreover, the fruits of culture can only ripen on the flowers of freedom. The academic thought of the Spring and Autumn and Warring States periods, as well as the culture of ancient Greece, surpassed any other era in their development, primarily due to freedom of thought. More recently, Peking University, the birthplace of China's New Culture Movement, was a world-renowned institution. At that time, Mr. Cai Yuanpei was the president of the university, allowing professors and students to freely express their views. From conservative to radical, everyone could establish their own unique perspective and compete for supremacy, and Cai himself participated in these activities. Thus, Peking University became the cradle of the New Culture Movement, which later flourished and grew, shaping the Chinese culture of today. If Cai had insisted on his personal opinions, flaunted his authority as president, or excluded dissenters, the New Culture Movement would have been crushed. Could it have achieved its current brilliance? We can now draw a conclusion: the formation of culture requires both a comfortable living and a fertile ground of freedom. By measuring the current situation in Shanghai against these two factors, we can prescribe the right medicine and potentially achieve twice the results with half the effort in our current cultural renaissance movement.

Since the outbreak of the war, all cultural groups and organizations in Shanghai have disintegrated, and many cultural figures have dispersed, some leaving Shanghai to seek their fortunes elsewhere, while others remain in Shanghai, struggling to survive. In the meantime, various publications have ceased publication, turning Shanghai into a desolate cultural wasteland. At the same time, cultural figures are being tossed about in the high tide of rising living costs, struggling to breathe. Because they don't usually engage in production, they are at a relative disadvantage in this chaotic environment. They spend their days struggling to make a living, barely escaping the threat of starvation and cold, leaving them little time to devote to their craft. Despite this, many admirable and commendable cultural figures continue to work hard despite hunger and cold. However, these people have long been forgotten by the masses, at best leaving only a faint impression in their minds.

Although a few well-known figures are loudly calling for help for cultural figures, their calls have received little response. For example, the Shanghai News' Grain Loan program was fully funded by a single anonymous donor in the first phase. Now, the second phase has begun, but funding has yet to be secured and fundraising is still underway. Yet, the Shanghai public is quite enthusiastic about charitable causes, often donating millions at a time. Why is it so difficult to raise a mere hundred thousand yuan for the Grain Loan program? This shows that the general public has long forgotten cultural figures.

If we want to revive culture, we must awaken the public's attention and support. Culture relies on the support of the masses; without the support of the masses, how can culture arise? In addition to public support, culture also needs a fertile ground of freedom, allowing it to branch out and grow, as mentioned above. Furthermore, the time it takes for the seeds of culture to blossom and bear fruit is uncertain. Often, the trees planted by the previous generation provide shade for the next. Therefore, we should not expect too much from the fruits of culture, and we must not try to force growth. We only need to water and weed it from time to time. Therefore, we hope that cultural activities will involve less political elements, be freely organized by the people, and receive assistance and ample freedom from the government. Then, the flowers of culture will surely spread across Shanghai.

As mentioned above, if the public can support the cultural renaissance movement and the government can provide assistance from the sidelines, then our cultural figures should redouble their efforts, not belittle themselves, and not sit in their ivory towers like before, creating works for self-admiration. They should assess the current environment and world trends, thoroughly abandon their past decadence, arrogance, disorganization, jealousy, and other bad habits, and work diligently. Then, the cultural renaissance can be anticipated.

### Liquid Fuel in Central China;

Using Oil Sludge to Refine Gasoline Substitute;

Mr. Hibi Toshio, the author of this article, is the director of the Nantong Agricultural Experiment Station of the Jiangbei Industrial Company's Agricultural Affairs Department. He devoted himself to researching how to extract gasoline substitutes from oil sludge and achieved success after more than a year of effort. A brief overview of his process was published on page 4 of this newspaper on March 6. We have now translated and published Mr. Hibi's detailed report for our readers' attention. - Editor's Note

We are currently living in an era of fuel scarcity. Coal liquefaction has progressed from the hydrogenation method to a unique stage and is rapidly entering the industrialization path. Northern China has vast coal reserves, so this problem is not difficult to solve. However, in the vast Central China, this problem can be studied from a different perspective, namely by using cotton oil refining residue to produce liquid fuel. Approximately 70% of liquid fuel can be produced from this type of vegetable oil refining residue.

Research Motivation

When I went to Nantong to take office, an insightful person from Nantong visited me and mentioned that gasoline substitutes could be produced from cotton oil. He said that the Cotton Crop Chemistry Department of Nantong Agricultural College had this facility before. After investigation, it was found that the method had not been completed. Therefore, I had the opportunity to study it. Recently, due to restrictions on the allocation of heavy oil and gasoline, the operation of various internal combustion engine ships has been greatly hindered, and the Chinese are also very concerned about this issue. I therefore decided to start research.

About Raw Materials

Central China can produce about 4 million dan of cotton, and Jiangbei, known as the granary of Central China, produces about 840,000 dan of cotton and about 550,000 dan of cottonseed. If all of these approximately 550,000 dan of cottonseed are used to extract oil, approximately 55,000 dan of cotton oil can be produced. In reality, not all of it can be used for oil extraction in Jiangbei and most of it is transported to Shanghai. China produces about 0.1 million tons of cotton oil and most of it is used for food. In the interior, charcoal and cottonseed husk ash are used for cotton oil refining. Lime is commonly used for refining, while caustic soda refining is not adopted due to its high cost.

The cotton oil extracted by the lime refining method is black in color and impure, and cannot be used for food. Therefore, more lime must be added to the crude oil, stirred and heated to precipitate and remove the impurities it contains. The residue containing impurities is commonly known as lime refining residue, or "oil sludge" in China. This substance contains too many impurities and has little utility value. Although it can be used as part of the raw material for soap, because its composition is lime salt of fatty acids, it must be converted into soda soap or potassium soap to be used to manufacture ordinary soap. The operation is extremely difficult, so it is discarded.

On the other hand, Manchuria conducts thorough research on soybeans, its major agricultural product. Not only is the oil extraction industry well-developed, but also the utilization of soybean oil, soybean protein, and soybean cake is studied exhaustively, making it an emerging and active soybean industry. However, the cottonseeds, the major agricultural product of Central China, are not sufficiently studied, and their oil and protein are often simply discarded. This is a very regrettable thing.

Uses of Oils and Fats

With the expansion of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the oil and fat resources of the South are also newly added, especially coconut oil, which can produce 5 million tons annually, of which about half can be exported. So, in the future, it can be supplied to the mainland of Japan and China. Coconut oil is excellent for making soap, and if it is refined, it can obtain an excellent frying oil. Therefore, it is necessary to make efforts to study how to make cotton oil in Central China meet the new uses of the new era. After the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the increase in the production of lubricating oil is an inevitable trend. Four-tenths of it can only be obtained from oil and fat resources, so manufacturing lubricating oil from oil and fat resources has become a current major problem.

History of Oil Sludge Fuel

This history is quite interesting. Before the incident, China's kerosene production was very scarce. Therefore, everyone considered using oil sludge to replace kerosene in the event of an emergency. Therefore, the research on kerosene production from oil sludge was prevalent in research institutes and universities in various places. As a result of the research, Professor Hui of the Central University and Professor Du, the director of the Applied Chemistry Research Institute of Nankai University in Tianjin, made the most outstanding contributions. Nantong Agricultural College, of course, has also been conducting research, but it was interrupted due to this incident, and has only recently been restored. The mainland of Japan is also prevalent in the dry distillation research of fish oil. According to the recent publication of Professor Kita's Research Office of Kyoto Imperial University, by adding lime to the mixture of soap and organic and inorganic impurities discharged from the washing factory and performing dry distillation, an oil-like substance can be obtained. The research has been successful and it has been proven that its composition is very similar to kerosene.

Refining Method

My method uses oil sludge (namely cotton oil lime refining residue), which is extremely cheap and almost waste, as a raw material, and performs dry distillation to cause molecular cracking. This produces crude gasoline and volatile oil, crude heavy oil, and crude mobile oil. Crude gasoline can be used for gasoline engines, and crude car oil can be used for internal combustion engines. As for crude mobile oil, it becomes lubricating oil after hydrogenation. Furthermore, if high-pressure hydrogenation is performed, lubricating oil for aviation use can be obtained. I am currently researching this purpose. The above various substances are all obtained by extracting oil sludge. If cotton oil is used for extraction, the quality of the product will naturally be better, and the operation will of course be simpler.

First, according to the method obtained by Chinese research institutes, oil sludge is used without a catalyst, and dry distillation is performed. In the first four hours, heat to 200 degrees Celsius, and then heat to 400 degrees Celsius for five hours. After this dry distillation, approximately 70% of the kerosene-like substance is obtained. Secondly, according to the method obtained by Chinese research institutes, acidic white clay is added to the oil sludge, and dry distillation is performed in the same way, and it can also be manufactured. However, it takes a long time and does not meet economic principles. Therefore, in addition to the lime and acidic white clay that have always been used, more than 36 kinds of compounds are used, namely oxides and salts of alkali, alkaline earth metals, metals, heavy metals, etc., which are added to the oil sludge to cause a reaction. It was then discovered that there is a certain relationship between molecular weight and the law of molecular

### International Women's Day – Letter to Women from the Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association

Dear sisters across the country:

As we celebrate this year's "March 8th" International Women's Day, two kinds of feelings arise in us: When we look back at the past, we feel excited, but when we look forward to the future, we feel serious.

Thanks to the efforts and struggles of the pioneers of the women's movement, over the past thirty years, our women's community has broken free from the shackles of feudalism and gained liberation amidst heavy oppression and various constraints. Today, we have fought for equality in political, economic, and legal status. Furthermore, through our unity and self-respect, we have strengthened the equal status we have won and ensured permanent victory. How can this not make us excited?

However, the mission that the new era has given to our women's community is not limited to gaining equality in political, economic, and legal status. Because a new China is growing, a new East Asia is developing, and the entire world is undergoing new transformations. Standing before this new history, we cannot but realize that what we fought for in the past were rights, but from now on, we will have to bear responsibilities. Saving China, protecting East Asia, and even transforming the world, we women must also bear responsibilities. How can this not make us feel serious?

We have fought for rights. From now on, can we evade responsibilities? Our self-esteem answers us: No! We who are born today are ashamed to evade responsibilities!

Here, with a sincere heart, we would like to offer loyal advice to women compatriots of all social strata, with the following points:

(1) We hope that ordinary housewives will, from now on, unanimously practice thrift. At the same time, severely abstain from extravagance. Because rising prices and difficult living conditions have already formed a serious problem. While the government is planning positive solutions, passive remedies must still be maintained through our own efforts. Educating children is our natural duty, which must not only not be neglected but also be given special attention. Because, from a broader perspective, it directly relates to the quality of the entire nation, how can it be taken lightly?

(2) We hope that women in general professions should, most importantly, strive to enrich their abilities and improve their skills. Strengthen our self-esteem, and completely eliminate our dependence. We should have a belief that it is not only glorious to be loved, but even more honorable to be respected. We must build women's personality on the point of fulfilling obligations to society and responsibilities to the country. We not only hope that professional women are aware of or understand this pursuit but especially hope that all professional women will practice it and set an example.

(3) We hope that women in school will earnestly study and research practical knowledge, seek true knowledge, and use it as the foundation for serving society in the future. In particular, we should know that extravagance is not a virtue, and vanity can lead to ruin. Women in school, from an environmental and economic perspective, can be said to be uniquely privileged. How can they not emphasize self-respect? If you waste time in school, and later society wants you to fulfill some obligations, you cannot, and the country wants you to fulfill responsibilities, you still cannot, then may I ask what the meaning and value of your existence is? In the future, the obligations that our women will have to fulfill will be even greater, and the responsibilities that we should bear will be even greater. More obligations and greater responsibilities will be shouldered by today's women in school. How can women in school be slack in their efforts and not encourage themselves?

(4) We have infinite sympathy for working women. In addition to admiring the contributions of working women's sweat and blood, and their profound endurance of hardship, our only hope is that working women will pay more attention to their health within the possible range. Working women work hard and enjoy little, and can face the world without shame. Therefore, women of other strata should be moved by you and learn from you to make themselves healthy.

When women of all strata progress, when combined, they can generate strength. When that strength is used for society, society benefits. When used for the country, it can invisibly assist in national construction. Today, we should face the new era squarely, accept the new mission, and strive in the right direction and struggle toward the right goal. This is in line with the meaning of celebrating this year's Women's Day. We hope that women across the country will encourage each other!

### The Shanghai District Bureau of the Income Tax Office Begins to Levy Income Tax on Industrial and Commercial Profits Last Year; Implemented and Started Collecting from March 1st

The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office of the Ministry of Finance, in view of the fact that the industrial, commercial, banking, and money industries in this city have completed the year-end closing of accounts for last year's business surplus after the end of the old lunar year, and started new business this year after February 9th, in order to collect taxes in accordance with legal procedures and enrich national tax revenue, it has scheduled to start collecting income tax on business profits from various industries starting this month, and has notified all industries to comply. Details are as follows:

Shanghai District Bureau Announcement on Starting Collection

The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Office issued Announcement No. 8 the day before, stating that the income tax on Category 1 business profits for the 31st year will be collected on March 1st in accordance with regulations. Various companies, firms, shops, factories, and warehouses must truthfully declare the amount of profits for the 31st year in accordance with the regulations and on schedule. Tax arrears from previous years should also be reported for verification and handling. Do not delay, this is a special announcement.

Mandatory Declaration and Audit Procedures

The procedures for collecting taxes from various industries in Shanghai are the sole responsibility of the Shanghai District Bureau. All industries must truthfully declare their last year's business profit amount to the bureau on schedule. After the bureau reviews the accounts and audits whether the reported amount is accurate, if it is the correct amount, it will immediately determine the amount of business income tax to be paid and designate payment to the Central Reserve Bank. If it is inaccurate, the amount of tax to be paid will be determined according to the bureau's audit results. The tax collection agency is also the Central Bank. As for tax arrears from the past, they should be paid in accordance with the regulations without error.

### Measures for Allocating Flour to the Noodle Products Industry Are Under Overall Planning; Distributing Certificates for Cut Noodles, Cakes, and Steamed Buns; The Industry is Still Requesting Changes

Regarding the resumption of flour allocation to noodle shops and stalls, the Works Bureau's materials control department is under overall planning. Generally, cut noodle shops will be issued cut noodle certificates, and cake and steamed bun shops will be issued cake and steamed bun certificates. Residents will exchange flour for cut noodle certificates or cake and steamed bun certificates, and then exchange the certificates for products. However, the noodle products industry is deeply afraid that no one will exchange them, which will cause the unmade flour to be frozen, and the made flour products to rot. Therefore, it is still requesting to improve the allocation method.

### Improving National Health

— Optimist

A strong nation must first have a strong people

Compared with European countries, China is always lagging behind in everything, even in the health of its citizens, it is unknown how many times behind. Why does China's mortality rate rank first in the world year after year? Why is China's average age the shortest in the world? Why are Chinese people gray-haired and old before the age of forty? Although there are other reasons included; the biggest reason is that young people do not have sufficient cultivation and training in their youth. In other words, it is because China's sex education is unsound and sports are underdeveloped. Therefore, we young people must conserve our energy in our youth in order to serve the country and society in the future. Otherwise, even if we have profound knowledge, it will be in vain if we cannot bear this arduous work. This is not only a loss for individuals, but a loss for the entire nation. I hereby present my humble opinions below for adoption.

(1) The state should establish youth camps. European countries and friendly Japan have long established such institutions. Germany and Italy have achieved the most remarkable results. The funds are all aided by the state. All young people who are fourteen years old must enter the camp, and it is mandatory. The training period is four years. The courses taught are the same as those taught in ordinary schools, but there are more sports items, and knowledge of sexual aspects is also taught.

(2) Recompile health textbooks, enrich materials related to sexual knowledge. The health textbooks published in the past rarely mentioned anything about sexual knowledge. Even if there were any, it was only a few words! When revising in the future, if this issue can be given more attention, it will also be a small help to young people.

(3) The state should compile and print health booklets and distribute them to middle schools and universities. The Ministry of Health and Welfare of Japan spends a lot of money every year compiling and printing such booklets and distributing them to middle schools and universities, which describe the prevention of sexual diseases and the terror after recovery, so that students are aware and do not fall.

(4) I hope that the state will build more gymnasiums and sports fields. In the past, several sports fields in Shanghai were used by blue-eyed and yellow-haired children, and the Chinese had no share. Although some schools also have sports facilities, they are either poorly equipped with sports equipment or very small in area. They are not enough for many people to exercise. Therefore, I hope that the state will pay attention to this, and then the nation will be healthy and excellent.

(5) Hold health lectures and distribute health publications. The lack of health publications in Shanghai is beyond question. Therefore, I hope that when printing in the future, the content will focus on sex education, supplemented by health aspects. The price should be as low as possible, and a health lecture should be held once a week, inviting famous doctors to give lectures in turn. Because other lectures in Shanghai are surging, only health lectures are lacking, so this is also worth promoting.

I hope that the government authorities, the medical community, and all walks of life will work hard to promote the above points to achieve success. Then the nation will be fortunate, and the country will be fortunate.

### The Panic of Books

— Shen Zhiming

In the past, it was said that "tailors and secretaries have no clothes to wear, and farmers have no food to eat." Now it has reached the point where the people in our publishing industry, the bookstore owners, have no books to read, and the bookstore owners' children have no books to read either.

Last year, I talked with several colleagues in the book industry, and my prediction was that there would be a panic of books in the coming school season. At that time, my basis was (1) the business situation of the book industry (2) the inventory of books (3) the publishing policy of the book industry.

Sure enough, not only could other people's children not buy books, but my children also suffered the same fate. Because the panic of books is different from the panic of medicines, etc., we are not hoarding books and waiting for a "good price." We are hoping to clear the inventory as soon as possible. Therefore, other people's children have no books to read, and our children who are engaged in the book industry receive the same treatment in school.

Now that half a year has passed, my prediction is still the same, and the book panic will be even more serious next semester. Therefore, I would like to talk about the three points I based on before, and discuss how to solve the book panic.

(1) Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the book industry has been stagnant for a time, resulting in no publishing work at all. At this time, it is completely a method of selling inventory without making goods, so-called buying and finishing.

(2) Books and paper are inseparable. When paper was three yuan a ream, it was a prosperous period for the industry, so the more books printed, the better. Now the price of paper is more than five yuan. At this time, if you want bookstores to print more books and put them in warehouses as inventory, bookstores will never do this. Moreover, bookstores rarely store a large amount of paper like paper companies. Even if there is a large amount of paper, they would rather put paper than turn white paper into oily paper with black characters. Therefore, the current period is when bookstores are printing as few books as possible.

(3) In terms of publishing, taking textbooks as an example, they are all currently state-owned, and the number of types is very small and the printing is also limited. Therefore, if the old version is not available, new books cannot be published, and there is no book to print if you want to print.

Then, does this mean that books will be in a state of panic forever? This is not entirely true. Here are two methods I have proposed:

(1) Is to enable producers and consumers to have prior contact. Bookstores usually print up to 1,000 copies of a book, but in reality, only a few hundred copies are sold. In this way, the bookstore has a large amount of inventory. If the book can be sold at a good price like cotton and medicine, it doesn't matter. However, the inventory of books is mostly counted as "bad debt reserves" in our annual accounting settlement. Therefore, if the school authorities want to adopt any books, they may contact or reserve them with the bookstore half a year in advance. At the same time, the bookstore can set a fixed printing method and notify the teachers and school authorities of each school to register within half a year. This registration organization does not have to be managed by each bookstore separately, but can be jointly handled by the top five colleagues. At the same time, I want to honestly say that the school authorities will not have any sales representatives from each bookstore to contact the school and sell at lower prices. Therefore, in order to avoid the difficulty of being short of books after school starts, the school and the bookstore should have a cooperative effort first.

(2) Printing paper – readers should not dislike the quality, so that costs can be reduced and the source of paper can be increased. Even we insiders feel shocked when we take a thin book in our hands and see that the price is ten yuan. Therefore, the cost of printing a book is very relevant. Bookstores also hope to sell at a lower price. Although books are "spiritual food," people engaged in the book industry also know that they cannot be like "material food," which will be welcomed even if the price soars. Therefore, I have been discussing with several paper mill owners how to provide a low-priced and suitable printing paper. This will not only solve the source of paper, but also reduce the price of books, and increase the amount and types of books printed, which will be beneficial to readers and bookstore owners.

To solve the current and future panic of books, I think there are only two ways.
