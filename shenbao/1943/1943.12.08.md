### Welcoming the Third Year of the Greater East Asia War

Today marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War! We commemorate this historically transformative war amidst the great victories in the South Pacific, which is not only cause for celebration but also assures us that this war will be swiftly and victoriously concluded!

China's participation in the war has also reached eleven months. During this period, we have repeatedly reflected in our writings to awaken a shared sense of urgency among the government and the people.

Today, we should certainly be enthusiastic about the Greater East Asia War. However, we must also engage in sincere self-reflection regarding our own cooperation in the war effort: First, what have we actually contributed since joining the war? Second, do we possess an unwavering belief in victory for the Greater East Asia War? The results of this reflection might make us ashamed because, frankly, we cannot confidently answer either of these questions. Nevertheless, for the sake of China's destiny and the destiny of Greater East Asia, we absolutely need to strengthen our belief and cooperate in the war. We would like to offer a few points regarding the challenges of the third year of the Greater East Asia War:

During the two years of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has mobilized everything for the war effort. As we begin this third year, we must shift away from emphasizing verbal propaganda and move towards a period of implementation and action. We must all realize the importance of practice. On the government's part, this means implementing wartime systems and policies. On the part of officials, this means leading the people by example and living a wartime lifestyle.

Cooperating in the Greater East Asia War is China's only path to independent survival. Therefore, based on China's destiny, securing victory in the Greater East Asia War is a must. The ultimate failure of the Chongqing regime, which relies on Britain and the United States, and the failure of fence-sitting are inevitable.

Cooperation in the Greater East Asia War must begin from the basics, especially strengthening our own country. How do we strengthen our country? First, the people should have the right to participate in politics, so that the people and the government are united as one. Second, the people's lives should be stable, and they should happily serve the country. Third, economic development should be advanced, and resources should be developed and utilized to the fullest extent. If we talk about cooperating in the war without these points, the result will inevitably be a repetition of past failures.

The prosperity of a country cannot be solely the responsibility of the government; the general populace must also take responsibility. The people should support the government's national policies on one hand and urge the government to reform politics and clean up corruption on the other.

In conclusion, the third year of the Greater East Asia War will be a year of decisive victory. We Chinese, on the one hand, must cooperate in striving for victory to fulfill our responsibility as a link in East Asia, and on the other hand, we must strengthen our national foundation to become a strong member of East Asia.

### Chairman Wang Issues Speech Encouraging Citizens to Cooperate in Building Greater East Asia with a Spirit of Hard Work and Endurance

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Today, the 8th, is the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. Chairman Wang of the National Government issued a special speech, pointing out the bright future of East Asia and encouraging the entire nation to cooperate in completing the war and building East Asia with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. At the same time, he strongly denounced the Chongqing side for willingly accepting the instructions of Britain and the United States and for being a rebel against East Asia. He called on the entire nation to rise up and drive them out. The text is respectfully recorded below:

Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has exerted its national strength to crush the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia. The recent Greater East Asia Declaration further demonstrates the bright future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I respectfully offer my greatest respect to the governments of our allies and to the officers and soldiers on the front lines and the people in the rear who have worked hard to achieve unprecedented feats. At the same time, I constantly encourage the entire nation to strive for the completion of the goals of the Greater East Asia War and the full realization of the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere with a spirit of hard work, endurance, courage, and diligence. People in Chongqing showed a tendency toward peace in August and September, but a few villains, wielding power, suppressed public opinion and colluded with Britain and the United States to act perversely. Recently, Luo, Qiu, and Chiang met in Cairo, spreading rumors, saying that they must fight until Japan surrenders unconditionally and that Japan must be reduced to a third-rate country. Regardless of the fact that Britain and the United States have suffered repeated defeats in the Greater East Asia War over the past two years, and that the U.S. Navy has recently suffered heavy damage and its embarrassment is fully exposed, their boastful words are merely a laughingstock. The Chongqing side's blind following and adherence means that they have completely abandoned their original goal of resisting Japan and are willing to be directed by Britain and the United States to suppress their East Asian compatriots. This is truly extremely heinous. If they are allowed to act cunningly, it will inevitably lead to half of China falling into an abyss with no bottom. I hope that all compatriots across the country will rise up together and drive out these rebels who are biting back against East Asia, removing the stain from China and adding brightness to East Asia. I deeply feel that my mission is of great importance in the current situation. I can only work tirelessly day and night to seek progress and look forward to the early arrival of the final victory of Greater East Asia with utmost sincerity.

### Bose States in Syonan that He is Determined to Fight for India's Independence and is Confident that Final Victory Will Belong to Japan

Syonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Chairman Chandra Bose of the Provisional Government of Free India issued a speech on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, with the main points as follows: All revolutionaries aim for success. The simultaneous outbreak of war in Europe and Asia is what I have hoped for for twenty years. As far as the European war is concerned, its impact on humanity has already been experienced in the previous war. Before the outbreak of this Greater East Asia War, I closely watched Japan's diplomacy, and when the European war broke out, I also paid attention to its impact on East Asia. At the same time, I considered the development of Japanese-Soviet and Japanese-American relations, but after Japanese Foreign Minister Matsuoka visited the Soviet Union and concluded the Japanese-Soviet Agreement, only Japanese-American relations remained. However, when Ambassador Kurusu went to the United States, I became even more concerned. At that time, authoritative German figures, based on various information, determined that the United States would definitely be defeated in the war, and I was confident that victory would belong to Japan. I also estimated that Britain's war power was very low, because Britain relied solely on the United States, so I firmly believed that Britain and the United States were by no means Japan's opponents. When I had this thought, the Greater East Asia War broke out. Since then, the Japanese army has won consecutive victories and achieved amazing results, which fully proves the correctness of my observations. I formally started the independence movement after the fall of Singapore. My subordinates had repeatedly advised me to promote the independence movement before, but I believed that the independence movement could only be started after the organization was formed, and I was confident that this opportunity would come. When I heard that the Japanese army had captured Singapore, my joy was beyond words. Based on the position of ordinary Indians, I commented on the significance of this war and was convinced that India's independence was an easy task. Asians have broken the so-called first-class countries of Britain and the United States. The current war situation in India has actually reached the stage of attacking India. Now I am determined to continue to fight until I regain our motherland of India.

### Manchukuo Premier Zhang's Speech Summary: Strive to Increase Production and Strengthen National Defense

Shinkyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, Manchukuo Prime Minister Zhang issued a special speech to encourage the people, with the main points as follows: It has been two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. In the past year, Britain and the United States, disregarding the enormous sacrifices since the beginning of the war, have made persistent counterattacks in various aspects, but their attempts have been completely shattered as soon as they came into contact with the righteous army of Japan. The invincibility of the Japanese army is truly amazing. In particular, in the several fierce battles in the South Seas, the Japanese army has reaped unprecedented historical results. With the progress of the war, the great work of building Greater East Asia has also been steadily advancing. At the beginning of the year, the Republic of China reluctantly joined the war, and then Burma and the Philippines also gained independence one after another. The Provisional Government of Free India has also established its foundation. Last month, representatives of various countries of Greater East Asia gathered in Tokyo to hold the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. This declaration announced to the world the determination of all countries and nations of Greater East Asia to cooperate and assist each other, to defeat Britain and the United States, and to build a new order. Therefore, it can be called a great charter that will never be erased. As a result, the unity of Greater East Asia has become more and more solid, and the victory of the Greater East Asia War is even clearer than watching a fire. Under this situation, in order to complete the important responsibility of defending the northern border and increasing combat power, our Manchukuo should devote all its efforts to increase the production of food and materials and strengthen national defense.

### Ogawa Kyoshiro Appointed as Supreme Advisor to Burma

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – The Japanese government has accepted the request of the Burmese government and decided to dispatch Member of Parliament Ogawa Kyoshiro as the Supreme Advisor to the Burmese government. Mr. Ogawa will go to Burma in the coming days to assume his new post.

### The True Meaning of the Greater East Asia War: To Complete the Unity of East Asia. General Hata Issues Statement

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Hata, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, issued a special statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, stating that it has been two years since the imperial rescript declaring war against Britain and the United States was issued. Aided by imperial authority and the loyalty, bravery, and skillful fighting of Japanese soldiers, we have secured an unshakable posture and a guaranteed-victory war situation in a vast battlefield unprecedented in Japanese history, and we welcome the arrival of the third year of this war. During this period, the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China has constantly taken the initiative, thwarting the attempts of the Chongqing army and the American air force stationed in Chongqing anytime and anywhere. Japan's true intention is to ensure the stability of East Asia through the Greater East Asia War, in order to ensure lasting peace in East Asia. This true intention has become increasingly clear. Moreover, Japan's unwavering national policy towards China is also increasingly presented to the Chinese people through facts. Among them, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty currently concluded has completely overturned the Chongqing side's so-called resistance against Japan. However, the Chongqing side, at this major turning point that determines the destiny of the East Asian nations, still relies on the power of Britain and the United States and has not realized the error of resisting Japan. It is truly sad for the future of the one billion people of East Asia. Moreover, Britain and the United States, who are instigating the Chongqing side to attempt to dominate East Asia, will launch increasingly persistent counterattacks in the future. After suffering repeated defeats, they are urgently seeking to strengthen their air force in China in an attempt to reverse the decline. This strategy must not be taken lightly. However, Japan has established a solid posture in both political and military strategies and will thoroughly destroy all reactionary forces on the path to completing the Greater East Asia War. The true meaning of the Greater East Asia War lies in the normal resolution of Sino-Japanese relations and the fair support and cooperation of the people of both countries, in order to complete the common unity of the East Asian nations. The Japanese Expeditionary Force in China directly undertakes this major situation on the Chinese battlefield, so it feels that its responsibility has become increasingly heavy. On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the officers and soldiers of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, respectfully upholding the imperial rescript and remembering the sincere and enthusiastic attitude of the people in the rear, and in light of the glorious history and tradition of the expeditionary force, are determined to lead the entire army with an ironclad unity, in order to thoroughly realize the nation's highest policy, and will never rest until the goal is achieved.

### Javanese Residents Should Cooperate in the Holy War

Jakarta, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – Speaker Sukarno of the Central Council of Java convened all members at the Central Assembly Hall at 2:00 PM on the 5th to hold a report meeting on his visit to Japan. He delivered a speech reporting on the process of achieving the purpose of his visit to Japan and explaining the spirit of unity of the Japanese people. He also stated that Japan regards the Greater East Asia War as a holy war, because the destiny of Greater East Asia is tied to Japan's final victory. Therefore, the residents of Java should strive to contribute to the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in order to create the destiny of the future.

### The Comprehensive Power of the East Asian Nations Will Crush the Remaining Forces of Britain and the United States: A Statement from the Japanese Military Authorities in South China

Guangzhou, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Southern China Expeditionary Force authorities recently issued a statement on the current trends of the Chongqing side. The gist of the statement is as follows: It has been two years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Chongqing side is still shouting about resistance against Japan, but in reality, the Chongqing side does not have the ability to resist Japan as it claims. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has implemented a new policy towards China, which has gradually caused the Chongqing side to lose its purpose of resisting Japan. Take the Chongqing side's air force, for example, it is almost invisible, and recently it has been completely under the command of the U.S. Air Force. Other factors, such as the gradual loss of the domestic situation, continue to be factors that cause the Chongqing side to lose the will to resist Japan. Modern warfare is a war of attrition. On the one hand, resources must be developed and production increased. On the other hand, a sufficiently trained workforce is required. The Chongqing side is almost completely unprepared for this. The so-called development of the Northwest is only propaganda and has no results. The Chongqing side lacks coal and iron, so it has no way to maintain its combat power except to seek aid from Britain and the United States. Even today, some of the Chongqing side's important materials have been supplied to Britain and the United States as the price of aid. From the perspective of the Chongqing side's manpower, it seems to be extremely abundant, but the manpower required in modern warfare is different from ordinary times. The Chongqing army lacks training, has no will to fight, and its manpower can be said to be very weak. Under this situation, if the Chongqing side continues to resist Japan, it will only cause the Chongqing people to collapse. In contrast, since the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, the Japanese army has gradually expanded the peaceful areas in various parts of China, uniting with the people in various places and striving to build. In South China, Japanese and Chinese military officers and civilians have also united as one, striving to increase food production in the old fertile Pearl River Delta area, and actively strengthening and cultivating existing industries. Recently, land communication with Hong Kong has been completed, and economic construction in South China has seen rapid development. Furthermore, Guangzhou will soon begin transportation with various parts of the South. Now all the nations of Greater East Asia are united as one, working together to complete the Greater East Asia War. We believe that Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of China, must also be smiling in his grave. China and Japan have been cooperating in military, economic, and cultural aspects to build Greater East Asia. This status quo is difficult for the Chongqing side to deny, but they have ignored it and are willing to be a running dog of Britain and the United States, and continue to resist Japan by making this army a slave army of Britain and the United States. This can be said to be an act of betrayal against Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The Chongqing side will continue to resist Japan in the future, but it will be difficult to prevent the construction of Greater East Asia. We will show the Chongqing side a fact in the near future, that is, we will complete the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the future. The comprehensive power of the East Asian nations will crush Britain and the United States.

### Integrated Battle Results of the Japanese Fleet in China over the Past Year

Central News Agency – The press department of the Japanese Fleet in China announced at 4:00 PM on the 7th the integrated battle results of the fleet in China over the past year as follows: The Japanese Fleet in China has closely cooperated with the Japanese Army units in China to take on the task of attacking the Chongqing army and the enemy forces in China. At the same time, it has blockaded the Chinese coast and swept away enemy submarines, and has made every effort to protect the safety of maritime transport. Since the enhancement of relations between China and Japan, it has also cooperated in promoting various policies such as the return of concessions, the abolition of extraterritoriality, and the handling of enemy property in order to complete its mission. In addition, in order to complete the Greater East Asia War, it has cooperated with the Greater East Asia Ministry and various army agencies to develop and transport mainland resources, and has made outstanding contributions to the enhancement of combat power. Later, due to the rebellion of the Battoryo regime and changes in the international situation, as well as the independence of Burma and the Republic of the Philippines, the reform of the Sino-Japanese alliance, and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, cooperation among the countries of Greater East Asia has become closer. Therefore, appropriate countermeasures have been implemented one after another to strengthen the unity of the nations of Greater East Asia. The main operations in the past year include the cooperation of the troops stationed in North China with the army to sweep away enemy bandits in the Shandong Peninsula from mid-November to early December last year and from mid- to late February this year. In late January this year, the troops in South China peacefully advanced into Guangzhou Bay. In addition, the Hainan Island troops have launched sweeping campaigns many times since November last year, and have achieved great results. The Yangtze River troops have severely blockaded the guerrilla operations of the Chongqing side in various coastal areas. From late March to late May this year, they implemented the opening of the Yichang waterway in order to ensure the waterway. On the one hand, they cooperated with the air force to destroy the counterattacks of the Chongqing and American air forces. The integrated battle results over the past year are as follows:

### Bombing of Calcutta: Continued Clarification of Battle Results

The battle results were announced by the Japanese Imperial General Headquarters on the 6th. However, according to what was later clarified, in addition to what was announced by the Imperial General Headquarters, Japanese aircraft shot down 7 enemy fighters (4 of which are unconfirmed), destroyed 1 large enemy transport ship (fire started), and destroyed 6 port facilities and warehouse groups (fire started).

### General Terauchi Issues Statement

Syonan, 7th (Central News Agency dispatch) – General Terauchi, Supreme Commander of the Japanese Southern Expeditionary Army, issued the following statement on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War: Since the war began, the morale of my Southern Army has been increasing day by day. Remembering the spirit of the people in the motherland working hard for victory with one heart and one mind, I feel infinitely grateful. In terms of military and administrative affairs, thanks to the efforts of related personnel, the bravery of the soldiers in the front lines, and the cooperation of the local people, not only has security been ensured, but also development and construction have been on the right track. At present, the total war posture in the Southern Region has gradually been achieved. However, the purpose of this Greater East Asia War is to crush the exploitation of East Asia by Britain and the United States. In other words, it is to create a new world. Now, Britain and the United States rely on their enormous material war power. Although personnel and materials are consumed greatly, they are still constantly launching persistent counterattacks. The Japanese army is engaged in fierce battles with them everywhere, and the fighting will become more intense in the future. However, the enemy is still obstinate and does not know how to repent. The material strength of Britain and the United States should not be underestimated, and their spiritual strength should not be underestimated either. However, looking back at our country, the manpower and material resources have increased since the beginning of the war, and the determination to complete the war has become more firm. In addition, the Greater East Asia War is a holy war based on morality, so no matter how stubborn Britain and the United States are, they will eventually surrender. This is my war objective. The fact that the belief in the certain victory of subduing Britain and the United States lies in this.

### Imperial Rescript to Admiral Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet

I am deeply pleased. As the war situation becomes more complex, I deeply expect you to redouble your efforts to live up to my expectations.

### Thailand's Prime Minister Issues Statement Wishing to Cooperate in Building a Co-Prosperity Sphere

Bangkok, 6th (Central News Agency) – Thai Prime Minister Phibun, to commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, issued the following statement: The expansion of the spheres of influence by Britain and the United States in Greater East Asia in the past was entirely for their own selfish interests. Consequently, the countries of Greater East Asia either lost their independence and sovereignty, or their independence and sovereignty were restricted due to extraterritorial rights and unequal treaties. Japan was the first country in the Greater East Asia region to abolish extraterritorial rights. Subsequently, other countries also followed Japan's example, determined to abolish extraterritorial rights. Now, Japan has completely driven out the violence of Britain and the United States and, in order to restore the independence and sovereignty of the countries of Greater East Asia and build a co-prosperity sphere based on mutual respect for independence, has gone to war with Britain and the United States. Thailand fully understands the true intentions of Japan's war and firmly believes that building a new order in Greater East Asia is the only way to prosper East Asia and a necessary condition for achieving lasting world peace. Therefore, it immediately formed an alliance with Japan, sharing life and death. Since then, it has fully cooperated with Japan in military, political, and economic aspects. The Thai people express their utmost joy and congratulations for the great victories Japan has achieved in the past two years and are confident that after Japan has achieved these glorious victories, the countries of Greater East Asia have laid the foundation for final victory. The outline of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has already been completed. What I hope for is that all countries in Greater East Asia will cooperate with each other and fight with an indomitable spirit, so that the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can be further glorified.

### Japan Actively Increases Ship Production to Cope with Long-Term War: Chairman Su Ying Discusses Shipbuilding Industry

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Greater East Asia War is about to enter its third year, and the war situation is becoming increasingly fierce. Air warfare and naval warfare are the characteristics of this war. Therefore, the importance of airplanes and ships has also increased accordingly. At the same time, the missions undertaken by the aircraft industry, shipbuilding industry, and shipping industry are becoming increasingly important. Mr. Su Ying Xiaosaburo, Chairman of the Japan New Shipbuilding Control Association, discussed the situation of the shipbuilding industry in Japan as follows: Japan's wartime production has gradually emerged from the preparation period and will begin to increase sharply from the third year of the war. So-called wartime production requires a complete plan. The shipbuilding industry started the earliest. After the Sino-Japanese Incident, it began "building standard ships." The preparation for planned shipbuilding is now ready. The government has also resolutely implemented the policies of ship and maritime national control. Everything has been on track for the past three or four years, and excellent results will be achieved in the coming year. The shipbuilding plan was implemented earlier than other industrial sectors because of the unified regulations and administrative centralization of standard ships. This method will also be implemented in other departments, and the shipbuilding industry has achieved great results as a result. Furthermore, I believe that the production of the entire heavy industry will increase sharply from the coming year. Modern warfare is a total war, and the production war has been prepared since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War. After two years of preparation, everything is ready, so it will enter a full-scale stage from the third year. All kinds of materials can have planned production. If this preparation work is completed, production can be increased sharply, and there is no need to be surprised even if the war continues for fifty or a hundred years.

### Finnish President's Speech Reiterates Determination to Resist War: Independence and Freedom of Small Countries Should Be Respected

Helsinki, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to the Huitong News Agency, Finnish President Ryti stated in his speech on the 26th anniversary of Finland's independence: In a few days, the elapsed time of this war will be equal to that of the last war. At that time, most of the major belligerents in Europe were exhausted, and the result was predictable. Although the situation today is different from the previous one, many belligerents have already collapsed or been occupied, but the main belligerents are still as strong as ever, and their strength has increased even more than before. Therefore, it is still difficult to predict the end of this war, and of course, there are many changes in the future of the war, so the international situation in Europe is still difficult to stabilize.

Eliminating Small Countries is a Crime Against Humanity

The current development seems to have a significant impact on the status of small countries, and their neutral status has not always been respected. Although the Atlantic Charter and other documents recognize the right of small countries to exist, the general opinion seems to be not to recognize the existence of small countries, which is indeed extremely wrong. Not only should small countries not be eliminated, but large countries should respect their independence. Only independent countries can contribute to the world's culture. The small countries in the Baltic Sea, which gained independence in extremely difficult circumstances, can serve as the basis for future development, and small countries all uphold peace and international organizations, making greater contributions to mankind than any military power. Therefore, reducing small countries is a crime against all mankind, and a peace that unilaterally and arbitrarily aims to eliminate small countries will be difficult to sustain, because countries that have lost their independence will inevitably think of ways to restore it.

Compromising Will Not Avoid Disaster

This war has become a total war, and its outcome will inevitably lead to hatred between countries, and the desire for revenge will inevitably affect the post-war period. Before this war, Finland maintained friendly relations with all countries and strictly abided by international treaties, intending not to be involved in the war. Finland knew that its relationship with the Soviet Union must be based on trust and friendship, so it tried its best to reconcile with it, but the result was still inevitable disaster. It is clearly difficult to believe that Leningrad was threatened by Finland. Even if it wanted to protect Leningrad, there was no need to launch a bloody war to annex Karelia. For four years, Finland has been forced to conduct a defensive war, always with the goal of protecting Finland's life and independence. We concentrate our efforts on defending our territory, but heaven does not seem to bless us.

Clear Distinctions Between Gratitude and Hatred, Will Never Surrender

Since 1940, the total harvest of Finland's flax, potatoes, etc., has decreased by 20% to 30% compared to before the outbreak of the war. The lack of grains is often supplemented by assistance from Germany and Denmark. Finland remembers the assistance of friendly countries. We have experienced various difficulties and dangers. Currently, the enemy is demanding Finland's unconditional surrender. The precedent of unconditional surrender is not enough to entice Finland. I do not believe that Finland's loyal citizens see unconditional surrender to the Soviet Union as possible. After Finland ceded Karelia to the Soviet Union, 470,000 people from Karelia left their homeland, unwilling to be ruled by the Soviet Union. There is no doubt about the people's allegiance. The views of the Finnish people must be the same as those of the Karelian people. Finns are known for their endurance in the sports world and have also demonstrated their endurance in international wars. The Finnish army firmly believes that justice will prevail and does not hesitate to sacrifice for the country. We all recognize the goal of fighting. Our struggle shows the thousands of cities of small countries for freedom and independence.

### German Army Sneaks into Gibraltar Harbor from the Mediterranean Seabed to Attack Ships: American Government and Public Express Great Surprise

Argentina Capital, 7th (Central News Agency) – According to a Chicago dispatch: A British merchant ship owner, Machina, publicly stated in Chicago on the 4th, "Currently, German naval soldiers have used torpedoes to sneak into Gibraltar harbor from the seabed to attack ships." The American government and public were greatly surprised by this. According to Machina, ships in Gibraltar harbor had repeatedly sunk for no apparent reason. The British naval authorities in the area actively sought the cause, but ultimately obtained no results. Nets were set up in Gibraltar harbor to prevent submarines from entering, but incidents of ships exploding and sinking continued to occur frequently. One night, a sailor was repairing the bottom of a ship when he suddenly noticed bubbles rising from the seabed. He immediately ordered a diver to go underwater to investigate. The diver returned with a German in one hand and a torpedo in the other. Only then was it known that German naval soldiers were using torpedoes to sneak to the bottom of the ship and attach timed explosive devices, causing ships to sink for no apparent reason from time to time.

### Center of Eastern Front War Shifts to the Dnieper River Bend: Soviet Winter Warfare Special Forces Still Feel Insufficient

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: In the past 24 hours, the Soviet offensive west of Smolensk has stalled, and the Great Dnieper River bend has become the center of the Eastern Front war. There are three areas of Soviet offensive: the Dnepropetrovsk region, north of Kryvyi Rih, and south of Kremenchug, with the offensive in the third area being the most fierce. A German spokesman said yesterday that the Eastern Front war is the same as when the Soviet army began its offensive on July 5. The Soviets concentrated war equipment and troops to attack at two or three points, initially breaking through the German defense line, but once the German reserves arrived from the rear, they blocked the gap in the line and counterattacked to regain a small amount of land. The former Battle of Smolensk has ended, and the German Fourth Army resisted heroically without the slightest progress from the Soviet army. This offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend was not unexpected by the German side, but it is currently difficult to predict the outcome.

Berlin, 7th (Central News Agency) – Huitong News Agency reports: Apart from the major Soviet offensive in the Great Dnieper River bend and the new war in Crimea, the rest of the Eastern Front war is not very important this week. Enemy reports believe that this silence is related to the Soviet troop redeployment. This redeployment should not be underestimated, nor should it be overestimated. It should be remembered that in the past two winters, most of the enemy troops were specially trained troops with special equipment. These winter warfare troops were mainly ski teams, sled teams, and winter warfare tank teams. In addition, there were also special cavalry teams, whose horses were mostly hardy Siberian warhorses. The Soviet side may have formed one or two winter warfare special forces from these units, but their strength should not exceed twelve divisions. Although the Soviet authorities are trying their best to transfer manpower, no matter what, their winter warfare special forces are definitely not enough to take over the entire front line or even most of the front line. Therefore, the Soviet authorities must redeploy miscellaneous troops to make up the so-called winter warfare troops. Now that winter has arrived, both the German and Soviet sides have prepared for winter equipment and transportation, but the German side's preparations started earlier and should be more complete.

### Capital's Youth Hold Dawn Assembly

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) – The Capital Youth General Uprising Movement Dawn Mobilization Assembly will be solemnly held at 10:00 AM on the 8th in front of the Sun Yat-sen statue at Xinjiekou to commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War.

### The Collapse of the Enemy's General Counteroffensive: Talk by Colonel Kurihara, Head of the Naval Press Section, and Colonel Matsumura, Head of the Army Press Section, of the Japanese General Headquarters

Differences Between Land Warfare Past and Present, Colonel Kurihara

I hear that Colonel Matsumura is quite knowledgeable about war history. Could you tell me what the distinctive differences are between land warfare in the First European War and this war?

Colonel Matsumura: In this war, there are very few new weapons with completely different concepts. It is impossible to know whether various weapons will appear in the future, but at present, most of them are weapons that already existed in the previous war and have now made great progress. Take airplanes as an example. In the previous war, the speed was about 200 kilometers per hour, but today it is 600 kilometers to 700 kilometers per hour, and the number is also very large. As for the speed of tanks, it used to be 7 or 8 kilometers per hour, but today it is 50 kilometers to 60 kilometers. As for weight, there are now large tanks weighing 50 or 60 tons. So I think the distinctive feature of this war is that the concept has changed, not to mention that the former East Asia has made extraordinary progress.

Furthermore, in the previous war, infantry was the main force, and artillery, engineers, and cavalry were secondary. This time, especially in the German-Soviet war, it is a battle of tank units. In addition, airplanes also occupy an important position. In the early days of this war, the term "blitzkrieg" was very popular, which is nothing more than saying that it means speed. In the past, infantry advanced at a pace of 75 centimeters, but today, tanks, which generally travel at tens of kilometers per hour, are the main force of the war, supported by wireless radio and superior aircraft.

In the early days of this European war, Germany's attacks on France and Poland were all successful, thanks to speed. The lack of adequate defense methods against these agile weapons, I think, was the biggest reason for the failure of France and Poland. As for today's German-Soviet war, because it is a tank-versus-tank battle, the main body of the field battle can be said to be the encounter battle between tanks and tanks.

Also, regarding the methods of war, for example, in the past, there was the Battle of Annihilation, such as the Battle of Tannenberg and the Battle of Masuria, etc., but the scale is insignificant compared to today's. In the past, each infantry unit often gradually encircled the enemy's flanks or forced the enemy into swampy areas and annihilated them. However, at present, tanks are used to break through the enemy's front line, break through into a "wedge" shape, and then expand the two sides of the wedge to encircle the enemy. After the Polish war, I asked a German military attaché, "Where is the Tannenberg of the past?" He replied, "The entire Polish war is Tannenberg." In short, the encircled troops are often very numerous, which must also be a major feature of this war.

Furthermore, speaking of the methods of war, it was mostly trench warfare in the past, but since the Maginot Line was destroyed, there has not been much trench warfare. Of course, defensive methods such as anti-tank obstacles and anti-tank trenches have also improved, but the defenders ultimately feel inferior to the attacking equipment such as large tanks and paratrooper units. In many cases, the German-Soviet war is called the model of land warfare. The mechanical units, with tanks as the main force, encounter battles, and the scene of the large air force scattering like sparks above them, is indeed a spectacle of land warfare. So, what about naval warfare?

Naval Night Battles Are Different Now Than in the Past, Colonel Kurihara

So-called naval warfare is often a struggle for so-called sea control. The main actor in the struggle for sea control is the battleship. Therefore, until now, when talking about naval power, battleships have always been the standard. It is claimed that they have tens of thousands of tons of battleships, hundreds of thousands of tons. But in today's war, airplanes also exert extraordinary power, which must be the case in land battles as well. In naval battles, airplanes are also at the core. In this case, shouldn't the word "sea control" be revised? I think it should be changed to "naval battle under air control."

Those who seize air control often have 90% certainty of victory. I think this is very different from the previous war.

In addition, there is also a very significant change in naval warfare, which is that a new weapon called a radio wave detector has now appeared. This is a very revolutionary change, especially for the Japanese navy, which is accustomed to night battles, and has high expectations for it. Due to the emergence of radio wave detectors, the methods of night battles have also changed greatly. I think this is also a point of difference from the previous war.

Only submarines are still no different from the First European War. Currently, submarines are still very difficult to deal with. For countries like Japan, whether from an operational or a production war perspective, they are very dependent on ships, so submarines are especially annoying.

The war has now lasted for two years and is gradually entering the decisive stage, so I think we should make the people clearly aware of the current situation at this time, and everyone should exert their final strength. Therefore, what has been the situation up to now? What is the current situation? The people must be made to understand. Regarding the situation up to now, how can we make it easy for the people to understand?

War for Self-Preservation and Self-Defense, Colonel Matsumura

When Japan rose up for self-preservation and self-defense two years ago, the United States and Britain thought that Japan was easy to deal with. Of course, Japan is an island nation in the East Sea, lacking both oil and rubber, and simply has no resources to speak of. War materials are indeed lacking, but once it rose up in a corner of East Asia, there was immediately the great victory at Pearl Harbor, the landing in Malaya, and the occupation of Malaya, Java, and Burma, driving the United States and Britain out of Greater East Asia and attacking New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Southwest Pacific. As a result, Japan obtained oil, rubber, and tin from the south, and obtained various resources. In less than half a year after the start of the war, we established a self-sufficiency plan for war materials.

Moreover, the defense circle was pushed out 4,000 to 5,000 kilometers from the Japanese mainland. India and Australia were within reach, completing a sure-to-win and invincible situation. This is the first stage of the war.

The second stage of the war is the American counteroffensive. Since being defeated by Japan at the beginning of the war, they have done their best to greatly expand their airplanes and ships. According to Marshall, millions of people have been mobilized, and 80% of the students have become pilots, desperately strengthening their strength. Since last summer, they have been shouting for a counteroffensive, from the southern Solomon Islands to the central Solomon Islands. Since the beginning of last month, they have counterattacked Bougainville in the northern Solomon Islands, and a few days ago, they counterattacked the Gilbert Islands. Recently, the navy has established great achievements in Bougainville and the Gilbert Islands. The people's depressed mood has suddenly been relieved, and we are extremely grateful. The third stage is to intercept the enemy's counteroffensive, push it back, and further severely crush the enemy. Colonel Kurihara, now please talk about the people's feelings.

Colonel Kurihara

We hope that the people will think about this kind of thing. In short, as you just said, the first stage was that Japan acquired the areas necessary for self-preservation. Therefore, the people have a feeling that since the war for self-preservation has been successful, the war can be won just by doing it casually. In reality, even if it is not so easily optimistic, don't you think that the war has basically completed 80% or 90% of it? This is worrying. Such thinking is unacceptable. We should remember that this is just establishing a self-sufficient economic plan that can ensure self-preservation. Fortunately, this self-sufficient economic zone has been completed, so the war can continue. From this, we can engage in the second stage of the war. This self-sufficient economic zone is the minimum limit for Japan. It is the good situation you just said of establishing an invincible situation.

However, the United States and Britain know that if this continues, Japan's strength will increase with time, so they want to push it back no matter what, and therefore there is the recent counteroffensive. Japan's war aim is entirely for self-preservation and self-defense, so the first stage is self-preservation, and the war from now on is a war for self-defense. Because they want to counterattack, we must implement the so-called war of self-defense everywhere and intercept them. This is what we hope to appeal to the people.

The Mentality the People Should Have, Colonel Matsumura

After the end of the first stage, the war is proceeding step by step. Although there are many amazing war results, the United States and Britain are world powers, and of course they cannot be easily resolved in a short time. As for today's counteroffensive, Japan of course expected it long ago and it is not surprising.

Colonel Kurihara

I also think so. The previous wars and this war are completely different. In the past wars, the army and navy seemed to be players, and the people were the spectators who lined up the players. When they saw that the players they were supporting won, they were wildly happy, and if they were defeated, they would be dejected. However, the essence of modern warfare is definitely not like this. I hope the people will think about this point.

Because there have been no major victories for a long time, the people's morale is being questioned. Fortunately, recently there have been great victories in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and the Gilbert Islands. However, at this time, we should be absolutely careful not to have that kind of frivolous and optimistic atmosphere when we see the "sumo" wrestler we are supporting taking the upper hand.

### Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War Celebrated Enthusiastically by the Municipal Government; Grand Ceremony Held at 10:00 AM Today

Central News Agency: Today marks the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War. The Municipal Government, recognizing the historical significance of this major anniversary, specifically held a grand celebratory ceremony at 10:00 AM in the Municipal Government Auditorium. All personnel at the section chief level and above from affiliated agencies attended. Mayor Chen Gongbo presided over the ceremony.

### Reporting Department Chief of the Japanese Fleet Issues Important Statement, Declaring Determination to Fight to the End

Central News Agency: It has been three years since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. During this period, thanks to the valiant efforts of the Allied land, sea, and air forces, repeatedly inflicting heavy damage on the enemy, the foundation for inevitable victory has been laid. The Reporting Department Chief of the Japanese Fleet stationed in China issued a statement on the 7th, declaring the determination to fight to the end, and predicting that the war situation would become even more intense. He expressed hope that the people in the rear would each fulfill their assigned combat responsibilities consistently from beginning to end. The content of his statement is recorded as follows:

Soldiers Must Kill Every Enemy They See

The second anniversary of the Holy War has arrived. Looking back at the progress of the war in the Pacific since the enemy's counteroffensive began last autumn, and the changes in the world situation, and considering the current war situation, we are filled with profound emotions. The enemy attempted to break through our lines from the Solomon Islands and sever the connection between the Southern Co-Prosperity Sphere and our homeland, thus initiating fierce fighting in the Solomon Islands. Since late October, battles have been fought six times in the Bougainville Island area. Thanks to the fierce fighting of our soldiers who are determined to kill every enemy they see, a total of 94 enemy ships have been sunk or destroyed, and 592 enemy aircraft have been shot down, causing the US Navy authorities to admit the severity of their losses. To reverse their decline, the enemy plotted an offensive in the Gilbert Islands. As of now, they have sunk or destroyed 26 of their ships and shot down 145 aircraft. Out of desperation, the enemy is already showing signs of self-destruction, concentrating a large number of ships and aircraft, and sacrificing great lives, in an attempt to launch a final desperate attack in that area. Therefore, it is predicted that the battles in that area will become increasingly fierce after the second round.

Inevitable Victory Increasingly Consolidated

In addition to this major offensive, the enemy, in an attempt to respond and divert attention, has also launched so-called Burmese counteroffensives and air raids on mainland China, as well as movements in the northern areas and submarine attacks on commercial shipping. On the one hand, they are also using their self-proclaimed successful propaganda and ideological warfare, conducting anti-Axis talks, and using heavy bombs, and fabricating various favorable war situations, in an attempt to boost their power and influence. Judging from the enemy's leaders' sudden and frequent trips to various places, we can see the urgency of their situation. And judging from the enemy's counteroffensives' disregard for strategic tactics, we can see the depth of their anxiety. Conversely, regardless of the local war situation, our side's momentum of inevitable victory is only becoming stronger day by day. The closer the enemy gets to our strategic center, the greater their losses will be. We will never stop until we achieve final victory. The epoch-making increase in productivity, the strengthening of transportation capacity, the rapid expansion of combat power on both the personnel and material fronts, and the achievements of promoting independent ideological warfare offensives are all combat responsibilities that our people in the rear should bear. All of our lives and actions, no matter where we are, contain fierce battles. This battle is the most intense battle in the history of the world, a struggle for the justice of humanity, a battle of material strength and spiritual strength, a battle of individualism and dedication to the country. The blood of our ancestors has already merged with our blood, and the spirits of the war dead protect our future. We must resolutely annihilate the enemy and never give up.

### Speech by Japanese Naval Attaché

On the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, thanks to the majestic power of the Emperor and the glorious military might of the Imperial Army, which has covered the Greater East Asia and repeatedly crushed the fierce counteroffensives of Britain and the United States, the decisive unity of the Greater East Asian nations is also becoming increasingly solid, and the great steps of grand construction are steadily advancing. This is truly cause for celebration.

The fleet in China, with close cooperation from the elite units of the army, has also established combat locations and is working on two fronts, bearing the great responsibility of the Greater East Asia War. All officers and soldiers are working day and night, striving to fulfill their mission. After the establishment of the alliance treaty, Japanese-Chinese cooperation is expected to increase, moving towards the complete realization of shared life and death. We are confident that in the future, we will overcome any difficulties and achieve the core of this holy war for national liberation, the labor and mission of [木?].

However, even though the enemy has suffered several miserable defeats, it is easy to deduce that they will still fight fiercely in resistance. It is also expected that they will use [檀?] and other means to confuse the current difficult situation and unleash their ideological sharpness. As we realize that the third year of the war is the year of true decisive battle, our determination to work diligently in our respective positions is self-evident and needs no further elaboration.

Today, at this moment, is the time for us to display the great achievements of our ancestors, repay the country with our lives, and support the flourishing imperial destiny. All our lives, all our actions, should be guided by this sincerity.

We also hope that the local officials and people will be more diligent and strive together to fulfill this holy war.

### 100,000 Bundles of Rice Have Been Shipped to Shanghai and Can Be Distributed as Household Rice

Since its establishment, the Rice Control Committee has been actively expanding its business in the past month. It has been actively procuring rice, and large quantities of rice have been collected from various regions. However, due to some transportation inconveniences, the household rice in this city has been slightly delayed. After making every effort to adjust, 100,000 bundles of civilian food rice have recently been transported. It was approved by the entire Chinese-Japanese committee at 3:00 PM on the 6th of this month that this rice will be used as household rice for distribution in this city. It is also heard that large quantities of rice are on the way to Shanghai, and it is expected that it will be distributed per capita before the 20th.

### The Ninth Phase of Household Sugar: Payment and Delivery

Central News Agency: It has been learned that the ninth phase of per capita sugar in this city has been allocated by the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office. Purchase certificates will be issued on December 8th and 9th. All retailers who sell per capita sugar must, within the aforementioned deadline, stamp the previously issued blank receipts, go to the office to fill in the amount, and then collect the purchase certificates. Payment must be made to the designated [轉行級?] and the goods must be delivered before the 10th of this month without delay. The date for special group users (formerly Class B retailers) to exchange purchase certificates will be notified separately.

### Registration of Coal Retailers Soon to Be Carried Out

Recently, due to transportation difficulties, the arrival and sales of various coal retail quantities have been difficult to balance, resulting in illegal price increases in sales. At the same time, the imbalance in the supply of coal balls has made it even more difficult for citizens to hire workers. However, the relevant authorities are paying close attention to the fuel supply situation. They have convened meetings with coal merchants several times and discussed appropriate solutions. According to the Shanghai News reporter's investigation in the coal industry, the competent authorities have now discussed solutions for the coal retail supply and will register industrial, commercial, and domestic users in preparation for allocation according to limits starting in January next year.

### The First Police Bureau Continues to Capture and Kill Stray Dogs

The First Police Bureau, in view of the rampant stray dogs, has launched a campaign to capture and kill stray dogs several times, but there are still many victims. To maintain the safety of pedestrians, it plans to cooperate with the military and police authorities to implement the capture and killing of stray dogs from the 10th to the 12th of this month, from 6:00 AM to 8:00 AM every day, within the jurisdiction of the Xihongkou Branch of the Bureau. All ownerless stray dogs and those without dog licenses will be captured and killed as stray dogs. Furthermore, licensed dogs without muzzles will also be captured and killed.

### Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth Deposit Certificates Changed to Accrue Interest from October 1st

Central News Agency: The National Commercial Control Association was ordered to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Regarding the issuance of fixed-term deposit certificates, the association originally submitted and obtained approval from the Executive Yuan to set the starting date as September 6th. However, due to procedural reasons on all sides, it was unable to handle it in time, and the Executive Yuan changed the starting date to October 1st. The Commercial Control Association has now been notified by telegram to comply with the record. After receiving the telegram, the association has complied with the order to notify all relevant parties to comply.

At the top center were the national flags of China, Japan, Manchuria, the Philippines, and India. The national flags of Thailand and Burma and the German flag were also hung high behind the seats, raised in the center. The venue was decorated in a solemn, parliamentary style. The chairman's seat was in the center, with seats for officials on the left and right, and seats for representatives from China, Japan, Manchuria, the Philippines, and India on both sides. General congratulatory seats were located on the side, and the press seats were located behind the seats. The arrangement was quite solemn.

The Shanghai China Film United Film Company sent personnel to the venue to take newsreel footage of the grand meeting.

Attending Representatives

The meeting was originally scheduled to be chaired by Mr. Hirota, Director of the Information Department of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, but Mr. Hirota was unable to attend due to official business. Mr. Funatsu Tatsujiro of the Koa Hokokai presided over the meeting. The attendees included Minister Izubuchi of the Reporting Department of the Army, Lieutenant Nakagawa, Minister Matsushima of the Fleet Reporting Department, Captain Tsugita, Secretary Manabe of the Embassy in Shanghai, and representatives of the five East Asian nations, including Liu Yangshan, [彬?] Su, Zhou Huarren, Yuan Fudeng, Cheng Zhiliang, Xu Liqiu, Xu Chao Yuan, Lang Yufei, Gu Benfan, Cao Jianjin, Zhu Ding, Li Bingqing, Jiang Wanchun [水?] Qian Jianwu, and others from China; Takeuti Fumin, Ashisaka Yoichi, Toda Yasuso, Kurimizu Toraji, [服?] Bumon Heito, and others from Japan; Consul General Yo Ko of Manchuria, Matsuba Hideo, Yu Qi, and others; Wei [?] Casino, Contrelas, Arobauqi, A.

Thus, this warm and grand Greater East Asia Ethnic Representatives Informal Discussion Meeting came to a successful conclusion. Everyone took a group photo after the meeting, which concluded at 6:30 PM.

Chairman's Speech

Chairman Funatsu Tatsujiro gave the opening remarks, which stated, in brief: "You all know very well the final ultimatum that the enemy America issued to Japan on November 26th two years ago. At that time, Japan was in an unbearable situation. If Japan had accepted it at the beginning, the situation today would have been supported by the United States. Therefore, the countries of East Asia would have been in an unbearable situation. Therefore, Japan was forced to launch the war on December 8th of that year. When the Greater East Asia War opened, fortunately, the Japanese Air Force was invincible, and wherever it went, it won great victories. Therefore, at the beginning of the war, it broke the entire power of Britain and the United States [?]. In today's East Asia, the power of Britain and the United States no longer exists. I believe you all know this from the newspapers. To regain their past losses, Britain and the United States have been racking their brains to plan a counteroffensive. Both the North and South Pacific are the goals of their plans. I personally hope that you will consider what the situation will be like if the enemy Britain and the United States succeed in their attempted counteroffensive and their evil forces re-enter the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. I hope you will use all your strength to launch a general offensive and defeat Britain and the United States so that they cannot invade. The ambition of Britain and the United States to plunder East Asia is always plotting to revive from the ashes. Therefore, we must have a firm belief and work hard. This war may not be short-term and may last five or ten years. The Japanese side, from top to bottom, has already resolved to defeat Britain and the United States and achieve final victory. Therefore, we are confident of winning. I hope that all one billion people in the entire East Asia will have a consistent determination. This war must achieve victory so that the East Asian nations can coexist and prosper. I also hope that those who have money will contribute money, and those who have strength will contribute strength. With one heart and one mind, we pray for the victory of the Greater East Asia [?] war."

Matsushima's Report

Fleet Reporting Department Chief Matsushima, a colonel, reported on the war situation, saying that on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army had achieved significant victories and crushed the enemy's fierce counteroffensives, completely thwarting the enemy's attempts. The center of the decisive battle is in the South Pacific. Since late October, six major naval battles have taken place before and after Bougainville Island, destroying 90 enemy warships and shooting down 500 enemy aircraft, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. Moreover, the enemy has launched several counteroffensives in the final Gilbert Islands and [金?] Island, and has again destroyed 30 of their ships and more than 100 aircraft. Therefore, in the enemy's fleet, its battleships, aircraft carriers, important ships, and 60,000 to 70,000 excellent soldiers have been lost in this counteroffensive, showing the enormous scale of its counteroffensive power, and the impact it has had is quite large. Afterwards, we moved the front line to the inner line for operations and destroyed them individually, causing the enemy to suffer heavy losses. As for the northern sea, the enemy army is preparing for an air counteroffensive, and is constantly planning and waiting for an opportunity. We have been strictly on guard. Fortunately, due to weather conditions, the enemy has not launched any counteroffensives. Whether in the southern or northern seas, the enemy's air force has only made some minor movements and has not achieved much. In Burma, no counteroffensive has been launched. Our land, sea, and air force vanguards attacked first, causing the enemy to [?]. In summary, we have established inevitable victory in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, and the enemy has no room to recover and is constantly being attacked by us. Therefore, the completion of the Greater East Asia War is expected to come soon. I hope that you will all unite as one, strengthen the determination of the people, work together, and complete the victory of the Greater East Asia. Therefore, the time for the liberation of the Asian nations has been established.

Izubuchi's Report

Army Reporting Department Chief Izubuchi reported on the war situation, saying that at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, Britain and the United States had been badly defeated. Seeing that a long-term war was just a drain, they changed their strategy and attempted a counteroffensive by staking their vast strength on a single throw. Therefore, this general counteroffensive against Japan was not only in the [甫?] sea, but also used Burma and the mainland of [渝?] to drive the [渝?] army to counterattack Japan, and to instigate the American air force in [渝?] to attack Japan's airspace. However, [渝?] voluntarily went against the trend, willingly became a traitor to the Greater East Asia, dreaming that Britain and the United States would win victory, and willingly allowed Britain and the United States to use the area as a false front. At the current stage of the war on the [渝?] mainland, their internal divisions are complex and divergent, while the actions of the Japanese army imply a clear resolve and confidence to arrive at a very rapid decisive battle. Since November 2nd, the Japanese army has been in the Xiangxi area of the upper reaches of the Yangtze River. After a month, it completely wiped out 100,000 of the [渝?] Central Army in each area, making it impossible to turn the situation around. On December 3rd, it completely occupied Changde in the 6th War Zone of [渝?]. Changde has always been valued by [渝?], and is the same center point as Changsha, and has always been a base for cultivating resistance. Therefore, in this operation, the [渝?] side suffered more than 10,000 casualties, while our soldiers suffered only 550 casualties. The large number of [渝?] casualties is enough to show the intensity of the resistance at that time. The movement of the American air force in [渝?] was preempted and the dream of their attempt to raid Japan was shattered. Moreover, it is also planning to seize control of [渝?]. Recently, a joint American-[渝?] air force was established. The American-[渝?] air force participated in the war on the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, and 14 aircraft were shot down. Therefore, the American-[渝?] air force has no effect in the war on the mainland. Looking back at the war results of the Japanese dispatched army in China in the past, the main battles totaled 39 times, engagements more than 22,000 times, troop deployment 3.3 million, and the enemy's war dead reached 210,000, and more than 170,000 were captured. To further describe the losses of the American air force in [渝?], 251 aircraft were shot down, and all but 8 of them belonged to the American air force in [渝?]. This is enough to show that the strength of the American air force in [渝?] is weak. In addition, on the Burmese front, [渝?] was impatient and planned to open up the road to [漢甸?] for supplies, and the United States also used the route to try to secure it, and to strengthen the strength of the American air force in [渝?] to plan a new route to attack Japan. The British side also planned to regain Burma and maintain India, not only using Burma's economy, etc., but also to oppress India. Although their goals are different, their movements are the same. On the other hand, in the Yunnan territory, the [渝?] army attempted to attack. Last month, the Japanese army attacked and surrounded and eliminated the [渝?] army on the west bank of the Nujiang River, while the British and Indian troops did not provide assistance. Therefore, after the Japanese army, which is rich in activity in the Yunnan-Burma [經?], began to attack, Britain, the United States, and [渝?] became even more anxious. The Japanese army in South China has long been prepared to attack the [渝?] inland. The battle on the [渝?] front will soon be clear. In summary, the general situation is centered on the [渝?] front. Incidentally, the northern defense is firmly strengthened. I hope that you will be determined and work hard consistently to ensure that the day of bright [明?] East Asia will come soon. With this determination, let us strive forward.

### Representatives of the Five Greater East Asian Nations in Shanghai Issue a Joint Declaration

Central News Agency: After the Shanghai Greater East Asia Ethnic Representatives Informal Discussion Meeting, representatives of the five Greater East Asian nations in Shanghai—China, Japan, Manchuria, the Philippines, and India—issued a joint declaration. The original text is as follows: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, two years have passed in an instant. The British and American forces, which harbor the ambition to invade and enslave Greater East Asia, are on the verge of collapse, and the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asian nations has long been established. The foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has also been laid, and the great undertaking of Greater East Asia construction is progressing. For example, China and Japan have concluded a new alliance, Burma and the Philippines have successively become independent, and the Provisional Government of Free India has also been established. Furthermore, in early November of this year, the Greater East Asian nations held a Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. From then on, each East Asian nation will get what it deserves, help each other, and share the joy of co-prosperity. Is this the fundamental meaning of establishing world peace? It has already been clearly stated in the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, and the purpose of the Greater East Asia War is also here. Today, one billion people in Asia are restoring their original character, based on Eastern morality, and gathering together for the construction of Greater East Asia. This is all thanks to the Japanese Army and Navy, as well as the national armies of the Greater East Asian nations, who have fought hard beyond life and death. Today, fierce battles are unfolding in the Nanyang area, which is a fact known to the world. How should we East Asian nations be grateful? We respectfully pay our sincere respect to the soldiers on the front lines. At the same time, we express our deep condolences to the heroic spirits who are the cornerstone of protecting the country and the pillars of building the nation. We, the representatives of the Greater East Asian nations residing in Shanghai, on the occasion of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, should know that without the completion of the Greater East Asia War, it will be difficult to achieve co-existence and co-prosperity, as well as cultural revival. Therefore, we must realize that this is our duty entrusted by Heaven. Based on the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration, we will overcome all difficulties, realize the cooperative and united posture of the Greater East Asian nations, and implement the necessary means to completely defeat Britain and the United States and complete the Greater East Asia War. We swear to stand up and assist in the great undertaking of building a new order in Greater East Asia. The declaration is as above. December 7, 1943.

### Mr. Chen Bin's Speech on the Third Year's Task of the Greater East Asia War

Speech by Mr. Chen Bin, our country's representative and president of this newspaper, original words:

Two years ago, in Shanghai, it was impossible for the various ethnic groups of East Asia to gather together and discuss the major issues of East Asia. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our ally Japan has first brilliantly achieved an auspicious initial battle, followed by glorious victories. Until recently, the Greater East Asia Conference issued an unprecedented great charter seeking co-existence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, and prospering the economy in Greater East Asia, and further dedicating this belief to the world. Today, we are able to sit here and freely express our opinions, jointly discussing the problems of East Asia itself. This is the most glorious page in the history of East Asia, even in world history.

Thanks to the leadership of our ally Japan, the Asian ideal of "Asia for Asians" has largely been realized today. Therefore, the outer form of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has, in fact, reached the highest ideal. Future tasks are concentrated within the Co-Prosperity Sphere, on how to consolidate it, and on how to consolidate internal harmony. This is not something that Japan alone can bear; each ethnic group has its own responsibility.

First, in the future, each ethnic group within the Co-Prosperity Sphere should stand on an equal footing of obligation, and contribute their respective strengths to the consolidation of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, so as to have genuine cooperation.

Second, each ethnic group should openly reveal its own weaknesses without reservation, and be brave enough to innovate. Because strengthening one's own strength is strengthening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and weakening one's own strength is weakening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Now entering the third year of the Greater East Asia War, there are four tasks that our Chinese nation should strive for:

First, the Greater East Asia War was originally a war of "I will destroy the enemy, or the enemy will destroy me." The rise and fall of East Asia depends on this one battle, and the rise and fall of China also depends on this one battle. This is a basic understanding.

Second, jointly striving for victory in the Greater East Asia War is our responsibility. Our emotions towards the war are not too late even now. It is the right time to contribute everything to cooperate with the war. The war is not limited to battles on the front lines. Politics, economy, technology, science, and ideology are all in the ranks of battle. We should cooperate with the war with absolute belief, and then we can be certain of victory.

Third, the demands of the front lines for the rear are the most practical things for people and materials, not just verbal or written cooperation.

Fourth, within the entire territory of China, today there is still the split of the Chongqing regime and the subversive sabotage of the Communist Party. How should we reform politics, stabilize people's livelihoods, so that the people of the whole country can move towards unity and cooperate with the Greater East Asia War? This important responsibility rests entirely on the shoulders of the Nanjing National Government and the people in the peace zone.

### Mr. Liu Yangshan's Speech on the Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations

Speech by Mr. Liu Yangshan, representative of the East Asia League China General Branch Shanghai Branch and Secretary-General, on the topic of "The Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations," original draft as follows:

Gentlemen, it is a great honor for me to participate in this symposium today and have the opportunity to say a few words. This symposium, in terms of the countries to which the participants belong, is international. In terms of the common mission and harmonious spirit, it can also be said to be a symposium of brothers in a big family. We are holding this symposium on the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, and its significance is evident.

My topic today is "The Greater East Asia War and the Liberation of East Asian Nations." When the Greater East Asia War began, those with incorrect understanding generally thought that this was only Japan's resistance to Anglo-American aggression. Now everyone understands that this is a war for the liberation of East Asian nations. To liberate East Asia, we must defeat the Anglo-American imperialists who have invaded East Asia. Only after the Anglo-American efforts collapse can the world be stable and the cause of the liberation of East Asian nations be successfully completed. This war is truly a war of life and death for the Greater East Asian nations."

Before the Greater East Asia War broke out, the so-called "Far East Problem" in recent decades was nothing more than how the Anglo-American imperialists divided up and ruled the East Asian colonies. East Asia, because of its abundant resources and suitable climate, is blessed by nature. Precisely because of this, East Asia has become the target of European and American colonial expansion. For nearly a hundred years, it has truly suffered from the invasion and trampling of imperialists. Especially since the First World War in 1914, the Anglo-American imperialists have become even more blatant. All the losses of participating in the European war were sought from the weak East Asian nations to seek compensation."

At that time, the Anglo-American imperialists had many conflicts in order to compete for East Asian colonies, but in maintaining the common superior status of white people and eliminating the resistance movement of East Asian nations, the attitude taken was consistent. All the fronts united by Anglo-American utilitarianism were aimed at inducing conflicts between China and Japan, completing their purpose of "divide and conquer" and "separate rule." Such painful facts are too numerous to mention. Finally, they joined the so-called ABCD line of defense, adding greater encirclement and threats to East Asia. Their vicious intentions simply sought to place the East Asian nations in a situation of no return."

However, the East Asian nations are the most civilized and most outstanding nations in the world, and have never been trampled on and conquered forever, and finally jointly issued the call for East Asian liberation and the action of liberation. For example, Japan's Meiji Restoration was the first to initiate the effort of East Asian nations to get rid of the shackles of imperialism. Our founding father advocated Pan-Asianism, which is the most correct policy for East Asian nations to seek liberation together and build together."

Unfortunately, apart from our ally Japan which, since the Meiji Restoration, has strived for strength and only managed to get rid of the clutches of imperialism, unfortunately, most of our East Asian compatriots did not recognize the true meaning of Pan-Asianism, but were incited by the Anglo-American invaders, and even engaged in internal strife, causing the liberation of East Asian nations to encounter great obstacles.

Fortunately, enlightened people in China and Japan saw through the conspiracies of the Anglo-American imperialists, stood up, and advocated the peace movement. In the 27th year [of the Republic], after the declaration by Japanese Prime Minister Konoe, our leader Chairman Wang [Jingwei] issued a telegram, reorganizing the relations between the two countries, externally seeking close cooperation with neighbors, and internally stabilizing people's livelihoods to restore national strength. Until January 9 this year, the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States. This spirit of truly sharing responsibilities, sharing joys and sorrows, and sharing life and death, undoubtedly recognizes that China is a powerful partner in the Greater East Asia War.

Economic Commentary

### Re-discussing Prices

We haven't discussed the issue of prices for a long time. The reason is that since the government announced the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in early August this year, the relevant authorities have successively adopted bold measures to severely punish speculators and profiteers. After the unscrupulous merchants in various industries disappeared, they were even more worried that their hoarded goods would be purchased, and they rushed to release them. As a result, various prices generally fell, and until the end of last month, they turned horizontally downwards. However, since the beginning of this month, the tight monetary situation caused by the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth has eased, and recently, speculators have again used the reason of reduced electricity production to carry out their activities. As a result, in the past two weeks, the prices of all goods have become unrecognizable again. Among them, the price increases of fuels, such as cigarettes, white coal, coal balls, firewood, charcoal, and all cotton textiles made from yarn, are the most alarming. In addition, non-major items, such as cigarettes, candles, leather shoes, and other items that do not directly affect people's livelihoods, have also risen linearly, with the potential to indirectly stimulate other prices.

The most important and most obvious reason for rising prices is, of course, the devaluation of currency and the demand for goods exceeding supply. The focus of suppressing prices is to increase production and facilitate transportation and sales. However, restricting the disruption of prices from the monetary and financial aspects, in other words, restricting improper lending and suppressing the floating purchasing power in society, is ultimately a price policy of drawing firewood from under the pot. Because hoarding for profit and indulging in extravagance in society are mostly due to floating purchasing power.

### Economic Bureau Urges Reporting Quantities of Main Items to Provide Data for Price Evaluation

The Shanghai Special City Economic Bureau, in order to balance the prices of all goods and promote the healthy development of industry and commerce, has issued a notice to various industries to report the quantities of main items within a specified period, so as to compile statistics and provide data for price evaluation and household distribution. However, after the member firms of various industry associations receive this form, they must fill in detailed business information and send it to the bureau for disposal. There are many people who conscientiously fill in and send the forms, but there are also many who intend to wait and see, which violates the law and will inevitably be subject to legal sanctions or suspected of illegal hoarding.

Letter Urges Submission of Forms by Deadline

In order to complete the statistics of material inventory as soon as possible, the bureau has sent letters to various industry associations, instructing them to receive and submit the forms by deadline. The original letter stated: "In order to count the quantity of main items in this city, this bureau has formulated survey forms and registration forms of business conditions, which have been notified by this bureau's Economic Section 4, No. 167, to send personnel to the bureau to receive them and instruct the members of each industry to fill in and report them separately. It has been a long time, and we have not yet received the public association to receive them. This matter concerns important statistical policies, so we hereby send another letter to urge you to check and receive them by deadline, and do not wait and see any longer.

No Shortage of Supply of All Goods

Yesterday, the reporter also inquired from various industry associations about the inventory of various main and non-essential items. So far, they are still sufficient, and there is no shortage of future supply. Among them, such as woolen cloth, silk fabrics, cotton fabrics, paper, dyes, etc., the total can meet the city's needs for several years, and at least can meet the city's needs for more than one or two years. However, most of this inventory is held by merchants who operate these items, and a small number is purchased and accumulated by people who do not formally operate these items or are outside the industry. At the same time, the date of purchase is far more than two years ago, so the cost is very low.

### Qian-Dui Industry Members Apply for Registration, Business is Under Careful Planning

The Shanghai Special City Qian-Dui Industry Association, in order to maintain the current business of the industry, convened a meeting yesterday. More than 90 Qian-Dui companies under its jurisdiction decided to first file with the Ministry of Finance of the National Government, and then apply to the Economic Bureau of this city for registration and obtain a business license. At the same time, the association is also carefully planning for the future business of the industry, establishing the principle of not engaging in speculative business. If any industry member is found to be engaged in speculative business, their membership will be immediately revoked and business will be prohibited.

### China Silk Company and Others Start Purchasing Silkworm Cocoons

With the dissolution of the Central China Silk Company, the future trend of the silk industry is highly noteworthy. According to Japanese newspapers, the China Silk Company and five other companies, as well as personnel from the silk industry association, are jointly starting to purchase silkworm cocoons in the area centered on Wuxi. The purchase funds are loans of several million yuan from a consortium of 19 banks, including the China Transportation, Huaxing Commercial, and other banks.

### Chinese Stocks Remain Strong, Datong and World Stocks See New Highs

Yesterday, Chinese stocks fluctuated indefinitely, rising and falling in a sideways movement. Most closed at the highest price of the day, which strengthened the hearts of the weak. In the "Textile Industry," Datong Yarn Factory had the largest increase. Xinhuo once fell, but finally returned to the same level as Zhongfang. The Yong'an Yarn Factory fluctuated narrowly throughout the day. "Culture and Entertainment" stocks rose almost uniformly, especially the World Bookstore and China Film, which both reached unprecedented peaks in the afternoon. "Department Stores" were relatively stable. In "Chemical Industry," the price of Senmao Chemical saw a slight increase, while Zhongfa and Xinya were very flat. In "Public Utilities," 315 yuan was transacted for Zhabei Water and Electricity and 210 yuan for Huashang Electric. In "Finance and Investment," Xinya Construction once rose close to 30 yuan, and Sanle Industrial rose by more than one yuan. The remaining increases and decreases were slight. The "Real Estate Industry" trend was very stable, and Xinheng, Yongxing, etc. all saw increases. In "Other Industries," Kangyuan Biscuit immediately fell after the 100-yuan level was entered. Trading was extremely active throughout the day. The closing prices of major stocks are recorded below.

### Business Summary

Public Bonds: Yesterday's prices were still mixed, with extremely little trading. Type C initial issues were still relatively stable, but "Bu Yao" once saw a decline. The final price at noon recovered slightly, resulting in a small increase of 4 yuan compared to the previous day. Type A was down 2, Type B was down 1, Type D had no trading, and Type E was down 4.

Interbank Rate: The interbank rate of the Qianpiao Association was listed at 18%, which remained unchanged. Rice: Yesterday, thousands of bags were delivered by truck and Bun-shaped packages. Retail sales were slow, and scattered households were busy. The market showed an upward trend.

Cereals: Nanjing yellow soybeans, wheat, and Mingguang mung beans were still mostly up, with supply falling short of demand. Cigarettes: Again showed a state of having prices but no sales. Old British Knife, Qianmen, Quanlu, etc. were all stable, the same as the previous day's price.

Daily Necessities: Yesterday, the price of candles was still calling high, and matches, US products, and Phoenix were still strong. Soap was stable.

Woolen Cloth: Heavy overcoat woolen cloth can be described as widely sold at the right time. Because winter has arrived and the weather continues to be cold, actual sales are stimulated, and buyers' demand is strong. The Nanjing gang sends many goods to Shanghai every day, but mostly ordinary and low-grade goods below 1,000 yuan. The tailors and tailors of Western clothing in this street, etc., are all improving their procurement because of good actual sales. Standard prices are rising due to excessive demand

### National Representatives Conference (Continued from Page 3)

After Japan, an allied nation, was sued in China for participating in the war, it returned concessions, signed the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, assisted Burma and the Philippines in achieving independence, established a provisional government in India, and recently held the Greater East Asia Conference and issued the Greater East Asia Declaration. This proves the allied nations' proactive nature in completing the Greater East Asia War to liberate the East Asian peoples.

Looking at the evolution of the situation, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War was a natural development. The liberation of the East Asian peoples accompanying the Greater East Asia War is a natural result, and only by shouting for national liberation can we awaken and unite the various East Asian peoples.

Therefore, we must recognize reality. East Asia cannot be conquered. The sovereignty and territory of East Asian countries are independent and free. However, the power contributed to the Greater East Asia War must be integrated and indivisible. The Greater East Asia War is fought for the survival of the entire East Asian nation. If the Greater East Asia War is won, all East Asian nations can gain freedom and liberation; otherwise, they will perish together. Speaking of a single country, each East Asian country has its natural characteristics. As far as the Greater East Asia War is concerned, all East Asian nations should work together to achieve the goal of coexistence and co-prosperity. The only path for our East Asian nations to seek survival is to move forward on this path; there is no other way to go.

The British and American imperialists are still trying to use the land of China under the control of Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek as a battlefield for fighting for Britain and America, driving Chinese people to fight to stop India's independence for Britain and America. There is no reason to justify this in terms of reason or morality. If Chongqing's Chiang Kai-shek does not wake up, his failure is predictable.

On the eve of the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, recalling the oppression suffered by the East Asian peoples under British and American rule in the past, and the spirit of the soldiers shedding blood on the front lines, we firmly believe that the liberation of the East Asian nations will be completed. The greater the degree to which a nation endures suffering, the greater the certainty of victory in the war. Our East Asian nations have the inherent qualities of perseverance and a spirit of enduring hardship. If we can unite sincerely, the power we unleash will be irresistible to any enemy.

However, finally, I still hope that my East Asian compatriots will not take the Greater East Asia War too lightly. During this period, regardless of when this war ends, each of us East Asian compatriots must do their best and contribute everything possible to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, we must especially pay attention to what I said at the beginning: we only have national distinctions, but in terms of the whole of East Asia, we can also be said to be brothers in a large family. We only have distinctions of strength and size, but we must achieve emotional unity and have no gaps between us in order to shoulder this great mission. The shortcomings most easily exposed among nations, such as the strong having an excessive sense of superiority, often showing arrogance and looking down on weaker nations, and the weak believing that their abilities are weak, and belittling themselves and lacking self-confidence, are all obstacles to spiritual unity and seeking liberation together. We must find ways to overcome and eliminate them.

The above is nothing more than commonplace remarks. I hope you will correct me. Finally, I wish for the victory of the Greater East Asia War and the liberation of all East Asian nations.

### Mr. Takeouchi Fumio of Japan Speaks: Two Factors for the Success of Greater East Asia

### Japan and Asian Nations Cooperate in Parliament — Speech by Mr. Takeouchi Fumio:

Briefly stated: "On this day two years ago, I was in Tokyo. That day was when Japan declared war on Britain and America. The mood in Tokyo was extremely excited. One day after the start of the war, the Japanese army achieved unprecedented great victories. Every citizen was excited. We immediately felt a new belief that we would win this war, and through this war, East Asia would definitely be united in the future. This has been fully realized, and we have today's grand gathering and today's status. Last month, the historically rare Greater East Asia Conference was held in Tokyo, and the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration was issued. Everyone is working together and moving towards a consistent goal. The East Asian nations are united, so this unity of East Asians was determined early after the start of the war. Therefore, after three years, the East Asian nations can discuss matters together. At the same time, there is another point that was not expected, that is, after the independence of Burma and the Philippines, the Indian National Army and the Japanese army took joint steps to destroy the British and American enemies. This is very gratifying. The victory of the Greater East Asia War is really a blessing from heaven. It is an inevitable event in history, and the unification of the East Asian nations is also an inevitable event in history. Therefore, we must review how to address the Greater East Asia issue in the future. I think it can be divided into two factors for success: 1. The power of Asia has developed vigorously. 2. The general outstanding talents of Asia have fully realized. Asians inherently have talent and occupy an important position in the world. Due to years of oppression, invasion, and manipulation by Britain and America, the activity of Asians, who inherently possessed talent, was concealed. Until after the Russo-Japanese War, the genius and talent of Asians had a clear realization, and they had the belief of uniting and generating strength. They regarded Asians as oppressed peoples and sought self-improvement and strength. Therefore, the discovery of the genius of Asians and the recent unity can be said to have the Russo-Japanese War as the cause, and the current Greater East Asia War as the result. Therefore, how can the genius of Asians be used and contributed to East Asia and to the peace of the world? Therefore, we should resolutely contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War and strive hard. With this determination, and relying on strength to do it, we will definitely be able to destroy the British and American invasion and achieve success." Finally, Mr. Takeouchi mentioned the images he had seen in Tokyo in the past month regarding the strengthening of domestic production, the rapid progress of national defense, economic aircraft production, and the abundance of military preparations. Therefore, it is not far off that we will eliminate the British and American forces, expel them from the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and completely destroy them. At the same time, we must work harder to completely annihilate Britain and America, so that all East Asian nations can live in peace in their own places, to establish the completion of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, and further establish a world co-prosperity sphere, to build a new world and a new order. He particularly emphasized that there is only one Asia united in the world.

### Mr. Osaka Yoichi of Japan Speaks: New Belief in the Victory of Greater East Asia

### Mr. Osaka Yoichi, representative of the Continental News, speaks briefly:

"In the world war, there has never been seen such a spirit of righteousness among East Asian nations as in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, after Japan opened the prelude, the Greater East Asia War liberated sixteen East Asian nations and created a new world and a new history, a brilliant one. I returned to my country for a month this time and just returned the day before yesterday. This trip has given me a new belief that the Greater East Asia War will definitely be victorious. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will definitely be completed. However, in order to achieve this, we must also make the greatest effort. Japan has been established for more than 2,600 years and has achieved today's great achievements, revealing a world-rare history. This is enough to show the determination of the 100 million people of Japan to contribute their strength to the country and strive for victory." Mr. Osaka also introduced the service of the people in Japan for the country. There are no useless talents in Japan, and they have the spirit of courageously moving forward, serving, and striving for the victory of the war. Mr. Kwan also confirmed that Mr. Takeouchi's proposal that there is only one Asia was deeply agreed upon. He said that Asia must have a strong unity to achieve its goals, create a large family, and become one. Therefore, in this era, we must have this belief to serve the country. In this great historical era, it is very glorious. At the same time, our responsibilities are arduous, to liberate the sixteen East Asian nations, to achieve freedom and independence, and we must have confidence in the struggle. Not only Japan, but China and all nations are united and moving towards a common goal, and we must all join hands and work together to create a new history, and so on.

### Mr. Yeh Yao-kung of Manchukuo Speaks: Consolidate the New Unity of East Asian Nations

### Mr. Yeh Yao-kung, Consul General and representative of Manchukuo, spoke as follows:

"Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Today, the Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference is being held. I am honored to have the opportunity to participate in this grand meeting as a representative of the Manchukuo Concordia Association and to express my thoughts. Most of the nations in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, which has a population of one billion, have experienced economic or political oppression under the aggressive policies of foreign imperialists led by Britain and America for a long time in the past. During that period, many national heroes came out several times to raise the banner of liberation, but from the perspective of doctrine, they were not of the Mahayana type and were limited to local and group activities. The liberation of the East Asian nations has not yet achieved victory. The reason is that there is no central country with rich guidance and the ability to implement far-reaching plans and lead the nations. However, the Great Japanese Empire, which envisions eternal peace and co-prosperity for East Asia, displays the spirit of Hakkō ichiu. The first is the Manchurian Incident, the second is the China Incident, and the third is the Greater East Asia War. It can be said that it is an unprecedented innovative stage in East Asian history, firmly advancing the liberation of East Asian nations and assisting the independence of national countries. Therefore, there is the birth of Manchukuo, the establishment of the new regime of the Nationalist Government of the Republic of China, the assistance to Thailand, the complete independence of Burma, and the independence of the Philippines. Furthermore, it has developed into the great cause of the liberation of the Indian nation. This fact is a glorious century undertaking that we could not have imagined. Only the Great Japanese Empire can make it a reality. Therefore, recalling the events of twelve years ago in our Manchukuo, at that time, based on the total will of the 30 million people who rose up enthusiastically, and relying on the Great Japanese Empire's great righteousness, we established an independent country. For twelve years until today, we have been working wholeheartedly and continuously on national construction based on the spirit of national harmony. Last autumn, we blessed the first phase of basic construction for ten years. On this basis, we entered the second phase of construction. Now, the development of the domestic economy and industry has reached an extremely astonishing level. At the same time, in the position of a link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, we bear the heavy responsibility of guarding the north militarily, and we are promoting the spirit of harmony politically to devote ourselves to the construction of this righteous world. I think of the great achievements of national construction over the past twelve years and can only be grateful for the infinite righteous assistance provided by the Japanese Empire during this period. I look back on the new history of our country and therefore think of the liberation of the East Asian nations that followed us. I hope that the sacred intention of the Japanese Empire today will not be fruitless. We should conduct mutually solid progress with the Japanese Empire as the guiding country, complete the unity of the East Asian nations, and consolidate the foundation of the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere, making East Asia the crown of the sacred land of the world. Now the Greater East Asia War is still in full swing, and the situation is not so simple. We must contribute to the rear area tasks of the Japanese Imperial Army. The East Asian nations will surely realize the liberation of the East Asian nations with the efforts of Japan, and we must understand and strengthen this new unity. This is what I most believe. Tomorrow is the second anniversary of the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. Because of this significance, it is truly gratifying to hold the East Asia National Representatives Conference today in Shanghai, the international city of East Asia. May I hereby pray for the success of the struggle of the East Asian nations."

### Mr. Wei Xian of the Philippines Speaks: A New East Asia Has Emerged

### Central News Agency Report:

At the Shanghai Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, Mr. Wei Xian, Chairman of the Philippine Association and representative of the Philippines, spoke as follows: "East Asian brothers: A year ago today, representatives of various East Asian groups in Shanghai gathered at this time and place to express their heartfelt joy and happiness at the glorious victories won by Japan in its early heroic struggle to drive out Britain and America from East Asia. I was also honored to be present at that memorable event. At that time, we prayed for further victories for Japan, so that one day in the future, other East Asian nations would be rescued from their shackles and liberated from the tyranny of British and American imperialism. At that time, as an East Asian, I felt very happy, carrying the glory of an East Asian. But what about today? As a citizen of the Philippines, with the heart of a Filipino, I am even happier. It was only recently that we, under the rule of Westerners, first Spain and then the United States, groaned and became haggard. Now our motherland has finally broken free from its shackles and gained independence. What makes me happy is that last year, our wishes and prayers seemed to be like an old horse that knows the way, carrying us straight to the path of victory. You see, China has restored its sovereignty, the Philippine people have been revived, India has its free provisional government, Malaya and the islands of Southeast Asia have recovered their prosperity, and all East Asian nations are gloriously bathed in the light of eternal freedom. They have new hope, greater national self-esteem, and a resurgent sense of self-confidence and justice. A new East Asia has emerged. All these earth-shattering events have occurred one after another following Japan's repeated victories. Today's celebration is even more significant than the great victory we celebrated last year. We not only praise the glorious achievements of the Japanese army and navy, but also celebrate the future of the new East Asia."

### Mr. Chotram Partabrai Gidwani of India Speaks: The Indian Flag Will Be Raised in New Delhi

### Central News Agency Report:

At the Shanghai Greater East Asia National Representatives Conference, Mr. Chotram Partabrai Gidwani, Head of Shanghai Branch of the Indian Independence League and Representative of India, spoke briefly: "Two years ago, Japan defeated Britain and America in a very short time to liberate Asia, driving Britain and America out of various battlefields such as Hong Kong, Malaya, the Philippines, East Indies, and Burma. The British and American base of two hundred years, Syonan-to, is also free of enemies. The brave and invincible Japanese army, with its spirit of fearing no death, has shaken the world stage. At the same time, the thing that makes us Indians most happy is that the Indian army will no longer be oppressed by the British in the future, and will fight alongside the Japanese army in Hong Kong and Burma for the blood of political freedom and independence. On January 9 of this year, the Chinese National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War and declared war on Britain and America. In this year, China not only gained complete freedom and independence, but also recovered the concessions, eliminating the illegal places where British and American enemies hid their dirt and filth. We believe that one day, Chiang Kai-shek of Chongqing will realize that he has gone astray, that Britain and America are splitting up, and that he will return to Asia and join hands with the same enemies. The Japanese government has been assisting Burma and the Philippines to gain independence this year, and at the Greater East Asia Conference, Prime Minister Tōjō announced that he would return the Paracel and Nicobar Islands to the Indian Provisional Free Government. This shows that Japan has no ambitions and sincerely assists India's independence and seeks India's liberation. This June, Mr. Subhas Chandra Bose came from Berlin to the East to work hard for the liberation of India. He arrived in Syonan and established the Indian National Army, with the slogan "Return to New Delhi," and fought alongside the Japanese army, fighting the common enemies of East Asia, Britain and America. On the 23rd of this month, the Indian Provisional Government declared war on Britain and America. We will shed our blood and destroy the symptoms of England until we achieve freedom. As we celebrate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, it further increases our strength and strengthens our confidence in victory. On this day next year, our two-colored Indian flag will definitely be raised in New Delhi."

### Restoring the Psychology of Trust and Peace — A Prerequisite for Achieving Overall Peace

— Sun Lukan

The China Alliance has been established, and new treaties of equality and mutual benefit have been produced. What the people of both countries are watching and naturally expect is the issue of overall peace. But if we say that this issue is difficult to achieve, it is because, based on observing the psychology of the people, except for the Communist Party who spread red ideology, the Chiang regime who blindly believes in Britain and America, and the speculators who make a fortune from the national crisis, I dare say that there is not a single person who does not yearn for peace. Those who are in the midst of war and suffer all kinds of disasters, needless to say, even the people living in cities, saturated with economic oppression, lack of goods, traffic congestion, and all kinds of suffering, who does not harbor the thought of "living in peace" and not being a displaced person? Based on this view, peace should have been achieved long ago. Why is it that even today, the road ahead is still hazy and difficult to grasp? I think that although there are many people who hope for peace, there are really too few who trust in peace. Because there are too few people who trust in peace, overall peace cannot be achieved. Under today's circumstances, if we want to achieve overall peace, besides the Chinese and Japanese sides quickly correcting the errors of the past and present, and causing the people to have a solid sense of trust in peace, there is no other way to go.

From our side's point of view, the government's errors towards the people are not to be concealed. They are really obvious. First, there are many gatherings, many proposals, few implementations, and few achievements. Second, the appointment of officials has no standards and is half-based on personal relationships. Third, orders change from morning to evening, making people at a loss. Fourth, there is no representative body, and feelings have no way to reach the top. Fifth, corruption is discovered, but those who abuse their power are not severely punished.

Having said this, perhaps some people will refute me, saying: "The inability of the Chongqing side to join the peace is not an expression of public opinion, but is due to the coercion of the Chiang regime's military power. Moreover, there is also the Yan'an Communist government, which has no hope of leaning towards peace." These kinds of arguments cannot be said to be completely without basis. But in reality, the soldiers of the Chongqing side are also recruited from the people. If the hearts of the people are completely scattered, from where will military power be exerted? During the Xinhai Revolution, the elite and sharp weapons were all in the north. But a small team of people in the 8th Battalion of the Engineering Corps ignited the fuse, and in less than four months, they overthrew the Qing government. In the Northern Expedition that year, the military strength of Wu, Sun, and Zhang was in a ratio of seven to three compared to the people's army. However, once the hearts of the people were lost, the Nationalist Party achieved complete success in a short time. These are all recent facts that can serve as a warning. Regarding the internal situation of the Chongqing side, except for Song, Kong and their ilk, who have too deep personal economic ties with Britain and America, and are trying to get rid of them, other military leaders, such as He Jingzhi, are very reluctant to resist Japan. Yang Gengguang once said, "Our commander's military knowledge is not enough to be a brigade commander, and it is still a question." The psychology of the high-ranking officers of the Chongqing side can be imagined from this. The strength of the Gui clique has long been weakened to the point where little remains. Most of the Sichuan clique are riding on two horses, and in view of the death of Liu Fuchen, most of them are a little disheartened. The leader of the Yunnan clique, Long Yun, has long reached the point of superficial agreement and internal divergence with Chiang Kai-shek. As long as the current government really has a way, and the allied nations are extremely sincere and the workers' party changes, perhaps Chiang Kai-shek will have to go abroad to be a government in exile. As for the entire group of Communists, they will not participate in the peace, but that does not matter, because our national system and customs have no reason to accept communism. If the Nationalist government could have truly eradicated the remnants of the Beiyang warlords when it was established, started anew with the people, established a clean, upright, and just system, and practiced the Three Principles of the People, the Communist Party would not have been able to exist long ago. Unfortunately, besides raising party power, nothing else was done that day. They took the opportunity to easily incite the masses. As long as the government learns from the past and reinvigorates the future, gains the trust of the people, even if the Chongqing side has British and American support, it will inevitably disintegrate, and the Communist Party will not be difficult to eradicate. At the latest, within a year or two, overall peace will inevitably be achieved.

From the friendly nations' point of view, of course, their governments and people hope that our country will achieve overall peace as soon as possible, so that they can unite to deal with Britain and America. I am now putting forward three points, which seem to require review. First, according to the various expressions of the allied nations' governments to us, it can be said that they are benevolent and righteous to the extreme, and there is nothing they have not considered. However, looking at the real situation in the current peaceful areas, whether everything conforms to the announcements issued by the Japanese government, and whether the spirit of mutual assistance and cooperation among the military and political authorities of the allied nations is consistent? Perhaps because there are few people and many things, or because of language barriers, the Chinese staff employed are of uneven quality, and it can be said that there are more weeds than good grain. These people rely on their ability to understand Japanese and get close to the authorities, and inevitably take advantage of their power to bully others, and even engage in fraud and embezzlement from time to time. Money all goes to them, while the people's resentment accumulates towards the allied nations. Recently, the military police have detected a fraud case involving as much as 200,000 yuan, which shows that the friendly army has long been aware of it, but unfortunately, there are still many similar matters. In particular, there are many cases of using public undertakings as a pretext to commit fraud and harm the public. Conscience dictates that most people in the allied nations are able to exercise self-control. But it is hoped that they will use fewer flashy and cunning employees, and pay close attention to the behavior of these people on weekdays, and firmly adhere to the principle of punishing those who commit crimes and punishing them severely. Naturally, good people will be blessed, and the realization of peace will be more promising. Second, among the foreigners who come to China, there is no doubt that merchants have the closest contact with society. If merchants can sincerely express goodwill to the residents, one person will tell ten, and ten people will tell a hundred, and the influence will be quick and great. Now I would also like to put forward three opinions, hoping that the merchants of the allied nations will review them: (A) The organizational content of major merchants such as banks and companies is mostly westernized. Most of the people in charge are fluent in English, and those who understand Chinese are secondary. There is already a slight estrangement. In addition, British and American merchants used to treat Chinese people arrogantly. It seems that the merchants of the allied nations have not been able to completely change this habit, and they look down on Chinese people more than Westerners. Of course, this kind of situation is not the case for every family, but I hope that if there is such a case, it will be corrected. (B) In jointly organized undertakings, apart from personnel and general affairs, the Chinese side has no real power at all, as if it were the system of employing compradors in foreign firms in the past. I ask, which truly wealthy and talented merchant would be willing to work within this scope? This is the second point I hope to correct. (C) Most of the merchants who come to China to operate in the beginning recruit Chinese partners to facilitate their operations because they are unfamiliar with the place or have language barriers. However, honest and kind people are timid and dare not join, or they misunderstand rumors and do not intend to invest. As a result, a group of hooligans and swindlers take the opportunity to rise up, pretending to be partners on the one hand to deceive their compatriots, and on the other hand taking advantage of the partners' ignorance of Chinese customs to commit all kinds of fraud. When the day comes when the accounts are overturned or the funds are lost, the people blame the Japanese merchants. Such things are not seen in the north. In the future, it seems that we should pay more attention to being careful at the beginning in order to be able to see things through to the end. This is the third point I hope to correct. The above three points seem to be minor details, but they are most likely to arouse social resentment and are also a major obstacle to the entire peace. I deeply hope that the merchant friends of the allied nations will pay special attention.

### The Dawn of Comprehensive Peace

— Hu Shuomei

The call for comprehensive peace has long resonated to the heavens, and the work of implementing comprehensive peace has also been well underway. The National Government, in its position of cooperating with its ally Japan, aims to strike down England and America, and will naturally contribute everything, using the highest degree of ability, determined not to recognize the existence of the Chongqing regime. Moreover, at this stage of the peace movement, having obtained such a just treaty, the object of resistance has completely disappeared, and there is absolutely no reason to blindly delay. The people of our country have always demanded the withdrawal of troops as a condition for peace. Now our ally Japan not only allows the withdrawal of troops, but also completely abandons the right to station troops under the Boxer Protocol. The key to comprehensive peace lies entirely with Chongqing. As long as Chongqing abandons resistance, comprehensive peace can be realized.

The Chongqing side has repeatedly and publicly stated: "Peace can only be achieved by returning to the status quo before the incident." Judging from the current situation, the content of this Sino-Japanese alliance treaty not only restores the situation to what it was before this incident, but actually exceeds it several times over. So, what is the basis for the arguments of those who advocate resistance?

However, the reason why comprehensive peace has not yet been achieved is partly due to the violent hijacking by the Chiang clique and the obstruction by the Communist Party. However, a major reason is also that the current strength of the National Government has not yet been universally developed. Since the return to the capital...

However, the people can also be angered for the sake of their own survival and the safety of their country. Since the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and even the declaration of war against England and America, the Chinese government has been seeking the independence of the Republic of China, and the Chinese people have been fighting for the survival of the nation. If China had not fought Japan at the Marco Polo Bridge Incident, China could never have become an independent country. Similarly, if China had not fought with England and America on January 9, China would never have become an independent country. Moreover, what is at stake goes beyond China, as the Marco Polo Bridge Incident and the Greater East Asia Holy War are the foundation for the liberation of Asia.

What does this mean? As the saying goes, "No fight, no deal." Seven years ago, the relationship between China and Japan had many areas of discord. If China had not resolutely resisted Japan, the relationship between China and Japan would probably never have reached the point of mutual understanding that it has today. Witnessing the people of two countries of the same culture fighting each other in the depths of suffering, destroying the national strength of both countries, men of vision have long felt the pain. It is amidst this pity that the people of both countries gradually realized the wrongness of mutual slaughter, and thus came the Konoe Statement, Chairman Wang's telegram, the gradual release of tensions, and the fruit of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, which blossomed from the flowers of true and righteous friendship. Therefore, the resistance at the Marco Polo Bridge was indeed a medium for mutual understanding between China and Japan. Now that China and Japan are upholding each other in the spirit of righteousness, the former enemy has become today's friend. Why is the Chongqing government still not awake?

Anyone who endangers China's independence and freedom is China's enemy. Japan used to be an enemy, but now it is an ally. The Chongqing government certainly knows that England and America are harmful to China, but they still rely on them and fight Japan because they still believe that Japan is China's greatest enemy. If this concept cannot be broken, comprehensive peace cannot be achieved.

In fact, Japan respects China's independence and equality more than England and America. Just look at the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty that has been signed this time, its significance is so far-reaching. England and America are merely engaging in a clumsy imitation, returning concessions and abolishing consular jurisdiction, which is as ridiculous as the United States falsely promising independence to the Filipinos after the independence of the Philippines. Their hypocrisy is so obvious that even a three-year-old child would not be fooled.

However, in our opinion, there are two reasons why the Chongqing government does not awaken:

They are forced by England and America and cannot turn back.

They cannot trust Japan and lack ambition for the construction of East Asia.

The latter is the primary reason. Therefore, if we want Chongqing to return willingly, we can only prove with facts that Japan treats China as an equal. This can be discussed in two aspects.

The hatred of Japan among the Chinese people has been ingrained in their minds for many years. These prejudiced views can only be overcome by using propaganda to promote friendship between China and Japan. At the same time, friendly countries should also change their past attitudes so that China and Japan can gradually embark on the path of genuine respect, understanding, and even love.

In the political aspect, Japan should help China become a truly strong and independent country. It is obvious that East Asia cannot be called completely liberated until China is strong.

### Navy

— Written by Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

The traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy has achieved unprecedented feats in world naval history. This spirit is admired by both friend and foe. The famous Japanese writer Iwata Toyoo devoted all his energy to write the book "Navy" for the Asahi Shimbun, vividly conveying the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. It was published daily in the newspaper, widely circulated, and made into a movie. Now, this newspaper has translated it and will publish it daily. We hope readers will pay attention.

A Man

One

In 1919, the Treaty of Versailles was established. The citizens of Paris tore up pieces of paper from all the windows and threw them down, symbolizing the auspicious snow of victory. Their feeling was not so much the joy of victory as it was the welcome of peace. On November 18 of that year, a boy was born to Shinichi Taniguchi, a rice merchant in Arita Town, Kagoshima City.

In front of the store facing Taniyama Street, Shinichi, holding a dustpan, knew about the birth before he was told, because of the high-pitched and intense birth cry.

"Is it a boy?"

The fifty-year-old father's face showed no expression. He continued to handle the dustpan full of rice flour.

Shinichi was not like a businessman. He was a man of few words. He held the rank of Private First Class in the Konoe Cavalry and had served in both the Sino-Japanese War and the Russo-Japanese War. However, when he heard of the birth of the boy, he was as silent as a forest. This was not only because of his experiences and nature, but also for other reasons.

He, his wife, had grown accustomed to the birth of children. This was the eleventh birth. Five girls, five boys, none died young, all grew up healthy. Moreover, the births were very easy. The children were like the fruits of the persimmon tree in the garden, born naturally and simply, one by one. Now, another one has been added—a boy.

Shinichi calmly accepted the birth of the child. Although the local custom was to be ashamed of having many children, they were not disgusted by it. Of course, the family was not very wealthy, but because there was a custom of treating children as a gift from heaven, no matter how many were born, there was not a word of complaint, especially since this time it was a boy. Although it was already the era of 1919, in the Satsuma region, the disparity in value between the sexes was still very severe.

(A boy was born...)

Shinichi was thinking about what to name him. The eldest daughter was named Haruko, and the second daughter was named Mitsuko—girls' names could be given very casually. But boys' names required more thought. The eldest son was named Shinzo, and the second son was named Shinichiro—these were easy. The ones born later were troublesome. The fourth son was named Shikichi, which was not bad. The fifth son was named Taro, which was a bit rough.

This time, no matter what, he wanted to give him an auspicious name. Why? Because this child's name seemed like it couldn't be too casual!

(Shin, Shin, Shin Jin! Good!)

Strangely, a good name that slipped out of his mouth came to mind. Shin Jin, Taniguchi Shin Jin! One of the 83 Satsuma loyalists had that name. This was no ordinary name. At that time, Shinichi's family was still commoners.

Second Anniversary Commemorative Issue of the Greater East Asia War

### The Greater East Asia War and the China Front Provided by the Shanghai Army Reporting Department

England and America, which suffered a major defeat in the war, realized the disadvantage of prolonged attrition and quickly changed the entire wartime situation, using their huge resources to launch a desperate counterattack. Today, fierce battles are being waged day and night in the southern strongholds.

England and America's overall counteroffensive against Japan, in addition to the southern strongholds, also focuses on the counteroffensive in Burma and the counteroffensive from mainland China, driving Chongqing to engage in anti-Japanese resistance to the end. Using the US Air Force stationed in China, they attempt to directly bomb the Japanese mainland.

Chongqing also violates East Asian history on its own, continues to resist, and hopes for the victory of the Anglo-American alliance, gradually giving territory to the American army, hoping that external forces will crush Japan.

Thus, the current situation of the war on the Chinese mainland is in a complex state. At the same time, the position of the China front in the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly important.

In the second year of the Greater East Asia War, in addition to its original task of destroying the Nationalist army, the Japanese army also carried out increasingly active operations against the Communist army, and to the activities of the US Air Force stationed in Chongqing, they acted ahead of their plans, seized the initiative, and closed off the air routes to bombing the Japanese mainland.

Let us now examine the results of the operations over the past year:

The operational results of the Expeditionary Force over the past year.

The main battles in North China included the Taihang Operation in 1937 and the Autumn Communist Suppression Operation; in Central China, there were the Dabie Mountain Operation and the Spring and Summer Offensive Operations, and the Southwest Taihu Lake Area Operation. In addition, there were active and vigorous activities in Xinjiang, Central China, North China, and South China.

Now, let us summarize the results:

A. The number of engagements was 22,000, with an average of 1,900 per month, or about 67 per day. This seems to be a decrease compared to the 25,000 in the previous year, but the number of Japanese troops dispatched did not differ much. This shows that the enemy is trying to avoid engagement as much as possible.

B. The number of enemy troops engaged was approximately 3,300,000, which is less than the 3,600,000 in the previous year. This indicates the difficulty of replenishing enemy troops.

C. The number of enemy soldiers killed was approximately 210,000, and the number of captured and surrendered was approximately 170,000. The ratio of the latter to the former is approximately 80%. This is a significant increase in the number of captured and surrendered compared to the 12% in 1937, 29% in 1938, and 44% in 1939. This clearly shows how low the enemy's morale is.

D. In terms of captured equipment, artillery and heavy weapons are decreasing, which proves the difficulty of replenishing enemy equipment after being cut off, and that they are using inferior equipment; while the increase in swords and spears shows that they are fighting with unconventional weapons.

E. In the air war, 148 enemy aircraft were shot down, 62 were set on fire in the air, and 41 were shot down by ground fire, totaling 251. Of these, the majority were US Air Force aircraft. It is now estimated that the enemy's current strength is approximately 250 aircraft. Thus, the enemy's air force has been almost completely destroyed.

### Second Anniversary of the Greater East Asia War China Area Fleet Reporting Department

— Lieutenant Commander Shioda

Introduction

Before August of last year, when the enemy launched a general counteroffensive from the Solomon Islands, the war history of the Japanese Navy was like a prairie fire, like water flowing downhill, and could be described as unprecedented. The surprise attack on Hawaii, the Battle of Malaya, the capture of Guam, the Battle of the Java Sea, the capture of Singapore, the Battle of Bali, Surabaya, the Battle of Batavia, the Battle of the Indian Ocean, the Battle of the Coral Sea, and the Battle of Midway, etc. In the first two battles, the enemy's main fleet was destroyed at the beginning of the war, cutting the enemy's combat power in half. Then, the HMS Prince of Wales was sunk, crushing the enemy's huge combat power in East Asia. The latter directed the elite spearhead to the enemy's outer front, broke into the enemy's base, and successively concentrated on island-hopping attacks, until the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 14 of last year. In one fell swoop, the battle line was extended by 3,000 kilometers to the west and south. During this period, eight enemy battleships and eight aircraft carriers were sunk. Japanese damage was limited to three aircraft carriers (including one small aircraft carrier and one seaplane carrier), resulting in a great victory. From a strategic point of view, up to this point, it could be called the first phase of the operation, or the attack phase. In short, the largest point attacked by the Japanese naval force in the first phase was the Solomon Islands. To further block the connection between the United States and Australia, and to completely cut off transportation between Australia and Hawaii, it was necessary to set up important replenishment bases in the south.

After this, it inevitably entered the second stage: protecting the southern treasure house. Adding bases, occupying various strongholds to smash the enemy's offensive power, forming a defensive posture. The decisive battle of Guadalcanal, the battles of Irovela, Lunga, the first to third battles of the Solomon Islands, and the Battle of the South Pacific were all naval battles aimed at occupying strongholds and smashing the enemy's counteroffensive. Recent battles, such as the first to sixth air and sea battles of Bougainville Island, are in some sense of the same nature as the Solomon Islands battle.

Why Obtain Great Victory

So, where did the glorious war results since the beginning of the war come from? It was due to the belief in certain victory created by training and the spirit of destroying the enemy based on this belief. This is the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy. The belief in certain victory is not only produced by indoor education or armchair strategizing, but is actually born from continuous training, being confident that you can defeat the enemy. Hours after attacking Tulagi during the First Battle of the Solomon Islands on August 8 last year. At 5:15 pm, as the mine warfare ship was advancing, the coaching bugle rang, and training began. This training took place at the same time every day, until today, so even in the spare time during the attack on Tulagi, training also began at the same time. In this way, one shot will certainly hit, and Marshal Togo's teaching, "One cannon that hits with one shot is better than one hundred cannons that hit with one shot," can be realized.

But even with such training, if it is not propelled by a great spiritual force during combat, results cannot be expected. The traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy for seventy years, "Do not die until the enemy is defeated," has become the belief of "Kill without fail upon seeing the enemy," and has further developed into the belief of "Seek the enemy and kill without fail." Based on this belief, there arose warriors who fought as ten against one, or as one plane against twenty, or who self-exploded towards enemy warships.

Due to the Washington Conference, being forced into a disadvantageous ratio of 5:5:3, new aircraft carriers, which the world's shipbuilding movement focused on, could only be created through remodeling, on the road to self-destruction. From then on, the Japanese Navy devoted all its energy to the remodeling of weapons, the thoroughness of training, and the research of tactics. Japan also noticed that in the future, it would inevitably have to confront England and the United States at a ratio of 3:10, so it put the greatest effort into the quality of weapons. As a result, in this war, it proved how excellent Japanese weapons are.

First, Japan has special submarines. In Hawaii, in Sydney, in Madagascar, making the enemy weary, and many other new weapons are also being constantly researched. Speaking of aircraft, the excellence of Japanese naval fighters has long been established by the American side--the United States has always boasted that its weapons are the best in the world, but the appearance of Japanese naval fighters has also made them quite troubled. The enemy particularly emphasized the number of Japanese naval aircraft destroyed in each naval and air battle, which shows that the enemy has more fear of Japanese fighters than imagined. In August of this year, enemy reports claimed that Japan was using new fighters on the New Guinea front, urging their country to accelerate the manufacture of excellent aircraft. All wars cause weapons to develop surprisingly, which was already evident in the previous Great War. In particular, the progress of modern aircraft is astonishing. Yesterday's aircraft are already outdated in today's battles. Today's aircraft cannot be the front-line aircraft of tomorrow. In the field of aircraft, especially fighters, Japan's excellence is often ahead of the enemy. Also, large cruisers (over 10,000 tons) have been sunk in air battles in which war results were obtained each time, which shows that torpedoes are also quite advanced.

Secondly, the tactical research and the far-sighted operations of the Supreme Command must be mentioned. Recently, the operations carried out in the Solomon Islands and the Gilbert Islands have caused American military commentators to marvel at the Japanese fleet's operations, calling them whimsical. As with the surprise attack on Hawaii, the attack on Singapore, and the Battle of the Coral Sea, Japan often caught the enemy off guard. Its great war results have left a great war history in subsequent tactics. Also, looking at the history of naval battles over the past two years, the naval battles of Hawaii and the Coral Sea have had a great impact on the enemy, causing England and the United States to change their warship building plans.

The naval battles of the Coral Sea and Midway were manifestations of the Japanese Navy's traditional spirit of attacking the enemy, while the naval battles in the Guadalcanal area, especially the night battle of Lunga, showed that the Japanese Navy had strong confidence in both offensive and defensive tactics. The withdrawal from Guadalcanal was a reorganization and strengthening of the internal battle lines in preparation for the next phase of operations after the mission was completed. The brave decision of the Japanese Supreme Command for this withdrawal operation is truly commendable.

Secondly, the Japanese naval force is composed of material and human elements. The human element can be divided into officers and non-commissioned officers, and non-commissioned officers can be further divided into conscripts and volunteers. Non-commissioned officers are actually the foundation of naval strength. The glorious war results obtained are due to these non-commissioned officers, who become the hands and feet of the officers, allowing them to conduct battles calmly and accurately, so that they can defeat ten or fifteen enemies with one. The navy has put a lot of research and effort into cultivating these excellent non-commissioned officers.

Tactics call for the benefits of timing, terrain, and people. In the Japanese Navy, the captain is the father and the executive officer is the mother. It is a family on the warship, and life and death are one. The combat power produced by the unity of people enables the inferior to defeat enemies several times their number.

The Nature of Modern Naval Warfare

The fighting spirit of the navy emphasizes the first five minutes and the last five minutes the most. This is what is required by the uniqueness of naval warfare, which is different from land warfare. Until the withdrawal from Guadalcanal in August of last year, it was only about halfway through, and it was actually the opening battle. After the determination of the military force of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to ensure the continued supply for the next stage of battle, Japan seized the enemy's outposts one by one from the base. Its speed and war results have established an unprecedented and great pyramid. In short, the initial purpose was to secure the resources to carry out the war. On the other hand, what was advantageous for Japan was precisely the deprivation of England and the United States' ability to carry out combat. Under Japan's control of the sea and air, it obtained unlimited wartime necessities such as aluminum, oil, rubber, tin, and iron. With this, Japan was able to prepare a system that could win independently in any war production, ensuring the treasure house from the Philippines in the north to Java in the south, from Celebes in the east to the western ... one ... place. At the same time, it meant breaking into another strategic stage.

The second stage of defensive warfare is the battle to enhance combat power. The result of the opening battle was not only to secure military resources, but also to ensure a situation of certain victory and invincibility on the base and strategically. The southern islands played a great role in the enemy's counteroffensive operations. The above-mentioned military resources and strategic advantages were, of course, disadvantages for England and the United States. On the other hand, if the opening battle is further analyzed, Japan and England and the United States have long been hypothetical enemy countries, and have been constantly researching all weapons and tactics, exhausting their secrets, which were fully utilized in the opening battle period. From the enemy's point of view, all of the enemy's main ships before the war were completely sunk, and the various types of ships used in the second stage are new or warships of unknown types.

Before the war, the United States adopted the doctrine of large ships with giant cannons, thinking that a huge fleet was necessary on the vast Pacific Ocean. However, after the end of the war, they deeply realized the serious errors in their shipbuilding policy. Because there are countless islands in the Pacific Ocean. The combat strategy adopted based on all the assumptions established at sea turned out to be that large battleships were not suitable. That island is sometimes more useful than a battleship. It is an unsinkable aircraft carrier. Also, because these islands can be used as important bases and supply points, the United States is now deeply regretting the great mistakes of the war. Their control of the sea and air has been taken away. Countless large and small islands from the Malay Peninsula to the Solomon Islands have now become Japan's unsinkable aircraft carriers, becoming powerful warships, with the advantage of internal operations.

### Going East

— Komatsu Kitamura

From West to East

We know there is a fleet of enemy supply ships! Including three aircraft carriers, far away from the motherland of a certain country, advancing across the ocean. Meanwhile, we take off in our planes and fly east.

I, along with a part of the 〇〇 unit of the British Navy, which holds sway over the Indian Ocean, embark on the final leg of a 3,400-mile voyage. Although this 3,400-mile journey is merely a small distance from one point on Earth to another, it is by no means insignificant. Nevertheless, being so far removed, I cannot help but feel that the distance flown by humans is by no means short.

An American correspondent criticized our army's operations, saying: "The Japanese army has forgotten the concept of distance in its operations."

Engaged in this battle, crossing the equator south, then returning north, traveling hundreds of miles west, and then hundreds of miles east, I deeply feel that our army, forgetting the concept of distance, searches for the enemy, captures the enemy, and begins battle. But before defeating the enemy, the concept of "distance" is deeply imprinted in our minds, and we fight against distance, overcoming it.

I must say that their operational concept uses the forests of Malaya as a shield, and relies on the vastness of the sea, conducting operations in a manner vastly different from our own.

Here, I am reminded of the story of Timur.

The Dutch soldiers defending Timur said:

"The Japanese army is cowardly!"

When asked, "Why?"

"The Japanese army never attacks our heavily fortified positions with barbed wire head-on. They unexpectedly attack us from our sides and rear in the dead of night. This is not a formal battle..."

—This is not idle talk. We are not playing a game or competing; we are at war. We are not playing at war like the British and Americans. This also reveals the difference between their concepts and ours.

Readers have likely read the notes of a naval reporter who flew on a search mission over the distant Indian Ocean!

In those notes, readers can sense how the navy fights against this great "distance" before engaging in battle.

Whether it was the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of Malaya, or the Battle of Java, our army never forgot distance. On the contrary, with the concept of "distance" in mind, we achieved these great victories through the mental strength and mobility to overcome that distance.

I think of the seas I have crossed and the skies I have flown through so far. That sky is indeed a vast sky. That sea is indeed a boundless sea.

On the Waves

"Lights out for battle!"

At sunset, this voice of the sailor on duty is heard throughout the ship.

The windows are completely closed with iron doors, and the window glass is covered with thick blackout curtains. The lights inside the ship must be controlled to the bare minimum.

"It must be cool on a warship sailing on the sea!"

Some might think of saying such a thing, but this is as much of a misconception as saying, "If you go to the sea, you can eat a lot of fish..."

Such a statement is as inappropriate as saying, "If you fly in a plane, you can capture a lot of islands!"

Of course, if you are sailing in the northern seas in winter, it is indeed cool, and you are exposed to fierce cold. But to say "It must be cool!" about sailing with a warship in the southwestern ocean near the equator is simply not true.

"After a day off, I want to drink some unheated sake."

Someone lamented like this.

The sake on ships sailing in the South Sea is completely heated by the scorching heat. Of course, so is the drinking water.

In this place, the heat is no small matter.

During the summer in Tokyo, when we are cooling off in the evening, we often say, "It's so hot, I won't be able to sleep tonight..."

However, the heat of a Tokyo night, though unpleasant, is still bearable. It is completely incomparable to the heat on a warship sailing under the equator.

The iron plates on the ship are directly exposed to the sun and become almost scalding. The heat they absorb is gradually released at night.

In a room with a fan, hot air swirls around the small space. The hot air blows on you, and you sweat like rain. In this situation, you can no longer say it is cool. Your clothes, starting with your undershirt, are completely soaked.

Despite this, you don't want to change. When you have a fever, you drink something to sweat it out and sit on a cushion to sweat. I can't help but think that the sweating is similar to this. If you were to change clothes, you would probably need hundreds of sets! And first of all, because there is a water shortage, you are restricted, and you cannot do that much laundry on the ship.

We also cannot be naked on the ship. Why? Because we are at war. We never know when we might encounter the enemy and have to start fighting. During war, a ship's hull can be hit by torpedoes from enemy ships or submarines at any time. In that case, no one can afford to be caught flying out naked.

Exposed to this oppressive heat, the image of boiling an egg comes to mind. If there were a mind inside the egg, it would be just like the state of a warship sailing under the equator during "battle stations." That is exactly our state of mind.

Looking at it that way, I can't help but have many unfounded associations. Aren't we just like half-boiled eggs?...

When half-boiled, your head droops, you doze off, and you can't lift your head. We endure this suffering in the room, which is truly indescribable.

The passageway is pitch black. The heat from the engine room fills the ship. Because of the location, it is stuffy and you can't see anything.

Now, when going to the toilet, you have to carry a cane, just like an old woman, groping in the darkness with one hand, cautiously taking one step at a time. Sometimes sailors come from the opposite direction, bumping into you as they walk.

"Be careful of the path ahead, don't panic."

When first boarding the ship, you must be aware of this situation, so you study it carefully in your spare time. Although you think you have become familiar with the passageway and won't bump into anyone, you still scrape your skin on the iron threshold at the entrance of the room, or you lose your footing halfway up the ladder, thinking it is already flat ground. This happens often and is not surprising.

In the officers' quarters of a certain type of destroyer, because of the extreme heat, a square hole large enough for one person to pass through was opened in the entrance to the first deck, but it was still unbearably hot inside.

In that officers' quarters, when eating in such extreme heat, your own sweat would fall into your rice bowl.

I use my own sweat as salt to eat rice. Human eyebrows are truly necessary. If we didn't have eyebrows, the sweat on our foreheads would drip into our eyes, and eating a meal would truly blind us. Eyebrows are not only for beauty; they are a necessary distinction between humans and dogs, and are necessary to prevent sweat, just like snow fences along a railroad. I truly marvel at the wonders of creation.

Deck

In the extreme heat, when I ran out onto the deck, the ship's lights were completely extinguished, and it was advancing through the darkness, cleaving the waves.

"Resurrected!" This phrase is quite fitting to say at this moment.

It is truly a realistic escape from the brink of death, so it is truly unspeakable.

Being on a ship and chased by enemy flying fortresses for eight hours, it was only after the enemy planes left that I ran out of the ship's cabin onto the deck, and the wind from the Ceram Sea bathed my whole body. At this moment, it was truly "Resurrected!" Isn't that amazing?

Looking up, the Big Dipper was on the right, and the Southern Cross was on the left, shining beautifully.

Under that magnificent starry sky, the ship sailed straight towards western Yunnan. I gazed at the horizon ahead. There, I saw no ship shadows, no shadows of small islands. However, in my mind, the image of the fleet that first fought in the Indian Ocean already floated up, watching vigilantly, waiting for an opportunity, and the new planes and pilots of the air force at the forward base advancing side by side. Through the narrow deck, I saw shadows under the starlight, and I saw the medical officer and the purser sitting in chairs, unable to sleep due to the heat, enjoying the cool of the night.

The captain and vice-captain stood on the bridge, anxiously watching the front. Since the warship left port, the captain had been moving between the bridge and the rest of the ship, eating meals on the bridge, while staring at the bow and the stern.

In the officers' quarters, the purser, who had been promoted to lieutenant two or three days prior, was being celebrated. Of course, until the destination was reached and the objective completed, the celebration could only be perfunctory. I, along with that unit, saw some things that I am not allowed to freely and fully describe. The people who accompanied me as naval reporters will either report to you the situation of the landing ahead, or describe the details of each battle, or write down the notes of submarines, so I do not want to write such a news report again. I hope you will understand that before I report "important events" to you, I have first written this fragmented article.

That said, I sat down on the purser's empty chair, temporarily escaping the "boiled egg" state of mind. I turned my gaze to look from the shimmering, phosphorescent sea surface to the distant horizon. Of course, my gaze was endless. Eyes that have undergone training are watching the sea. The vigilance against planes and submarines is truly a work of endurance.

"Being torpedoed in a certain area was really terrible!"

Breaking the silence, the purser began to talk about the story of the submarine.

"One torpedo was aimed at the stern, but we dodged it. Another was aimed at the center of the ship, but it sank before it reached us..."

"The torpedo's wake was as clear as could be..."

Before I knew it, the young navigator interjected, then politely walked off to the bridge, his footsteps tapping away.

"But on a submarine, the heat is truly unbearable... First of all, you can't even bring a chair out onto the deck to cool off..."

The medical officer muttered to himself.

Compared to this ship, the submarine is truly scorching. The area of operation for those friendly submarines extends from the distant Indian Ocean to the American coast.

While wiping the sweat from my forearm, I looked at the conning tower and deck slightly exposed above the waves, and thought of the brave posture of that submarine in a certain area.

Is there any place hotter than this? When I went to the sleeping quarters to rest, I thought again of the "boiled egg state of mind." In that extreme heat, people were operating on the sea even further away than this ship, engaged in a great battle....

Flight

I was wearing three layers of military uniform. When I saw the plane I was about to board, the engine was already roaring. Even though I was wearing a short-sleeved, short-trousered anti-exposure suit, in this hot tropical base, I had tied my necktie properly and put on three sets of military uniform. Sweat dripped down, and my undershirt was completely soaked. However, if you fly to an altitude of 3,000 meters, it is unbearably cold, so there are hardships involved in both flying and sailing on a ship.

When I first flew out of the base and looked down at the vast forest area, when crossing the Vietnamese border, I suddenly felt cold, just like when you have a fever. I could barely breathe if I moved slightly. Looking at the altimeter, the needle was pointing near 5,000 meters.

"If you are not a regular passenger, you will of course feel discomfort after crossing 4,000 meters."

Medical Officer U said this, then added:

"Those who feel discomfort at 3,000 meters can be considered unhealthy, while ordinary people generally feel uncomfortable after passing 4,000 meters."

In the air raid on Darwin, Mr. S wanted to take pictures, but accidentally took the oxygen tube out of his mouth, and immediately vomited because of the bad smell. Without rigorous training, it is of course impossible to operate during a high-altitude air raid. Let's look at the young and excellent fighter pilots. The 22-year-old Petty Officer Second Class K, who brought down multiple enemy planes, was on the Burma front at that time. Under the spirit of fierce attack, he resolutely flew low over the airfield and fired, setting one plane on fire. He then fired at another plane hiding in the coconut grove, also setting it on fire. When turning around to fly back, the enemy barbed wire on the ground caught the left wingtip, but he was still able to fly with a part of the barbed wire tangled on the wing. Such a daring, ultra-low-altitude flight, with the ability to safely return even after being caught on an obstacle, is by no means due to "luck" or "miracles" alone.

"When progressing from basic training to advanced training aircraft, your eyesight sometimes changes. Furthermore, when progressing from advanced training aircraft to 〇〇 fighter planes, your eyesight changes again after combat training. This time, when riding the 〇〇 fighter plane, it was completely different... but you become more courageous. Even driving the 〇〇 fighter plane to its limit is quite common."

The world-class battles engaged in by the crews of large long-range bomber squadrons, large fighter squadrons, and large reconnaissance and patrol squadrons are by no means achieved overnight. Step by step, they have reached such greatness through physical and mental training stages. —We think this way.

All training is not something that can be achieved in one go. Petty Officer Second Class K jumped from basic training aircraft to riding the 〇〇 fighter plane and began fighting. Before the battle, the crew members often have concerns about harming themselves, which is obvious.

This situation is not only about airplanes; there is also the same situation in social training. First of all, this situation demonstrates that anything must be learned through constant training. At the same time, it also reveals the dangers involved in "overdoing it."

On the Plane

I quietly sat next to the telegraph operator, my gaze peacefully fixed on the young backs of the pilots who were firmly grasping the controls. Looking out the window, the preceding squadron was clearly floating.

Nearby, in this squadron, including the fighter planes, the individual facial expressions of the crew members were all clearly visible.

Beyond the hazy horizon, on the boundless ocean, an enemy fleet was advancing, attempting to attack our homeland.

While suppressing the intense emotions burning in my chest, I stared intently to see where the several fleets were lurking in this vast ocean. Closing my eyes, my mind could visualize the strength of that enemy fleet—but reopening my eyes, all my eyes could see was the boundless sky and the endless ocean. Yet, in this vast sky and ocean, it is possible to discover the enemy fleet, which is only as big as a tiny speck. Aren't the "eyes" of our navy divine?

I hugged myself in the cold of the high altitude, watching the various measuring instruments and gauges, and working as a navigator. Here, I also saw those same eyes. When I looked at the people on that small ship who were "watching" for a speck in the vast ocean, I saw that same amazement again. This may be divine power. I felt that this was an organic combination of an organization.

The telegraph operator silently brought over the hot meal: "Won't you eat something?"

I accepted it and also gave him candy.

I couldn't help but think of the young soldiers of the paratrooper unit.

The plane I was riding in was one of the planes that dropped the personnel of the first naval paratrooper unit in the history of the Surabaya Sea Battle over the Siliwangi region. That unit was also the unit that landed on Timor Island for the second time in this plane.

Lovely young men!—I always have this affectionate feeling towards the young men of all units. Especially the young soldiers of the paratrooper unit, who are truly cheerful, are the most "top-notch" men I feel. The ship I first took out from the 〇〇 base was filled with countless "healthy children," sturdy soldiers like specimens, which was them.

At first, I didn't know what kind of unit that unit was. From their equipment, from their training on the ship, I felt strange everywhere. Before long, I realized, "Oh! That's it..."

These kind young soldiers often came to my cabin to play, smiling and handing me candy:

"Sir! Won't you eat some?"

They didn't know how to address me—those only in their twenties eventually called me "Sir."

I really enjoyed talking to them.

"Regarding our own deployment and training, we never said a word before. That was truly the hardest thing. ...If we were blamed for our lack of skill, we wouldn't say anything. We completely escaped from death, and now we can safely parachute down. Just wait and see!"...

Raising their eyebrows proudly, they spoke with relish. How sincere they are!

The first time I was bombed by enemy flying fortresses, I was on the same ship as these soldiers. At that time, the strongest feeling in my mind was, "This unit will not be killed here."

I don't think of myself as great, and I don't want to embellish my feelings. It was entirely because of this "life" that I personally experienced this fearless emotion. But when I thought that some of them had already died for their country on the Southern Front, I couldn't help but beat my chest and think silently.

Because of the telegraph operator's kindness in bringing me a hot meal, I thought of the soldiers of the paratrooper unit who were about the same age as the telegraph operator.

Clouds

—The sun has already climbed over our heads and is setting in the west.

Since this morning, the two engines that have been spinning back and forth in the air have not rested at all. On the instrument panel, the speedometer reads 〇〇〇, and the altimeter reads 4,300 meters. Looking at the engine and the silver-basin-like rotating propeller, in front of us are beautiful, ever-changing clouds, and from the gaps in the clouds, we can see the mysterious jewel colors of the large reefs in the ocean. Under our feet appeared strange rainbows, drawing two arcs. —On the white clouds, the shadow of our plane was imprinted in individual circles. In that round, wreath-like shadow... We have already enjoyed several times the magnificent scenery of nature that ancient people did not even know in their dreams.

The magnificent beauty of nature made me forget the position on the battlefield, the pain of being short of breath, and the shivering cold. Several times, a feeling of happiness like ascending to heaven after becoming a celestial being flew through my chest.

But nature not only welcomes us with that kind of beautiful or magnificent posture, but also all kinds of beautiful phenomena in the air, which at any time become obstacles to the operation of the air force.

The light of the setting sun on all sides passed through the sea in a straight line, shining on the eastern sky, and strangely shaped dense clouds cut off the front.

The first squadron lowered its altitude as if it were sinking. Seen from high altitude, it looked like a small boat floating on the surface of the sea.

When we spread out the aviation chart, we knew that we were approaching our destination. And in front of us, there was nothing to be seen, only layers of cloud mountains blocking our way.

Our squadron also lowered its altitude. The nail of the altimeter read three thousand, two thousand, one thousand... We felt quite hot inside the plane.

We saw a burst of heavy rain. The lead-colored clouds had already cut off the sunlight behind us. The sea ahead, which had previously been a single expanse of water and sky, was now filled with layers of white, suffocating clouds.

Don't rush past it—I thought.

Although this cloud had no oxygen, I had never seen a cloud so low. I remembered a time when I had rushed into such a cloud.

—In the "white fog" where you could only make out the things at the wingtips, the sound of the heavy rain covered the engine's roar. The sun was not visible, nor was the ground.

The ever-changing posture of the clouds seen in the clear sky, the magnificence of the rainbow! However, seeing those clouds, that rainbow, and even suddenly breaking into this heavy rain, was only a moment, and the place where we were about to land was blocked. It suddenly turned into a 〇〇 world that played with our emotions and made us tremble.

Before one burst of heavy rain had passed, another burst of heavy rain followed closely behind. The squadron was eager to avoid the dark clouds ahead, tilted its wings, and changed direction.

We could only see a small black shadow of a friendly plane in our squadron. We began to fly high again. The sun began to shine on the wings of the planes from the western horizon again.

Indeed, under those thick clouds, there was a small island, our destination. But our eyes could not see it.

If this were a single plane, it might have rushed into the heavy rain, floated on the sea, and reached its destination, but we were a formed squadron, and the commander's plane seemed to intend not to take the above-mentioned risk unless there was a problem with the fuel.

The squadron was circling, looking for a large gap in the clouds. The navigator began to be surprisingly active, recording the constantly changing position of the plane on the map.

There was no gap in the clouds at all. —Should we fly above the clouds?

If we flew past the destination, which was only a small dot in the ocean, then there would be another vast and boundless sea ahead. The sun was about to set. In another thirty minutes, the light of day would disappear from the sky. The sea was already showing a black color. If the night curtain were to come down... that would mean great difficulty.

If we didn't see the island under these clouds in the next thirty minutes, we would be in considerable danger. I have never felt anything as fast as the Earth's rotation. "Falling sharply," the sun in the sky would "fall sharply" to the horizon like this in thirty minutes.

The navigator looked at me and smiled, tying the knot of the life rope.

I haven't felt a real crisis yet. I didn't say a word. I didn't even look back at our friendly planes. Perhaps it was because I felt at ease after seeing the back of the young pilot holding the control stick?

One Battle

Suddenly, we saw a valley between clouds and clouds in front of us, and the first squadron was like a small sparrow, flying through the active valley. —These clouds might merge and close this valley at any time. But, from this valley, our eyes saw a dark shadow far away on the lead-colored sea.

We flew to that island, and after everyone landed safely, the sky and this isolated island were once again heavily sealed by rain.

"If it had been thirty minutes later..."

That night, after everyone met, they all said the same thing. But as for myself, this cannot yet be said to have been a real crisis. Before this, you received a wireless order on the Pacific Ocean: "Search for the missing plane within a 2,000-meter distance," and you flew towards your destination for three hours. At that time, I really felt hurried in my chest. A certain plane had an engine failure on the side and sent the message, "I may also be one of the missing," and then the message was cut off.

So this flight didn't feel as rushed as the last time. But the feelings I felt in my heart were unexpectedly strong. Can't that be said to be the feeling of comradeship in arms?

This boundless sea, with a missing plane as small as a mustard seed, stirred up various imaginations and stimulated the heart with a feeling of despair. What if I saw... it would never be a plane from the ship. What if I saw the shadows of people on board that I thought were from the missing plane? Would I open my eyes to look at him?

The driver, crew member, navigator, and telegraph operator anxiously opened eight eyes. Staring at the four seas, the sound of the engine dominated time and space. We could not help but encounter human life associated with the life of this engine. The greatness before this nature is more difficult than fighting the enemy. This is another battle posture before battle, fighting with "distance."

Thinking of the Motherland

The homeland was bombed!

Upon receiving the report, we felt that the distant homeland had also become the front. When receiving that report, everyone felt that since the founding of the country, no matter how many wars have been fought, no matter how many people were involved, they had never experienced the situation in this war.

That night, a pale blue crescent moon hung in the southern sky, and a rare cool wind blew from the east. While gazing at that crescent moon, we talked about the homeland with the officers. If the enemy dares to come now, they can be wiped out in one fell swoop!

The focus of our discussion was what impact this air raid would have on the rear.

Of course, this kind of guerilla air raid will not cause any damage to the Japanese army's major operations or great victories.

However, thinking that this is a national all-out war and that the civilians in the rear are also deployed in their respective battle positions, the impact that this air raid has on the civilians can also be considered a very significant one.

"Is the motherland safe?"—Everyone was thinking deeply about this matter. We trust the army to respond calmly and stubbornly. For example, the panic of people who don't understand war and the general public is just making a fuss. Panicking won't defeat the enemy. We only know that we must trust the army and resist stubbornly.

Look! The great achievements of the Battle of the Coral Sea. We were already sure of what the enemy would do after being defeated by our navy. At the same time, the enemy is also planning. Why? The enemy, who wanted to attack the homeland, was probably discovered by us and annihilated in one fell swoop. Therefore, are they not just using a small number of large aircraft to quickly advance and retreat from outside the radius of action of our naval aircraft? This is indeed the American way. Those of you who witnessed this air raid can probably confirm this!

This time, they did not expect the North American B25 to return to the ship. This so-called one-way air raid spirit is very different from the spirit of our navy's attack on Pearl Harbor. You can probably understand this. This is by no means a spirit of desperate annihilation. The spirit of those crew members is certainly incomparable to the spirit of sacrifice of the Pearl Harbor Special Attack Force. They thought that if they left the mother ship, passed over Japan, and arrived in mainland China, their lives would be safe. This is the same gambling spirit as the "warriors" of the American air force in the previous war.

But we must be very wary of their "gambling spirit." They know how generous our group is to prisoners. It is dangerous if they use our generosity to come here. Unlike us, they don't think it is dishonorable to be taken prisoner. Won't they come from even further away than this time with bombs from the summer silkworms, complete their mission, raise both hands, and come down by parachute to surrender?

We must not forget that they are still arrogantly boasting and looking down on us. This time, they brought small, malicious incendiary bombs to make a mess. On the other hand, they also consider Japanese cities to be "small," and we must keep in mind that they have the idea of using those incendiary bombs to burn down our cities. Their conversations never fail to mention war, and we must be wary of their spirit.

On the Southern Front, the first words of an American aviator who was shot down and captured after parachuting down were: "No matter what, please give me a glass of whiskey first." (Translator's note)

### The Full Story of the Naval and Air Battle of Bougainville Island

The great naval and air battle of Bougainville Island, which began in late October, lasted for more than a month until the beginning of December. During this time, the Japanese Navy sank four American battleships, seven aircraft carriers, twelve cruisers, and eleven destroyers, creating the greatest victory since the Pearl Harbor attack. The news of this shook the world. The circumstances of this battle are described below:

Bougainville Island is the largest island in the Solomon Islands and a shield for Rabaul (on New Britain Island), the Japanese southern front naval base. It is located east of New Guinea, west of the British Ellice Islands and the New Hebrides, and north of Australia. These areas are mostly in enemy hands. In terms of location, it is surrounded on three sides by enemy forces and is quite isolated. However, the Japanese army has occupied this location. Since occupying this location, they have made great efforts to consolidate its defensive strength, making it a strong fortress on the southern front, not only threatening Australia but also using it as a base to hinder American transportation and resupply to Australia. Therefore, it is not surprising that the American army is determined to obtain it at any cost, regardless of any tragic sacrifices.

In the southern part of Bougainville Island, the Torokina River flows out to the sea, and the mouth of the river is called Torokina Point. At the river mouth is a steep and majestic island, which is the location the Americans have captured this time. Sixty kilometers south of Bougainville Island is a barren island called Mono, which can be said to be a satellite of Bougainville Island to the south. The American army occupied it during the initial attack. The so-called "Bougainville Island Naval and Air Battle" unfolded on the sea near these two locations.

Before this war began, the American army naturally made sufficient preparations. Over the past two years, the United States has claimed to have built twelve aircraft carriers, totaling 500,000 tons. At the same time, according to news from Berlin, since the Italian navy was lost in the Mediterranean, the British and Americans transferred their navy in that area, including four to five battleships, three to four aircraft carriers, seven to eight heavy cruisers, and more than ten destroyers, to the East to deal with Japan. Therefore, the situation of the Japanese navy in the South Seas before the Battle of Bougainville Island was not very strong in terms of numbers.

Preliminary Battles

The American air raid on Bougainville Island on October 20 can be said to be the prelude to the naval and air battle of Bougainville Island. The attacking American planes numbered only twenty, and as a result, thirteen were shot down. It is clear that this surprise attack was weak and only intended to scout the strength of the Japanese.

Starting on October 22, the American side officially challenged the Japanese garrison on Bougainville Island. In total, from the 22nd to the 25th, over four days, the American side sent 652 planes to bomb Buin, the southernmost tip of Bougainville Island. On the 26th, they dispatched 360 planes in a single sortie for a large-scale bombing.

This surprise attack was actually intended to contain the Japanese forces on Bougainville Island to cover their attempt to land troops on Mono Island. The next morning, it was discovered that American troops had landed on Mono Island.

Mono Island is twelve kilometers long from east to west and eight kilometers wide from north to south. It is a barren island with no inhabitants. After the American army occupied it, Buin, the fortress on the southern tip of Bougainville Island, was greatly threatened. From the morning of the 27th, the Japanese side dispatched naval aircraft to launch a large-scale bombing of the American ships near the landing site, resulting in the sinking of one small transport ship, two cruisers, and one large transport ship. A torpedo sank one small transport ship, and one large cruiser and one small transport ship were damaged. The attacking Japanese aircraft also suffered minor losses.

After the American army established a forward base on Mono Island, they began a large-scale operation at the end of October. Several large transport ships, protected by giant warships, moved towards Bougainville Island from the southeast. No matter how concealed, this kind of large-scale operation could not escape the reconnaissance of Japanese patrol planes. The American attack had three targets: the first was Buka Island, opposite the northern end of Bougainville Island; the second was Torokina Point, in the waist of Bougainville Island; and the third was Stirling Island, between Mono Island and Buin. Armed ships from the south advanced along three routes, with the Torokina Point route being the most important, so the fighting on this route was particularly fierce.

After receiving the report, the Japanese side launched a full-scale counterattack from late night on October 31. East of Mono Island and west of Bougainville Island, large numbers of bombers, torpedo planes, and fighters were dispatched for a desperate attack. At the same time, the Japanese fleet stationed in Rabaul Harbor also set sail south, encountering the American fleet on the sea off Torokina Point. This great battle lasted until the morning of November 2nd. The battle results announced by the Japanese side are as follows:

Naval Air Force Battle Results

Sunk: Two large transport ships
Sunk: One cruiser, one destroyer, over 40 landing craft
Shot down: 10 American planes
Damaged: One large cruiser, one cruiser or destroyer, two large transport ships, many small vessels

Fleet Battle Results

Sunk: One large cruiser, two large destroyers
Sunk: Two large cruisers, one cruiser or large destroyer
Damaged: One to two large cruisers, two destroyers

The Japanese side also lost one destroyer and some aircraft. Another cruiser was damaged.

At the same time as the naval and air battle, the American army landed at Torokina Point on November 1st, and on the 2nd, they landed at Hall Sound to the north. The small island in front of Torokina Point was naturally occupied. The American losses were so severe that even the United States itself did not deny it. It is said that the Japanese army defending the area, facing a superior enemy, killed 1,800 American soldiers in a single bayonet charge.

First Battle

After the naval and air battle on November 1st, the American side desperately reinforced the landing troops and sent out over two hundred (November 2nd) planes to attack the Japanese naval base at Rabaul. Another 135 planes attacked Buka Island. The Japanese side met the challenge and used excellent naval aircraft to confront them. In the Rabaul area, the Japanese land-based anti-aircraft artillery, warships, and aircraft together shot down as many as 201 planes. Very few American planes survived. This can be said to be unprecedented in the history of air combat. In the Buka area, 39 planes were also shot down.

Then came the "First Bougainville Island Air Battle" on November 5th. Learning from the lessons of previous defeats, the American side adopted the so-called "aircraft carrier group" tactics. This time, the fleet centered around two aircraft carriers, each with various warships arranged in two circular formations, with very strict defenses. In addition, aircraft from land bases also flew in to assist, boldly attempting to break through the power of the Japanese air force and seize air supremacy in the Bougainville Island war in one fell swoop. However, this was exactly what the Japanese side had been hoping for. On the evening of the 5th, when the American aircraft carrier group sailed to the sea south of Bougainville Island, Japanese planes suddenly appeared. The results of the attack:

Sunk: One large aircraft carrier
Sunk: One medium-sized aircraft carrier, two large cruisers, two cruisers or destroyers

After November 6th, the land battles continued, and New Britain Island was frequently attacked by American planes. The Japanese army's air force also performed remarkably. From the 6th to the 9th, Japanese planes bombed [gap] New Guinea six times. [gap] shot down a total of 120 [gap] American planes, and also shot down 59 American planes.

Second Battle

On the morning of November 8th, the Japanese [gap] reported that the American [gap] was concentrated at Torokina Point. Large numbers of [gap] fighters and bombers departed in batches. When they discovered that the American [gap] was concentrated in such large numbers [gap] in one place, the Japanese [gap] pilots were excited. In the first wave of Japanese attacks, only five minutes [gap] American [gap] three ships, [gap] four [gap] immediately [gap] thoroughly, and two cruisers and one transport ship were damaged. During the attack, American [gap] fighters flew in to attack, but 15 were shot down. The Japanese fighter [gap] commander, Captain Nōfu, unfortunately [gap] died in this battle.

Originally, the Japanese navy's tactics were different from other countries. The flagship carrying the commander was sure to be the first to break into the enemy formation at the point of engagement. The naval air force's style was also like this.

Captain Nōfu's position was naturally the most vulnerable to attack.

At this time, [gap] the weather gradually worsened. Subsequent Japanese planes departed from the base in flashes of lightning. Batch after batch of suicide squads advanced in the chaos. By the time they reached their destination, it was already evening. The sun set at 4:30 PM in both oceans. By chance, Japanese planes in the [gap] discovered the main force of the fleet in the [gap] retreating at full speed. As soon as the [gap] fired, they braved a barrage of anti-aircraft fire and charged straight down, right up to the American [gap] before launching torpedoes. In an instant, the calm sea erupted with columns of water. Flames roared, and one American battleship caught fire. Two cruisers immediately sank into the sea, and another cruiser and three destroyers caught fire. At this time, the third wave of torpedo planes arrived. After an attack, one of the four burning battleships sank into the sea, and Captain Nosaka, who led the torpedo squadron, also died in battle, following in the footsteps of his predecessors. In total, the Japanese side lost 20 planes in this battle, and besides the two captains, three squadron leaders also died. Conversely, the price obtained was very high, which shows how fierce this battle was.

Sunk: 4 battleships, 3 destroyers, 4 transport ships, 2 cruisers
Damaged: 6 large cruisers severely damaged, 4 cruisers or destroyers severely damaged, 1 large transport ship, 15 aircraft shot down

Third Battle

In order to cover up their defeats, the Americans had to seek revenge again and again. At the same time, the [gap] landing troops also needed [gap] continuous replenishment and resupply, making it impossible for the tiger to stop. On the Japanese side, they considered it a golden opportunity to use relatively less valuable air power to attack high-value fleets, a once-in-a-lifetime opportunity.

On November 11th, the tragedy of mutual bombing occurred. That morning, American aircraft carriers coordinated with land-based air forces to launch over 200 planes in a single sortie to bomb the Japanese naval and air base at Rabaul. The Japanese air force, however, chose to attack the American mobile fleet, focusing on the more valuable targets. In Rabaul, the Japanese sank one destroyer, lightly damaged one cruiser, and lightly damaged one cruiser, losing 10 planes in exchange for 71 American planes. On the other hand, the American fleet west of Mono Island encountered unprecedented bad luck.

The American fleet was divided into two parts. The part centered on aircraft carriers was discovered at noon on the 11th. After a fierce attack by Japanese planes, a cruiser or destroyer was sunk, and two large aircraft carriers were hit by several bombs. Several other cruisers or destroyers caught fire. In the evening, another fleet centered on battleships was discovered sailing north in the sea west of Mono Island. Although the weather [gap] was bad, making it difficult to attack, Japanese planes still inflicted moderate damage on one battleship and severe fire damage on one large cruiser. The Japanese planes also lost 30 aircraft. The results of the battle are as follows:

Sunk: 1 cruiser
Moderately Damaged: 1 battleship
Lightly Damaged: 2 large aircraft carriers
Severely Damaged and on Fire: 1 large cruiser, 3 cruisers or large destroyers, 1 destroyer

Fourth Battle

The Japanese naval planes [gap] were exhausted [gap] and were constantly [gap] returning to base. Sure enough, at 3:00 AM on November 13th, the American fleet [gap] was discovered taking advantage of the darkness of the 12th, centered on [gap] battleships, [gap] and a force consisting of heavy cruisers, light cruisers, and destroyers [gap] was advancing from the east towards the Japanese base at Rabaul and had already reached [gap] the [gap] waters off Mono Island.

The Japanese planes [gap] immediately targeted battleships and aircraft carriers, launching a fierce [gap] attack with torpedo planes. Before long, [gap] one battleship was severely damaged. Smoke billowed from the stern, and a fire broke out. The speed was greatly reduced, and it was almost dying. At the same time, a major fire broke out on the aircraft carrier, and it was almost sinking. Although the Japanese side did not [gap] include it in the list of sunken [gap], it was estimated that it was very likely to sink. On the right, one large and one small cruiser were sunk, and one destroyer was hit by a torpedo. However, two Japanese planes also made [gap] a costly sacrifice.

A special feature of this air battle was that naval aircraft carried out the most difficult night attacks and torpedo warfare. It was really difficult to [gap] attack the enemy at night. Relying only on the faint trail left by the passing fleet on the sea, finding and tracking these trails required flying the plane so low that it almost touched the surface of the sea. One careless move would mean joining the sea creatures. As for the attack, it required skills of a divine nature. This skill was the result of years of training by the Japanese naval air force. The results of the fourth air battle are as follows:

Sunk: 1 large cruiser
Sunk: 1 cruiser
Sunk: 1 destroyer
Severely Damaged: 1 battleship, 1 medium-sized aircraft carrier

Fifth Battle

The nature of the Fifth Bougainville Island Naval Air Battle was the same as the first battle, but the results were even greater. Only the South Pacific Naval Battle on October 26 of last year, in which Japan sank three American [gap] aircraft carriers in one fell swoop, can be compared. The American's stubborn tactics of not [gap] fearing sacrifices were seen as foolish by the Japanese, who were accustomed to exchanging the least sacrifices for the greatest gains. This was probably because the United States had too abundant resources.

Before dawn on the 17th, a powerful American fleet, based on three aircraft carriers and accompanied by cruisers and other ships, was discovered again several tens of nautical miles south of Bougainville Island. The Japanese "sea [gap]" once again demonstrated their "capture" tactics and established remarkable results:

Large [gap] aircraft carrier: 1
Medium [gap] aircraft carriers: 2
Cruisers: 3
Large [gap] warship (type [gap] unknown): 1

At the same time as the above [gap] attack, Japan [gap] also sent out fighter squadrons and bomber squadrons to attack the American landing [gap] fleet at Torokina Point. [Gap] There were thirty fighters [gap] protecting the fleet's sky. When the Japanese fighters attacked, the [gap] torpedo [gap] bombers [gap] swarmed up, [gap] [gap], but after returning with achievements, they were unfortunately pursued by about a hundred American fighters, resulting in the loss of ten planes. The results of this battle were:

Sunk: 3 small to medium-sized transport ships
Damaged: 1 small transport ship
On Fire: 1 destroyer

At that time, Japan [gap] [gap] [gap] sixth [gap] [gap] the great battle [gap] [gap] said in December [gap] [gap] south, [gap] [gap] navigation [gap] ships 2, battleship or large [gap] ship 1, large cruiser [gap], sunk aircraft carrier 1, in addition [gap] one on fire severely damaged, large [gap] [gap] and [gap] [gap] one severely damaged.

A Calculation

Not yet finished, the Japanese navy's traditional [gap] [gap] the spirit of overcoming the enemy [gap] is competing with America's bean-sized production capacity [gap] [gap]. Both [gap] will become popular in the future [gap] remarkable military exploits, it seems that [gap] it has been decided that the Japanese [gap] are waiting, we estimate the known results, make a battle statistics, [gap] in order to estimate what kind of heavy losses the United States has suffered, how much strength is still left, it is not without meaning.

In total, 93 warships were lost and damaged on both sides, not including small boats. 576 American planes were shot down, and 16 were damaged. In addition, one destroyer caught fire due to a misunderstanding. Except for two Japanese cruisers and two destroyers sunk, and two cruisers damaged, only a few planes were sacrificed.

Looking at it from another angle, since the battle near Mono Island at the end of October, how many trained sailors has the United States lost, and how many warships have been built [gap] [gap] the bottom of the sea [gap] [gap]. According to the calculations of Japanese intelligence officer Iguchi, based on the above table:

(Note) Only sinking and destroying are counted, repair costs for damage are not included.

From the end of October to the beginning of December, in just over a month, in a corner of the vast South Sea, in an area of hundreds of miles, more than 20,000 American soldiers silently and silently rest forever on the seabed. Giant ships costing nearly 700 million [currency] or more sank to become scrap iron on the seabed. The ferocity of the battle and the bravery of the Japanese army can be imagined.

Explanation of the Bougainville Island Terrain Map

Bougainville Island, which has become famous due to this battle, is one of the islands at the northwestern end of the Solomon Islands. It was discovered in 1768 by the Frenchman Bougainville during his circumnavigation of the world. The island has an area of 10,000 square kilometers and is the largest of the Solomon Islands. Except for the capital, [gap] Roki Cape, in the east [gap], it is a humid swamp. The 30,000 inhabitants are divided into Melanesians and Papuan mountain [gap] tribes living in remote areas of the island.

### After the Pearl Harbor Air Raid

Time flies, and today, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, marks the third December 8th. On this second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, I cannot help but recall the fierce battle at Pearl Harbor on the day the war began. Pearl Harbor was the largest naval base for the U.S. in the Pacific. Various reports have been made about the fierce fighting at the time, but this article is a recent record of what was personally witnessed by Japanese residents in the U.S. and the Soviet Union. It is specially translated below for our readers. - Translator's Note

It Was a Real Attack

Overhead, a formation of Boeing B17s flew towards Wheeler Airfield. This was the reinforcement force that had been arriving daily from the U.S. mainland since that December 8th (Hawaii time was the 7th). Why was this type of top-secret military movement being carried out in broad daylight? It turns out that around 8 p.m. on the night after the heroic battle, a formation of nineteen Boeing B17s had rushed to reinforce from San Diego. Unexpectedly, they were mistaken by the ground forces at Pearl Harbor as Japanese planes returning to attack, so they fired anti-aircraft guns wildly, almost completely destroying all nineteen American planes. The American airmen on the planes, after receiving the "welcome" of the anti-aircraft guns, thought that Pearl Harbor had already been occupied by the Japanese army. They dropped all the bombs they were carrying, resulting in a rather serious and laughable situation. Since then, air transport has been conducted during the day. My wife and I, under the shade of guava trees, chased the planes along a small path from the Aiea Heights towards Punchbowl Crater, hoping to see the heroic sacrifice of our motherland's warriors at Pearl Harbor. Panting on the steep slope, we looked at the green waves of Pearl Harbor and silently prayed for the victory of our motherland. This was the morning of the third day after the Japanese air raid on Pearl Harbor. In order to witness the relics of the bloody battle and to imprint the war achievements in our minds, we disregarded the curfew that prohibited going out from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. and climbed the hills north of Aiea in the early morning to look down and survey the Waikiki coast, the city of Honolulu, and the Pearl Harbor area in all directions.

On the morning of December 8th, I had just finished breakfast when I heard my child shout, "Planes with the Hinomaru flag!" I was puffing on my pipe, watching the blue smoke leisurely rise into the blue sky, which had been cleansed by the wind and rain of the previous night, enjoying myself immensely. At that time, not only myself, but anyone living in Oahu would have answered, "It's a drill!" However, a few minutes later, a distant, rumbling sound came from afar, and it grew louder and louder. At that moment, I suddenly felt a strange sensation, as if a bug was quickly crawling down my spine.

I immediately went to the radio, and with trembling hands, I turned the dial to K·G·U· station, and then to K·G·M·B· station. Immediately, I heard the radio station shouting, "Pearl Harbor is under attack by the Japanese army. It's a real attack!"

"It's a real attack!" Ah, is this not a dream? Ever since I landed in Hawaii, whenever I was oppressed by the American authorities, I would imagine such a scene in my mind. I never thought it would actually come true! I gazed from the veranda at the plumes of black smoke rising up, and saw bean-sized objects diving in formation into the smoke, drawing circles like silk threads in mid-air, presenting a magnificent picture against the backdrop of the blue sky. It was indeed wonderfully beautiful.

I don't know how much time had passed when the radio began calling for doctors and nurses. Hearing this call, I realized the seriousness of the situation. Especially when I heard the call for undertakers, I couldn't help but laugh.

The streets were extremely chaotic. I tried to call my friends, but I couldn't get through. In my anxiety, I waited until noon when Mr. K from the Japanese language school came to inquire about the news with several extra editions of newspapers. According to him, in the Honolulu city area, more than a dozen Japanese people had been hit by shrapnel from anti-aircraft shells. Some had died from their injuries, and some, though not killed, had suffered serious wounds. He also told me that the Hickam and Kaneohe airfields had been completely destroyed, and the warships had suffered heavy losses.

I spent the day in fear and anxiety. At night, I heard the sound of explosions, and I thought to myself, "Could the Japanese army have landed?" Because there were many rumors at the time, such as Japanese paratroopers landing and submarines infiltrating the naval base, they sounded very believable. I believed them too, until later when I found out that only the news of submarines infiltrating the naval base was true. The next morning, amid the sound of military trucks speeding by, the sky gradually brightened.

Many eyewitnesses were recounting the events of the time to each other. What touched me the most was what Mr. M's servant boy said. He said that he had witnessed a Japanese plane self-destructing in Pacific Heights. The wings were gone, and the fuselage was charred. Inside, several oil-covered airmen were lying there, as if protecting each other. One of the warriors was still tightly clutching his military sword. Saying this, the servant boy said, as if very surprised, "They didn't even have parachutes!" We were deeply moved by the noble spirit of the Japanese soldiers, and we couldn't help but shed tears. Later, we heard that the naval base was still searching for Japanese special submarines, and at the same time, they began to collect the dead from the destroyed American warships.

The next morning (the 10th), my wife and I climbed Aiea Heights. Because the Waiawa Ridge blocked the view, we couldn't see Wheeler Field, but we could still see thin smoke rising from that area. Look! Pearl Harbor! Where has the American Pacific Fleet, which proudly dominated that area four days ago, gone now? It doesn't look like they are leaving the harbor to attack! Look! Isn't that the wreckage of overturned battleships over there? Those moving back and forth are all small boats. At the net barrier! The mouth of the bay, there are several ships that seem to be destroyers, dropping depth charges. Water columns are rising up, and soon, the rumbling sound is heard continuously. Looking elsewhere, it seems as if the world-shaking battle of two days ago had never happened. The scenery is peaceful and unchanged. Just as I was sinking into endless emotion, my wife suddenly sobbed, "Under that water..." Watching Pearl Harbor under the guava trees, we couldn't help but have tears streaming down our faces like a spring. We bowed to the most honorable people of Japan and unconsciously knelt on the ground, putting our palms together. My wife's and my hands, without knowing when, were tightly gripping the leaves, turning our hands green. (Written by M., a construction contractor)

Cheering "Banzai" in a Low Voice by the Radio

It was truly an amazing thing. Since the Japanese army attacked Pearl Harbor, within about a month, the attitude of the average American towards the Japanese had become extremely intimate. At first, we didn't understand their true intentions and felt a little uneasy. Later, we realized that they were doing this in the hope that we would consider them pro-Japanese elements when the Japanese army landed in Hawaii. On the evening of December 8th, of course, and even for the next two or three days, Honolulu was in complete chaos. At that time, Christmas was already very close. If it were in previous years, the large Christmas tree at the Liberty House department store on Fort Street would have been a sensation, but this year, no one cared about it. Originally, this Christmas tree was specially shipped from the U.S. mainland, being the largest one. In this Hawaii, where there is no winter, it allowed people to experience the feeling of winter, attracting a lot of attention from the local residents. However, at this time, the most anxious thing for the citizens of Honolulu was food. They no longer had the leisure and elegance of the past, and everyone rushed to the food stores. Women were carrying in their hands and under their arms large and small packages of salted meat, ham, canned food, and all kinds of other foods. From the large food companies on Fort Street and King Street to the Weigert food chains, which were almost on every street corner in Honolulu, all were crowded with customers. In just a few hours, the goods in these stores were sold out as if swept away by a whirlwind, but people were still coming in droves, forcing the shopkeepers to close the iron gates, leaving the crowds who had not yet bought food to make a commotion outside.

From the day of the bombing, martial law was declared, and citizens were prohibited from going out from 6 p.m. to 8 a.m. The blackout was also enforced extremely strictly. If even the slightest glimmer of light shone out from a covered light inside a house, the patrolmen outside would open fire with their pistols. Countless families experienced this situation, especially when they were going to bed. Moreover, the patrolmen never gave a warning before shooting. Therefore, the general public spent their days trembling in terror.

After a few days, the fear of a Japanese landing gradually subsided, and the oppression of the local Japanese residents gradually intensified. The number of Japanese residents who were designated as the Japanese Fifth Column and detained by the FBI increased daily. The FBI was located in the Dillingham Building, a three-story Spanish-style building. Guards with loaded rifles prevented Japanese people from approaching the lawn in front of it. If you wanted to enter this building, the only way was to be escorted from your home by American soldiers with loaded rifles. For example, Mr. H, who was originally from Hongwanji temple, was one of them. Mr. H was immediately arrested because his servant secretly informed the authorities that he had been eagerly listening to the radio the day before the bombing. He was personally transferred by the FBI to G2 (the U.S. Army's intelligence agency) and the naval intelligence department. He was detained for three weeks before being allowed to return home. At the same time, the American authorities also began to detain influential members of the Japanese community. Sand Island in Honolulu Bay was suddenly crowded with Japanese people, but on the other hand, Honolulu was gradually feeling a shortage of manpower, and the state of panic was increasing. Originally, almost all the local carpenters and agricultural workers were Japanese, and carpenters were needed everywhere to repair the destroyed buildings and expand the fortifications. Therefore, even carpenters with mediocre skills could earn around $300 a month at that time. The prices of vegetables and fruits also increased seven or eight times due to transportation difficulties and other reasons. Furthermore, due to the expansion of the army and navy and the procurement of their supplies, prices rose even higher. In order to accommodate American soldiers, starting from the 9th, Japanese middle schools, elementary schools, and other private Japanese language schools affiliated with the Hongwanji temple system were ordered to suspend classes and evacuate, and the schools were converted into barracks. Fish were also in short supply because Japanese fishermen, who made up the largest number of fishermen on the island, were prohibited from going out to sea to fish, causing great hardship for the lower-class citizens.

In this monotonous life, the only comfort was listening to the good news broadcast from our homeland on the radio. Although Japanese residents were not allowed to use shortwave radios, we still used all sorts of means to secretly listen, or else we would go to the homes of second-generation Japanese-Americans to hear the voices of Japan. Not only Japanese residents were doing this, but also Americans. What was the reason for this? It turned out that they had no place to go for entertainment. Waikiki Beach, known as the world's best swimming beach, was off-limits to the general public. Not only that, but the entire coast of Oahu Island was fenced off with five or six layers of barbed wire. Swimming was out of the question. As for mountain climbing, from the Diamond Head fortress area to the highlands around Nuuanu Pali, where the Kaneohe Naval Air Station could be seen, all were forbidden to enter. As for watching movies, there was only one daytime showing. The large open-air movie theaters in Waikiki, such as the Princess Theatre and the Queen Theatre, squatted in the dark like monsters at night, without a single person. Therefore, they had no choice but to keep the radio as their companion. Because the news broadcast by Japan matched the words of the Americans who witnessed the air raid on Hawaii, the general public was very trusting. It was only natural that both Americans and Japanese, regardless of being enemies or friends, were waiting for the Japanese broadcast.

When we heard the reports of the naval battle off the coast of Malaya and the fall of Singapore, we shed tears of emotion countless times, and at the same time, we shouted "Banzai" in a low voice countless times. (Written by Mr. 〇, a Japanese language school teacher) (Translated by Yoshi: Translated from the November 26th and 27th issues of the Mainichi Shimbun)

### Gilbert Islands

— War Memoirs

When I heard about the great victories in the Gilbert Islands and the news of the American landing on Makin and Tarawa, my blood boiled. I recalled the dawn of August 17th last year when I learned of the landing on Makin Island at the southern base, and I went to bomb with the "Eagle Warriors". From the end of October to the beginning of November two months later, I stayed on those islands for ten days. As a member of the naval press corps, I flew around the islands for a week and saw the strong defense of the sea, land, and air forces united as one. I felt boundless trust. Now, the air force warriors are probably fighting bravely.

The Gilbert Islands Situation

The Gilbert Islands, with Little Makin, 260 miles southeast of the Marshall Islands, as its northernmost point, consist of sixteen islands, including Makin and Tarawa, spread out from north to south. Their position is like a sharp dagger aimed at the enemy's blood transfusion route connecting the U.S. and Australia. They are a militarily important stronghold, but economically, they have no value other than copra. The reason why this archipelago became a British protectorate in 1917 was simply because Britain wanted to suppress the Marshall Islands. Today, it is understandable that the British and Americans are using a large fleet to recapture these islands, considering history.

This may be the enemy's desperate act after suffering successive defeats on Bougainville Island, but in any case, after failing in the landing operation last August, they did not give up and still vainly attempted to recapture the lost territory. Therefore, this area will also become a decisive battlefield.

Tarawa is the seat of the British Gilbert Islands administration, which can be reached in 0 minutes by plane from Makin. The shape of the island resembles a reclining monkey. The part corresponding to the monkey's foot is Betio Island, which has government offices, a post office, a radio station, a central hospital, a church, etc.; to the east is Bairiki Island, which has King George V School; the north shore is a calm inland sea with a large pier protruding into it.

Makin Island is the second most important island after Tarawa in terms of administration. The British have a district officer stationed on the island. This island is long and narrow in the northeast. At the central part of the island, the width is only about 300 meters. Last year's Makin operation was carried out in its eastern part, the battlefield being an area with lush coconut trees.

Same Skin Color

The indigenous people of the two islands total 0,000. They sincerely welcomed the Japanese army's landing, saying in broken English, "You me same skin" (You and I have the same skin color). During the Battle of Makin, the Kia family, who were carpenters, all helped the Japanese army carry bullets and stretchers for the wounded. The other islanders also assisted the Japanese army in the same way, and they bowed and thanked the Japanese army morning and evening. They will work with the Japanese army as brothers and sisters to destroy the American army. The only Japanese resident in the Gilbert Islands, Chojiro Kanzaki (originally from Tateishihara-cho, Fujisawa City), often said, "As long as I see the magnificent appearance of the Imperial Army, I can die at any time." The current victories will make him, who has spent thirty years on a remote island in the South Seas since 1923, weep with gratitude.

On this island, there are no dense forests or mines like those in the Solomon Islands or New Guinea. There are only scattered coconut groves and breadfruit trees, dotted everywhere. It is such a flat island that is only a few meters above sea level.

Here, the situation of the war should be as it is now. At the same time, I cannot help but recall the smiling faces of the Japanese soldiers I saw when I left the island. At that time, they smiled at me and said, "As long as we are still alive, we will never let Roosevelt and Churchill smile even for one day."

### The Collapsing British Empire: Barely Surviving by Relying on Four Forces

As we commemorate the second anniversary of the Greater East Asia War, we can more clearly feel the magnitude of the war's impact on the disintegration of the British Empire. Furthermore, it has accelerated the decline of the British Empire. After France surrendered, Britain continued its isolated and unsupported resistance. The start of the German-Soviet war provided a brief respite, but unexpectedly, the Greater East Asia War erupted. The fall of Hong Kong and Singapore successively shattered the British Empire's defense system. The remaining India, influenced by Japanese victories, launched a large-scale anti-British movement. Even today, there is a view that the British Empire should be completely shattered. The tenacious British are now desperately trying to extricate themselves from this predicament. However, the post-war Britain not only needs to resist external military threats but must also continue to fight against various internal hostile forces that politically erode and devour the British Empire. This means that due to the outbreak of this war, the British Empire's lack of independent defense capabilities has become very clear. Britain today relies on the assistance of its Dominions, labor, the United States, and the Soviet Union, these four major forces, to barely survive. While these four forces are Britain's greatest allies in this critical moment, they are also extremely dangerous semi-hostile forces that seek to devour the British Empire. Britain's resistance is akin to a mad dance on the edge of a volcano.

The Defection of the Dominions

The earliest and most loyal supporters of Britain's resistance were its self-governing colonies. Britain, with its meager resources of materials and manpower, would have been unable to continue the war without the help of its territories. However, while Britain relied on the strength of its colonies to fight the war, the proportion of each colony in the British Empire's war effort increased as the war dragged on. Almost all the colonies became creditors to the British homeland, effectively reversing the roles of host and guest. Under such circumstances, even disregarding the anti-British Boers in South Africa, the Indian national movement, and the French-speaking population in Canada, it is only natural that Britain's colonies, especially the self-governing Dominions, show an increasing tendency towards independence and defection. The recent British Empire Aviation Conference held in London best demonstrates this trend. On one hand, the Dominions each demand their own special rights and interests; on the other hand, they refuse to accept matters entrusted by the home government. This situation has undermined the conditions for competing with foreign countries as a unified British Empire and clearly demonstrates the difficulty of rebuilding the pre-war Ottawa Agreement's cooperative structure. Therefore, in the current situation where other countries have not yet intervened, the Dominions can be said to be the most peaceful "enemies" of Britain.

Labor Class Resentment

Second only to the Dominions in supporting Britain's resistance is the British labor class. Churchill's formation of a cabinet and the outbreak of the German-Soviet war completely turned them towards supporting the war. However, there was no complete consensus between them and the government regarding the direction of the war. A wide gulf still separated them. For example, when Britain was in dire straits due to the fall of Singapore, anti-government movements centered on the labor class immediately surged, bringing the Churchill cabinet to the brink of collapse twice. From that time until the Indian rebellion in the summer and autumn of the same year and the North African landings in November, the British cabinet endured the greatest hardships of this war. This suffering was endured by blindly flattering and following the labor class.

That is to say, while welcoming Cripps into the wartime cabinet, while issuing blank checks to the Soviet Union for opening a second front, and while ordering the enactment of the Beveridge insurance plan, it certainly looked like a "Kerensky regime" was being established centered on Cripps. However, once India was suppressed and the North African landings were successful, Churchill immediately changed his attitude. Less than ten days after the North African landings, Cripps was squeezed out of the wartime cabinet, and Churchill loudly proclaimed, "I did not become Prime Minister to liquidate the British Empire!" This also happened around the time of the successful landings in North Africa. In early December, while the labor class had high expectations for wages, the immediate implementation of the Beveridge Plan was announced, thereby triggering internal divisions within the labor class over whether to reject the immediate implementation of certain provisions or demand their postponement. In this way, Churchill's work of dividing the labor class was successful. However, the labor class, dissatisfied with the government, has become increasingly radical. Therefore, as the war develops, especially with the changes in relations with the Soviet Union, it is difficult to predict the direction of the British labor class.

The Rightward Shift of the Cabinet

The most noteworthy measure taken by Churchill to counter this situation is the rightward shift of the cabinet. The two recent cabinet reshuffles have already established the absolute dominance of the Conservative Party in the wartime cabinet, and the trend towards the right is very obvious. Related to the rightward shift of the cabinet, and something we cannot ignore, is that while the British upper class loudly proclaims the overthrow of fascism, they are actually moving towards fascism themselves. Abandoning 19th-century democracy and adopting the idea of new democracy has become a new concept growing in Britain today. The content of so-called new democracy, namely dedication to the state, control of the economy, and the social policies resulting therefrom, clearly has the characteristics of a transitional product with fascist ideals. Conservative Party theorist Professor Carr has commented on the relationship between Hitler and new democracy, claiming that it is similar to the relationship between Napoleon, who spread the gospel of liberalism by force, and liberalism. As for the recent release of British fascist leader Mosley, although the reason given was that he was ill and unable to continue imprisonment, it is probably not entirely unrelated to this trend.

In this way, although the British labor class is currently prone to division, the radicalization of the labor class is always a prominent phenomenon in wartime. Therefore, in this war, large-scale domestic struggles will inevitably arise, which cannot be compared to those of the previous war. This observation is unlikely to be wrong.

American Plunder of Britain

Even more terrifying than the above threats is the American plan of annexation, which is currently underway in secret. In terms of resources, in terms of sea and air routes, and in terms of military strength, Britain is completely overwhelmed by the United States. American bases have been established in every strategic location of the British Empire, and the British Empire has been incorporated into the American defense system. One of the purposes of America's participation in the war is to "inherit the legacy of the British Empire." This is common knowledge. However, the specific form in which it will be carried out is a very subtle issue. Currently, the American attitude towards Britain already shows various anomalies. First, there is the bold and reckless theory of immediately merging Britain. Second, there is the theory of an American-British alliance, which has recently become a problem in powerful circles. This is advocated by New York Governor Dewey, the Republican Party's most powerful candidate for the succession. Third, there is Willkie's attitude: excluding Britain from interfering in American politics to support President Roosevelt; criticizing stubborn British imperialism; and valuing the Soviet Union more than Britain. Fourth, and most peculiarly, the pre-war isolationists have now become "defense imperialists." Using the defense of the United States as a pretext, they adopt a robber-like attitude of "plotting for wealth and harming life" towards Britain. For example, while they also advocate giving Japan the strongest blow, they also take advantage of Britain, inch by inch, to steal British bases, resources, and territories.

However, the American authorities' attitude towards Britain is even more insidious. Considering the overall situation, immediately dismantling the British Empire could cause great disadvantages and confusion for America's national defense and its ambition to dominate the world. Therefore, on the surface, they support the British Empire as much as possible, while gradually eroding British territorial interests in secret. For example, regarding the Indian issue, because Willkie seemed to favor the Indian National Congress, the American authorities prohibited him from entering India. The reason why the American authorities did this is that they support Britain's policy towards India on the premise of maintaining the British Empire. As a result, if the American authorities' current policy can be successfully implemented, then just as Britain today dominates its self-governing Dominions and other territories, will the United States not be able to dominate Britain in the future?

The Soviet Threat

Finally, we must discuss the Soviet Union, the force assisting Britain. There are many interesting similarities and differences between the Soviet Union's relationship with Britain and that of the United States. The similarities and differences between the elements of Soviet aid to Britain are compared below:

American aid to Britain is voluntary, while Soviet aid to Britain is to continue the war against Germany.

The United States cares about British territories, while the Soviet Union pays attention to the British homeland. Therefore, when the Soviet Union exerts its "semi-hostile" nature towards Britain, Britain will fall into the greatest danger, because the United States uses financial power as its main weapon, while the Soviet Union uses ideological power.

The United States, as a "semi-hostile force" towards Britain, attempts to gradually seize the British Empire while maintaining it, but the Soviet Union's hostility is even stronger, and it has the potential to use its red tentacles to shatter both the British homeland and the British Empire.

Britain's anxiety about the Soviet Union's advance into Europe is well-known. Regarding Poland, the Balkans, and other Eastern and Southeastern European issues, Central European issues, and Mediterranean issues, it already seems that everything has been defeated by the Soviet offensive. If this continues, Britain will have no place to stand. Although Britain has not yet launched an effective counterattack against the Soviet Union and pretends to be a mediator between the United States and the Soviet Union, there are already sufficient elements in Britain's policy that hint at a change in its attitude towards the Soviet Union, and it is likely to be clearly demonstrated during the opening of the second front. As for the degree and form, it will of course be mostly governed by the situation at the time. However, if Britain's attitude changes drastically, then the Soviet Union's counterattack will also be strong. In order to effectively counter the Soviet Union, whether it wants to or not, Britain will probably have to go deeper under American protection and become a sacrifice to American ambitions.

In summary, although Britain is desperately struggling to save itself, in this struggle, the "semi-hostile forces" are gaining ground step by step, and in the end, it will inevitably be devoured.

Intensifying Military Threats

On the other hand, the military threats imposed on Britain from the outside itself do not allow Britain to be optimistic about its future. Although the Axis powers currently seem to be adopting a defensive strategy as their basic strategy, they are also engaging in offensives within the defense, and the sharp edge of their offensives, whether from Germany or Japan, is aimed at the British Empire, making it their common target. For example, while the German army is adopting a defensive strategy on the main Eastern front, it is continuing to launch strong counterattacks and is also carrying out large-scale retreats from time to time. However, in this move to reorganize the Eastern front, there is the possibility of carrying out retaliatory bombing against Britain and other offensives against the British homeland. This is acknowledged by anti-Axis military experts. President Hitler also clearly stated in his speech on the anniversary of the previous Nazi uprising: "Even if we cannot reach America... there is one country within our reach, and we will resolutely act against it." This was of course directed at Britain. On the other hand, Japan in East Asia is also taking an offensive in its defensive posture on today's main battlefield, and it is clear that Japan's defense contains a great offensive. For example, while British Indian Army Commander Auchinleck dismisses the possibility of an offensive in Burma, Indian Provisional Government Chairman Bose is shouting "Advance on Delhi!" Germany's target is the stronghold of the British Empire, while Japan's target is the pillar of the British Empire, India. As the saying goes, "If the skin is gone, what will the hair cling to?" If the British homeland falls, there will naturally be no British India, but if India defects, the British Empire will also lose its substance.

Of course, we cannot currently discern when the final offensive to decisively battle Britain will be launched. However, it is indeed very interesting that one of the major goals of the Axis powers is to overthrow the British Empire. At present, whether the anti-Axis offensive can be shattered and whether the overthrow of the British Empire can succeed seems to have become the key to victory or defeat in this war.

### Mine Warfare Flotilla: Pioneering Supply Routes —Completing a Non-Mandatory Mission—

Our boat, with the naval ensign fluttering at its stern, was amidst the mine warfare flotilla, busy preparing to set sail. From one warship, it rowed to another. As it approached the side, young officers, one or two at a time, climbed from the boat onto the warship's ladder. Watching the figures of the officers climbing the ladder, we shouted, "Goodbye! Good luck!" while waving our hats with our right hands. As soon as the boat left the side, the sailors who had briefly stopped working to rest responded to our farewell, all desperately waving their naval caps. Finally, our boat pulled alongside the destroyer 〇〇. This time, it was our turn to be seen off. A crew member of the sweaty motorboat said:

—When this ship returns to port, we'll be the first to greet you. This is the luckiest ship. Since the Guadalcanal campaign, I don't know how many times it has gone to war, but it has always returned safely, so this time it will definitely be okay.

—Okay, goodbye! Thank you for everything!

—Well then, I wish you a safe journey!

These words of wishing the other party success and a safe journey were deeply etched on the hearts of those being seen off. The sincerity and enthusiasm of those seeing them off were fully expressed in them. There were truly no better words to be found.

Climbing aboard the destroyer 〇〇, the inside of the ship was bustling with activity. On this ship were army soldiers being sent to 〇〇 Island, supplies to replenish the front-line troops, and sailors mixed in between, scurrying back and forth. The deck was full. The army soldiers were very careful, trying not to do anything that would bother others, talking in groups behind the turrets and beside the ventilators. A smell of sweat and leather floated out of the cabins, a strange and unfamiliar smell that warships had never had before. The sailors ran over to the army soldiers and seemed to be talking very warmly, even taking care of them.

Observing the Sea

On the bridge, Captain 〇〇 and Navigator 〇〇 were studying the course on a chart with a compass. The lookout, with both hands on a pair of large binocular telescopes, although beads of sweat the size of soybeans were flowing down his forehead, was still observing intently. For some reason, this place was very quiet. The senior officer who was leading us said:

—Captain! The passengers have all been accommodated.

—Ah, well done! Then refuel and prepare to leave port on schedule! Communications officer, signal 〇〇!

Then the captain swiftly issued orders and immediately weighed anchor to proceed to the fueling ship. The captain finally came to us, apologizing and wiping his sweat, saying:

Our ship is going to 〇〇 this time for the 〇th time, but this time we plan to sail into the middle of 〇〇 Bay. It is said that the enemy aircraft have scattered mines in the harbor, so maybe there won't be any problems. We will arrive at Buin at 〇 o'clock tomorrow morning, and at 〇〇, maybe around 〇 o'clock in the evening. Malaria is very rampant in 〇〇, so be careful! Well then, this is my welcome speech. Go to the officers' mess and have some soda!

Because it was time to leave port, the captain seemed very busy. As we walked down from the bridge, we saw the senior officer, and the captain made a steering gesture, saying that this was really good. The captain said to tell everyone about the time when he was transporting with the same 〇〇 and was bombed by enemy aircraft, how he saw black bead-like bombs leaving the enemy aircraft and skillfully turned the rudder. The senior officer said that maybe it would happen again this time, but as long as it was the same captain, it would be okay. When the enemy's bombs were dodged by about thirty meters and fell into the sea, that was truly indescribably exhilarating. The senior officer said this, looking at us with an expression of great trust in the captain.

Our ship had unknowingly pulled alongside the fueling ship, sucking up heavy oil through a thick rubber hose. The sun was gradually setting in the west, and the naval aircraft that had set out this morning returned in neat formations. The air wing that had set out based on the news that enemy ships were concentrated near Lunga Point on Guadalcanal Island had just returned. One or two were missing from the formation; perhaps they were kamikaze planes! Although fighting was commonplace, today seemed particularly fierce. Naval aircraft landed on our ship, rumbling, one after another.

Last night we felt a strong earthquake on land. The more the earth shakes violently, the more intense the war becomes. This was 〇 days before the enemy landed on Rentaba Island, when the destroyer 〇〇, together with other friendly ships, ventured into an area under enemy air control to attack. In an instant, the ship gently swayed and set off. From then on, neither the captain nor the soldiers would be able to sleep or rest day and night. They would not only have to fight against enemy aircraft and enemy submarines but also against waterways full of coral reefs. From then on, they would only sail at a speed of 〇〇 knots, silently praying that they would complete the 〇〇 mission and launch a major operation. The sun sank into the sea, and the surroundings were all dark. Those seeing the ship off could only see the scattered lights of the signal lamps on the lookout tower.

### Plunging into Enemy Airspace

Are destroyers always destined for such hardship? The Solomon Sea, often described as calm, is in reality quite turbulent. Finally, unable to endure it any longer, I crawled into the bunk that the executive officer had helped prepare. I could hear the waves crashing against our warship, a ferocious roar like that of a tiger, a powerful "hum" sound. It was also extremely hot. Disregarding all formality, I stripped completely naked, yet my entire body felt as if submerged in water, with sweat constantly pouring down. Soon after, I vomited once. As I tossed and turned, unable to sleep, our warship picked up speed. From time to time, waves crashed onto the deck, and the ship's hull emitted a rushing sound. At the stroke of midnight, my throat parched, I went to the galley next to the officer's mess. There, the commissaryman (the cook) stood amidst the hazy heat, sweat streaming down his face like a fountain.

This place was many times hotter than where I had been trying to sleep. To prepare breakfast for the army soldiers on board, the commissaryman toiled through the night, cooking many times the usual amount of food.

The officer's mess was, of course, empty. The navigator, communications officer, and gunnery officer were undoubtedly all at the captain's side, performing their duties. Thinking of this, I felt that I was the only one on this warship sleeping peacefully, without a care in the world. This was a bit much. I scolded myself, "This is war!" I felt like vomiting again. That evening, a navigator from a merchant marine school said to me:

"If you can't sleep tonight, please come up to the bridge and hang out! If the weather is good, even at night, you might be able to see Mount Bagana on Bougainville Island!"

Although he invited me, in my condition, I really couldn't make it to the bridge. Mount Bagana was a common sight for our naval aviators, nothing extraordinary. Starting from the 〇〇 base, after only 〇〇 hours, the pilots of our naval air force, boldly heading out to attack, might find this volcano erupting with smoke and clouds extremely beautiful. An air squadron officer once said:

"Before getting on the plane after receiving orders, I do feel a bit nervous, but once I take off, I forget everything. Because the surroundings are so beautiful, I always think that even dying like this, melting into nature, would be quite nice. So when I'm in the plane heading out on a mission, I feel truly refreshed. I feel like a true High King. Especially when I open the lunchbox that the commissaryman has painstakingly prepared, eat the delicious food, drink the fragrant tea, and gaze at the colorful, charming scenery, there's an indescribable sense of beauty."

The Philosophy of Death

Embracing a torpedo and charging towards an enemy ship in an attack plane might be a matter of bravado. This officer simply connected his philosophy of death and the beauty of nature at a higher altitude above us, which is a rather optimistic approach. Nevertheless, I, seasick and vomiting amidst the beautiful nightscape of the South Sea, as the mine squadron advanced in a single column, was truly a pathetic sight.

On the higher mast of the bridge, the sailors who were silently standing watch in the round bucket that they call the "pigeon coop" were probably holding the same sentiment as that air squadron officer. At the same time, the soldiers who couldn't neglect aerial observation for even a second, even at night, and were focusing their attention on the faint light of the stars through their binoculars, had certainly transcended the concept of death. Our ship, with all lights extinguished, was simply pushing forward into the sea of battle. In this beautiful and tense atmosphere, our ship, though in an area where enemy submarines appeared and disappeared unpredictably, did not encounter any, and at 〇 hours, entered the port near Buin.

On the snow-white sandy beach, dotted with clusters of coconut trees and the scattered, lush branches of mangroves (a type of tropical evergreen tree) even drooping to the sea, with the distant Mount Taroka towering in the clouds behind, everything looked extremely rugged, but our land troops seemed completely like lost sheep, unaware of where they were. The executive officer came running and said:

"Asleep? I blinked slightly. How are you!"

This officer, as well as all the officers and sailors I encountered on deck, had hardly slept at all last night. Their eyes were all bloodshot. Although their eyelids looked a bit swollen, everyone seemed unaware of fatigue, moving back and forth, operating. Because our ship had already anchored, the sailors who were off-duty spread out straw mats on the back of the deck, curled up like shrimp, and were snoring loudly.

A launch was lowered from a friendly ship, and officers with public duties came on the launch to meet with our captain. Based on enemy intelligence, the operational plan regarding the route, speed, and passage through various waterways had to be discussed.

In fact, the busiest person on the warship was the captain. Perhaps no one will be able to sleep tonight either. Most of the Solomon Islands are barren. In the worst places, even water has to be transported by ship. Therefore, ammunition, and of course all food supplies, must rely on rear support. However, in order to complete this transport mission deep within enemy airspace, it is necessary to operate at night and withdraw from enemy airspace early in the day. The only type of ship capable of carrying out such a mission is a destroyer.

Therefore, the task assigned to the mine squadron is transportation, not its original task. So, since the enemy landed on Lunga Point, although there haven't been any major battles worth mentioning, a supply war, unseen on the continental front, is being waged. In such a place, this is of vital importance, and the war is constantly and invariably waged day and night. (Translated by Shi Yan from the November 24th Mainichi Shimbun)

### British Military Defeat: Memoirs and Reflections

— Li Haibo

The article recorded here is a memoir by Lieutenant General Percival, former commander of the British forces in Malaya, reflecting on the defeat. It is sufficient to prove that the Japanese army's combat capability was far superior to that of the British army.

The Malayan campaign was a campaign in which the Japanese army launched a desperate attack, demonstrating their national spirit. The British had spent a hundred years in Malaya, building a seemingly impenetrable defense line. However, the Japanese army fought valiantly, engaging in battles across a vast theater stretching hundreds of kilometers, without showing any signs of fatigue. General Percival, commander of the defeated forces, upon the commencement of hostilities by the Japanese army, immediately mobilized the large British, Indian, and Australian forces distributed across the four military districts of Malaya, striving to conduct a defensive war. However, they ultimately could not withstand the surging Japanese forces, and the defensive operation collapsed, their arrows exhausted and blades broken, resulting in a complete rout. The seemingly impregnable fortress of Singapore finally raised the white flag and surrendered.

Percival described the entire course of this defeat very clearly, dividing it into fourteen chapters. According to his account, the seizure of the Kota Bharu airfield in various battles, the breakthrough of the Zaidra defense line by the Saeki unit on the Leda front, the fierce battle of the Slim River, the efforts of the Gotanda tank unit in the crossing of the Muar River, the battle of Singapore, and the activity of the Japanese air force posed a significant threat to the British army and were major factors leading to the British surrender. All of these facts are described in the enemy general's own words.

Initial British Military Deployment

The initial deployment of the British forces took into account the following three points:

Defense of Singapore Island 　 Defense of coastlines suitable for landing operations　 Defense of airfields. In the northern sector, these airfields had two main areas: one was the Kelantan region, and the other was the Wellesley region of Kedah State. Based on the above considerations, the Malayan military district was divided into the following four districts. 　 The Singapore Fortress Area was under the command of Major General Keith Simmons, who also commanded the fortress, infantry, and mobile units. 　 The Australian Army, under the command of Major General Bennett, was responsible for the defense of Johor and Malacca. 　 The Indian III Corps, under the command of Lieutenant General Heath, was responsible for the defense of northern Johor and the entire territory of Malacca. The Indian III Corps was composed of the Indian 9th and 11th Divisions, deployed as follows:

Indian 9th Division (with a brigade stationed in the Kota Bharu area, and a brigade in the Kuantan area), Indian 11th Division (a brigade south of Zaidra (northern Kedah State), a brigade at Sungei Patani, a brigade at Ipoh).

Air defense focused on the defense of Singapore and was directly under the command of the Malayan Military Headquarters. The mobile air defense units in the northern region were under the command of the Indian III Corps.

The Start of the Japanese Military Offensive

Before the Japanese military offensive began, we had already made complete preparations for defense, taking into account the general international situation. On the evening of December 7th, our aircraft discovered a Japanese convoy about seventy miles off the coast of Songkhla, confirming that preparations had been completed. The purpose of the garrison in the Kelantan area, responsible for the defense of Kelantan, was to secure the airfields for our aircraft. The area was too vast for the garrison to defend, but it was believed that the garrison could prevent the initial Japanese attack and inflict considerable damage on the Japanese. Subsequently, the Japanese offensive progressed, and the airfields became unusable due to the heavy bombing by the Japanese air force, forcing our aircraft to withdraw.

Under these circumstances, our air force had no reason to hold on to these airfields. On the morning of December 8th, the Kedah front troops received orders to move to the Zaidra defense line, learning that the Japanese had landed in Songkhla. Reconnaissance aircraft were also dispatched, and at the same time, the Japanese forces in Kroh were ordered to seek advantageous positions.

The Withdrawal from Kelantan

By December 11th, it was necessary to make a decision regarding the mission of the troops in Kelantan. Given the fact that the airfields there were unusable and the enemy's full-scale offensive southward along the west coast became increasingly apparent, it was decided to withdraw the troops from Kelantan.

The Situation in Kedah

By the end of the first week of the war, the situation in Kedah was extremely dangerous. The Indian 11th Division, lacking combat experience, retreated under the Japanese offensive. The rapid retreat and chaotic disorder caused considerable damage in terms of personnel and equipment. Moreover, there was a risk of a central breakthrough between the Kedah and Kroh lines. As a result, the following measures were decided upon:

The reserve, the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, was deployed to the Wellesley region and placed under the command of the Indian III Corps. 　 Even a very small number of units, which were no longer usable, needed to be transferred to Kedah State to fight. Therefore, the defense of Penang was abandoned. Furthermore, in this situation, it was most important to maintain absolute air superiority in the northern part of the Malay Peninsula, because the Japanese army deployed a considerable number of fighters in southern Thailand. Therefore, the Japanese army only had to attack Penang, which had no air defense facilities, and monitor our troop movements to disrupt our communication lines.

Retreat to Northern Perak

With the assistance of the Indian 12th Infantry Brigade, the connection between Kedah and Kroh was maintained. By around December 8th, this position was held along the line of the Krian River. However, before December 8th, the Indian 11th Division had already suffered considerable damage and become a very fragile force. Meanwhile, a small detachment still held the Grik Road. This location was the best position in northern Perak because the attack it faced was relatively limited. Because the Japanese forces attacking the Grik Road threatened to cut off the troops stationed in the Taiping area, the defense of that position was only temporary. Therefore, it was necessary to retreat to the position east of the Perak River. This position was not a naturally good one. Water and land routes ran parallel, so our communication organs on the land route were often attacked by Japanese forces attempting to cross the Perak River. Another position was selected and its front line placed at Kampar. This position was chosen because the terrain was relatively open, allowing for the full use of artillery.

The Withdrawal from Kuantan

Around the end of December, it was planned to have a division arrive to defend the Kuantan area. It was extremely important to secure the Kuantan airfield for as long as possible. Why was it necessary to preserve it? Because if it were occupied by the Japanese, the risk of air raids on Singapore would immediately increase. On the other hand, if the west coast line were pushed back, communication with Kuantan would be cut off. At that time, there was no direct attack on Kuantan, but there were some contacts on the lightly defended positions north of Terengganu. The method of withdrawing troops from Kuantan was gradual, because the ferry capacity in the Gelang area was limited. In order to strengthen the west coast operations, it was decided to withdraw these troops, with the withdrawal scheduled to be completed by mid-January. However, before the withdrawal was completed, the Japanese army attacked the Kuantan airfield from the north.

The Battle of Slim River

By early January, the Japanese army had almost completely secured air superiority and sea communication along the west coast of Malaya. The threat to our communications became even greater. Therefore, it was necessary to form special units by deploying artillery units to monitor this coast. Some volunteers and one or two units were also moved from the east coast. Although such measures were taken, the Japanese continued to land, and the threat to our communications did not decrease, but rather increased. During the weekend of the first week of January, the Japanese army won a major victory in the Battle of the Slim River in southern Perak. The Japanese army used tanks to defeat two of our front-line brigades. The personnel and equipment of the two brigades suffered great damage, and they were almost useless as combat units. As a result of this battle and the continuous fighting in January, the Indian 11th Division was unable to maintain its defensive position north of Kuala Lumpur. Moreover, there were many roads in the Kuala Lumpur area and to its south, and the constant threat from the sea made defense in this area even more difficult. It was decided to retreat to the northern region of Johor in the rear. The Indian 9th Division also needed to take the same steps as the 11th Division and retreat.

The Battle of Northern Johor

The northern Johor region was not an easy area to defend, especially against an enemy with naval supremacy. The reasons are as follows:

There were two main roads: the Kuala Lumpur Road and the Coastal Road. There was also a road that could be used for movement.

Rubber plantations were highly developed there, and almost every area could be traversed by troops. On the other hand, because the main airfields were located on the Mawai-Kluang-Batu Pahat Road, it was necessary to fight north of this road. For the operations in the northern Johor region, a new Western Army was established under the command of Major General Bennett. Its formation consisted of the Australian Army (a brigade in Mawai), the Indian 9th Division, and the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade (recently arrived from India). Initially, Major General Bennett's deployment was as follows:

The Australian Army and the Indian 9th Division were stationed in positions north of Segamat, with a small force ambushing north of Gemas. 　 The Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, supported by some Australian artillery units, was responsible for monitoring the Muar River crossing point on the Coastal Road. The remaining areas of Johor were under the command of the Third Indian Corps, with its headquarters in Simpang Renggam. Its units were all engaged in rear area tasks. 　 A brigade of Australian troops in the Mawai area came into contact with the Japanese forces pressing our troops in the Gemas area. Our ambush troops achieved great results, and it is believed that several Japanese tanks and a large number of Japanese troops were put out of action. However, at this time, the Japanese forces advancing along the Coastal Road had successfully crossed the Muar River and were attacking our troops defending the Muar River area. In order to support the Indian 45th Infantry Brigade, a large number of Australian troops were dispatched (these were troops withdrawn from Segamat and Mawai), and a large detachment of the newly arrived 53rd Infantry Brigade (18th Division) was also sent to defend the high ground west of Yong Peng. The Indian 6th and 15th Mixed Brigades were ordered to move from Kluang to Batu Pahat. Because the rear roads were blocked, communication with our Muar area defense forces was cut off. As a result, the main forces still engaged in combat in the Segamat area were directly threatened. An order was immediately issued for these troops to break contact with the enemy and immediately retreat from Kluang to the Ayer Hitam position. This operation was carried out smoothly, and all troops withdrew safely with only very few casualties. The new deployment was roughly as follows:

(A) A brigade of the Indian 9th Division was stationed in Kluang, and the Australian Army was stationed in Ayer Hitam. A brigade of the Indian 9th Division in the Yong Peng area served as a reserve for the above units. All of the above units were under the command of Major General Bennett.

(B) The Indian 12th Division stationed its advance units in Batu Pahat, deployed on the Coastal Road. An Australian brigade remained in the Mawai area. These units were under the command of the Third Indian Corps. In order to reduce the danger of air raids on Singapore, it was most important to hold the Kluang airfield and prevent the Japanese from capturing it. Therefore, an order was issued: the battle in this area should be prolonged as much as possible.

The Landing at Endau

At this time, a small number of Japanese troops made a small-scale landing at Endau. Our air force attacked their ships, but only after the Japanese had already landed. The Japanese army advanced towards Mawai and engaged the Australian troops who had established positions there. The Japanese advance was not very rapid, so they did not seem to feel threatened.

The Battle Near Batu Pahat

For about a week, the 6th and 15th Brigades continued to fight in Batu Pahat to protect the left flank of the Kluang and Ayer Hitam defense forces. After the road between Batu Pahat and Ayer Hitam was blocked, the only route available to this unit was the Coastal Road. Around January 26th, even the main road to Yong Peng in the rear was cut off. The attempt by the 6th and 15th Brigades to break through the encirclement failed. Therefore, the brigade had to abandon most of its baggage and equipment, and the troops retreated by water and land. Because the Coastal Road was blocked and there were no other usable units, if the Japanese army advanced south along this road, all allied forces fighting in Kluang and Ayer Hitam would be cut off by the Japanese. Therefore, it was decided to withdraw all units fighting in Johor State to Singapore Island during the last week of January. This withdrawal was completed before January 31st, with the exception of the Indian 22nd Infantry Brigade of the Indian 9th Division, which was stationed near the railway south of Rengam and could not contact the main force, and was mostly captured by the Japanese army.

Defense of Singapore Island

Before the outbreak of the war, all efforts were concentrated on defending the coast of Singapore Island, but there were no defensive fortifications along the northern coast. Although efforts were made to carry out these defensive measures as much as possible during the fighting, it was ultimately too late. Even when Singapore was evacuated, the defensive works were not complete. The deployment of troops was as follows:

The Australian Army: commanded the Indian 44th Infantry Brigade (recently arrived from India), stationed in the fourth region of the island, including the Causeway. 　 The Third Indian Corps: adjacent to the Australian Army, stationed in the northern region, including Kranji. The corps was composed of the Indian 11th Division (after reorganization) on its left flank and the 18th Division (its remnants recently arrived in Singapore) on its right flank. 　 The southern region, including the southern region of the island of Kranji and the defense of Pasir Panjang, Bukit Timah, and Ponggol. The general defense plan was to inflict heavy damage on forces attempting to cross the Johor Strait, so outposts were stationed on the coast, defensive strongholds were selected internally, and a reserve force was prepared for a counterattack. All commanders were ordered to send reserve forces to assist neighboring units if they received requests for assistance.

The Battle of Singapore

The Japanese army concentrated artillery fire on the northeast of the island, attempting to divert our attention to that area. However, our reconnaissance teams received reports that strong Japanese forces were concentrating in the opposite area from the northeast. It was naturally expected that the Japanese would land on the northwest coast. Regardless of whether their first landing was carried out, the Australian Army and the Malayan Military Headquarters first dispatched a reserve force to the Tengah area. All efforts were devoted to preserving the positions already laid out between Jurong and Tuas. On February 10th (Tuesday), it was decided to reinforce these forces with troops drawn from the 18th Division. By the morning of the 11th (Wednesday), Bukit Timah Village and the racecourse, which had large reserve forces, had been lost. Every effort was made to keep the positions near Adam Road intact. On the 12th (Thursday), it was necessary to retreat from the northern region. This was the 18th Division. The Indian 11th Division and troops from the naval base area and the southeast coast also retreated. This retreat took place on the evening of the 12th (Thursday). As a result, by the 13th (Friday), positions were built around Singapore City in the areas of Kallang Airport, Vita Valley, MacRitchie Reservoir, Adam Road, and Alexandra. On the 14th (Saturday), water pipes and water mains were damaged by air raids and artillery fire, making water supply to Singapore difficult. By the morning of the 15th (Friday), the supply situation was even more pressing. According to water experts, there was only enough water for one more week. This was the biggest reason for deciding to surrender on the 15th.

The Air Situation

In this memoir, the air situation is hardly mentioned, because this situation was very obvious not only to the British army but also to the Japanese side. Because of the British commitment to missions in other theaters, it was not possible to deploy the necessary air force strength to Malaya. As a result, the Japanese army gained air superiority in the first few days and maintained this air superiority until the end, never losing it. This had a huge impact on us. In particular, it was impossible to launch actions without the enemy knowing, especially in coastal operations, which resulted in many attacks. Actions in Singapore City were also severely affected, making it difficult to repair airfields or carry out dock work.

Note: Because the Air Force was separate from the Army, there was no position to elaborate on matters concerning the Air Force.

The Reasons for the Japanese Victory

In my opinion, the main reason for the Japanese victory was their rapid advance, which was due to a combination of the following reasons:

The Japanese army had the ability to reside in this area for a longer period compared to the British army.

The Japanese army received assistance in terms of road transportation.

The Japanese army possessed the agility and determination to quickly overcome obstacles (such as rivers, swamps, etc.) and quickly repair damaged objects.

### The Responsibility for the Rupture of Japanese-American Negotiations

Two years ago, on November 26th, the relationship between Japan and the United States had essentially reached a state of collapse. On that day, the United States presented its final proposal to the Japanese representatives, Nomura and Kurusu. It was essentially a beautifully worded declaration of war by the United States against Japan, which even some of their own people later admitted was unacceptable. In January 1943, the U.S. State Department published a booklet entitled "Peace and War" (U.S. Foreign Policy, 1931-1941), detailing the past ten years of U.S. foreign policy, particularly the "truth" about Japanese-American relations and the breakdown of Japanese-American negotiations. The apparent purpose of the U.S. government in publishing this book was to demonstrate their "fair stance" in the Japanese-American negotiations to both domestic and foreign audiences, and to shift the responsibility and blame for provoking the war onto Japan. However, within the thousands of words of the book, the challenging attitude of the United States towards Japan at the time, their wishful thinking, and their policy of both intimidation and appeasement were exposed without reservation. This was probably something they did not anticipate. It is difficult to present the entire booklet here due to space constraints. Therefore, I will extract two or three points from Chapters XII and XIV regarding the Japanese-American negotiations to expose American deception and concealment.

The United States Lacked Sincerity in Negotiations

The first point to note is that the highest authorities in the United States had no hope or sincerity in establishing negotiations from the beginning. In other words, they were merely using this as a means to delay the start of the war in order to complete their own war preparations and cultivate public sentiment in favor of war. The following excerpts will clarify that this statement is not rash.

1. "The President and the heads of the Army, Navy, and State Departments were in complete agreement that involving the United States in the war was less appropriate than adopting economic measures against Japan, given the current public opinion in the United States and the insufficient military preparations." (Page 58, Chapter XII)

(Note) The reason why the heads of the U.S. government did not impose sanctions on Japan until June 1938, a year after the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident, is now self-evident.

2. "Ambassador Grew in Japan submitted his opinion to the U.S. government on September 12, 1940, as follows:

"If the United States can maintain the status quo in the Pacific until Britain succeeds in the European war... then the United States may have the possibility of adjusting the entire Pacific issue." (Page 62, Chapter XII)

(Note) The so-called "adjustment" means forcing Japan to submit, which is a U.S.-style diplomatic euphemism.

3. "In the spring of 1941, before the start of the Japanese-American negotiations, President Roosevelt and Secretary of State Hull, after exchanging views, fully recognized that due to the extreme nature of Japan's policy of conquest, it was impossible to stop Japan's advance. Therefore, the hope for establishing a fair and peaceful agreement in the East Asian region was very slim. (Note: This refers to the fact that Ambassador Nomura revealed the Japanese side's sincere attitude towards starting negotiations after taking office.)

The U.S. government had to agree to begin preliminary talks in order to determine whether a full agreement could be reached on the basic issues that could be brought into formal talks." (Page 77, Chapter XIV)

(Note) It is impossible to find any hope or sincerity for the United States to maintain peace in the Pacific in this narrative.

4. Negotiations regarding the Konoe-Roosevelt meeting -

Japanese proposal

"On August 28, 1941, Prime Minister Konoe submitted the following document to President Roosevelt through the Japanese ambassador:

"Continuing informal preliminary talks and having the leaders of both countries confirm the conclusions are not suitable for the current situation, where unexpected events may erupt. Therefore, it is necessary for the leaders of both governments to meet and discuss various issues concerning the entire Pacific from a broad perspective." (Page 83, Chapter XIV)

American response

"During the meeting on the same day (Note: August 28th), Secretary of State Hull pointed out to Ambassador Nomura: "The United States hopes to establish a principled agreement on the main issues before the Konoe-Roosevelt meeting. If the summit meeting fails, the result will be very serious. Therefore, the purpose of such a meeting should be to have important points on which both sides agree in advance." (Page 84, Chapter XIV)

When considering the Japanese proposal, the U.S. government noted the following facts: Prime Minister Konoe was the Prime Minister of Japan at the time of the outbreak of the Sino-Japanese Incident in 1937... The highest authorities in Japan attending the summit meeting were responsible for implementing Japanese policy since 1931... Even if the meeting reached a principled understanding, Japan would act according to its own interpretation... If the meeting failed, Japan would place the responsibility on the United States." (Pages 84-85, Chapter XIV) (Note) From this, it can be seen that the United States was nitpicking on everything in order to obstruct the negotiations.

Various Perspectives on American Demands

The second point that must be pointed out is that the American demands in the Japanese-American negotiations were based on an arrogant and disrespectful viewpoint. They expressed these demands using either threatening words and tempting attitudes, or by making wild statements to the defendant, and published them separately with a straight face. Using the Japan-Germany-Italy Tripartite Pact, the issue of withdrawing troops from China and Indochina, and the issue of equal opportunity in international commerce, which were the biggest obstacles in the negotiations, as the center, I will quote the original text of the book as follows:

1. The U.S. attitude towards the Tripartite Pact

"On May 11, 1941, Hull stated during a meeting with Ambassador Nomura:

"The United States is well aware that Hitlerism is a scourge not only to Europe, but also to the rest of the world. Not only that, but the United States is also convinced that Japan, like the European countries under the control of Hitler, will suffer from its misfortune in the near future." (Page 77, Chapter XIV) (Note) This is a malicious attempt to alienate Japan and Germany.

"On July 23, 1941, immediately after the Japanese army was stationed in southern French Indochina, Undersecretary of State Welles stated during a meeting with Ambassador Nomura:

"The agreements concluded between Japan and the Vichy government were all achieved by Germany putting pressure on Vichy. Therefore, the Japanese-Vietnamese agreement can be interpreted as supporting Germany's world domination policy." (Page 79, Chapter XIV) (Note) This clearly reveals the shallowness of the United States' understanding of the situation in East Asia.

During the Nomura-Kurusu-Roosevelt-Hull meeting on November 17, 1941,

"Hull said: "If Japan still stubbornly adheres to the Tripartite Pact, then any agreement regarding the Pacific region cannot be considered sincere. As a result of Hitler's military expansion throughout the world, the United States is in imminent danger. Therefore, the United States must promptly request self-defense measures." (Page 88, Chapter XIV)

(Note) Behind these words lies the determination to declare war on Germany. The reason why the United States interfered with Japan's departure from the Tripartite Pact was that it feared that Japan would declare war on the United States based on the Tripartite Pact when a war broke out between Germany and the United States. Therefore, it wanted to make Japan an onlooker before defeating Germany.

2. The U.S. position on the troop withdrawal issue

"The intention of this proposal is to have foreign troops withdraw completely from Vietnam or China. At that time, the withdrawal of U.S. troops stationed in China was virtually complete (Note: This refers to the measures taken to withdraw all U.S. Marines stationed in China, who were fighting the Japanese army, and move them to the Philippines and other places.) The withdrawal of the last unit is also underway. In addition, the British also withdrew from China (Note: The purpose is the same as the U.S. military.) Therefore, it is proposed that Japan also withdraw its land, sea, and air forces and police from China and Indochina." (Page 92, Chapter XIV)

Nomura-Kurusu-Hull meeting on December 1st!

"Hull said. "The Japanese army's advance into Vietnam is a threat to the southern region." (Page 93. Chapter XIV)

(Note) Isn't it they who formed the so-called ABCD encirclement against Japan?

Nomura-Welles meeting on July 23, 1941!

"Undersecretary of State Welles said: "According to Japan's explanation, the Japanese army's advance into southern Vietnam is only intended to secure rice and raw materials, and to counter a certain country's attempt to encircle Japan. However, if the ongoing negotiations between Nomura and Hull can be satisfactorily resolved, Japan will be able to obtain greater economic guarantees than occupying Indochina. Moreover, the U.S. policy is neither an encirclement policy nor a policy of threatening Japan." (Page 80. Chapter XIV)

(Note) This is truly a blatant argument that sounds like it's meant to deceive children.

August 17, 1941. A note from Roosevelt to Japan, handed to Ambassador Nomura!

"If the Japanese government takes any further actions based on its policy or plan to militarily dominate or threaten neighboring countries, the United States will immediately implement all means deemed necessary to protect its own rights and the safety of its people." (Page 80, Chapter XIV)

Nomura-Hull meeting on March 8, 1941 —

"Hull said, "Are there three countries organizing armies and navies before the eyes of the United States, wanting to conquer the seven seas of the world, as well as all commercial routes and the four continents outside of the Americas? Does Japan want the United States to stand by and watch?" (Page 76, Chapter XIV)

3. The U.S. attitude towards the issue of equal commercial opportunities

"Although Japan has made great efforts to comply with the principle of non-discrimination in international commercial relations, it has refused to relinquish the special status it has acquired in the Japanese-occupied areas in practice." (Page 90, Chapter XIV)

(Note) However, Japan actually "hopes to implement this principle in all countries of the world, and has expressed its willingness to comply with its implementation and strive to apply it to the Pacific region, including China, and has clarified that it does not exclude any fair economic activities of third countries in China." (Japanese Memorandum to the United States on December 8th) Therefore, there is no doubt that the U.S. side deliberately distorted the Japanese side's position. Moreover, the United States, regarding its monopolization of the Americas under the name of Pan-Americanism, brazenly attempted to indirectly argue for its Monroe Doctrine with the following explanation.

Japanese Ambassador-Hull meeting on April 20, 1940—

"Hull said that the difference between the United States' Monroe Doctrine and the Monroe Doctrine claimed by Japan is like the difference between black and white, that is, the United States' Monroe Doctrine is only a means to protect its own material security, while Japan believes that it can be applied to all purposes, including economic, political, and social purposes." (Page 60, Chapter XII)

A de facto Ultimatum

The third noteworthy point is that the proposal of November 26 was, in fact, an ultimatum, and that they inadvertently revealed that the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor was not a "sneak attack."

1. Ambassador Grew reported to his government on January 27, 1941—

"We have obtained information from various sources that the Japanese military authorities have formulated a plan for a large-scale surprise attack on Pearl Harbor in the event of a dispute between Japan and the United States." (Page 76, Chapter XIV.

2. Grew's report of November 3 of the same year—

"Judging from the various events that have occurred so far, it is difficult to agree with the view that a complete embargo can avoid war in East Asia... My purpose is to prevent the mistaken judgment that Japan does not have the ability to wage a "suicidal war" with the United States, because this kind of misjudgment may promote the United States to be involved in a long war... It is foreseeable that Japan is likely to take dangerous measures that make war between Japan and the United States inevitable." (Page 87, Chapter XIV)

3. On November 7, Secretary of State Hull reported at the Cabinet meeting—

"Secretary of State Hull reported at the Cabinet meeting on November 7 that Japanese-American relations were facing a major crisis, and that Japan was likely to launch new military actions at any time. Therefore, the Cabinet agreed that our country should immediately respond to the development of this situation, and that the critical situation should be emphasized in speeches. Based on this decision, Secretary of the Navy Knox gave a speech on November 11, 1941, warning that the United States not only had to take extraordinary self-defense measures in the Atlantic, but was also facing ominous possibilities in the Pacific." (Page 87, Chapter XIV)

4. Grew's report of November 17—

"The Japanese Army and Navy are in danger of launching torpedo attacks in areas not included in the scope of the Sino-Japanese Incident, and we must be closely vigilant." (Page 88, Chapter XIV)

5. Hull's statement at the Supreme Leaders' Meeting on November 25 and 28. This statement was made shortly before and after the U.S. issued the final ultimatum.

"Secretary of State Hull emphasized the critical nature of Japanese-American relations at the government leaders' meeting on November 25 and 28. According to Hull, the possibility of establishing an agreement with Japan was virtually non-existent. He believed that there was still a fear that Japan would take new military action. The United States should now transfer the issue of defending national security to the Army and Navy. The United States must promptly establish a military defense plan. Because Japan regards the element of surprise as the core of its strategy, Hull argued that it should be assumed that the Japanese army will launch attacks simultaneously in many locations." (Page 92, Chapter XIV)

6. November 29, Hull meets with the British Ambassador—

"Hull conferred with the British Ambassador on November 29, stating: "The diplomatic relations between the United States and Japan have virtually come to an end. The issue will now be transferred to the Army and Navy authorities." (Pages 92-93, Chapter XIV)

(Note) The report of Judge Roberts, the head of the investigation into the truth about the defeat at Pearl Harbor, also stated: "On November 27, 1941 (Note: i.e., the day after the United States submitted the memorandum to Japan), Army Chief of Staff Marshall notified Lieutenant General Walter Short, commander of the Hawaiian Army District, that negotiations with Japan had broken down. On the same day, the Chief of Naval Operations also notified Admiral Kimmel, commander of the Pacific Fleet, and ordered him to implement preparations for carrying out war missions."

Active Cooperation between the U.S. and Britain

Finally, it must be mentioned that Britain was actively cooperating in the offensive against Japan. This was proposed by the United States, and as a result, the phrase "Japan's great ambition to advance into the Indian Ocean" was created.

August 9, 1941, Hull-British Ambassador meeting—

"Hull said that Japan is about to use force to advance into the Indian Ocean and the continents and islands connected to it, isolate China, and extend its tentacles to the mouth of the Suez Canal, the Persian Gulf oil fields, and the Cape of Good Hope area. As a result, it plans to block trade routes and supply sources to the British mainland. Such a large-scale action would probably be more harmful to the defense of British Europe than the German army crossing the English Channel... If Japan advances further south in the future, the U.S. and British governments should naturally immediately discuss countermeasures." (Page 82, Chapter XIV)

(Note) Roosevelt and Churchill held their first meeting on the Atlantic Ocean and decided on concrete countermeasures for the offensive against Japan, as well as the so-called Atlantic Charter, after Hull made these remarks. The sailing of the "Prince of Wales" and "Repulse" to Singapore was after this Roosevelt-Churchill meeting at sea. (Source: Evening Edition of Yomiuri Hochi, November 24-25)

### The Way to Achieve Overall Peace

— Lu Yunxuan

How to achieve overall peace? In a nutshell, Chongqing can realize the fallacy of the war of resistance in time, resolutely abandon the war of resistance policy of clinging to Britain and the United States, and end the state of war within China, then overall peace can naturally be quickly achieved in the shortest possible time. But why does Chongqing advocate continuing the war of resistance? If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first dissect the anti-Japanese elements in Chongqing. In the past, many people who discussed the anti-Japanese issue in Chongqing were constrained by a kind of restraint in their hearts, so they hid what they wanted to say, and as a result, the arguments were not straightforward or sufficient. The Shen Bao's open essay contest to commemorate the first anniversary of its resumption is undoubtedly the best opportunity for us to express our opinions. I will say a few words from the standpoint of the Chinese people. I hope that the wise men of the allied countries will correct and criticize any mistakes.

The reason why the general Chinese intellectual class developed a distaste for Japan began with the September 18th Incident in Manchuria. At that time, due to emotional impulse, they harbored the idea that Japan would not give up the three northeastern provinces after the September 18th Incident. After the Manchurian Incident, the Chinese intellectual class misunderstood Japan's policy toward China and spared no effort in propagating anti-Japanese policies. The general public, influenced by propaganda, developed suspicion due to misunderstanding. The January 28th Shanghai Incident and the July 7th Marco Polo Bridge Incident were both caused by this kind of anti-Japanese propaganda. Currently, the intellectual class under Chongqing who are promoting the war of resistance to recover lost territory also use the Manchurian Incident as the only propaganda target. The Manchurian Incident has prevented the Chinese intellectual class from thoroughly understanding the righteousness of Japan's actions, and has had a great impact on their thinking. Therefore, it has become a stalemate in Chongqing's compromise with Japan. This is one of the important reasons why Chongqing advocates continuing the war of resistance.

After Japan implemented its new policy toward China, the anti-Japanese sentiment under the rule of Chongqing had gradually weakened. Recently, with the signing of the Japan-China Alliance Treaty, Japan agreed to withdraw its troops stationed in China when a state of overall peace and war between the two countries was terminated. This move will at least increase many new understandings of peace in the anti-war camp. Chongqing currently relies on foreign aid to fight, and there is a great crisis of becoming an appendage of the British and American fronts. The inner suffering is needless to say, but if it resolutely breaks away from the anti-Axis front, will Japan use China as an allied country and make China a military supply depot for Japan? China has been ravaged by war for many years, and the fields have become ruins. If we immediately take care of the situation, recruit refugees, make the people live in peace, and restore the old appearance, it will take several or even decades to succeed. If overall peace is achieved in a short period of time, we will naturally spare no effort to build a new China. Will Japan extend the control and allocation system to China at will and use economic means to bind China's free economic development? The people under the rule of Chongqing have the above-mentioned doubts, so they cannot dispel the anti-Japanese prejudices. This is the second reason for the war of resistance.

The Chongqing authorities have always believed that the Democratic Entente will win. In the past two years of the Greater East Asia War, although they could not help but be shocked by the Japanese army's repeated victories, they were hardly able to fully understand the truth of the Japanese army's achievements under the cover of British and American propaganda. Chongqing's newspapers have further concealed the failures of Britain and the United States. Although this is partly because they fear that it will cause the people who are infatuated with Britain and the United States to waver, it is also partly due to the oppression of the American propaganda advisors in Chongqing. This kind of propaganda that recognizes defeat as victory makes the people of Chongqing unable to recognize the greatness of the Japanese army's operations and the uniqueness of its achievements. Therefore, they hold the belief that Japan will be defeated by the United States. Due to the fabricated news and concealed defeats of the United States, not only do the people of Chongqing hesitate to move forward in the overall peace movement, but they also create the psychology of delusionally relying on the victory of Britain and the United States to recover lost territory. Under the blind infatuation of the general public, the anti-Japanese psychology cannot be eliminated. This is the third reason for the war of resistance.

In summary, we can see that the war of resistance is a problem of thought. If this kind of thought is not adjusted, and the essence of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration is revealed, it will not achieve the desired effect in the end. Not only that, but the overall peace that we expect will never be quickly realized due to the existence of Chongqing's anti-Japanese thought. The allied friend and veteran, Mr. Toho Yoshida, his remarks can very thoroughly understand the inner pain of the Chinese people. We have read his article "Japan's Cultural Policy toward China and the Chinese Intellectual Class" in the past. He said: "When the Chinese intellectual class is still very suspicious of Japan, persistently revealing the "Asia Prosperity Theory" and Japanese people wearing Chinese clothes, eating Chinese dishes, and shouting Sino-Japanese friendship will only make the Chinese intellectual class more wary of Japan." His calm words pointed out very thoroughly that if Japan does not adjust the pro-American thinking of the general Chinese public, it cannot expect too much efficiency in promoting Sino-Japanese joint cooperation in building a new East Asia. If we want to achieve overall peace, we must first let Chongqing abandon the policy of war of resistance. To make Chongqing not resist, the first thing is to solve the ideological problem of the people in Chongqing. We sincerely hope that our Chinese friend, Mr. Toho Yoshida, will publicly answer the first and second points of this article. As for the third point, we hope that Japan's propaganda can extend to Chongqing in order to correct the suspicious thoughts of the people in Chongqing.

### Several Basic Conditions for Practicing the Sino-Japanese Alliance

— Mao Chiping

China and Japan are like teeth connected, with political and cultural exchanges since ancient times. At this time of the Great East Asia War, a decisive moment for victory or defeat, a critical time for the survival of the Great East Asian nations, it goes without saying that the two countries should unite to jointly support the overall situation and jointly seek survival. Therefore, the Sino-Japanese alliance means to make the relationship between the two countries even closer, so that China's revival and strength can be realized more quickly. However, no matter how beautiful and pleasing the words in the treaty are, no matter how enthusiastic and impassioned the people are, this is just an ideal. To make it a reality, the following points must be examined:

Smoothing Communication in Language

Understanding each other's language serves as a weapon for cultural communication and a medium for mutual love and affection. If even the language is not understood, there is simply no way to achieve cultural exchange. If meanings cannot be conveyed to each other, emotional resonance will not be aroused. Therefore, understanding each other's language is a fundamental condition for thorough Sino-Japanese cooperation, so as to achieve the highest goal, as declared in the Great East Asia Conference, of jointly promoting the ancient cultures of the East.

Now, China and Japan have sadly mourned the deception they suffered in the past and have realized that they should love each other, unite, and act consistently against external forces. Therefore, smoothing communication in language is the most fundamental work for unity and affection. Furthermore, the enthusiastic research of the people of the two countries into each other's languages is indeed a necessary and highly commendable phenomenon. I think a Chinese person who can understand Japanese, or a Japanese person who can understand Chinese, will surely remove the erroneous concepts in their minds and appreciate the loveliness and respectability of China or Japan.

Economic Cooperation

Economic cooperation is originally a condition that allied countries should have. In the past, Great East Asia was occupied by the forces of Britain and the United States. Their economic aggression reduced the national economic rights of China to a state of decline and danger, causing economic panic throughout China, forcing China to pant and sweat, and gradually heading towards the end of destruction.

Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the allied powers, with their magnificent military power, have wiped out the evil forces of Britain and the United States in one fell swoop. East Asia has purely become East Asia for East Asians, and the Sino-Japanese economic cooperation that Japan hopes for and China hopes for has also gained the opportunity to be realized. China is an industrially backward country. All production technologies and production methods have not been thoroughly improved and still retain their primitive state. If economic prosperity and production development are desired, it is impossible to achieve overnight and it is essential to rely on the strength of others. The allied powers are advanced countries on par with Britain and the United States, and everything is worth China's emulation. They are indeed a powerful partner for China to revive its economy.

China's Self-Strengthening

China has been liberated from the oppression of Britain and the United States because of the Great East Asia War. Furthermore, due to the spirit of righteousness of the allied powers, it has gained the opportunity to establish itself autonomously. China should take advantage of the current good opportunity to eliminate old habits and strive for self-strengthening to create a new life, so as not to disappoint the ardent expectations of the allied powers. Moreover, since the National Government announced its participation in the war on January 9, it has officially declared war on Britain and the United States, becoming a member of the effort to win the Great East Asia War. We must not just shout slogans, but should use strength as a weapon of war.

The Awakening of Chongqing

The entire East Asia has reached the stage of liberation. Only Chongqing is still being confused by Britain and the United States, acting as a traitor to East Asia, and cannot jointly build Great East Asia. This is truly the most regrettable and regrettable thing.

What are the compatriots in Chongqing gnawing on grass roots and tree bark for? What is the price of their sacrifice? They are also the people of our Republic of China. After hearing about the signing of the Sino-Japanese alliance treaty, they must realize that Chongqing's resistance is futile, and that the establishment of the Sino-Japanese alliance will be a guarantee for China's revival. The call for Chongqing's resistance will no longer be able to bind the hearts of the people who have already awakened. It is hoped that Chongqing will awaken as soon as possible, no longer be intoxicated by the confusion of Britain and the United States, and jointly build the ideal Great East Asia and strive for the final victory of Great East Asia.

Navy

### The Origin of Filming the Movie "Navy"

Since the beginning of the Great East Asia War, the brilliant achievements of the Japanese Navy have been the result of the unwavering belief forged by generations of Japanese naval predecessors, as well as the product of continuous and intense training. The spirit of utter devotion represented by the special attack units is especially worthy of emulation by future generations, and the magnificence of their actions can be said to be unmatched in the world. It is truly the pinnacle of the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy!

Today, at a time when the world is undergoing a major historical transformation with Japan as the axis, it is necessary to make people correctly understand the navy. Therefore, Mr. Iwata Takao devoted his passion to writing the book "Navy" for the Asahi Shimbun, which was disclosed in the newspaper day by day, concretizing the traditional spirit of the Japanese Navy, enabling the Japanese people to understand the characteristics of the navy, and making it a work that conforms to the times. Therefore, Shochiku Kinema has adapted it into a movie to contribute to the people. The production of this film was a massive project, and fortunately it was completed with the assistance of various naval organizations. The list of items used is attached.

### Synopsis of the Plot

In the third year of Bunkyu (1863), six British warships arrived at Kagoshima. This was ostensibly to use the Namamugi Incident as an excuse to intimidate Japan and force it to submit. The Satsuma clan was greatly angered and rose up in arms, firing the first shot against the British barbarians. This is known as the Anglo-Satsuma War. Among the young warriors who served in this war, many later became famous generals. Marshal Togo also first faced battle in this war, at the age of only seventeen, and the belief that "those who come from the sea must be guarded against at sea" became even more firm. Tani Makoto was born in Kagoshima. In the summer of Showa 9 (1934), when Makoto was in the third grade of middle school, a survey of academic aspirations was held. It was difficult for him to decide for a while. After being led by Instructor Kikuchi to visit Etajima Naval Academy, Makoto decided to study the navy, and Makoto's long-held aspirations were finally realized. When he entered the school, he was deeply moved by Major Hirata's speech: "Your lives have already been dedicated to His Majesty the Emperor at this school!" From then on, he began a life of intense training and strict discipline.

A soldier's duty is to be loyal and virtuous. A soldier should be upright in etiquette. A soldier should be trustworthy. A soldier must maintain integrity. These are the things that Makoto recited every morning and evening.

Are you not true to your sincerity? Are you not consistent in your words and actions? Do you not lack vigor? Are you not shaken by effort? Do you not exhaust your spirit?

This is the essence of the military spirit, the backbone of the "Navy Soul." Makoto often urged himself not to fail this life. "Because of my temporary negligence as a junior officer, His Majesty's ship was sunk and the lives of my subordinates were lost. I am truly guilty and inexcusable. However, before dying together, the crew remained loyal to their duties and calmly responded. We are sacrificing our lives for the country and have no regrets. We only regret that people in the world may misunderstand this matter, causing a major blow to the development of submarines. Therefore, I hope that you will know more about encouragement, do not misunderstand, and devote all your efforts to researching and developing submarines. Then we, though dead, will have no regrets." After reading Commander Sakuma's will, Major Hirata wept and said, "Even if you silently understand the principles of submarines, it is still useless. Only those who read Commander Sakuma's will and weep every time can understand the way a naval soldier serves the country—"

Later, he devoted himself to practicing special submarines and had gained quite a bit of experience. He received secret orders, and at this time he happened to be returning home, saying goodbye to his old mother, brother, and sister, and returning to his hometown of Kagoshima.

The Japanese Navy's warship secretly set sail into the Pacific Ocean at midnight. It was several days before December 8, Showa 16 (1941).

"At this time of national crisis for our Imperial Nation, I am honored to have a place to die. I sincerely and faithfully pray for the eternal life of His Majesty the Emperor..." Makoto drafted a will in the officers' room.

The commander of the Combined Fleet raised the Z flag, and the brave warriors with soaring ambitions set off in special submarines to launch a surprise attack on Pearl Harbor.

At this time, friendly air force units also began a fierce attack, and special submarines strongly attacked the enemy's main forces. The shadow of the battleship USS Arizona suddenly appeared in the periscope. Makoto smiled unconsciously and sank the ship with a torpedo that was sure to hit. "Our surprise attack has succeeded!"

"The rise and fall of the Imperial Nation depend on this battle. Each member must shatter their bones and complete their mission!" After the mothership received this telegram, the whereabouts of the special submarines became unknown from then on. How heroic are the five special submarines that have not yet returned. "The road to ambition is exhausted, and if one goes, one will never return!" Yamamoto Isoroku

### Slogans

The special attack units that shook the world, may their heroic spirits live forever! The bright moon over Pearl Harbor; a torpedo leaves a white trail, a thunderous crash as if the sky is collapsing, and the warship sinks in an instant. Alas, the special attack units whose names are inscribed in history, their heroic姿 is as vivid as ever.

Dawn of December 8, Showa 16 (1941)

A great feat of the Japanese Navy that shook the world!

The Japanese Special Attack Unit formed by special submarines broke into the heavily guarded Pearl Harbor, either launching a strong attack on the enemy's main forces simultaneously with a certain air force unit, or resolutely carrying out a lone night attack, sinking the battleship USS Arizona and others, establishing real achievements and shocking the enemy fleet. The Japanese side lost 29 aircraft and 5 special submarines that did not return.

The heroic姿 of national heroes whose English names are immortal are now on the silver screen.
