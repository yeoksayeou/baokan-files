### The Greater East Asia War and the Japanese Navy - Celebrating the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day

From the perspective of historians, the Greater East Asia War should be seen as a development of the Russo-Japanese War of thirty-eight years ago. Thirty-eight years ago, the new Japanese navy created achievements that changed the history of East Asia; thirty-eight years later, the Japanese navy is creating a cause that is changing the history of East Asia and even the world.

Thirty-eight years ago, the situation in East Asia was in a very dangerous position. At that time, the devilish hand of British aggression was deeply penetrating the Chinese mainland, while the declining Tsarist Russia, in order to eliminate the growing revolutionary forces at home, to maintain its precarious autocratic rule, and to plunder land from the East to seize colonial hegemony, was constantly preparing to provoke foreign wars. Japan, which had not long after the Meiji Restoration, and whose national strength was not understood by foreign countries, happened to become the target of Tsarist Russian aggression. If Tsarist Russia had won against Japan thirty-eight years ago, then the Russian revolution would not have succeeded, and it would certainly be doubtful whether there would be a Soviet Union in the world. Moreover, the timing, nature, and location of the First World War twenty-eight years ago would have been very different from what actually happened. At that time, Britain and Russia might have first staged the tragedy of dividing China. Fortunately, the emerging Japan defeated the main force of Tsarist Russia in one fell swoop, shaken the foundation of Tsarist Russia's autocratic regime, consolidated the then Anglo-Japanese alliance, created a balance of power in East Asia, and delayed the outbreak of the First World War. More importantly, it laid the foundation for Japan to become a stabilizing force in East Asia and laid the foundation for Japan to become a defender of the Pacific.

The situation on the eve of the Greater East Asia War was almost the same as that of the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago. The declining Britain and the United States, which attempted to seize hegemony in the Pacific, like Tsarist Russia thirty-eight years ago, brewed the crisis of the East Asia War, used the contradictions between the East Asian nations, and implemented their "using Asians to control Asians" strategy, creating various conditions that would lead East Asians to extinction. If the British and American conspiracy had succeeded, the situation in East Asia and even the Pacific would naturally not know "where it would end." Fortunately, Japan inherited the traditional spirit of the Russo-Japanese War, especially the Japanese navy, who stood up on the vast Pacific Ocean and attacked the enemy everywhere from the sea and from the air. In a very short time, they forced the enemy to withdraw from every island and escape from the Pacific, returning the oceans and islands of Asia to the hands of Asians. The fighting spirit they displayed was the promotion and expansion of the fighting spirit in the Russo-Japanese War, shining on the Pacific and the whole world.

Not long ago, the Japanese Navy Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters compiled the book "The Greater East Asia War and the Japanese Navy," which further promoted the faithful record of the great achievements of the Japanese Navy inheriting the glory of the Russo-Japanese War. It vividly wrote out the enthusiasm and loyalty of the Japanese patriots during the Russo-Japanese War reviving in the chests of the Japanese Navy in the Greater East Asia War. It simply and realistically depicted how the Japanese Navy stood up to fight in the Greater East Asia War and how they won victory. This book realistically depicts the amazing scenes of modern naval battles such as the Battle of Hawaii, the Battle of the Malay Sea, the Battle of Wake Island, the Battle of the Naval Parachute Unit, submarine warfare, the Battle of the Java Sea, the Battle of Australia and the Indian Ocean, etc. This not only portrays the heroic and invincible posture of the Japanese Navy, but also provides East Asian nations with a wealth of new knowledge, providing practical knowledge of the role, strategy, tactics, new weapons, new technologies, etc. of the modern navy. At this time when China urgently needs to prepare for national defense and build a navy, we have translated and published this book into Chinese, which seems to be the most timely and precious gift for our army and navy personnel and the general patriotic people. At the same time, we dare to believe that the publication of the Chinese translation of this book is also the most appropriate and sincere commemoration of the 38th Japanese Navy Day.

### Russo-Japanese War - Records of This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago - Old Newspaper New Excerpts (7)

Introduction

We recognize that it will be entirely the responsibility of Asians to protect the Pacific in the future, and that the British and Americans must no longer be allowed to exert aggressive forces. However, fulfilling the task of protection depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous advancement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it showed its initial brilliance by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has further unleashed its invincible power. At present, the friendly navy alone bears the heavy responsibility for the entire defense of the Pacific, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden even slightly. Therefore, how we should emulate the friendly navy to establish the Chinese navy and participate in the task of defending the Pacific in the future is truly the common goal that the people of our country should urgently aspire to and pursue. In order to increase the people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper has excerpted the records of this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago as new excerpts, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention to this.

### Imperial Edict to the People (From this newspaper, No. 11400, Guangxu Year 30, December 4th, corresponding to January 9th, 1905, Monday)

A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo reported: On the first day of the first month of Meiji Year 38, the Emperor went to court and issued an imperial edict, saying: The Emperor of Great Japan, who is blessed by Heaven, whose imperial domain is consolidated and inherited for ten thousand generations, now swears to you, my loyal and brave subjects. I am now at war with the Russians. My army and navy should each exert their loyalty and courage, and share the same hatred against the enemy. My officials and all civil servants should each diligently perform their duties to protect my country, strictly abide by the founding charter, and do their best. Do not let anything be wasted, and I have high hopes for you. What I hope for is the prosperity of the nation, the civilization, the peace of the people's hearts, and the friendship with all countries, which will be more sincere than before, so as to maintain the peace of the Eastern situation for a long time. May the prestige and rights not be damaged, and may all be of one mind, to establish the foundation for the future. I have always regarded diplomacy as the most important task, and I think about it day and night, and I dare not violate it. My officials can all deeply understand my intentions, harmonize with friendly countries, and increase their intimacy. Unfortunately, the Russians have acted recklessly, and I have had no choice but to raise an army to attack the violent. However, is this my original intention? What my empire values most is the preservation of the Korean territory, and I have never forgotten this idea for a day. Because Korea and Japan have been close for generations, and the survival of Korea is really related to my empire. The Russians have clearly made alliances with the Qing Dynasty and other countries, which is obvious. However, they occupied Manchuria. Once they had a place to breathe, they indulged in the ambition of annexation. In the future, if the land of Manchuria is incorporated into the Russian territory, how can Korea support Asia and maintain a peaceful situation? Therefore, I took this opportunity to discuss with the Russians, hoping to maintain peace for a long time and preserve the peace. I repeatedly ordered the officials to hold meetings with the Russians, and negotiated for more than half a year. The Russians outwardly wanted to make peace, but secretly prepared their armaments. The army and navy competed for power. At that time, I still thought of yielding to them, but the Russians were always indecisive and had no sincerity at all. I saw that Korea was facing imminent danger and was about to infringe on the rights and interests of the empire. Therefore, I launched a punitive expedition and met with them in armor. However, my original intention is still to hope to ensure that the country is strong and peaceful. How can I like war? I now tell you, my subjects, that you should each exert your loyalty and courage, work hard and join the army, to increase the glory of the empire, and to achieve boundless achievements, which is what I deeply rely on.

### The Situation of the Japanese Welcoming the Masters (From this newspaper, No. 11397, Guangxu Year 30, December 1st, corresponding to January 6th, 1905, Friday)

A certain Japanese newspaper in Tokyo reported: Our Japanese Navy Admiral Togo Heihachiro and Navy Vice Admiral Kamimura Hikonojo returned triumphantly from Lushun. It was pre-arranged that they would arrive at Shinbashi Railway Station at 9:30 am on December 30th, Meiji 37th. Earlier, the Japanese people who admired the prestige of the two admirals rushed to Shinbashi to pay their respects. Outside the railway station, Asahi Kōki emblems and national flags of various countries were hung all around, colorful and numbering in the thousands. Members of the Tokyo Chamber of Commerce, city councilors, ward councilors, and personnel from the Chamber of Commerce gathered in groups to watch, numbering no less than tens of thousands. Before long, the sound of wheels rumbled, arriving in front of the station. Mr. Togo, accompanied by Chief of Staff Mr. Shimamura, Staff Officer Mr. Akiyama, and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Nagata, alighted from the train in military uniform. Those who traveled with Mr. Kamimura included Chief of Staff Mr. Kato and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Ogoe. Following them were Imperial Envoy Mr. Inoue, Imperial Messenger Mr. Takeshima, and Empress's Chamberlain Mr. Yamauchi, Prince Higashifushimi, and Prince Fushimi Wakamiya, the two collateral princes, and Imperial Messengers from various princes, shaking hands warmly and expressing their respect. Then, Speaker of the House of Peers Mr. Tokugawa and Speaker of the House of Representatives Mr. Matsuda greeted each other. Chief of the General Staff Mr. Yamagata, Count Matsukata, Prime Minister Katsura, Minister of the Imperial Household Mr. Tanaka, Minister of the Navy Mr. Yamamoto, and various army and navy generals and officers, Governor of Tokyo Prefecture Mr. Chika, Mayor of Tokyo Mr. Ozaki, and thousands of other dignitaries from all walks of life welcomed them on the roadside. Admirals Togo and Kamimura then rode in carriages dispatched by the Imperial Household Ministry, heading directly to the Ministry of the Navy. Along the way, cries of "Banzai" were so loud that they seemed to echo like spring thunder from all sides. Everywhere they passed, every household hung the national flag. At Hibiya Park, hundreds of fireworks were set off. Outside the main gate of the Ministry of the Navy, the National Supporters Association erected a decorated arch to express their welcome. After the two admirals arrived at the Ministry of the Navy, the Imperial Palace dispatched Attendant Military Officer Mr. Inoue, and the General Headquarters sent Major General Mr. Murata and Aide-de-Camp Mr. Horiuchi to greet them. The two admirals met with Navy Minister Yamamoto in the minister's office according to etiquette, respectfully holding up a glass of champagne and shouting "Long live the Emperor! Long live the army and navy!" three times. When it was past 11:15, the two admirals rode in the Imperial carriage to enter the palace and be received in audience by the Emperor and Empress. Prince Arisugawa's chamberlain, Mr. Tokudaiji, secretary Mr. Iwakura, and attendant military officer Mr. Nagasawa were all in attendance. Navy Minister Yamamoto, Chief of the Naval General Staff Ito, and naval officers were divided into ranks and stood in attendance. The Emperor's voice was slow and gentle, expressing his appreciation. The two admirals then reported in detail the situation of the naval battles before and after the siege of Lushun. After the audience, the Emperor issued an edict, granting the two admirals and the Navy Minister, the Chief of the Naval General Staff, and others lunch. It was not until 2:20 pm that they left. Shortly after, the Emperor sent people to present each of the two admirals with a gold watch and a gift of wine and dishes. The officials below Mr. Shimamura were each given a gift of wine and dishes. Then, another table of delicacies and a jar of sake were sent to Mr. Togo's residence. That evening, the citizens of Tokyo planned to hold a large welcome party. Upon hearing this, Mr. Togo quickly wrote a letter of refusal, saying: "I am deeply grateful for your kindness. However, I am concerned that my subordinates are still exerting their strength on the battlefield, enduring the hardships of snow and wind. How can I alone bear such honors? My return to Tokyo is actually to obey the call of the General Headquarters to secretly plan important military affairs. I will soon have to go on an expedition again. I respectfully thank you, gentlemen, and urge you not to impose excessive honors and aggravate my faults." Therefore, the welcome party was cancelled.

### On the Strength of Japan (From this newspaper, No. 11371, Guangxu Year 30, November 5th, corresponding to December 11th, 1904, Sunday)

Japan is an island nation in the Eastern Sea. In terms of its territory, it is no more than 360 square miles wide and no more than 7,500 miles long, with an area of no more than 16 million square miles. Its territory can be said to be narrow. In terms of its people, the entire country has no more than 45.7 million people. In the densely populated areas of the home islands, there are 6,000 people per square mile. In the northeast, the population is gradually sparser. In Hokkaido, there are only 90 people per square mile. Its people can be said to be sparse. Before the Meiji era, the shogunate seized power, the lords guarded their domains, and foreign troubles pressed daily. It was deceived by strong neighbors, and the national power gradually declined, as precarious as a pile of eggs. The people were worried and forced to change their plans. They studied in Europe and America, studied their laws, and were of one mind from top to bottom, so they changed the old ways. The political system became constitutional, education flourished, military affairs became sophisticated, commerce expanded, products became richer, and crafts became better. For thirty years, they have been pursuing practical studies, working diligently, and feeling that there is not enough time in the day. The country has gradually become strong and can rival the major powers of Europe and America. Last year, because of the affairs of Korea and the affairs of the three eastern provinces of China, they started a war with the strong Russia, and exchanged jade and silk for weapons. At that time, all countries around the world were worried about Japan, worried about the size of Russia and the smallness of Japan, worried about the strength of Russia and the weakness of Japan. Once they went to war, the outcome could be predicted without saying. But after fighting for almost a year, Japan was not only not defeated, but also won repeatedly. The Russian navy had almost its entire fleet destroyed. The army had almost all of its occupied territory taken away. Russia is a country of tigers and wolves, and all countries in Europe and America fear it. But Japan, a small country in East Asia, was able to capture flags and kill generals, defeating its army and navy. Why is it so strong? Observers have said that since the Meiji Restoration, Japan has become constitutional in its political system, flourished in its education, sophisticated in its military affairs, expanded in its commerce, richer in its products, and better in its crafts. Without this, it could not have achieved such great results. I believe that this is indeed the way for Japan to become a strong country, but its origin is not only this. Japan's strength lies in the fact that everyone shares the same feeling of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, without dispersion or taking advantage of chaos, sincerely facing each other, and of one heart and one mind. They regard their emperor and country as if their lives are connected. If they are separated, they cannot live in the world. The country also regards the people as if they share life and death. Therefore, the upper and lower levels are connected in one breath, firmly united and unbreakable, and there is nothing that cannot be done to revitalize all things. Reforming the old system is effective. My friend Mr. Zhang, who studied in Japan, recently sent a letter saying: "After Japan went to war with Russia, the national spirit was even more aroused. Men focus all their energy on military affairs and fulfill their duties as travelers. Women focus all their energy on education and fulfill their duties as residents. Millions of dollars in conscription funds are raised in an instant." The so-called conscription funds are donated in the name of providing winter supplies for the soldiers. There was an old woman who was very poor. Her husband died in the Sino-Japanese War. She used the compensation money to buy a thimble, which she always carried with her as an honor. Recently, when she heard about the donation of conscription funds, she offered the thimble, but the donation office said that she was too poor and said, "This is a gift from the emperor as a souvenir. How can I bear to accept it from you?" The old woman went home, cut off her finger with a knife, and returned to the donation office to give it, saying: "The finger has been cut off. What is the use of this? Take it." There was also a small child who was also very poor. He hated the Russians, but he was too poor to donate the conscription funds, so he sold cakes in the market and donated his income every day. These two things are recorded in the newspapers and spread in the neighborhoods. They are not unfounded rumors. From this, we can know that the Japanese people's heart of loyalty to the emperor and love for the country is firmly rooted and cannot be uprooted. This is why they can resist the Russians. Is it just the effect of striving for everything after the Restoration? Although Japan's strength originates from the people's loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, if it does not first engage in the political system, military affairs, education, commerce, products, and crafts, then there is no way to encourage their aspirations and arouse their spirits. Therefore, those who establish a country should still establish their foundations in the political system, education, military affairs, commerce, products, and crafts, and then they can inspire the people to generate their loyalty to the emperor and love for the country. If you only talk about loyalty to the emperor and love for the country, but do not first do your best in the political system, education, military affairs, commerce, products, and crafts, it will be impossible.

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The glorious war results achieved by the Japanese naval forces in the South Pacific have been announced today, adding luster to the achievements of the Japanese army since the start of the war. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese navy attacked Hawaii first. Combining the subsequent naval battles such as the Battle of Malaya, the Japanese army achieved a total of 505 enemy ships destroyed, 484 vessels, and 4,826 enemy aircraft shot down and destroyed, creating an unprecedented record. Today, the navy has seized the initiative in combat, crushing the enemy's counterattacks and cutting off the US-Australia supply route. From May 5th to May 24th, a total of 13 enemy ships have been sunk in the waters there, totaling 111,400 tons. Among them, 2 15,000-ton oil tankers, totaling 30,000 tons, 6 cargo ships, totaling 57,000 tons, 1 11,000-ton, 3 10,000-ton, 1 8,000-ton, 1 7,000-ton and 1 other transport ship of 35,000-ton were sunk by submarines. The aircraft had sunk 1 transport ship of 7,000 tons, 1 ship of 1,500 tons, and 1 ship of 400 tons, totaling 9,400 tons. Moreover, the Japanese naval forces frequently attacked enemy submarines that appeared in the waters of the South Pacific and near the Japanese mainland. From April 1st to May 20th, a total of 17 enemy submarines were sunk, of which 7 were sunk by aircraft, and the other 10 were sunk by destroyers.

Manila, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - A certain colonel of the Japanese Philippine Islands dispatched naval forces gave a radio speech here today titled "Welcoming Navy Memorial Day under the Greater East Asia War." The general idea was that Navy Memorial Day is a day to commemorate Japan's defeat of the invaders forty years ago and to lay the foundation for Japan's century. Britain and the United States want to dominate the Pacific and the world, while Japan advocates its natural rights within its own territory. Navy Memorial Day is a day that implies that Japan will resolutely defeat Britain and the United States. The mortal combat between Japan and Britain and the United States began after the Russo-Japanese War. Although the Greater East Asia War is a long-term war, victory is already in our hands, and the rebirth of Greater East Asia will surely be realized soon.

Rome, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Italian newspaper editor Geda, on the occasion of the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day, published an article today praising the great achievements of the Japanese Navy in this East Asian war. At this time, the Italian people across the country have a better understanding of the Japanese Navy's combat power against the British and American navies. Moreover, since the Japanese Navy can cope with the British and American navies with ease in the Pacific, the responsibilities of the German and Italian navies in the Atlantic and the Italian navy in the Mediterranean are naturally greatly reduced. In addition, since the Japanese Navy can smoothly and firmly grasp its power in the Indian Ocean, the raw materials needed for the most important bases and anti-Axis military industrial needs of Britain and the United States have been almost completely plundered. Geda continued that the most important condition for the final victory of the current war is to gain maritime hegemony and prevent Britain and the United States from crossing the sea to reach their front lines. Therefore, the Axis powers must annihilate the enemy's warships and transport ships one by one, and in this respect, the Japanese Navy should be given the primary credit. It was a great mistake for Britain and the United States to try to reduce the equipment of the Japanese Navy at the Washington Conference. They did not know that spiritual power is sometimes greater than material power. In this war, with the assistance of its air force, the Japanese Navy has shown great capabilities in night raids and landing operations. Former Commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, Vice Admiral Yarnell, admitted that the Japanese Navy could not be defeated by the US military alone, and that is why.

### Allied Navy Memorial Day: National Government Scheduled to Celebrate

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The allied nation Japan destroyed the Imperial Russian Navy in the Sea of Japan on May 27th, 38 years ago, and achieved supreme war results. In order to commemorate this historically significant anniversary, the Japanese naval authorities specifically designated this day as Navy Memorial Day, which marks its 38th anniversary today. In order to commemorate this victory, the Japanese naval authorities stationed in Nanjing held a Navy Memorial Exhibition at the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association starting on the 24th, and screened advertising slides and other publicity materials at various movie theaters. In order to celebrate the victory of the East Asian national navy, the Publicity Department of the National Government's Navy Department has also scheduled a celebration at the Dahua Grand Theater at 7:30 pm on the 29th, and will have a day off. Large banners and publicity materials will be hung at all major intersections, and Japanese residences will fly flags for one day to celebrate.

Naval Minister Ren's Remarks

Nanjing, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - May 27th is the 38th Navy Memorial Day of the allied nation Japan. At this time, when the Japanese navy is soaring in the Pacific, threatening the Indian Ocean, and entering and exiting the Atlantic, the completion of the Greater East Asia Liberation War can be expected soon. The reconstruction of our navy also relies on the cooperation of the allied navy to lay the foundation. On this auspicious festival, the government and people of the allied nation unanimously celebrate enthusiastically. The officials and people of our country also feel gratified for this first naval battle to defend East Asia, and pay tribute to famous generals such as Marshal Togo, Marshal Yamamoto, and Lieutenant Commander Hirose, the souls of the allied navy. The reporter specially visited Navy Minister Admiral Ren Yuandao on the 25th and was honored to receive his remarks, acknowledging that the Japanese navy's decades of meritorious service in defending East Asia is a model to follow, and hoping that the joint Sino-Japanese fleet will appear on the Pacific Ocean together in the future. The Naval Minister Ren's remarks are recorded below: "In the 38th year of Meiji, Marshal Togo, a holy general of Japan, led the combined fleet and fought bravely, annihilating the Imperial Russian Baltic Fleet on May 27th. This great war result can be said to be illustrious in the world, so Japan has designated this May 27th as Navy Memorial Day to commemorate this great achievement, which has now been 38 years of history. Japan uses this May 27th to commemorate the navy, its significance is very profound, not only arousing the patriotic heart of the people, especially Japan's consistent work to eliminate European and American aggression and protect the integrity of East Asia, this battle is the starting point. Therefore, the meaning of Navy Memorial Day is to fully express the spirit of Japanese morality, and now it has become a memorial day for the entire East Asian moral spirit. Its scope has actually expanded from the navy to the entire nation, and from Japan to the entire East Asia. At that time, the Imperial Russian naval forces had a tendency to dominate the Pacific. For the sake of its own survival and the preservation of East Asia, Japan resolutely fought against Imperial Russia. In the decisive battle, the Japanese navy, under the command of Marshal Togo, used its belief that every battle would be won, and finally annihilated the Imperial Russian navy of equal strength, captured its warships, and captured its main generals. The greatness of the war results was unprecedented. This was all due to the consistent unity of the navy generals and soldiers, who held the utmost sincerity of loyalty to the emperor and serving the country, so they only counted on fighting bravely to kill the enemy and did not care about anything else. This kind of determination is extremely admirable. Now when we think of Marshal Togo's encouragement to the generals and soldiers, there is a training speech that the rise and fall of the empire are at stake in this battle, and his generous and impassioned attitude can express the great spirit of our East Asian nation, and naturally we cannot help but be excited to the extreme." Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese navy has used its traditional spirit to cooperate with the army and air force to destroy the evil forces of Britain and the United States in Asia. Now, on the occasion of the 38th Navy Memorial Day, Japan celebrates it enthusiastically throughout the country. All of our East Asian nations feel the same, especially the emerging naval officers and soldiers of our country should learn from the spirit of the pioneers and jointly shoulder the responsibility of liberating East Asia.

### The Soul of the Navy (3): Admiral Togo on the Mikasa

— Tsuruzo Ishii

"Regarding the newly arrived enemy fleet, I swear to sink it to reassure His Majesty," was the answer of Admiral Togo, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, to the Emperor's concerns before commanding the great naval battle of the Sea of Japan. At this time, the Admiral already had a plan in mind.

Not long after, on May 27, 38th year of Meiji, the Great General Headquarters issued the first report: "Upon receiving the alert that the old enemy had been discovered, the Combined Fleet immediately set out to prepare to defeat the enemy. Although the sky was clear that day, the waves were quite high." At 1:30 pm, our main force met the enemy's main force for the first time. As the distance between them gradually decreased to 8,000 meters, Commander Togo, who had been silently staring at the enemy, raised his right hand very high and suddenly waved it to the left. Chief of Staff Kato understood the Commander's intention and ordered, "Captain, go forward at full speed." As a result, he rushed to the front of the enemy ship and gained the advantage of overwhelming the enemy's front row. The outcome of the battle had already been decided in less than half an hour of shelling. The reason for this was actually due to the Commander Togo's wave of his right hand to the left. Assuming that the body was hit by enemy bullets and the war could achieve the most effective result, that was based on the belief that victory was certain, and this wave of the hand had such a profound meaning.

### German Air Force Active on the Eastern Front, Destroys a Large Soviet Aircraft Factory: Germany Clears Soviet Guerrillas on a Large Scale

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The German Presidential Headquarters announced the battle situation in a communiqué at noon on the 25th as follows: (1) On the Eastern Front, German assault teams have begun operations in several areas. (2) The German Air Force will bombard Soviet railway facilities and bomb a large Soviet aircraft factory in the middle reaches of the Volga River.

Berlin, 25th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Colonel Hama, a correspondent for the German News Agency Lishton, said that both sides are stepping up preparations for large-scale military activities on the Eastern Front. Strong Soviet troops can be seen concentrated in the western Caucasus near the Kuban bridgehead. Heavy troops are being assembled in the center between Moscow and Kursk, and south of Leningrad District Moscow. It is certain that a lot of weapons have been deployed there, along with strong tank units and mechanized detachments. The number of Soviet troops concentrated in the lower reaches of the Kuban River is smaller, but the project is important. The public believes that the Soviet army plans to launch large-scale military operations against the German southern wing and the northern part of the central region, as it did in the winter of last year. What the German army intends to do is still unknown. In addition to preparing to resist the expected Soviet summer offensive, the German army command also has many divisions and offensive troops to allocate. Therefore, the German army's military operations on the Eastern Front are completely unaffected by the Soviet army's actions.

Berlin, 26th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to military sources from the German New Open News Agency, the German army began a large-scale sweep of Soviet guerrillas operating behind the German lines on Sunday. One of the teams, which was resupplied by the Soviet army from the air and waterways, has been cleared. The German army destroyed more than 120 bunkers and more than 20 other guerrilla camps, which were filled with large quantities of military supplies and food. The German army also discovered and destroyed them. The German army's dispatch this time was assisted by Russian volunteer soldiers, which was very effective.

### Director Hagi of the News Department Gives a Speech in Yokohama

(Continued from yesterday) Equipment and objects can be produced as much as possible, but manpower is not the same. How will the British and Americans replenish the countless deaths, injuries, and illnesses of the three services of sea, land, and air? It is questionable. In addition, the sailors of the sea transport, which is regarded as the lifeline of the United States and Britain, have already suffered significant depletion, and their efficiency is also declining day by day. All of this is a confirmed fact. In the air battles in the Solomon Islands, New Guinea, and Burma, their casualties were ten times higher than ours. This is enough to prove that their quality is also extremely low because of the difficulty in replenishing air force soldiers. Secondly, in terms of the time issue, there is no doubt that the longer the war lasts, the more it will benefit the Axis powers. Japan has now established an invincible political and military posture in the mainland and the Pacific. The strategy of fighting while building and using war to support war is quickly and smoothly becoming a reality. This is well known. Given the years, Japan has formed a posture that cannot be broken no matter how strong the world is united. This has been repeatedly pointed out by the Chongqing government and the Australian authorities. The Greater East Asia War is not a war of destruction and consumption, but a war of construction and production. As a result of the war, Japan has now become a completely resource-rich country. In a long-term war of attrition, it can exert great power. The United States has reached its peak in production by the end of this year, and the situation after that may decline. Therefore, the longer the war is prolonged, the weaker the war power will be for the United States and Britain. To give an example, from the perspective of the British and American shipping relationship, the combined shipbuilding capacity of the two countries is 10 million tons per year, and the number of ships sunk is about one million tons per month. In that case, the ship retention of the United States and Britain must continue to decline, and they will inevitably face a time when they break their retention of [ ] million tons. In the message submitted by Roosevelt to the 78th Congress of the United States, he said that 1943 was the year of attack, and it was decided to counterattack from the Aleutian Islands in the north, strengthen support for Chongqing in the west, increase the air force stationed in Chongqing, counterattack Burma, and consolidate the bases of the Solomon Islands and New Guinea in the south. It attempts to tighten the encirclement of Japan, and even advocates launching air raids on the Japanese mainland, even at the cost of any major sacrifices. Therefore, there will be many changes in the future war situation, and temporary local losses may be possible, but considering the vastness of the war zone and the length of the war, temporary local fluctuations are not enough to affect the final war situation, and there is no need to be happy or worried. All our people should unite as one, and we are sure that there will be a glorious victory on this road of war. (The end)

### Near the Aleutian Islands, a Major Battle is Imminent

Stockholm, 26th (Central News Agency) - American naval commentator Herbert stated yesterday in a broadcast on the British Broadcasting Corporation that prominent American naval experts predict that the American and Japanese navies will soon engage in a major battle in the Aleutian Islands. He pointed out that the sudden appearance of Japanese aircraft over Attu Island suggests that Japanese aircraft carriers are operating near the Aleutian Islands, thus indicating a large Japanese naval force in the area.

Argentina, the capital, 26th (Central News Agency) - The U.S. Navy Department has neither denied nor confirmed the reports from the Japanese Imperial Headquarters regarding the achievements of the Japanese naval air force and submarine units in the waters off Attu Island. Regarding the battle situation on Attu Island, U.S. Navy Secretary Knox, when meeting with a group of reporters on the 25th, only stated that, regarding the battle situation on Attu Island, there was nothing to add beyond what has already been published in the Navy Department's official announcements, but that the fighting is still ongoing.

### Marshal Yamamoto's Spirit Lives On

Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto killed in action! The death of Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, commander of the Japanese Combined Fleet, is not a dream, but an undeniable fact. Marshal Yamamoto first launched the attack that destroyed the American fleet at Hawaii, achieving a victory unprecedented in naval history, which Japan has since secured. The Japanese navy revered Marshal Yamamoto like a benevolent father, and countless citizens admired Marshal Yamamoto as a peerless hero. Since the start of the Greater East Asia War a year and a half ago, the men of the naval air force have become the masters of the Pacific. Marshal Yamamoto led from the front, taking to the skies in his aircraft, commanding operations across a vast front of thousands of miles. Unfortunately, he fell victim to enemy counterattacks, and this loyal, heroic, and renowned general became a guardian spirit of the nation on the southern seas.

Alas! Though Admiral Yamamoto has given his life, the "Yamamoto Spirit" that we know is immortal and will continue to bear the task of defending the Pacific! The "Yamamoto Spirit" moved the hearts and minds of countless young admirals who will follow in his footsteps... In the past year and a half of the Greater East Asia War, the patriotic fervor of every individual who has sacrificed their lives has reached a boiling point. May the heroic spirit of Marshal Yamamoto watch over us, as countless citizens rise up with unwavering determination to engage and defeat the enemy ahead!

Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto was born on April 4th, Meiji 17 (1884), in Nagaoka City, Niigata Prefecture. He was the fourth son of Sadakichi Takano, a retainer of the Nagaoka domain. At the time of Marshal Yamamoto's birth, his father was already fifty-six years old, hence the name "Isoroku" (fifty-six). His family was poor but honorable, and he was diligent and hardworking. He was intelligent from a young age. The Yamamoto family, a prominent family in the area, had no heir, so he was adopted, and thus changed his surname. Marshal Yamamoto was a natural-born military leader and had aspirations for the navy from childhood. In November of Meiji 37 (1904), he graduated from the Naval Academy. His classmates included Admirals Shiozawa, Yoshida, and Shimada, as well as Vice Admiral Teikichi Hori. At that time, the Russo-Japanese War was raging. Marshal Yamamoto, as an ensign candidate, served on the battleship Nisshin of the First Fleet. In May of Meiji 38 (1905), he participated in the Battle of Tsushima, where he was struck by shrapnel, losing two fingers on his left hand and suffering severe burns to his right leg. The following year, the government awarded him a military injury medal. The Marshal, who was wounded while fighting for his country, was honored with the first injury medal.

In Taisho 4 (1915), he was appointed a lieutenant commander in the navy. In Taisho 5 (1916), he graduated from the Naval War College. In Taisho 8 (1919), he was dispatched to the United States as a naval attaché, where he meticulously studied the American situation. Before long, Marshal Yamamoto was not only familiar with the U.S. Navy, but also had a deep understanding of the general American character. This was the result of his diligent study while in the United States. It is said that Marshal Yamamoto had the following anecdote while in the United States:

When Marshal Yamamoto was in the United States, he never frequented social gatherings with wine and women. Instead, whenever he had free time, he would go to the shooting range to practice his artillery skills. He often said: "When Japan cannot achieve something with brains, I will solve it with strength."

One day, Marshal Yamamoto visited the Naval Academy in Annapolis. He entered a classroom and saw a war game diagram of a future Pacific war between Japan and the United States drawn on the blackboard. At that moment, the American instructor, seeing a Japanese officer visiting, hurriedly said: "We are lecturing on the current situation in the Pacific." Marshal Yamamoto strode into the classroom, smiled, and said: "Excuse me for interrupting. We will meet again in the Pacific someday!"

In Taisho 10 (1921), when the Washington Naval Conference began, Marshal Yamamoto, stationed in Boston, was summoned to Washington to assist plenipotentiary representative Kijuro Shidehara, along with Admiral Nagano, the current Chief of the Naval General Staff. Marshal Yamamoto, who detested compromise, revealed his determination to stand firm to all the representatives. In December of the same year, he returned to Japan and taught at the Naval War College, passing on all the knowledge he had acquired in the United States to his students. In view of the tense situation following the Washington Naval Conference regarding naval arms reduction, he was once again ordered abroad in Taisho 12 (1923), visiting various countries in Europe and America. In the same year, he was promoted to captain. The following year, he returned to Japan and became the chief professor and adjutant of the Kasumigaura Air Group.

Marshal Yamamoto had long emphasized expanding the naval aviation force and was willing to take on the difficult task of cultivating future airmen. This was the beginning of his efforts.

In Taisho 14 (1925), he was dispatched as a naval attaché to the Japanese Embassy in the United States, becoming the unrivaled expert on America in the navy. In Showa 3 (1928), he was appointed captain of the cruiser Isuzu, and then captain of the aircraft carrier Akagi. In Showa 4 (1929), he was promoted to rear admiral. At the London Naval Conference in the same year, he went as a specialist committee member under Vice Admiral Sakonji, assisting plenipotentiary representatives Wakatsuki and Takarabe. Through the Washington and London Naval Conferences, Marshal Yamamoto was fully confident in the future of naval aviation. After returning, he put this ideal into practice. In Showa 5 (1930), he was appointed head of the Naval Aviation Department of Technology, and in Showa 8 (1933), he became commander of the 1st Air Fleet, working hard to train the naval air force.

In Showa 9 (1934), he was specially dispatched as the representative of the Japanese Empire to London to attend the preliminary negotiations for the Naval Arms Reduction Conference. "Isoroku Yamamoto's name shook the world, maneuvering between the cunning British and American Ministers of War, attracting attention." While actively involved in London, he was promoted to vice admiral. In Showa 10 (1935), the preliminary negotiations were completed, and he returned to Japan without dishonoring his mission, maintaining Japan's consistent position of equal naval power with Britain and the United States. During those preliminary negotiations, the current Minister of the Imperial Household, Matsudaira, like Representative Yamamoto, strongly opposed British and American tactics, advocating for the establishment of equal military rights and the abolition of the ratio system, expressing a firm attitude of no retreat.

In Showa 10 (1935), he was appointed head of the Naval Aviation Department. In Showa 11 (1936), he served as Vice Minister under Naval Minister Nagano, and in Showa 12 (1937), when Admiral Yonai joined the cabinet as Naval Minister, Marshal Yamamoto continued to serve as Vice Minister, continuing to assist Admiral Yonai. Subsequently, during the Konoe and Hiranuma cabinets, Admiral Yonai remained in office, and the internal affairs of the Navy remained orderly and unchaotic, thanks to these military and political skills, creating today's invincible naval force.

In August of Showa 14 (1939), he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, bearing the fate of the nation on his shoulders. In the stormy Pacific, he did not yield one step to Britain and the United States. All this relied on Admiral Yamamoto laying the firm foundation of the Japanese Navy during his lifetime. In November of Showa 15 (1940), he was promoted to admiral at the same time as Admirals Yoshida and Shimada. Under the leadership of Marshal Yamamoto, the navy was actively trained in preparation for any eventuality. On December 8th, Showa 16 (1941), the Imperial Rescript declaring war on Britain and the United States was promulgated, shaking the world and changing the tactics of naval warfare forever. The successful surprise attack on Pearl Harbor was the immortal pyramid built by Marshal Yamamoto, and the achievement of the naval air force trained by him. For the past twenty years, after the Washington and London Treaties, the Japanese Navy endured one humiliation after another, finally breaking the weakness of the ratio with Britain and the United States in the Battle of Hawaii, creating an unprecedented feat in history.

His Majesty the Emperor commended the great achievements of the Navy and again bestowed an Imperial Rescript to encourage Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, no military honor was greater than that of Marshal Yamamoto. Upon receiving the Imperial command, the Marshal vowed to dedicate himself completely to repay the Emperor's grace. Since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy's brilliant achievements have astonished the world. While its success was undoubtedly due to divine favor, it was also largely due to the Marshal's many years of hard work. Moreover, the Marshal's proper management of the military, his frequent visits to the front lines to encourage the officers and men, or to comfort the wounded soldiers, and his sharing of hardships with the soldiers at the front, greatly inspired them.

He died on the 4th of this month, bravely killed in action while leading operations on the front lines. The supreme commander of a great naval power sacrificing his life for his country in battle is unprecedented since Nelson's death at the Battle of Trafalgar. The people of the entire nation, who had hoped for his triumphant return, could not help but express their infinite grief at the Marshal's death. Marshal Yamamoto, who had always been committed to living and dying with the Imperial Navy, was able to give his life under the wings of the naval air force he had nurtured. It can be said that this was the Marshal's long-cherished wish. As the saying goes, "to die in the right place," Marshal's martyrdom can be said to be worthy of his life.

### Today is Japanese Navy Day; Grand Celebrations Unfold; Captain Kamada Discusses Naval Construction

Today is Japanese Navy Day, and various grand celebrations are being held in this city. The Japanese Naval Fleet Press Department especially invited reporters from the Central News Agency and various newspapers to a reception at 3:30 PM yesterday (the 26th) in the department's conference room. Captain Kamada, head of the Fleet Press Department, presided, with Masao Kawasaki serving as the translator.

Standards of Ship Age

The chairman first delivered a speech, stating in essence: The reason for inviting everyone today is that tomorrow is Japanese Navy Day. Furthermore, considering that everyone visited the Izumo warship yesterday, I hope you will freely express your opinions and, in your news reports, awaken a deep understanding of the navy's importance among your countrymen. The nation should urgently mobilize to build up the navy. The Izumo warship, which you inspected yesterday, was built in Meiji 32 (1899) and is now an outdated warship. The construction of the Japanese Navy is progressing daily. According to the naval standards of various countries around the world, the service life of large warships is 24 years, while that of smaller warships is 16 years. Therefore, the Izumo warship is only used for coastal defense. Therefore, the United States' propaganda of transferring 50 old warships to Britain is, in fact, of no use, and we need not overemphasize it.

Two Great Records

Japan has achieved two great records in two major naval battles, which have given the world a new understanding of the navy. First, in the Russo-Japanese War, Japan annihilated the Tsarist Russian fleet. At the time, all countries were shocked, and it was recognized that cannons could penetrate the iron armor of warships. As a result, countries began researching the firepower of cannons. Second, in the current Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy deployed naval aircraft to sink the British battleship Prince of Wales with torpedoes. As a result, countries recognized that modern warships should study how to avoid being sunk by aircraft. Therefore, countries simultaneously recognized that the navy should be supported by the air force to achieve greater effectiveness.

Chinese Navy

Finally, a reporter raised the question of building a Chinese navy. Captain Kamada then delivered his great insights, stating that China already had a powerful navy in the Yuan Dynasty, which had even sent expeditions to Hungary. At that time, Japan did not yet have such large ships. Japan's naval construction began in the Meiji era and has taken 91 years to reach its current state. To revitalize East Asia, a powerful East Asian navy must be built. Since China and Japan share a common destiny, Japan should pay close attention to the suggestions for building a Chinese navy. Therefore, I earnestly hope that newspaper reporters will take on the responsibility of promoting this, so that the entire nation gains a new understanding of the navy and unites to work diligently for naval construction. The meeting adjourned at 5:30 PM.

### Information Department Head Hirota Explains American Immigration Law

The spokesman of the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai Office, Information Department Head Hirota, expressed his views on the recently proposed amendment to the Chinese Exclusion Act by the U.S. Senate during the regular meeting of the Chinese newspaper reporter group in this city at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 26th).

Prohibition of Entry

First, he cited the Chinese Exclusion Act, one of the American anti-Chinese laws, which began in 1882 and was formally passed by the U.S. government in 1923. It stipulated that Chinese citizens who had not naturalized as American citizens were prohibited from entering the country. Even those requesting entry for special reasons were restricted according to the immigration quota of each country, allowing only 107 Chinese immigrants per year. At the same time, it also restricted Japanese people from going to the United States. As a result, the Japanese government lodged a serious protest. The Japanese ambassador to Washington, Uehara Masanao, sent a note to the U.S. government, which stated in essence: Based on the principles of relations between nations, Japanese people, even if they have not naturalized as American citizens, should have the right to enter the United States. Otherwise, this discriminatory treatment would be a great insult, which the Japanese government greatly regrets. However, because the friendly relations between Japan and the United States must continue to be maintained, it is hoped that there will be some improvement. If this provision remains, it may cause serious consequences in the future, which this ambassador cannot foresee.

Complete Reckoning

After the U.S. received this protest, not only did it fail to improve the situation, but it also followed its usual practice, interpreting the phrase "serious consequences" in the protest as a threat from Japan and demanding that the Japanese government recall its ambassador to Washington. At the time, the Japanese people were greatly angered by this issue and repeatedly protested, but they were met with unreasonable arguments from the United States, which became increasingly severe and unresolved. As a result, the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War can be said to have been mainly caused by this immigration law. The humiliation we felt in the past will be completely reckoned in this war, in order to resolve the issue. Regarding the recent proposal by U.S. Senators Cain and others in the Senate to amend the Chinese Exclusion Act, it is actually a wartime expedient by the U.S. government. Its intention is that the U.S. is aware of the inadequacy of its material aid to Chongqing, which has aroused resentment from Chongqing. Especially at present, when Chongqing is showing a tendency to break away from the anti-Axis powers, the U.S. is using its usual tactics to amend the immigration law in the hope of easing the situation and winning over Chongqing. From the standpoint of the Chinese people, it is not only the United States that adopts restrictions on Chinese immigration.

The Shame of East Asia

That includes Britain and its territories, such as Canada, India, Australia, Malaya, South Africa, and Central and South America. Furthermore, Britain passed the Land Act in the South African Union, which prohibits Indian people from owning land. This is a law to exclude Indian people, showing that both Britain and the United States despise the nations of East Asia, which is a shame for the nations of East Asia. Therefore, cooperation between Chongqing and Britain and the United States will be difficult to achieve the ultimate goal. Chongqing's attitude of opposing East Asian national cooperation is a mistake on Chongqing's part. This American immigration law is not only a problem for the Chinese people, but also a problem for the hundreds of millions of people in East Asia. All East Asian nations should rise up and resist. Therefore, Britain and the United States despise East Asia, and not only China and Japan must stand up, but all East Asian people should rise up to drive out the evil influence of Britain and the United States in East Asia.

### Shanghai-Dalian Athletic Meet; To Be Held on June 20th at Noon; Chinese Athletes Must Register Within Two Days

In addition, there will be a soccer match between a combined team of Chinese, Japanese, and Italian players in Shanghai against Dalian. Preliminary selections will be held on June 6th. Chinese athletes who wish to participate can register with Mr. Zhou Jiaqi at the Shanghai Special Municipality Sports Association, Room 306, Jingan Building, 749 Jingan Temple Road, Public Concession, before the 29th of this month. The phone number is 31412.

### Cooking Oil Distribution Period

According to reliable information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter from the cooking oil wholesale office, the authorities have approved a special allocation of oil for restaurants and taverns, and distribution will begin immediately. At the same time, it is also learned that the cooking oil wholesale association has begun processing the third-round household oil distribution, which is expected to be widely available by the end of this month, or at the latest, the beginning of next month.

### Consumer Cooperative Seeking Members

The citizens' consumer cooperative has been actively operating since its establishment and is seeking 50,000 members within a 10-day period. Members of various trade associations can obtain application forms from their respective associations, fill them out, and submit them for membership.

### Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters Expresses Condolences for Marshal Yamamoto

Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, led the Japanese Navy in the naval battles of Hawaii and Malaya at the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, achieving outstanding feats. Now, unfortunately, he has died a heroic death in battle. The news of his death has shocked the world. Ling Xianwen, Chairman of the Shanghai Special Municipality Party Headquarters, specially dispatched Section Chief Du Mengsen to the Japanese Navy Attache Office in Shanghai to express his deep respect and condolences.

### Welfare Association Teas to Welcome Ambassador Sawada

Former Japanese Ambassador to France Sawada and Minister Yanai arrived in Shanghai by plane from Tokyo the day before yesterday (the 25th) for an inspection. They will stay for five or six days, then go to Hankou, Nanjing, and other places, and then go north. Ambassador Sawada is a well-known figure in the Japanese diplomatic circle. His elder brother is also a diplomat and served as ambassador to the United States. The brothers look very much alike, and they are often mistaken for each other at meetings, which is a popular anecdote. The chairman and vice-chairmen of the Shanghai Citizens Welfare Association, Wen Lantao, Lin Kanghou, and Zhao Jinqing, and all the directors will hold a tea party at the Conluxe Hotel at 4:30 PM tomorrow (the 28th) to welcome them.

### Japanese Authorities in Shanghai Decide to Jointly Host Press Corps Weekly

The Japanese authorities in Shanghai will host the regular meetings of the Chinese press corps in the city every Wednesday and Thursday. According to sources, the Japanese Embassy's Shanghai office and the Army and Navy will jointly hold these meetings every Friday at the Hui Zhong Hotel on Nanjing Road.

### Regulations on the Sale of Rationed Cigarettes Not Effective

According to sources close to the cigarette rationing authorities, retailers often sell a very small number of the allocated cigarettes to the public at the set price, while reselling the rest elsewhere. Two weeks ago, the Central China Tobacco Rationing Association issued trade regulations. However, even the clause "Businesses should announce the quantity of cigarettes allocated and the date of allocation at the storefront" has been completely undermined because retailers do not have fixed hours for selling goods. According to a widespread survey conducted yesterday, it was learned that the trade regulations set by the Central China Tobacco Rationing Association have not had any effect, and the regulation prohibiting children from buying rationed cigarettes at the set price has also not been implemented in practice. The rationing authorities had declared that if retailers violated the trade regulations, the supply of rationed cigarettes would be suspended. According to well-informed sources, rationed cigarettes are often found in nightclubs and other entertainment venues, where they are sold at inflated prices.

### Arcadia Ballroom Night Party

### Female Teacher Dies After Being Humiliated, Public Outrage in the Education Sector

Ms. Liu Wangmin, a woman from Anhui, residing at No. 4, Lane 393, Pingliang Road, is 41 years old. Her 13-year-old son, Liu Junzhi, is a student at the Sacred Heart Elementary School in the same lane. On the 18th of this month, Liu Junzhi had an argument with a classmate during class and was reprimanded by his homeroom teacher, Su Yizhi. Unexpectedly, Liu Junzhi returned home and complained to his mother, Liu Wangmin, who became very angry. She rushed to the school and, without asking for details, slapped Teacher Su twice. Teacher Su, feeling humiliated, swallowed her anger and did not resist. On the 24th, Liu Junzhi again had an argument with a student named Zhang. After returning home, his mother rushed to the school again and used barbaric methods. In addition to slapping Su Yizhi, she also punched her in the chest and abdomen. As a result, Su suddenly died. The principal reported the incident to the Yulin Road Police Station, where Deputy Detective Jiang Linxiang and Detective Chen Fukang were assigned to investigate. The body was transported to the autopsy station for examination. Liu Wangmin was arrested and taken to the police station. Yesterday morning, she was sent to the Second Criminal Division of the First Special Court. In addition to explaining the case, the police requested that she be detained because Su's body had not yet been examined. Judge Du approved the detention of Liu Wangmin pending examination of the body. After this incident, the education sector was particularly outraged. Yesterday, colleagues jointly appealed to all sectors for assistance for the deceased. They also took a petition to the Municipal Government's Social Affairs Bureau and other agencies at 4 p.m. yesterday to request assistance. The deceased's family has only one sister and a young brother, and her life has been disrupted, so her situation after death is very bleak, and funeral expenses must also rely on relatives and friends to find a way.

Economic World Translations and Essays

### The Significance of Food Treasury Bonds

The National Government issued 400 million yuan of food treasury bonds, entrusting the Central Reserve Bank to release them to all parties.

This policy makes many contributions to the food problem and the general price problem. The funds obtained from the sale of food treasury bonds are all used for the rice purchase and allocation business under the supervision of the Food Department. This will not only promote the efficiency of the above-mentioned business, but also absorb a large amount of floating capital in Shanghai and other cities, casting an effective method on the crux of the price problem. In terms of economic significance, it is quite significant.

In addition to first mountain China Banking Corporation and insurance companies, enterprise trust companies, etc., purchasing a considerable amount, the issuance method of food treasury bonds also encourages the public to purchase, and Japanese financial institutions also purchase as much as possible. In addition, the released treasury bonds can be repurchased by the Reserve Bank when necessary, or used as collateral for loans. The intention is extremely thorough. Looking at the above measures and extrapolating from the economic situation of the peaceful area, it is expected that the issuance of food treasury bonds will definitely be successful.

One more point worth noting is that this food extension bond has a term of only one year and an extremely low interest rate of only 4.5%. If it can be digested quickly and achieve the predetermined results, it will be equivalent to the peace government gaining a great victory in finance.

Issuing 400 million yuan of food treasury bonds to absorb floating capital and give it a proper outlet will definitely make a major contribution to the general price policy. There is no other way to suppress prices than to absorb surplus purchasing power. The self-discipline of financial institutions and the contraction of loans have a major effect on suppressing rising prices. However, now that the issuance of food treasury bonds has been decided, the process of self-discipline will inevitably be further promoted, and the rising trend of prices can also be easily suppressed. The figure of 400 million yuan is not too large compared with the figure of hoarding, but absorbing 400 million yuan of floating capital has a significant economic significance.

We hope that the National Government authorities will make every effort to promote the digestion of treasury bonds. At the same time, we believe that the Japanese side will also provide full assistance to support the National Government to achieve this goal. (Yunpeng: Translated from the May 26th Mainland News)

Reserve Bank

### Undertaking Class A Food Treasury Bonds Promoting Transfer Banks and Money Shops Treasury Bonds Can Also Be Mortgaged for Loans

In order to meet the needs of the financial community, the Central Reserve Bank has decided to promote the transfer of the Class A food treasury bonds it undertakes to banks, trust companies, money shops, and private individuals. The issuance of this type of treasury bond is not only beneficial to financial institutions in terms of the disposal of floating capital, but can also guide floating capital into the right track, becoming a good mechanism for capital operation. At the same time, by digesting the abundant funds in the market through food treasury bonds, it can flow back to the Central Reserve Bank. Solving the price problem, which is of concern to the whole of China, is really beneficial. In addition, if financial institutions that have purchased food treasury bonds need funds in the future, they can be taken in at the original interest rate at any time, and they can also use the treasury bonds as collateral to apply for low-interest loans from the Central Reserve Bank.

### Director Liao of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station Visited Shanghai to Inspect the Cotton Seed Field

Mr. Liao Jianan, Director of the Central Agricultural Experiment Station, led Senior Technician Gu Boming to Shanghai yesterday. Accompanied by Director Shao of the Shanghai Cotton Management Office of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, they visited the Beiqiao Cotton Field. Mr. Liao highly praised the facilities of the field and the various ongoing experimental works. Director Shao also discussed in detail the plan of the Shanghai Cotton Management Area. In addition to the Beiqiao Breeding Field, there are also the Pudong Yangsi Breeding Field and the Chongming Breeding Field. For the promotion of the entire cotton crop, it is also planned to contribute to the Central Government, dividing Central China into three major cotton promotion areas, namely, the Suhuai-Subei and northern Anhui area as a demonstration field, located near Ningshu, with Ningshu as the center; the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-eastern Zhejiang area as the second area, with Shanghai as the center; and the area along the Yangtze River, Jiangxi, Hubei, and southern Anhui as the third area, with the area near Jiujiang as the center. He also requested the Central Agricultural Institute to provide specific guidance and train middle and lower-level technical personnel to be assigned to each place to meet urgent needs.

### Various Groups Convened the First Representative Symposium Yesterday to Discuss Many Important Economic Cases

Superintendent Ozawa Sei

### Oil and Grain Specialized Committee to be Established Commercial Control Association Has Not Yet Decided

Since its establishment, the internal organization of the National Commercial Control General Association, in addition to the completion of the organization of various departments and the handling of material movement permits, is actively urging the organization of the joint associations of various industries in the lower part. At present, the Chemical Industry and Soap and Candle Industry Joint Association and the Flour and Wheat Specialized Committee have been established, and the trade associations of other industries can be decided to be formed by the end of this month. Regarding the Oil and Grain Specialized Committee, it was rumored yesterday that it had been formally formed. According to a report by a Central News Agency reporter who inquired with the Commercial Control Association, it is unreliable, and the association is still considering whether the Oil and Grain Specialized Committee needs to be organized, so the various rumors are false propaganda, and the association is conducting an investigation.

### The Formation of Trade Associations is Postponed for Half a Month

The National Commercial Control General Association's lower-level organization, the Trade Association of Various Industries, was originally scheduled to be completely organized and established by the end of this month. It is now learned that the Commercial Control Association, in view of the fact that the organizational work of the various associations is being actively carried out, but the time is too short, it may be difficult to completely organize and establish them before the end of this month, so it has postponed the deadline by another half month, setting the deadline for all the associations to be formally announced as established by June 15.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks showed some strength at first, but suddenly turned flat and weak at noon. This is because, after a long period of stock price declines, it is not easy for all parties to boost morale for a while. The current sellers are still waiting to see how things develop. Before the end of the month, it is feared that the market will be in a state of fluctuation. Trading is not active, and the new pharmaceutical industry is showing significant prosperity. China-France Pharmacy and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory have both risen close to the threshold. Among the public utilities, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Power are stagnant at their previous prices, with little trading. Nanyang Tobacco Company showed little change; Da Zhonghua Match Factory alone saw a decline. Wing On Company rebounded strongly, while Sincere and National Goods Company also saw an increase. The cultural industry remained stagnant. Commercial Press, China Book Company, and World Book Company all showed no change. Among the textile industry, Wing On Textile and Mei Ya Silk Factory are both making progress. Other miscellaneous stocks such as Zhongxing Timber, Jingfu Woodworking Machine, and Tongyi Trust were all firm. Jiu'an Industrial and Xin Yi Real Estate showed a stagnant trend. China Clock Factory remained weak, and there were buyers only at face value. There was little trading in financial and food stocks.

### Coal Briquettes Will Not Increase in Price Stores Already Have Legal Profits

Recently, there have been widespread rumors that coal briquettes will increase in price again, but this is unfounded. It is hoped that the current price of coal briquettes will remain unchanged, and there is no possibility of change. As for the raw materials (coal) used to manufacture coal briquettes, they mainly come from Hebei and Korea. Because the source is continuous, the bottom stock is also very full. However, the current production price has increased slightly, increasing by 7 Central Reserve Notes per ton, and transportation costs have also increased slightly by 12 yuan compared with the past. However, manufacturers have not been threatened in any way, because the price of coal briquettes has increased from 25 yuan per dan to 32.5 yuan (650 yuan per ton), and the factory price is 550 yuan per ton, so manufacturers can get a net profit of more than 100 yuan per ton, and retailers can get about 70 yuan. In addition, the Association of Hot Water Shops has requested to resume selling "hot water at the flat price per catty of coal." It is now learned that the Coal Number Association is very sympathetic to the situation of the industry, especially the price of coal supplied to Tiger Stove for combustion. The person in charge of the Hot Water Shop Association is still considering it.

### Not Many New Broad Beans are Transported to Shanghai

Broad beans, a supplementary food for the people, have now reached the season for new production. It is said that at the beginning of flowering, it was affected by the climate, but recently the weather has been good, and the harvest is considered not bad, and 60-70% of the large ones can be predicted in the countryside. However, the general people mostly pick them to fill their hunger, so it is difficult to expect too many to be transported to Shanghai.

### Activities of Various Trade Associations

Chemical Industry The Chemical Industry Joint Association, a lower-level organization of the National Commercial Control Association, has been prepared and convened a general meeting of all members yesterday to establish the association. A total of more than 70 member representatives from three provinces and two cities in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui attended. Secretary-General Zhang Peishen of the Commercial Control Association attended and guided the meeting. Chairman Lu Zhixue reported on the preparations. After the meeting, the articles of association were discussed, revised, and directors and supervisors were elected. A total of 21 directors were elected, including Lu Zhixue, Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, and Zhou Bangjun. Eleven supervisors were elected, including Qian Nianzu and Yuan Hesong.

Miscellaneous Grain Industry Recently, miscellaneous grains from various places will be successively produced. In order to discuss the production and sales cooperation policy and allocation matters, the Miscellaneous Grain Industry Joint Association of various regions has specifically decided to convene a general meeting on the 10th of next month. At that time, detailed decisions will be made on transportation and other plans. It is also heard that the chairman of the association, Mr. Fu Qiankeng, has made a special trip to Beijing yesterday to discuss important matters. At the same time, Mr. Lu Wenzhao, the person in charge of the Rice Joint Venture, also went to Beijing to ask for instructions.

Soap and Candle Industry The Soap and Candle Industry Joint Association has been prepared and convened an establishment meeting at the Youth Association of Eight Immortals Bridge at 3 p.m. yesterday. It is found that the joint association is composed of the trade associations of soap and candle manufacturers and vendors in various cities and counties in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, and various regions in Suhuai and eastern Zhejiang. More than 140 member representatives from various places attended. Secretary-General Zhang of the Commercial Control Association and others attended and guided the meeting. Chairman Li Zufan reported on the preparation process. After discussing the draft articles of association, 21 directors were elected, including Lu Zhixue and Zhou Bangjun, and 11 supervisors were elected, including Han Zukang.

Dear Sister Lanfang:

Your departure seems to have unspeakable reasons. However, for the sake of your family, your old mother, and your own future, you should think twice. How should the complex and confusing evolution be dealt with? I am uneasy about the fact that you are my sister. Aunt has recently relapsed with her old illness. How can I comfort others when I cannot comfort myself? Moreover, your brother's career is about to begin and has been stopped for my sake and yours. Sister, you are smart. You should handle things well for the sake of the overall situation and yourself. I hope you will come to my place as soon as you see the newspaper. Any matter can be discussed at length. Do not make a mistake. Your cousin Xiaomei.

### Special Edition Commemorating the 38th Japanese Navy Memorial Day Navy Memorial Day: Outlook on the Current Stage of the Greater East Asia War

— Takamichi Shiota

(1) The World History Is in Transition

Since we decided to crush the will of the United States and Great Britain and shatter the combined British, American, and Dutch fleets in the Pacific, one victory after another has been reported. The second Navy Memorial Day has arrived—the 38th anniversary of the historic victory of the Battle of the Sea of Japan and the leaping development of the East Asian people. Looking back on the situation 38 years ago, one cannot help but be filled with deep emotion.

Thirty-eight years ago, the nations of East Asia were enslaved. India was a loyal and rich milch cow for Britain. China was the most obedient servant to Britain and America. Japan was Britain's faithful dog in East Asia.

But now, we stand tall. Japan, the faithful dog, has risen to crush the insatiable ambitions of its master for the sake of all humanity, expelling Britain and America from East Asia. Thirty-eight years ago, Britain was no more than a weak nation, and America was still a child. But in those 38 years, Britain plundered vast resources, labor, and money from East Asia, treating it as if it were their right to command the people of the world.

However, once the Japanese Navy stood up, Britain immediately fell from the ranks of first-class nations to become a third-class nation. America was driven beyond the Aleutian and Solomon Islands.

(2) Maritime Nations Create World History

"When a maritime nation makes a great decision regarding the sea, it signifies a turning point in history." This is the esteemed opinion of Mr. Hiraide, the head of the Public Information Section of the Imperial Headquarters. Japan is now advancing toward a turning point in world history.

From the very beginning of its nationhood, Japan has been a maritime nation. For the past year and a half, under the great ideal of national founding, the naval forces have struggled to break through the so-called ABCD (America, Britain, China, Dutch) encirclement. Whether in the raging waves of the North Pacific or the scorching heat of the South Pacific, they have destroyed the military power of Britain and America from the air, land, and sea, achieving great victories that have shaken the world. Looking at world history, Greece created Aegean culture through the Battle of Salamis, and Britain turned world history into its own through the Battle of Trafalgar. Similarly, Japan has become the world's Japan through the Battle of the Sea of Japan, and the East Asian people have become a people of the world. The future of the East Asian people is now filled with even greater hope. Therefore, we are now raising the banner of inevitable defeat for Britain and America, which historians of the past and present could only dream of, in the Pacific, and we are advancing in unison to transform the world.

Revising the old order to transform world history is by no means an easy task. The path ahead is undoubtedly fraught with obstacles. Based on the great policy of national founding, as a maritime nation, once we have decided on a major course of action and raised the Z flag in the Pacific, we should move forward regardless of everything else.

Chancellor Hitler once said, "The current war is either the destruction or the development of nations." Therefore, we must remember the ten brave members of the special attack squad who, after writing their farewells in the book "Practicing the Virtue of Returning to the Nation Seven Times," embarked on a journey from which they did not expect to return, with Sydney Harbor as their target. We should not be complacent with great victories but should accurately recognize the current stage and future of the war and move toward its completion.

Recent newspapers have stated that 1943, this year, is the autumn of the decisive battle. Churchill made the bold statement: "Next year or the year after, after defeating Hitler, we will permanently disarm Japan, Germany, and Italy." Roosevelt made a strategic propaganda statement: "This year is the time to bomb the Japanese mainland." The commander of the Pacific Fleet, Admiral Nimitz, said, "We have completed preparations to destroy the industrial areas of Japan." They are all vigorously promoting a large-scale air raid. If these statements are not just propaganda but their actual intentions, then we should implement the decisive battle as soon as possible. We want to hold a fleet review of the elite combined fleet in Washington.

In order to hold a fleet review in Washington, we must emphasize the "final five minutes." The "initial five minutes" and the "final five minutes" are crucial in everything. We have completely won the "initial five minutes," namely, the U.S. leadership carelessly misjudged the strength of the Japanese Naval Air Force. Although they made considerable preparations, the elite Pacific Fleet was reduced to seaweed in Pearl Harbor. Therefore, the remaining issue at this stage is the "final five minutes." In 1918, although Germany maintained a superior front line, it still became a defeated nation, not because of failure on the front line, but because of internal collapse.

Therefore, we must accurately understand the current stage of the war. The nations of East Asia must share joys and sorrows, cooperate unanimously, and strive for the victory of these "final five minutes."

(3) The Form of Naval Warfare in the Greater East Asia War

Previous wars were histories of the rise and fall of individual nations. However, the current and future wars are extremely complex and global wars involving the rise and fall of multiple nations. Therefore, opposing nations are pouring their entire national strength and the limits of human intelligence into the war. Especially in modern times, due to scientific progress, wars have become so-called scientific wars. The form of war has changed from planar to three-dimensional, and its scale and complexity are incomparable to those of the past. Due to the rapid development of aircraft, the superiority of air power has become an indispensable requirement for naval superiority. Therefore, the former command of the sea cannot be established without command of the air. In short, victory in modern naval warfare cannot be achieved unless command of the air, command of the sea, and command of the land are integrated into one.

Regarding the first item, command of the air, the reconnaissance capability of aircraft is equivalent to the reconnaissance range of five or six cruisers, and its range is equivalent to the one-day sailing distance of a fleet. This is further enhanced by cooperation with submarines, which are extremely developed underwater. As a result, it is extremely difficult to conceal and hide the movement and intentions of military forces. Therefore, the preemptive strike of the "initial five minutes" has become the primary cause of victory. If the enemy cannot be crushed in the initial attack by various means, there is no hope of victory. Until the last European war, fleets anchored in heavily defended ports could safely rest their troops, replenish supplies, and repair their ships with plenty of leeway. But now, with excellent aircraft like those of our Naval Air Force, even if the defenses of U.S. naval ports in the Pacific are heavily fortified, the safety of U.S. ships at anchor is unlikely. Moreover, surface vessels have become excellent targets for airborne torpedoes and underwater torpedoes, making it difficult to escape even at night. Examples include the devastating attack by our bomber force on the U.S. Pacific Fleet at Pearl Harbor in Hawaii and the sinking of the British battleship Royal Oak, anchored in its home port, by a German submarine after the start of the war. Therefore, the planning of the preemptive surprise attack in the opening stages of the Greater East Asia War, the Hawaiian Operation, can be fully regarded as the ideal of modern naval warfare theory. Only the Japanese Navy, with its excellent training and skills, could accomplish what Britain and America considered impossible. This is also an example.

However, the movement of aircraft is still greatly affected by the weather in many ways. In addition, the constant threat of submarines is greatly disadvantageous to enemy fleets advancing from afar and advantageous to the defending side. Therefore, we have occupied many coral islands scattered throughout the Pacific, using them as unsinkable aircraft carriers, which fully demonstrates the superiority of our front line. The reason why the United States is determined to recapture these bases from the air and sea is for this reason.

However, according to Roosevelt, attacking from the south and recovering one island occupied by the Japanese army each year, it would take 50 years to completely recover them. In this light, the aspect of the Greater East Asia War can be aptly described as a battle for air bases. Therefore, the Japanese army captured Wake Island, Marcus Island, and the Gilbert Islands at the beginning of the war and used them as bases for attacking the United States. It also captured the resource-rich Dutch East Indies, the Philippine Islands, and the Malay Peninsula. The Andaman Islands in the Indian Ocean were also occupied by us. If this area is fully developed into a well-equipped naval base, it will have a different meaning from Singapore as a British base. With this situation, Japan has secured an impregnable position, and it is no exaggeration to say that it has laid the foundation for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Below, we will look at the current situation of aircraft and submarines, which have changed the state of naval warfare in the past:

A. Air Warfare: At the beginning of the war, the U.S. Pacific Fleet was destroyed by the elite Japanese Naval Air Force, and the British Far East Fleet, led by the unsinkable battleship Prince of Wales, was also completely annihilated. As a result, Britain and America lost their excellent maritime mobility and air fleet. Consequently, Hong Kong was captured, Singapore was seized, and the Philippines were occupied. In just over half a year, their century-long ambitions were completely expelled from the East, forming the magnificent view of the current stage of the Greater East Asia War.

Churchill hastily flew to Washington to devise countermeasures with Roosevelt. As a result, Admiral Kimmel was dismissed, and the new air force commander, King, concurrently held the important posts of commander of the combined fleet and minister of war. Air force officers were successively assigned to important posts. From this, it can be inferred how much the United States values the air force.

The New York Times raised the issue of this military reorganization, discussing that in the future, "the United States must proceed with construction and change its organization in the order of first, long-range bombers and long-range airships, second, aircraft carriers, and third, cruisers and destroyers." Although this cannot be said to be the will of the leadership, it is not far from it. The United States has suspended the construction of 58,000-ton battleships and 25,000-ton heavy cruisers and light cruisers, and has used merchant ships to convert them into aircraft carriers, which is clear evidence. It can be seen that the United States is desperately trying to seize command of the air in the Pacific.

This change in the U.S. method of operation is actually a countermeasure adopted in response to the great achievements of the Japanese Air Force since the beginning of the war. Recently, the United States has begun to gradually recognize Japan's strength.

They have realized that their disastrous defeat was due to complacency and arrogance and are now desperately pouring their efforts into reversing the situation.

So, what kind of strategy do they want to use to maintain their prestige? First, they are strengthening their air force at maximum speed to recapture the strategic bases in the Pacific occupied by the Japanese army. They are also bombing the residents of the areas occupied by the Japanese army and announcing the strategy of bombing Japan to the nation through propaganda. At the same time, they are using submarine "guerrilla" warfare to disrupt trade in the Greater East Asia Sea. They are also eagerly replenishing the main fleet lost in the battles of the Aleutian Islands, Solomon Islands, Coral Sea, and Hawaii, and trying to build warships equivalent to the Japanese Combined Fleet in order to reverse the decline of the main surface fleet. Thus, Nimitz made the bold statement of "large-scale air raids on the Japanese mainland," and Undersecretary of the Army Peterson made a propaganda to deceive about their defeats by saying to the nation: "Japan and the Japanese people have recently really felt the pain of war all over their bodies." The New York Times also said: "To bomb the Japanese mainland, we must first recapture Burma and strengthen the U.S. Air Force in China to establish an organized air raid plan," in order to stir up the enemy's hatred among the people of their own country. However, the American people have not yet awakened from their pleasant dreams. Shortages of supplies, conscription by the military, and low wages have caused labor disputes, and there is a very obvious state of unrest in the country.

Now let us examine the U.S. air raids on the mainland. The enemy is eagerly engaged in strengthening its air force and using Midway Island and Dutch Harbor as bases to bomb the Japanese mainland. But they do not know at all that the U.S. troops in the Solomon Islands have been cut off due to the Japanese Naval Air Force, and there will be a second (blank text, unreadable) defeat. Because of the fierce bombing by the Japanese Air Force, Prime Minister Curtin said sadly: "What is the United States doing? Not a single plane is coming. Should Australia surrender to Japan?" He pleaded with the United States to transport weapons, even if it was only a little help. Also, due to the recent fierce bombing by the Japanese Air Force, he complained, "The United States is using new aircraft!" In a nutshell, it is impossible for them to bomb the Japanese mainland. Because in this war, the distances for conducting large-scale air raids are very short. There is no precedent for a large formation of aircraft bombing an area more than 600 miles from its base. Of course, the development of aircraft is extremely rapid, and today's aircraft cannot be used as tomorrow's aircraft. However, the distance from Midway Island and Dutch Harbor to Tokyo is about 2,300 miles or more. A certain U.S. military commentator said, "It is quite difficult to carry out continuous bombing of areas more than 800 kilometers away. The increase in distance reduces the amount of bombs carried, which is strategically unfavorable."

In addition, the defense of the Japanese mainland is extremely thorough. In the north, we have first occupied Attu and Kiska Islands. In the center of the Pacific, we have occupied Wake Island and the South Seas Islands. Strong defenses have also been deployed in New Guinea, preventing the enemy from crossing the line. Moreover, Australia will soon become an abandoned child of the Pacific.

We should lend a helping hand to this Pacific castaway, a ring of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and adopt it as an adoptive child.

After the Japanese Navy occupied Timor Island, it relentlessly launched air battles centered on Port Darwin, Wyndham, and Broome in northern Australia. After New Britain and Rabaul were also occupied by Japan, Australia was completely reduced to an "orphan of the Pacific." The United States attaches great importance to this southern route of attack against Japan and is planning to strengthen its air force and engage in fierce base battles with the Japanese Air Force. Because Japan is one step ahead of the United States in terms of the quality of aircraft, Japan has command of the air in the Pacific. Therefore, enemy air forces and transport fleets often suffer heavy damage and are scattered in the South Pacific.

These great air battles in the South Pacific are brave, tragic, and unparalleled. Future war historians will unhesitatingly use the words "truly fierce air battles" to describe them.

In short, the United States is desperately strengthening its air force and spying on our southern occupied bases. As for us, we are also occupying the U.S. bases in the south, cutting off maritime traffic between the United States and Australia, and making Australia an "orphan of the Pacific."

On April 7, the Imperial Headquarters announced the naval battle off Florida Island. This was a fierce air battle following the naval battle off Isabel Island on February 1. Since the battle unfolded with the South Pacific as the stage, the Japanese and American forces have engaged in close-range, head-on confrontation. In the naval battle off Florida Island, after the Japanese side advanced from Buna and Guadalcanal, it effectively prevented the enemy's large transport convoy that was trying to replenish troops, weapons, and ammunition in this area, sinking two large military transport ships of more than 8,000 tons and eight ships of more than 5,000 tons. In addition, two cruisers and destroyers were also sunk. A total of 37 Grumman P-38 aircraft escorting the transport convoy were shot down.

From this, it can be seen that the United States wants to transport tens of thousands of troops and many aircraft to recapture the strategic bases. An unparalleled large-scale air battle is unfolding around a tiny isolated island in the region. However, the Japanese Air Force constantly defeats the enemy. In particular, in the naval battle off Florida Island, it severely struck the enemy's counterattack attempts and sank 13 transport ships. This is enough to prove that the Japanese Air Force is becoming stronger and stronger, and the situation of complete victory is becoming more and more solid. The U.S. Navy Department announced that the United States only lost seven aircraft in this naval battle and ambiguously described the situation of defeat in order to deceive the world. Even if the United States makes the bold statement that it wants to recapture the areas occupied by the Japanese army, no matter how many aircraft the United States sends, only scattered wreckage remains in front of the Japanese elite air force. When the results of the naval battle off Florida Island are still fresh in our ears, on April 12, the Imperial Headquarters announced that between April 11 and 12, the combat bomber squadron of the Japanese Army Air Force attacked enemy ships and aircraft groups off New Guinea and Lae, sinking four transport ships and one destroyer, and shooting down more than 60 aircraft, while the Japanese side lost five aircraft.

Also, recently on the 23rd, in the Aleutian Islands, cruisers and destroyers were sunk, and the Japanese Air Force gained an overall advantage.

B. Commerce Raiding Warfare: Next, how about the U.S. boasting of using submarines for "guerrilla warfare"? If the operation is examined in detail, this submarine "guerrilla warfare"

Continued on Sixth Edition

### The Elite Combined Fleet of Greater East Asia

"A nation that does not understand the sea will never prosper." "The center of the future world is in the Pacific." This is indeed a profound and truthful statement. Only a nation that knows the Pacific and controls the Pacific is a nation that will lead humanity in the future. Our East Asian people have this massive fleet and do not have to worry about not controlling the Pacific. All the nations of Asia will surely succeed.

### Certain Victory in Battle, Certain Success in Attack: The Japanese Navy is Truly Invincible - The Giant Guns of the Invincible Fleet

Countless fleets once mobilized, causing the enemy nations of Britain and America to be terrified; a single giant shell could transform the course of history.

## Page 6

Translated from the Fifth Factory

Even so, it has not become the counter-offensive weapon that the United States boasts of. Submarines, due to their nature, cannot have long endurance. It is also impossible for a submarine's hull to be completely submerged at the bottom of the sea; only a fraction of the entire submarine can be submerged. Especially the American submarines, which lack both sufficient numbers and adequate technology, are not a match for Japanese submarines.

Currently, all over the world, the commerce raiding war is intensifying. British Prime Minister Churchill, who for 150 years has boasted of dominating the world's seven seas, is flying by plane to either the Soviet Union or America, rushing back and forth, pleading for assistance. On one hand, the number of ships sunk by German submarines exceeds the shipbuilding capacity of Britain and America combined. On the other hand, in the Pacific, Japanese submarines are appearing off California, constantly sinking armed merchant ships along the American coast, while Roosevelt is concealing continuous defeats from the public and fantasizing about victory. On May 23rd, they heavily damaged American battleships and cruisers in the Aleutian Islands, moving horizontally and vertically, echoing each other from east to west, advancing towards sinking ships at sea.

This is completely different from the inhumane act of the United States attacking hospital ships.

However, regarding the character of this commerce raiding war, the modern naval historian, Admiral Mahan, described it as follows:

"When the enemy's commerce is thoroughly destroyed by a commerce raiding war, the enemy can be forced into the abyss of poverty. Therefore, this type of operation will play a very important role in future wars, but from the perspective of naval warfare, it is only a secondary operation. If one elevates commerce raiding to the first position in naval warfare, believing that commerce raiding can destroy the enemy, that is a great delusion."

However, this is not completely separate from naval operations; it has an inseparable complementary relationship with naval power. When in an inferior position to the enemy's naval forces, this is the only method. If in a superior position, of course it can be even more remarkable if this method of operation is used in conjunction.

In the pre-war London Conference, the United States, from a position of justice and humanity, advocated the complete abolition of submarines. And in the previous Great War, due to Germany's unrestricted sinking of merchant ships, disregarding humanity, it declared war on Germany. But now it has repeatedly used submarines to attack hospital ships. This is truly an uncivilized act that violates international law, exposing the barbarity of the Anglo-Saxons. The submarine commander who attacked the hospital ship foolishly thought he would gain merit, but instead aroused the enemy's animosity in the front lines and rear, creating the opposite effect. He has made it so that even kneeling before the statue of Lincoln, who sang praises of justice, humanity, and liberating black people, he cannot escape his guilt.

The enemy's attempt to suppress Japan with the so-called ABCD encirclement has been driven away beyond India, the Aleutians, and the Solomon Islands by the Japanese elite forces, but we must never be complacent about this.

The areas from the Aleutians, Midway Island, and the Solomon Islands onward are still within the enemy's sphere of influence. The four hundred million people of Australia's Eastern races are still being exploited by the enemy, so we still have the obligation to liberate these East Asian peoples. In addition to planning battles in the South Pacific, the enemy is further instigating Chiang Kai-shek, using him to try to retake Burma without mobilizing his own forces.

Now let's look at the Indian Ocean. It has been a year since the Japanese naval forces annihilated the British Indian Ocean Fleet. They are gradually strengthening strategic bases. They illegally occupied French territories such as Madagascar, Comoro, and Réunion without prior notice.

The world's famous scholars of international law are nurtured in Britain, yet Britain is now committing such acts that are impermissible under international law, truly revealing its complex nature. Even if Britain engages in unlawful acts not permitted under international law, the British before the steel wheels and iron armor-like deployment in Japanese Burma, Andaman, and East Indies can only eagerly retreat to the Indian Ocean.

(4) Japan's Inevitable Victory

The above explained that the integrated air supremacy, sea control, and ground control operations in modern warfare are the key to victory in this naval war. Although Britain and America are loudly proclaiming a counter-offensive operation against Japan, Japan will not fail in any of these three aspects. War is when a country fights with its total strength, so in addition to the above military warfare, material resources and human resources, namely the three Ms (Military, Money, Men), are undoubtedly necessary factors. As for human resources, East Asia has a total of one billion, and Japan has one hundred million; there is no need to elaborate on this situation. As for material resources, newspapers in various countries are saying that this year—1943—is the year of decisive battle. If this is true, then Japan's victory is already beyond doubt. However, enemy news or communications use astronomical figures to publish or report the shipbuilding plans and aircraft and tank production figures that the United States boasts of, deceiving themselves in a fog, saying that victory lies with Britain and America.

However, these people have completely failed to recognize the great war results achieved by the Japanese Army and Navy, which have placed Japan in an invincible and impregnable position. Unless the greatest miracle occurs in the world, the spiritual strength and skills of the American Army and Navy cannot reach a state of surpassing Japan. Therefore, to destroy the Japanese Navy, recover the war results that Japan has achieved to date, recover lost territory, and make Japan submit is ultimately unnecessary to consider. Let us briefly describe the reasons.

Since President Roosevelt returned home from Casa-Blanca, the first thing he said was that the US Army's troop strength should be increased to 7.5 million. Today, transporting one soldier requires at least eighteen tons of ship capacity. Therefore, transporting 100,000 soldiers requires at least 1.8 million tons of ship capacity. Assuming that the average tonnage of a ship is 15,000 tons, then the transport ships for transporting 100,000 soldiers will require 120 ships. It is not considered possible for this transport fleet, protected by cruisers and destroyers, to enter and exit the sea controlled by Japan's air and sea power. Because the Japanese ships and aircraft searching and guarding in that area, as long as they send a single telegram, the Japanese fleet waiting in position can immediately sink them. From this perspective, no matter how much the US Army increases, and no matter how large its army boasts of being, there is no need to pay attention to it.

Then, we only need to do some research on the US Navy. Roosevelt once discussed a general counter-offensive against Japan, gradually retaking the Japanese-occupied bases from the southern invasion route and the northern invasion route. However, the many islands scattered like stars in this area have been used by Japan as unsinkable aircraft carriers to spy on the American mainland. Therefore, even if the United States wants to attack with large aircraft carriers, the unsinkable aircraft carriers will immediately sink the sinkable aircraft carriers. As for wanting to bomb the Japanese mainland from the center of the Pacific, the various vanguard islands of the Japanese mainland are not so easily approached by the US fleet. Therefore, the path that the United States most wants to use for attack is the northern Aleutian and southern Solomon areas, not choosing the centrally advancing route that is most difficult in navigation. Taking a step back, let us look at observations that are extremely favorable to the United States: their planned counter-offensive is not limited to propaganda like the Chongqing army. Assuming their plan succeeds, they will make a comeback in two or three years, and even take back the Japanese-occupied territories. In that case, the words of the famous German strategist General Moltke and the trickster Napoleon have already clearly provided a solution.

General Moltke said:

"Combat power is like a river channel. The closer to the source, the stronger it is. No matter how much military strength there is, its pressure gradually decreases when acting over long distances. To forget this fact and wage war is a fool's strategy."

Tactics King Napoleon said:

"The difficulty of combat is inversely proportional to distance. With equal forces, when fighting based on the length of distance, the closer one is at an advantage."

The words of these two strategic and tactical masters are axioms in war. As long as the Japanese Navy is healthy, no matter how hard Britain and America try to recover lost territory and make Japan submit, it will ultimately be a dream.

Now let's try to draw a circle with a diameter of 4,000 kilometers, centered on Cape Eluanbi at the southern tip of Taiwan: the trajectory of this large arc extends west from the Andaman Islands through the entire territory of Burma, south from the Greater Sunda Lesser Sunda Islands through Tiqeung Islands, passing through New Guinea in a week, and east to the Hawaiian Islands. The central part contains the Philippines and Malaysia. In the area within this large arc, the military power of the Japanese Navy is steadily carrying out construction.

To be a victor in modern warfare, the prerequisite is to first obtain the most important sectors of war materials: iron, oil, coal, rubber, tungsten, and daily necessities such as rice, sugar, and salt are absolutely necessary. These things are the world's treasures on the land within this arc, and the amount that is produced is the greatest. Therefore, after Britain and America lost this treasure trove, their war resources became increasingly scarce and have all fallen into the hands of Japan. Even if this Greater East Asia War lasts for decades in the future, it will not fail due to a lack of materials.

The United States, once known as the world's number one industrial country and resource country, became the world's number one by obtaining resources from these lands, and Britain maintained its world navy with this. One year after they lost these places, Britain already felt the shortage of materials, and in the United States, due to the lack of tungsten, rubber, sugar, etc., the state of insufficient production of military supplies was extremely profound. In addition, the labor of Laoren's work, Roosevelt, and the White House officials are considering that the number of Japanese to return home to study and many others agreed to resolve labor disputes, said "Japan is a strong country, the people do not underestimate the strength of Japan." So in the future, the lack of material resources will not be able to become an arsenal for the anti-Axis countries, and will not provide weapons assistance. The United States is now providing some old-fashioned weapons to the impoverished Chongqing and Australia to preserve the United States' awe and prevent them from withdrawing from the Allied front. The country that once "had" has turned into a country that "has not." Therefore, Britain and America are naturally extremely afraid of the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and sincerely cannot place any more sympathy on its future. And Japan is now self-sufficient and worry-free.

Among the world's great powers, there is no country as difficult to attack and easy to defend as Japan. Therefore, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels' statement "Japan is difficult to attack and will not fall" is an appropriate remark.

(5) Alas, Marshal Yamamoto!

We, no, the people of the whole world, have encountered an extremely major change and are saddened by it. After one or two days, this shock turned into admiration, this sadness turned into gratitude. This major event of the century is the death in battle of Marshal Yamamoto. The faith and hope of Japan's 100 million people are focused on one point: "With Yamamoto in the Navy, the country will be as safe as Mount Tai." But General Yamamoto suddenly embarked on the journey to the Yellow Springs.

Looking back, since assuming the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet three years ago, the illustrious war results achieved in the Greater East Asia War have entirely stemmed from General Yamamoto's strategic planning.

Marshal Togo, the saint of the sea in the Russo-Japanese War, became a god at the age of eighty-eight, living out his full life. Everyone in the world knew of his death and expressed their condolences.

Now we have lost the second saint general, and the Japanese people's mourning for this Marshal Togo is even greater. People around the world also unhesitatingly praised the death of the marshal, who was both a military commander and the founder of the flying corps, in an aircraft. But once one is a military commander and active on the battlefield, the awareness of dying in battle is, needless to say, a matter of course. To die in battle as a military commander is the highest honor.

Marshal Yamamoto's death gave the Japanese people great sorrow. The marshal's death has no impact on naval combat power. Before Yamamoto, there may not have been a general like Marshal Yamamoto, but after Marshal Yamamoto, there are countless Marshal Yamamotos.

Therefore, Marshal Yamamoto's death has aroused the infinite enemy animosity of the 100 million people and the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet, boosting infinite morale.

Old and young, men and women, all follow in the footsteps of Marshal Yamamoto, forming a total force of 100 million, no, 1 billion, until the day we achieve a victory that cannot but be won. (Translated by Xiang)

Chairman (Wu): During the 38th Naval Memorial Period of our friendly nation, our agency is holding this "Symposium" on Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation, which is of great significance. Looking back, during the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese Navy, in one fell swoop, annihilated Imperial Russia's Baltic Fleet, destroyed the strength of the Eastern Fleet of Imperial Russia that was invading East Asia, and shattered Imperial Russia's ambition to covet East Asia. This war was the starting point for our friendly nation Japan to shoulder the responsibility of defending East Asia, and it occupies the most glorious page in the history of defending East Asia. Therefore, the Japanese Navy Memorial Day is not only the glory of our friendly nation, but we, standing on the position of the East Asian nation, also feel excited and happy. After the Russo-Japanese War, the friendly nation Japan Navy trained and researched day and night, constantly seeking strengthening in quantity, superiority in quality, and tempering in spirit. Therefore, on the day the Greater East Asia War broke out, it inflicted enormous damage on the US Pacific outpost, the Pearl Harbor Naval Base in Hawaii. Within a few days of the start of the war, it sank two British East Asian Fleet capital ships, HMS Prince of Wales, and then, in a very short period, successively occupied the bases of British and American aggression in East Asia, establishing the foundation of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. After several battles in the Solomon Islands, it eliminated most of the British and American naval forces counterattacking East Asia, thereby laying the foundation for the final victory of the East Asia War. The Chinese Navy began construction in the late Qing Dynasty. Under the shackles of unequal treaties, the fences were exhausted, and there was no naval defense to speak of. After the National Government moved its capital, in order to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia, we began with the basic work of training people for the construction of the new Chinese Navy, and achieved expected progress. At this time when British and American aggressive labor are driven out of East Asia, building a new Chinese Navy should make every effort to achieve success on the current situation, but in terms of technology, there are many aspects that depend on the assistance of our friendly nation. Protecting East Asia is the common mission of China and Japan. Our agency is holding this symposium with profound significance in protecting East Asia, hoping that you will express your opinions on the several issues we have proposed above. Now, I would like to invite Mr. Kamata to give a high-level speech on "The Significance of the Naval Battle of the Russo-Japanese War for the Defense of East Asia."

Kamada: The rise and fall of countries in the world are mostly determined by the size of their naval forces. I remember more than 30 years ago, when the President of the United States was also called Roosevelt, he said: "Whether the United States can be strong depends on whether the United States can control the Pacific Ocean." This shows their ambition and they have long felt the importance of the navy. The United Kingdom has colonies all over the world. It has tried its best to balance the powers of various countries in Europe, so that it can manipulate various countries to permanently maintain and expand its colonial opportunities, especially its ambition for the East, which is even stronger. It made India a colony, and Hong Kong as a base for further aggression in the East. Other countries such as Germany, Italy, France, and the Soviet Union are also very concerned about the Pacific Ocean, especially the Soviet Union's Far East policy, which began in the era of Imperial Russia. Because of its relations with Germany, France, etc. in the West, it could not expand. Therefore, Imperial Russia has always attacked the East and signed secret treaties with the Manchu Qing government, and even sent troops to the Chishima Islands and other places behind Japan to expand its power. Various countries also began to attack the East at the same time, demanding that China open its doors. However, we must think that the President of the United States once said: "America is America for Americans." Then we should also say: "Asia is Asia for Asians." However, Asia at that time had not yet realized the aggression of Europe and the United States. They thought that Europe and the United States were helping them and that Europe and the United States were advanced countries. They thought that they could not resist and gave up on themselves, making a big mistake and enduring the aggression of Europe and the United States. Humans were originally on land, and their relationship with water is shallower. However, Japan's territory is surrounded by the sea, so its relationship with water is very deep, and the place is small. At the same time, because of the ambitious ambitions of various countries, Japan had long realized the aggression of various countries. In the era of the shogunate, there was a "colonial policy" in place and Japan did not interact with foreign countries, so that in the Meiji era, the people of Japan did not understand various countries very well. Emperor Meiji said, "Japan must absorb the culture of the great powers." But in this way, Japan absorbed the Japanese spirit on the one hand and the culture and knowledge of the great powers on the other, and began to build the Japanese Navy. The Japanese Navy was established in the Meiji 5th year (1872), 71 years ago from now. In the Sino-Japanese War, it obtained the Far Eastern Peninsula. At first, the United Kingdom and the United States were all for their own benefit and wanted Japan to return it to China. Japan returned it immediately because it was unable to deal with various countries, but Russia borrowed Lushun and Dalian from the Manchu Qing government not long after Japan returned it. Japan was stimulated by this and vigorously built the navy. Emperor Meiji paid great attention to the expansion of the navy, and gave half salary to all civil servants to use as "navy construction funds." The people also responded and supported it. During the Russo-Japanese War, Japan had 6 battleships, 18 medium cruisers, 19 destroyers, and 76 torpedo boats, totaling 264,684 tons. During the Sino-Japanese War, it had only 26,274 tons, a great improvement in ten years. The Russo-Japanese War began in February of the Meiji 37th year. Russia strengthened its military power in the Far East Peninsula. Japan negotiated for their troops to withdraw. Since August of the Meiji 36th year, Japan has been trying to resolve the matter peacefully through diplomatic means. However, the Russian side not only did not respond, but also advanced its troops. Therefore, this "Russo-Japanese negotiation" lasted for six months without any results. After the war began, the Russian Navy attempted to cut off the Japanese land and naval forces in Manchuria and transferred the "Baltic Fleet" to the east. The fleet had 8 battleships, 9 cruisers, 3 coastal defense ships, and 9 destroyers to attack Japan. On May 27th, the sacred Navy Memorial Day, the Japanese completely destroyed the Russian fleet. At that time, public opinion in various countries in the world recognized that Japan could defeat Russia. The Shen Bao editorial also expressed its joy at Japan's defeat of Russia. Later, India also realized that if Asians could rise up, they could resist the aggression of Europe and the United States, thus causing an anti-British and American movement in India. Therefore, it is said that the naval battle was the beginning of the "dawn of Asia." It is a pity that Japan did not join hands with the Asians at that time to deal with Europe and the United States. I think that Asians will one day be able to join hands to drive out Britain and the United States and achieve the great goal of "Asia is for Asians."

Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Principal Jiang Xiyuan to talk about "Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation Issues."

Jiang: Sino-Japanese naval cooperation has been going on for three years since the National Government returned its capital. In fact, our new navy is very young, and we are very ashamed to cooperate with the powerful Japanese Navy, but we are already striving to improve. The new navy has now begun to be created, but materials are still lacking and manufacturing is small, but the new navy's new spirit has cooperated with the Japanese army. As long as there is a spiritual and volitional cooperation, the new navy should be able to be reformed. And we must go to full strength cooperation, and do not regret "having the will but lacking the power." The only focus of building a new navy is to have definite cooperation, and at the same time, in the cooperation, we must understand the shortcomings of the Chinese Navy, that is, the soldiers have grievances that they cannot express. Whether it is in society or at home, they all have pain in their hearts and should be understood. At that time, the friendship between the new Chinese Navy and the friendly nation's Navy must be sincere. Do not misunderstand because of differences in habits, etc. Know that cooperation with sincerity can achieve a satisfactory goal.

The general Chinese people have a very deep "continental concept" and a very shallow "maritime concept," but in today's Sino-Japanese cooperation, naval cooperation has more hope than any other cooperation. I also hope that the friendly nation will come to help, so that Chinese nationals who do not have a naval concept will also develop an interest in the ocean and understand the importance of the navy. And we should ask for thorough cooperation in both spirit and material. In the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, naval cooperation is the most important. Therefore, naval cooperation is now the entire problem of Greater East Asia. In the past, the Chinese national spirit has had many national heroes, and our friendly nation has also had many great achievements, which are the same. This Greater East Asia War is the development of the cooperative spirit between China and Japan, but the Chinese Navy is difficult to promote due to the environment, and it still relies on the guidance of our friendly nation, and we should also strive to work hard ourselves. In the 38 years since the Russo-Japanese War, the friendly nation's Navy has been actively preparing every day. Therefore, the martyrdom of Admiral Yamamoto, whose ocean is the East Asian people, can represent the East Asian spirit. We were very saddened to learn the news. Especially the two countries' navies have learned their lessons. The future of cooperation between China and Japan is even more magnificent and bright. We can better promote the essence of cooperation between the two countries. As for the fact that habits can be improved with each other, the Chinese Navy has a new life. We already have a good environment and a strong will. If we work hard to develop cooperation with our friendly nation, I believe the future is bright and splendid.

Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Director Ye Kesong to give a high-level speech on "Building a New Chinese Navy and Defending East Asia."

Ye: "A nation must first have a 'central idea' before it can be united in one mind and move forward towards the 'central idea' to achieve successful construction. The 'central idea' of the new Chinese Navy is 'reviving China and defending East Asia' under the guidance of Chairman Wang [Jingwei]." Since the Greater East Asia War, the friendly nation has completely driven out the forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia for a hundred years. During this period, the government has also resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. Our new Navy should also "fight side by side" with the Japanese Navy, but in fact, the construction of the new Navy is still in its infancy and cannot fight side by side with the Japanese army. Therefore, our country must first have the spirit of building a new Navy. With this spirit, we can promote our existing strength, ensure social security, strengthen the power of the National Government, and make the people have a knowledge and belief in the new Navy and enthusiastically support it, so that the new Navy can be strong and take on part of the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War.

Chairman: Now, please ask Captain Tang Baohuang to give us his opinion on "How to Build a New Chinese Navy."

Tang: It is not easy to build a new Chinese Navy, but no matter what country it is, it must have a strong navy to make its national power strong. However, the first thing to build a navy is spirit, and the second is money. In addition to these two key points, we also need talent. This is also the only prerequisite. With money, we can manufacture a large number of warships. To manufacture warships, we must first set up factories. China's naval construction has felt very difficult for months. Not to mention warships of several thousands or tens of thousands of tons, even warships of several hundred tons are not easy. But we know that we must struggle hard to build, from small factories to large factories, and gradually seek progress. We also need to make the people realize the importance of the current naval construction, pay attention to it, and the whole country can work together to build, so that the new Chinese Navy can be strong, cooperate with our friendly nation, and defend East Asia.

Chairman: Now, I would like to invite Director Kamata of the Press Department to express his opinion on "Sino-Japanese Naval Cooperation."

Kamada: People in your country often express something like this: "China is vast and rich in resources, and there are many people and soldiers. The Japanese Navy is world-famous. As long as China is responsible for the army and Japan is responsible for the navy, it is enough to cooperate to defend East Asia." However, the Japanese believe that the ocean is very important. It is best to make the Chinese people not know the importance of the ocean and not want the Chinese Navy to expand, because expansion has a considerable impact on Japan. This is the idea of some Japanese people. This idea seems to have its own reasons, but it is actually very misunderstood. We must know that looking at the map, only the cooperation between the two countries of Greater East Asia can protect East Asia and win victory. At the same time, the division of labor and cooperation that the Chinese think is also absolutely unreasonable. We can verify the facts. The United Kingdom does this to its colonies. For example, in India, it is only allowed to grow cotton, and Myanmar is called rice, etc. It is not allowed to produce a variety of materials in the same place. This kind of division of labor and cooperation is the policy of the British colonies, and Sino-Japanese cooperation must not work. However, we must also say that the United Kingdom's colonial policy is correct in peacetime, but once an accident occurs, there will also be problems. If India and Myanmar become independent, the United Kingdom's rice will also become a problem. For Sino-Japanese naval cooperation, we hope that China must have a strong navy, and even that the army and air force cooperate with Japan. This is the Japanese spirit, but the construction of the navy must have a considerable period. Japan already has a history of 71 years. Under the cooperation of officials and civilians, I hope that China will only need to cooperate with officials and civilians, work hard to build, and revitalize the spirit of building a new navy, work hard to move forward, and can achieve success.

Chairman: Now, let's ask Principal Jiang to talk about "The Current State of the Construction of the New Chinese Navy."

Jiang: The key point of naval construction now is to cultivate talent first. The Central Naval Academy is responsible for this obligation. There are already 5,000 students, of whom 2,000 have already graduated, and 3,000 are still training in school. In addition to educating students, our school also has a senior non-commissioned officer training class, which is now in its third term, and we gather and educate all the Chinese Navy. Regarding the education of sailors, there are now three sailor training centers, the first in Shanghai, the second in Guangzhou, and the third in Weihaiwei. The sailor training centers handle practice education. For higher education, we still need the Shanghai Central Naval Academy. The above is a general overview of naval training. As for the Naval Defense Command, the first is in the capital Nanjing. It has been established for three years since the capital was returned. The second is in Guangzhou, which is the former Guangdong River Defense Command, now renamed Guangzhou Defense Command. The third is in Weihaiwei, also named Weihaiwei Defense Command. At the same time, we are about to establish the Hankou Naval Base Force, which is also the prototype of the Defense Command. They all have considerable gunboats and other equipment. Some are exported, and some are responsible for defense tasks in the interior. The base force is responsible for security work. There is also the Hydrographic Bureau, which is responsible for the national hydrographic survey tasks. Since Director Ye's command and defense, it has achieved considerable results. The scale of the national defense navy has been established, and the internal structure has a system. Under the unified command of the Navy Department, cooperation with the friendly nation's navy and spiritual construction are progressing day by day. In other words, various materials have gradually been provided by the friendly nation and are becoming more abundant.

Chairman: Now, please ask Director Kamata to talk about "The Current State and Future of British, American, and Japanese Naval Labor in the Greater East Asia War."

Kamada: Since the Greater East Asia War completely drove British and American forces out of East Asia, their predetermined goals have all been broken. Before the Greater East Asia War, the British and American sides maintained a "5:5:3" strength. At the beginning of the war, the American naval strength was 17 battleships, 6 aircraft carriers, 37 cruisers, 166 destroyers, and 108 submarines, but the United States believed that its strength across the Pacific Ocean was not enough and had to add twice the strength to achieve its goal. Therefore, it is still vigorously manufacturing various warships, etc. The British side has 15 battleships, 8 aircraft carriers, 70 cruisers, 206 destroyers, and 43 submarines. In addition to possessing commercial labor, the United States is still building. If it does not fight against Germany and the Greater East Asia War, it is estimated that by March of this year, it could be called the world's No. 1 naval power. Regarding Japan's strength, it could originally be matched, but because it is in the war, the number of warships, etc., cannot be reported, please forgive me. At the London Naval Conference nine years ago, Admiral Yamamoto proposed to abolish the naval disarmament treaty. After that, unfortunately, the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, followed by the war with Britain and the United States, but Japan is still working hard to build warships, but the numbers cannot be told. Japan once held a prize for naval slogans. The winning slogan was "For 5:5:3, Daily Gold." This means that 5:5:3 is the ratio estimated by the United Kingdom and the United States compared to Japan's efforts. Together, "Daily Gold" is the work of the Japanese naval personnel, with only Sunday and Saturday as rest days. However, naval personnel should fight hard and build in the process from Monday to Friday every day. The implication is very deep. In other words, it is to take out the spirit of Japan to fight hard. The spirit of Japan's training of soldiers is also the same. Japan pays attention to the ratio of "5:5:3" and always wants to defeat the unbalanced power. Therefore, this Greater East Asia War gave the enemy a great blow. At this time, Japan adopted the strategy of evenly dividing the enemy's power before fighting hard. At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War, it gave the enemy a great blow, and now it has reversed the power of 5:5:3. The sinking of the Prince of Wales, etc., can be proof. The naval power of Britain and the United States is no longer as good as the efforts of the Japanese Navy. However, now that aircraft are very developed, the navy focuses on warships, but now we must also consider aircraft. Some take off from bases, but most take off from aircraft carriers, so aircraft carriers are very important. Before the Greater East Asia War, the United Kingdom had six, almost all of which have been destroyed. Although they are still publicizing a lot, it is speculated that unless other ships are rebuilt or manufactured, all of the previous ones are gone. However, many of the warships sunk by Germany and Italy in the United Kingdom were sunk, and many were damaged. Moreover, the bombing of aircraft in the sky affected the factories, which is beyond consideration. So, the construction has been greatly hit. The United States is still building various warships, etc., but we cannot underestimate the enemy, because underestimating the other side is easy to fail, but the numbers they advertise cannot be believed, because manufacturing is not easy, and the losses after the war cannot be completely compensated. It is difficult for the United States to make every effort to produce and counterattack. Speaking of the future, the difference in labor between Britain and the United States is very large. The United States will definitely be dominant, so we think that the future of Britain is very pitiful. The United States is advertising in the newspapers that it produces a lot of munitions, but the inventory of materials has been exhausted. Although their factories are working hard day and night, their ability is weak. The ratio of the number of people injured or killed in the factory is, according to statistics, 40 times more than on the battlefield, so it is showing a backward phenomenon. Japan was actually short of materials in the past, but now it has obtained very rich materials in the south and is developing materials, so from now on, there will only be development and no backwardness, and it can gain a must-win position. Finally, regarding the death of Admiral Yamamoto, some people think that the death of the admiral may be very unfavorable, but the navy is different from the army. The marshal of the navy commands on the flagship and stands on the highest command platform to command the battle. The death of General Yamamoto was an unfortunate martyrdom while fighting or inspecting on the plane, and we are very saddened, but the soldiers will fight even harder and continue the admiral's will to complete the Greater East Asia War.

Chairman: Thank you all for giving very valuable opinions and providing very valuable materials one after another. This meeting has added a lot of color, and I am sincerely grateful for your teachings. Finally, please ask Mr. Yang Huilang to summarize the opinions of all parties and make a conclusion.

Yang: The issue of Sino-Japanese naval cooperation is worth discussing in the Greater East Asia War. Japan is a powerful country in the Far East, and it has become a world naval power since the Meiji Restoration. A hundred years ago, East Asia had a great crisis: (1) The British naval forces invaded Asia, (2) The American naval forces entered the Pacific Ocean, (3) The Russian naval forces surrounded the Manchurian area. After the Japanese Restoration, the result of the Russo-Japanese War defeated Russia. Therefore, the Russo-Japanese War was the starting point for defending the Greater East Asia War, but to thoroughly defend East Asia, it is necessary to build a new Chinese Navy. Since the National Government's war on wheat, the construction of the navy has been progressing day by day. For example, in Shanghai, Guangzhou, Weihaiwei, Nanjing, and even Hankou, there are naval officers and sailors training and the establishment of important port commands. Although building a strong navy is not easy, (1) the friendly nation Japan sincerely assists China in completing the construction of the navy, and (2) China is vast and rich in resources and has a large population. It is important to build an army. It is also necessary to build a navy. As long as there is the determination and courage to build a navy, the future is promising. Speaking of the comparison of the naval forces of Britain, the United States, and Japan in the Greater East Asia War, before the naval disarmament conference, the construction of the Japanese Navy was surrounded by the 5:5:3 ratio of Britain, the United States, and Japan. However, since Japan withdrew from the naval disarmament conference until after the Greater East Asia War, Japan has annihilated the British and American navies. Now, the comparison of the actual strength of the British, American, and Japanese navies has become a ratio of 5:5:7. This is the glory of the Japanese Navy and also the glory of Greater East Asia. As for Sino-Japanese naval cooperation, the Chinese Navy must be built up and become strong enough to be worthy of being friends with the Japanese Navy in order to be able to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia.
