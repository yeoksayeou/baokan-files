### A Word to the First Meeting of the Economic Commission

The National Economic Commission is a newly formed organization since the war, the highest authority for handling wartime economics. It is scheduled to hold its first meeting tomorrow. It will undoubtedly take a broad and long-term view of the future national economy, carefully and meticulously plan discussions, and make comprehensive decisions. Economic measures are extremely closely related to the lives of the people. Whether they bring fortune or disaster depends on the slightest detail. I would like to offer my humble opinion, based on what I have seen and heard, from the perspective of the people, and hope that the gentlemen of the National Economic Commission will pay attention to it.

The greatest mission of the National Economic Commission is, of course, to promote wartime economic work and strengthen cooperation with Japan, especially to concentrate resources to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War. As Japanese Minister for Greater East Asia Aoki said in response to a question from Representative Matsumoto Tadao regarding "Japan's future policy toward China in the economic field": "After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Chinese National Government has adopted a cooperative attitude with us in both material and spiritual aspects. Since participating in the war, it has strengthened cooperation in various aspects. Regarding its content, the Chairman of the National Government once said that it would restore order, boost morale, increase production, and fully exert its strength to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, our side and China have formed a single entity. We firmly believe that the National Government has made considerable preparations for purchasing materials and actively cooperating..." Therefore, it is inevitable that the authorities will devote themselves to concentrating national resources and cooperating with Japan in the future. However, a comprehensive plan must be in place for centralized purchasing. The first major principle is to consider the interests of both China and Japan as much as possible. On the one hand, it is necessary to strengthen cooperation with Japan to seek the final victory of the Greater East Asia War; on the other hand, it is necessary to take into account the lives of the Chinese people and maintain the minimum necessary materials for them. Second, in view of the serious malpractices and failures of the Chongqing regime in the implementation of the policy of requisitioning materials, the National Government must strictly clarify the powers, simplify the system, and establish a sound organization in the future concentration and purchase of materials, and the executive personnel must be carefully and earnestly selected. Third, in terms of material procurement, which was previously carried out by Japanese state-owned companies, the right to purchase will inevitably be transferred to the National Economic Commission for unified implementation in the future. This will naturally place a particularly heavy responsibility on the National Economic Commission, which should demonstrate the spirit and ability of the Chinese people in handling affairs in practice.

However, precisely because the basic requirement of a wartime economy lies only in the spontaneous and voluntary cooperation of the people, can it be effective. Therefore, no proposition, no principle, no method, and no measure can fail to take into account the will of the people, and none can fail to take into account maintaining the minimum standard of living for the people. The biggest failure of the Chongqing regime, more than military or diplomatic, was undoubtedly due to politics, especially due to the neglect of the people's opinions and the people's lives. Even in the so-called "wartime economic" policy, it was entirely the selfishness of a few people in the Chongqing government who used the form of meetings to announce various laws and regulations and force the people to comply. Under the pressure of the party, government, and military, the people were helpless for a time, but due to accumulated grievances, they constantly promoted the political crisis in Chongqing, while its economic policies still had no results. The economic crisis increased day by day, forming the most serious and fatal threat. Isn't this failed experience of the Chongqing government worthy of our vigilance? Therefore, we hope that the National Economic Commission will make a more far-reaching and comprehensive plan when implementing wartime economic policies, and take into account the people's livelihood as the first priority. All economic countermeasures and measures must seek to guarantee the minimum standard of living for the people, and only in this way can we take care of both and not lose the meaning of participating in the war. Therefore, in the economic field, we should not only focus on the collection and control of materials, but also actively devote ourselves to increasing production, rationally increasing agricultural production, industrial production, and encouraging the production of small and medium-sized industries. Only by planning and organizing the promotion of the production increase movement, and rewarding the large and small production of the people in agriculture and industry, can we guarantee the smooth completion of the wartime economic policy.

China's industry has a history of several decades. Regarding whether it is government-run, privately-run, or jointly run by government and private sectors, it has undergone a long period of experimentation. Due to the backwardness of China's politics and social organization, the evolution of new industries over the past few decades tells us that purely government-run industries have failed one after another, and purely privately-run industries cannot develop in a sound and rational manner. Only businesses supervised by the government and run by private sectors have a future. In the past, all businesses supervised by the government and run by private sectors still could not fully develop, mainly because the government did not provide sufficient support and correct guidance to private capital. Now, as long as the government is determined to support private industries, it will certainly be able to present a brilliant picture of China's economy, not only to meet the needs of the Greater East Asia War today, but also to have a great impact on the future development of China's economy. We can predict that the gentlemen of the National Economic Commission will never miss this "century-old plan." Therefore, we respectfully offer our foolish opinions to you. If they are adopted, the Chinese people will be fortunate, China will be fortunate, and the entire East Asia will be even more fortunate.

### Turkey Needs to Be More Cautious

The focus of the British and American meeting in Casablanca a few days ago was on discussing this year's war plan. However, after the meeting, Churchill urgently visited Turkey. The Turkish President Inönü and the Prime Minister, Foreign Minister, Chief of General Staff, General Staff Headquarters, and Air Force Advisor and other civilian and military leaders held talks with the British Prime Minister. In addition to the Prime Minister and the Chief of General Staff, British officials such as the commanders of the British forces in Iran and Iraq, and the commander of the Middle East forces were also present. On his way back, the British Prime Minister also visited the British naval base on the eastern Mediterranean island of Cyprus. All these actions are enough to infer where the British and Americans are focusing. The operations around Turkey may be part of the British and American war plan. On the other hand, vigilance against the Axis powers must not be relaxed.

Reports on the content of the British-Turkish talks are still speculative. According to the one-sided British announcement, "Britain will use all means to help Turkey strengthen its national defense to prevent foreign invasion." And a agreement was concluded between the two countries, and the US government also decided to participate in strengthening aid to Turkey. Since 1939, there has been a mutual assistance treaty and secret documents between Turkey and the UK, but it is known that they have not been implemented. This time, it is said that Turkey will be assisted in strengthening its national defense to prevent foreign invasion, but how it will be implemented is not specified. The United Kingdom and the United States often use the pretext of preemptively responding to the invasion of foreign troops to invade the territory of neutral countries and infringe upon their sovereignty. If the same means are used against Turkey and the reports that British and American air bases will be set up and the Dardanelles Strait will be crossed without restriction are true, then it will not only be important to Turkey, but also to Germany and Italy. Romania and Bulgaria, which border Turkey, are both allies of the Axis powers, and the Dodecanese Islands in the eastern Mediterranean near the island of Rhodes, which belong to Italy, are in front of Turkish Asia Minor. Moreover, by allowing free passage through the strait in violation of the Montreux Convention, Turkey has also abandoned the strict neutrality that it has always insisted on. This is certainly not the intention of President Inönü, the successor of Kemal Atatürk, the great hero of the revival of Turkey. The collusion between Britain and the Soviet Union is nothing more than ringing the death knell for Turkey's independence. The leaders of the Turkish government must act prudently and not be confused by the ups and downs of the long-term world war, and mislead the country's long-term plan.

### The Economic Commission Will Meet Tomorrow to Discuss Wartime Economic Policies. All Members Have Arrived in the Capital One After Another

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency) - The National Government considers the determination and implementation of wartime economic policies after the British and American war as an urgent task at present. The National Economic Commission is specifically scheduled to hold its first plenary committee meeting in the capital on February 12. The members of the committee have arrived in the capital one after another. In addition to the original members, the members attending the meeting include the heads of relevant agencies of the North China Political Affairs Commission, representatives of various non-governmental organizations, leaders of the financial sector, and leaders of the industrial sector, all of whom are important figures in the domestic economic circle. It can be seen that officials and civilians will work together to promote the wartime economy, which is of great significance.

### Outline of the List of Enemy Property Transferred in North China

Beijing, 10th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Minister to China Yamazawa visited Zhu, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, on the afternoon of the 9th to deal with the enemy property of the British and Americans in China, and personally handed over the list of 749 enemy properties to be transferred in North China. The enemy properties to be transferred this time are divided into three categories. The first category is those that are still used and managed by the Japanese army recently due to military necessity. The second category is those that have been transferred, but with some conditions attached to their use and management. The third category is those that are unconditionally returned to the manager. Among them, there are 48 items in the first category in general, 25 items in cultural relations; 45 items in the second category in general, 13 items in cultural relations; 656 items in the third category in general, 646 items in cultural relations; A total of 749 items. In addition, the number of items belonging to Japan is 58 in general and 18 in cultural institutions, a total of 78 items. Therefore, the share of all British and American enemy properties in North China returned to Chinese managers is 90%. Among the enemy properties to be transferred this time, the main ones include part of Yenching University in the first category, the Salvation Army Officer School, Jinan Qilu University, and Tianjin Recha Hotel, and part of Yenching University in the second category, and the property of the Tianjin Municipal Council, Tianjin Times, Beijing Times, and other primary and secondary schools and churches in the third category.

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency) - The Mainichi Shimbun here today published an editorial entitled "Transfer of Enemy Property in China," pointing out that the transfer this time is a measure taken with the aim of respecting China's independence and completing the Greater East Asia War. It said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, more than a thousand enemy properties in China received by Japan have been officially handed over to the National Government for management on the 8th. The types of enemy properties to be transferred this time include various industrial equipment such as textiles, shipbuilding, and chemicals, cultural facilities such as schools, newspapers, and radio stations, and hotels, department stores, and buildings. The Japanese side handed over these enemy properties in China to the National Government for management based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration on Cooperating in the Completion of the War signed on January 9 when China participated in the war, and the statement issued by Prime Minister Tojo to the inside and outside on the same day. The purpose of the transfer is to contribute to the completion of China's independence and to strengthen it quickly. When China participated in the war, Japan decided to assist the National Government in strengthening it, and decided to provide assistance in all good faith in political and economic aspects, and decided to implement it immediately. The transfer of enemy property this time is one of its implementation. Therefore, the transfer of the Japanese side this time can be said to be a measure taken based on the two major goals of respecting China's independence and integrity and completing the Greater East Asia War. This is the first time, and it will be transferred successively with the progress of the reorganization in the future. This transfer will have a great effect on the enhancement of China's combat power, both directly and indirectly. At the same time, it can also clearly show Japan's integrity, that is, it will definitely fulfill its promises despite all difficulties. The repercussions for the Greater East Asian nations and the enemy countries such as the United States and the United Kingdom are certainly very different, but it can be said that the impression it gives is particularly strong. It can be asserted that the Chongqing side will be deeply shocked by Japan's decisiveness.

### Hubei Provincial People's Congress Supports the National Government's Participation in the War. Propaganda Minister Lin Personally Delivered Instructions and Inspected the Youth Corps and Scouts

Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, the people of the whole country vowed to support it. In order to strengthen the people's patriotism and hatred of the enemy and firm their beliefs, the Hubei Provincial Government held a joint demonstration of the Hubei Provincial People's Congress yesterday to support the war and destroy the British and Americans. Lin Baisheng, a special commissioner and propaganda minister of the Central Government, personally came to the venue to deliver instructions. The venue of the People's Congress was set up in the Wuchang Provincial Normal School playground. More than 20,000 people from all walks of life, military, government, and civilian groups participated in the meeting. Minister Lin and Governor Yang arrived at the venue amid melodious music. At 2:00 p.m., the meeting was announced. After performing the ceremony, Governor Yang, the chairman of the congress, read the declaration of war and delivered an opening speech. After the speech, Minister Lin stepped to the podium and delivered a profound speech to the 20,000 people in the audience. After the speech, He Xiachang, a representative of the people's groups, gave a speech. Finally, the meeting adjourned amid shouts of slogans. After the meeting, the groups immediately lined up and marched out of the venue in an orderly manner, each holding a small national flag and parading to Hanyangmen, where the groups dispersed. In addition, after the closing of the People's Congress, Lin, in his capacity as Secretary-General of the New Movement, inspected the youth corps scouts in the provincial capital, with a total of 2,300 people, with Wang Wenquan as the commander-in-chief. At the beginning of the inspection, the commander-in-chief reported the number of people, and then the inspection ceremony was carried out. Secretary-General Lin was the chief inspector, accompanied by Governor Yang and others. After the inspection, all the personnel gathered in front of the command platform and listened to Minister Lin's instructions respectfully. His general idea was to elaborate on the history of the national flag, followed by the course and significance of adding peace, anti-communism, and nation-building symbols to the national flag after the return of the National Government to the capital, as well as the significance of canceling the symbols this time. Finally, he gave a lot of instructions to young people on their understanding of the national flag. The whole venue was inspired. After the speech, Governor Yang led the shouting of slogans until the red sun set in the west, and the meeting was announced to be dismissed amid the sound of music.

### Minister Lin's Speech

Hankou, 10th (Central News Agency) - In order to publicize the significance of participating in the war, Lin Baisheng, Propaganda Minister of the National Government, came to Hankou a few days ago. On the 9th, he gave a speech at the Wuhan General Assembly for Supporting the War and Destroying the United States held at the Wuchang Model School. The following is a record: Comrades, compatriots, the people of Hubei Province are holding a warm people's demonstration rally today, the first anniversary of the National Government's participation in the war. I am very happy to have the opportunity to meet and say a few words to people from all walks of life and students from all aspects. Since the National Government officially declared war on January 9, I have been to various places to participate in the People's Congress to promote the significance of participating in the war. I have been to Suzhou and Guangzhou, and today I came to Hankou, and I will go to Shanghai and Hangzhou later. The way the People's Congress is held in each place is different, but the enthusiasm for supporting the National Government's participation in the war and the patriotic sentiment are the same. No matter east, west, south, or north, the mood of revitalizing China and defending East Asia is the same.

After the National Government participated in the war, some people doubted why the National Government, which is for peace and nation-building, also has to fight a war. Peace and war seem to be contradictory. In fact, this is a misunderstanding. I think the compatriots in Wuchang will not have this misunderstanding. Everyone should know that peace is not about living in humiliation. Because we want to realize peace, we must first remove the obstacles to peace. It has been almost three years since the National Government returned to the capital. Why has peace not been fully realized? It is because of the communist disturbances and the instigation of the British and Americans. Therefore, to engage in peace, we must first defeat the British and Americans.

Some people say that the current war is between Japan and the British and Americans. What does it have to do with us? At most, we express some goodwill, or give them some convenience, or let them be defeated on both sides, and we can benefit from it. Isn't it better? Otherwise, we should remain neutral. But neutrality is a slippery policy, especially in the modern world. There is no way to remain neutral forever. A few years ago, when the European War broke out, many small countries thought it was best to remain neutral and not participate in any side. But the neutral Czechoslovakia, Poland, and many other countries were destroyed. In this great era, neutrality only leads to the destruction of the country. To save the country, we must first declare our position and determine the path we will take. Neutral bystanders are slippery and cannot be tolerated. There are only two paths in front of us: one is the aggressive front of the British and Americans, and the other is the axis front of Japan, Germany, and Italy. Some people may think, what about taking the path of the British and Americans? Compatriots, we must not forget China's position in East Asia and the painful history of the past 100 years under the aggression of British and American imperialism. Chongqing wants to take the path of the British and Americans, and its biggest reason is that Japan and the British and Americans are fighting, and if they follow the British and Americans, they will definitely be given freedom and equality in the future. It is absolutely impossible for the British and Americans to win. Not to mention, even if the British and Americans can barely support it, China will never benefit if it follows the British and Americans. During the First European War, Britain lacked manpower and lured India to participate in the war, saying that it would give India freedom after the war. As a result, India sacrificed countless compatriots, and freedom was still not obtained. This is the best example. Today, Chongqing is taking the second path of India. We must know that the survival of the country can only be obtained by its own strength and blood. Why should we rely on a fluke to wait for others to give it to us? Why should we willingly become the second India and be fooled by Britain? I say that the Indian thing is not an empty talk. A hundred years ago, Britain wanted to establish the second India in the Yangtze River basin and send 200,000 troops to conquer China. This policy could not be done, so it changed its policy, not allowing China to have a revolution, disturbing East Asia, and not allowing China and Japan to cooperate. Can we forget the crimes and atrocities of the past 100 years, stained with blood? (Continued Tomorrow)

### Article by Japanese Author Kataoka Teppei: A Message to Chinese Intellectuals

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese author Kataoka Teppei recently published an article titled "A Message to Chinese Intellectuals" in the February issue of the magazine "Genchi Hōkoku" (Local Report). The gist of the article is as follows: This time, China has resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, which will surely comprehensively arouse the spirit of the Chinese people. The influence it will have on the Chinese intellectual class will also be very strong. We are truly delighted about this. I will now venture to offer some sincere words to you all. Among the intellectuals who are currently working in various government agencies of the National Government in peaceful areas, there are still those who harbor doubts or unstable thoughts. In fact, those who work for the National Government or cooperate with its policies, are they acting according to their own conscience? If we go a step further, does their conscience affirm the ideal of Greater East Asia construction? There are probably not a few who feel uneasy about this. On the one hand, they are confused by the Chongqing faction's propaganda, and on the other hand, they believe that the revival of China requires overall peace with Japan. Therefore, under such circumstances, their thoughts are often in flux. Although they have this kind of spiritual unease, their unease will only deepen if they side with Chongqing. They are well aware that the Chongqing faction is extremely chaotic and full of contradictions, so their conscience does not allow them to enter the anti-Japanese camp. The reason why their conscience does not conform to the ideal of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is because they lack the wisdom and the courage to trust Japan. At the same time, they believe that Japan is using the construction of Greater East Asia as a pretext to invade China. Therefore, Japan's position is truly difficult. We cannot help but feel sadness for Japan's noble ideal when we see that very few Chinese people put themselves in our shoes, stand in this difficult position, and observe us.

Japan is Not Fighting for Its Own Interests

We have repeatedly emphasized that this war is for the liberation and construction of all of East Asia, and not for Japan's own interests. Among the Chinese intellectual class, there is still a portion that has not understood Japan's purpose in waging war. Japan must take a stance that allows those who have not understood Japan's war aims to understand that Japan's war aims are not for aggression. Human nature seems to make it extremely difficult to trust the purity of others. Japan has shed the blood of tens of thousands of its compatriots for this war, and has spent huge amounts of material resources and labor. Its purpose is to build a new order and for the happiness of all the peoples of East Asia. The fact that a small number of Chinese people harbor doubts about Japan's pure intentions is based on the most base of human instincts. After the outbreak of the war, the internal struggle waged by Japanese intellectuals was a struggle to liberate themselves from baseness. However, Chinese intellectuals, with the exception of a few progressives, have not raised this issue of internal struggle. So-called conscientious people are merely those who base their arguments on instinct and are mistakenly dominated by modern thought. The reason why this is at odds with the ideal of building Greater East Asia is due to Anglo-American concepts.

Declaration of War Clears Internal Unease

I deeply believe that the National Government's declaration of war on Britain and the United States has cleared away some of the unease harbored by some Chinese people. This great act of participating in the war has also reawakened their sense of national consciousness. China must be revived as a modern nation. This ideal is by no means a slogan, but a demand of life-and-death intuition. In short, intellectuals, because they possess the traditional spirit of East Asia, will surely understand Japan's true intentions after they possess a sense of national consciousness. They can only understand the meaning of Japan's holy war if they place themselves in the position of a nation. If a portion of people are still in a state of ideological unease, then it will be difficult for them to share the joys and sorrows with Japan. They may gladly enjoy the joys, but they will express their aversion to sharing the sorrows. Japan is waging war in order to expel the evil forces of Britain and the United States from East Asia. War is by no means an easy task and requires pain and sacrifice. Japan does not wish to trouble China, but now it is standing on the same cooperative battle line. We cannot help but express our deep joy at fighting alongside China. Therefore, on this point, we should trust Chinese intellectuals. At the same time, it would be a loss of dignity for our comrades on the same battle line if we were to protect them solely through our own fighting.

China and Japan Will Surely Win

Now that the Chinese intellectuals, who have grasped the ideological basis due to the declaration of war, lead the people and put into practice the sharing of hardships, they will surely be able to achieve victory together with Japan. The declaration of war has further enhanced the sense of national consciousness. Therefore, Chinese intellectuals also regard the ideal of building Greater East Asia as their own responsibility, and they can understand what the sacred purpose is. This is my observation. As for how to deal with the Anglo-American ideas that have influenced the Chinese people in the past, this is also the most important problem. Only this holy war can purify their thoughts and eliminate Anglo-American ideas. My conclusion is that the Chinese intellectuals after the participation in the war are the ones who will cooperate in carrying out the war and organize China's wartime system.

### Statement by Chen Jicheng, Ambassador to Manchukuo

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - National Government member Chen Jicheng has been appointed as the Republic of China's Ambassador Extraordinary and Plenipotentiary to Manchukuo, as approved by the 148th meeting of the Executive Yuan. Yesterday, the reporter made a special visit to Mr. Chen, who gave the following statement: Since the establishment of diplomatic relations between China and Manchukuo, two years have passed. Due to the changes in the situation, the relationship between the two countries has become increasingly close. Recently, the National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, and in the declaration of war, it clearly stated that Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share a common desire for East Asian co-prosperity. In the future, we should further promote cooperation in order to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. I am assuming this arduous task at this moment, and I feel the great importance of my mission even more. I will certainly do my best, under the leadership of the Chairman, and in accordance with the spirit of the joint declaration of China, Japan, and Manchukuo, to work with our friendly nation of Manchukuo to enhance the friendship between the two countries, and to strive to concentrate all our efforts to assist in the completion of the Greater East Asia War, so that the new East Asian order based on morality can be established and achieved as soon as possible.

### Eisenhower's Special Powers to Be Expanded

Lisbon, 10th (Haitong News Agency telegram) - According to the "Washington Post," which is known for its well-informed sources, there is a possibility that Lieutenant General Eisenhower's special powers will be expanded. Because Eisenhower is currently fighting in North Africa and is responsible for the supreme command, there is a great hope that he will be promoted to General and take charge of the entire Mediterranean region militarily.

### Report by Japanese Army and Navy Representatives on the Situation in the South Pacific: First Explanation of Last Year's Operations, Then Elaboration on the Strategic Significance of Guadalcanal

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese government officials, representing the Army and Navy, reported today on the war situation in the South Pacific at the House of Representatives budget general meeting. First, they explained the course of the operations, the gist of which was as follows: In the South Pacific, since August 7th of last year, when about one division of the US Marine Corps landed at Guadalcanal, Tulagi, and other places under the protection of a strong naval force, they made contact with the Japanese naval detachment stationed on Guadalcanal in late May that night. Upon receiving the report, the Japanese Army immediately dispatched a certain detachment and other forces to reinforce it. The first-line commander who was dispatched tried to grasp the war situation and inflict great blows and threats on the enemy, but ultimately failed to achieve the purpose of annihilating the enemy. Afterward, they further strengthened their forces and established a strategic base in the South Pacific. Furthermore, in order to provide a foundation for future large-scale operations, they were assigned the task of holding the enemy in check in that area. At that time, not only was the Japanese air force that cooperated with the ground operations on Guadalcanal quite limited, but the airfields that could cooperate were also very far from Guadalcanal, about 1,000 kilometers or more away. The enemy, on the other hand, used its mechanical power to build many airfields in a short period of time, and successively dispatched superior air forces, so that we failed to gain air supremacy in the Guadalcanal area. Since the enemy had the advantage in air supremacy, they further increased their forces and built solid fortifications around the airfield. Therefore, it was extremely difficult for our forces in the rear to attack these solid positions under the enemy's air supremacy and carry out long-distance attacks. Furthermore, the enemy forces in the New Guinea area were the joint US-Australian forces based in Australia. Since August of last year, the enemy has gradually increased the number of Australian troops stationed at Port Moresby. In early July of last year, a unit of our troops landed at Buna, and in early September, they broke through the Stanley Range and approached Port Moresby. However, due to logistical reasons, they were ordered to move to Buna and hold the area near the coastline. Like the Guadalcanal troops, they established a strategic base in the South Pacific in order to provide a foundation for establishing future large-scale operations, and were assigned the task of holding the enemy in check in that area. Therefore, for half a year, our officers and soldiers in Guadalcanal in the Solomon Islands and near Buna in New Guinea overcame various difficulties in the hot and humid forest areas, and often attacked the enemy's counterattacks with a small number of troops. Regardless of any losses, they held their positions and held the enemy in check. In the meantime, they had secured various strategic bases from Burma through the Dutch East Indies to the Marshall Islands and beyond, and the deployment of troops had also been completed. They then elaborated on the strategic significance of the operations in the Guadalcanal and Buna areas, stating in essence that after capturing the important points of Greater East Asia, they entered the stage of pursuit. The vanguard of the pursuit troops pursued to Guadalcanal and Buna, where they engaged in encounter battles with the enemy. As a result, the communication route between Australia and the US mainland was greatly threatened. Therefore, the United States used short-distance supply lines and air bases to launch a full-scale counterattack. A part of our naval forces preemptively launched a landing on Guadalcanal and occupied a corner of the island. However, since the air base was occupied by the enemy, our side was at a strategic disadvantage, and maritime resupply was particularly difficult.

Japanese Main Force Completes Outer Wall of Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere

However, for half a year, we continued to fight hard, repeatedly attacking under this disadvantageous position. In the Solomon and New Guinea areas, we held back the full strength of the US Pacific naval, land, and air forces, allowing our main forces to complete strategic preparations from Burma through the Dutch East Indies, New Guinea, this part of the Solomons to the Marshalls and other areas, becoming the outer wall of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and securing a basis for future offensive operations. The reason why the strategic deployment of the main forces was so rapid and orderly was that it did not attract the world's attention. However, this strategic deployment was a difficult task that consolidated the outer wall of Greater East Asia. As a result, the communication route between the US and Australia felt threatened. By holding back the US forces on Guadalcanal for more than half a year, we were able to consolidate the entire area at our leisure. The US strategy was truly laughable. Next, they reported on why the troops in the Guadalcanal and Buna areas were withdrawn. In encounter battles, when the vanguard independently attacks important positions, the main force usually gradually joins the vanguard in fighting and attacking the enemy. However, sometimes the vanguard is allowed to fight in the forward positions, and after the main force completes its combat preparations, the vanguard is withdrawn to the main force's line. This tactic is called a retreating deployment. The encounter battle in the South Pacific was a retreating deployment. Next, they talked about: 1. The wise decision of the command; 2. The cooperation of the Army and Navy; 3. The hardships and merits of the troops.

Japanese People Strive to Unleash Strength, Strike America to Abandon Hostility

Finally, they revealed the purpose of the American war and expressed their confidence in victory as follows: Japan has never insulted the United States or damaged their rights, nor has it threatened the existence of the United States. However, they have wantonly despised and oppressed the Japanese people, and have jeopardized the existence of the Empire economically and militarily. In order to survive and defend ourselves, the Empire has risen up regardless of everything. After the outbreak of the war, Roosevelt said that his war aim was to uphold democracy, but the American people's will to fight was waning. Roosevelt fabricated the war aim, saying that this war was for survival. The most ridiculous thing was that on November 26th of last year, he issued a challenge to Japan, desperately inciting the American people's anti-Japanese sentiment, fabricating the war aim, and instilling anti-Japanese ideology, which proves that American politics has no justice or humanity. The word "violence" alone is enough to sum up American politics. As a result, the pure youth of America lost 20,000 to 30,000 lives on remote island forests in the South Pacific. In the future, they will also lose many battleships, aircraft carriers, and airplanes. In short, the more tyrannical the American commanders and the more unjust the politics, the more we must fight, unleash the strength of the Japanese people in front of them, and make them treat us with proper etiquette. Therefore, in the future, we must not only crush the enemy's counterattacks, but also strike at their heart, otherwise it will be difficult to make the arrogant Americans give up their will to fight. Through the efforts and struggles of 100 million citizens, we will continue to fight decisive battles on the battlefield, in factories, on farms, and in homes. If the American will to fight is not abandoned, we will make the heart of America suffer a great blow. We are now working hard to prepare.

Minister of Health and Welfare Reports on the Actual Situation of Population Growth

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Japanese Minister of Health and Welfare Koizumi clarified the actual situation of Japan's population growth in response to a question raised by Congressman Akojima Shunji at the House of Representatives special administrative committee this afternoon. He stated that judging from the past history and the current situation, it can be proven that wars reduce the population. However, uniquely, Japan is seeing a trend of population growth while carrying out wars. At the end of the Meiji period, Japan's population increased by 32.3 people per year for every 1,000 people. By Taisho 9, the increase was 36 people per year for every 1,000 people. After that, it declined slightly, but in the Showa era, it increased by about 31.2 people per year for every 1,000 people. In Showa 13 and 14, it increased by 26 people per year for every 1,000 people. After Showa 15, it increased to 29 people, and the following year it rose to 31.2 people. Since that year, the population mortality rate has been extremely low. In the Taisho period, 21.2 people died per year for every 1,000 people, but in Showa 15, it decreased to 16.2 people, and in Showa 16, it decreased to 15 people. Therefore, the total number of natural population increase exceeded one million in Showa 16. As for the infant mortality rate, it was 9 people per 1,000 people in Showa 15 and 8 people in Showa 16, which is almost the same as the infant mortality rate in Germany, England, and other countries. Depending on the region in Japan, some regions have an infant mortality rate that is even lower than the level of 6 people in Germany, England, and other countries.

Director of Accounting Bureau Takei States Current Situation of Donations

Tokyo, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Director of the Accounting Bureau of the Japanese Navy Ministry Takei stated this morning at the third subcommittee meeting of the House of Representatives budget committee that the current situation of national defense donations is as follows: From the Sino-Japanese Incident to January 22nd of this year, national defense donations from various places have reached over 158,355,000 yen, condolence money over 63,490,000 yen, academic encouragement money over 9,120,000 yen, and other consolation goods totaling over 11,920,000 yen, totaling over 242,590,000 yen.

### Indian Mahatma Gandhi Decides to Fast for 21 Days

American Envoy's Activities in India Quite Forceful; Meets Separately with Key Figures from All Sides in India

Lisbon, 10th (Allied Press Urgent Telegram) - According to information from Poona, Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi, 74, has decided to fast for 21 days and has already begun. Gandhi has been detained at the Aga Khan Palace in Poona since his arrest on August 8th of last year, because the All-India National Congress passed a resolution to expel the British from India at a meeting in Bombay.

Lisbon, 10th (Allied Press telegram) - According to a report from Poona, Indian leader Mahatma Gandhi began a fast this morning to protest the All-India National Congress Party's failure to take responsibility for the Indian riots and his continued detention by the British side after December 8th of last year. This is the sixth fast of his life. The Governor-General wrote a letter blaming him for not using fasting as a political threat, stating that this action has no moral justification. The British authorities firmly stated that they do not intend to retreat on Gandhi's demand for release, and that he should be responsible for fasting while in detention. Gandhi refused to eat breakfast this morning. When the official announcement of this news was made, he had been fasting for six hours.

Bangkok, 10th (Central News Agency telegram) - Roosevelt's special envoy Phillips' trip to India this time is an attempt to pull India into the Anglo-American camp and expand its influence in England. Therefore, he has made various attempts in New Delhi. According to recent news received here, Phillips went to Punjab and met with the Chief Minister of the state to conduct important talks, and met with the leader of the Punjab branch of the National Congress Party, Dhani Ram, and made some attempts. Ever since the US sent an economic delegation to India headed by Clay in May of last year, the US policy of co-opting India has become increasingly apparent. Phillips' mission to India on Roosevelt's orders can be said to have reached its highest point in expressing its ambition. Phillips' mission is nothing more than to have the United States inherit Britain's legacy in India, but Britain, represented by Governor-General Linlithgow, has no ability to eliminate his plot. The fact that Phillips met separately with Indians from all sides, such as Pulla Sapa, President of the All-India National Liberal Federation, in New Delhi, where the Indian Governor-General's residence is located, without regard to the existence of the Indian Governor-General, proves this.

### Snippets from the "Council of State" in Chongqing - Transmitted from Macau on January 29th

According to reports, the first session of the third "Council of State" in Chongqing convened on October 22nd of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], lasting for ten days. Looking back today, although it feels like reviewing yesterday's news, these scattered glimpses still offer a lingering sense of interest.

Councilor Gu Jiegang, upon arriving at seat number 195, searched anxiously for his books, only to later realize, with Councilor Wang Yinzhi's arrival, that it was Wang's seat. His own seat was actually in the same row, but in the first three rows. The confusion and mistake caused him great alarm, and the two couldn't help but laugh.

Many councilors greeted each other in the morning with the question, "Where did you hide during last night's air raid alert?"

After the afternoon session, Councilors Yang Duanliu and Chen Yuan, unable to board a vehicle, had to walk back to their residence.

Gu Jiegang encountered Huang Yanpei and repeatedly greeted him with "Congratulations, congratulations," to which Huang responded with a smile.

Councilor Hadeer, from Xinjiang, could barely speak Mandarin but was fluent in English and French, having studied in Syria.

Female Councilor Tang Guozhen actively engaged inside and outside the meeting venue during the ten-minute break, seeking co-signatures for her proposal. One of the proposals concerned increasing salaries for university professors. ("University professors are even worse off than primary school teachers," was a point of great concern for Councilor Tang.)

Chen Lifu, when discussing the lives of primary school teachers, stated that their monthly salary was about 62 yuan, plus two dou of rice (also worth 62 yuan), for a total monthly income of 124 yuan.

Female Councilor Zhang Bangzhen inquired about the lack of teachers and unavailable textbooks. Tong Guanxian, Peng Ge and Chen inquired about student malnutrition and students carrying firearms in schools and engaging in unlawful behavior. Mr. Chen prepared to respond to all these inquiries in writing.

In one educational inquiry regarding the low level of primary school teachers, the following incident was mentioned: A certain county magistrate, while on inspection tour, found that the local primary school teacher, in an attempt to show the people's welcome to the magistrate, posted slogans everywhere. One of them read "The county magistrate's spirit never dies," causing laughter throughout the hall.

Wei Zhiguang, the director of the central labor administration, planned to propose a bill for "special medical expenses for civil servants and staff" to the assembly. As Wei said, "Who can afford to get sick these days? If the government doesn't come up with some solutions for these people within a reasonable scope, they will just have to wait to die when they get sick!"

A proposal suggesting that students must read the "Great Learning," the "Doctrine of the Mean," and the "Analects" and that universities should establish institutes for studying classical texts sparked heated debate. The initial review stated "reserved", Councilor Liu Hengjing agreed with the reservation, stating as a reason that "reading old books will only create fake antiques." Councilor Peng Yunyi asked, "Isn't the "Fuxing Academy" already studying classical texts?" Councilor Tao Xuan, addressing Councilor Liu Hengjing's point of view, stated, "China needs personality training, China should promote its inherent moral education, and reading old books will not turn people into antiques." Councilor Li Zhongxiang, Councilor Jiang Yiping, and Councilor Chu Fucheng all expressed agreement with and opposition to the opinions. The result was that the proposition to make "The Great Learning", "The Doctrine of the Mean" and "The Analects" compulsory extracurricular reading was passed and sent to the government for adoption and implementation.

After the proposal to promote reading the classics was passed, Councilor Wang Hanzhu suddenly stood up and declared, "Even if you revoke my qualification as a councilor, I must speak." He argued that the word "compulsory" should not be added to "extracurricular." However, after others informed him that it was possible to add "compulsory" to "extracurricular," Wang remained silent.

Councilors also engaged in a lively discussion regarding the loan issue for students from war zones. The proposer stated, "Prisoners in jail have all their living expenses covered by the state. Even before they are executed, they are given a full meal. Why should students from war zones have their loans canceled simply because of poor academic performance, thus cutting off their livelihood?" The listeners were moved by this.

Regarding Councilor Luo Heng's proposal to abolish the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, Councilor Chou Ao strongly argued against it. Luo stood up and gave a very long explanation, pointing out as many as fourteen shortcomings of the Relief and Rehabilitation Committee, and stating that anyone who argued against this proposal was protecting the committee. Councilor Tao Xuan, one of those who opposed Luo's proposal, specifically reminded everyone, "Don't let Luo's arguments lock up our mouths like a lock." Councilor Huang Yuren jokingly said, "I'm afraid people will say I'm being locked up by a lock, so I have to speak. My opinion is to maintain the review opinion." For a while, Councilor Jiang Yiping, Councilor Kong Geng, and Councilor Wang Liming all remained silent. The result was that the proposal was revised and sent to the government for investigation and action.

Among the councilors was a one-legged gentleman, Zhang Tong, and a one-armed gentleman, Liang Shangdong.

The various review committees at this session were extremely busy, especially the fourth and fifth groups. The fourth review committee (finance, economy, transportation) even worked overtime until the 30th of the month to deal with various important cases. All the councilors felt "overwhelmed." At each conference, the second review committee (international diplomacy) was the most idle, hence the nickname "lazy group." However, this time it had twelve proposals to review, but it finished in less than six hours.

The trend of councilors freely leaving the session had not diminished. Some councilors sitting in the back row would often move to the spectator seats to chat with guests.

Councilor Chen Yiyun was greatly dissatisfied upon hearing reports that in war zones, married women who had been separated from their husbands for five years could remarry without the government recognizing it as bigamy. He inquired with Xie Guansheng, the Minister of Judicial Administration, who replied in writing, stating that there was no such thing.

It was reported that the Council of State received a total of 250 proposals, 92 of which concerned economic and financial matters, including 27 related to price issues, reflecting the nationwide concern about prices.

### Current Stage of the German-Soviet War - The Battle for Rostov Reaches a Critical Juncture

Everywhere on the bitterly cold German-Soviet winter front, covered in frost and snow, fierce battles are unfolding, attracting significant attention. The German authorities also acknowledge the gravity of the situation and are urging their citizens to develop a new awareness. The current stage of the German-Soviet war is observed by synthesizing reports from various locations.

Along the vast German-Soviet front, stretching from the Leningrad area in the north to the North Caucasus in the south, the Soviet side has launched a counteroffensive despite suffering heavy losses. Last autumn, as the battle for Stalingrad intensified, the Soviet high command appointed Marshal Zhukov (then a Corps General), commander of the Central Front, as the supreme commander. He led fifty reserve divisions, awaiting an opportunity to strike the German rear during the winter. The Germans were aware of this plan from the beginning and had the Sixth Army and a part of the Romanian army build strong fortifications in the occupied area of Stalingrad, demonstrating their determination to fight resolutely on the Volga River.

On November 19th, the Soviet forces, which had been waiting for this moment, launched their operation from the northwest and southwest of Stalingrad, opening the prelude to the winter campaign in the area between the Volga and Don rivers. Subsequently, on November 25th, in the Central Front's Garinine northwest of Elziv, Toropetz, and Verikiel, on December 16th in the Bokocher, Nobelier, and Garitope regions of the middle Don, and in January in the Mozdok and Nari Zhetge regions of the central North Caucasus, and in the Leningrad eastern Ladojia Southern Lake regions, the Soviet forces took counteroffensive postures. In the fierce battles between the attacking and defending armies, progress was made in the southern war zone, with the major battlefield having a radius of 180 to 80 kilometers, centered on Voroshilov and Rostov.

The direction of the Soviet counteroffensive in this southern war zone was, in the northernmost region near Voronezh, commanded by General Gorlikov, and aimed at capturing Voronezh and advancing towards Kharkiv. In the middle reaches of the Don River, Lieutenant General Rokossovsky's troops crossed the Don River, with one part advancing from Staire Lisk towards the north of Voroshilovgrad, and another part heading south along the Moscow-Rostov railway through Millerovo to Minsk Leovsky, advancing towards the north of Rostov. Another group came out of the Kutsirini Gov region from the southwest of Stalingrad along the Stalingrad, Tsiolek, and Novo Rossiysk railway. General Airmenko's right-wing forces concentrated near the point where the Don and Donets rivers diverge, near Konstantinov Pusko, keeping an eye on the east of Rostov. The front line advanced towards Rostov along the north bank of the Manuichi Canal, and the left wing advanced west from Salisk, echoing the forces advancing north from the North Caucasus to attack Tsiolek, a key point in the south of Rostov.

Thus, what is the target of the Soviet counteroffensive on the southern front? First, Rostov, to cut off the connection between the German forces in the North Caucasus and eastern Ukraine, and to encircle and recapture the Donbas mining and industrial area from both the north and south, and to retake Kharkiv. Voronezh was first captured by the German forces in July last year when they began their summer offensive, and from there they controlled the important areas of Kursk and Kharkiv in the west.

The Soviet army took advantage of the opportunity of the slightly reduced severity of the winter to use tank groups as the main force of the attack, launching successive attacks on the German positions with tenacious attacks. Marshal Timoshenko, the loser of the southern front, was replaced by the young General Vatutin as commander, who, together with Marshal Zhukov, commanded 800,000 troops in a major counteroffensive.

The scale of the counteroffensive on the northern front in the central region was smaller than that in the south, but it regained the Hilleselipurgo and Veriki-Erji districts at the southern end of Lake Latga. The flank operations of the southern war front gradually became deadlocked due to the German counteroffensive after transferring to a new position in mid-January. However, the Soviet Union's propaganda that the attempt to regain Hilleselipurgo was intended to relieve Leningrad.

The German forces on the southern war front, led by Field Marshal Manstein, the brave conqueror of Sevastopol, replacing Field Marshal Bock, conducted a flexible retreat and defensive deployment, forming a strong new trapezoidal position facing the Soviet army in the rear of the war front, owing to last winter's defensive battles. Because the extension of the front line was quite vast, the front line and the rear had to maintain a very long supply line, which was obviously at a disadvantage. Therefore, Rostov and Kharkiv were connected to form a line, and they were held as strongholds as a starting point for the offensive in the coming spring. Therefore, according to the German authorities, the stubborn defense of the strongholds in the center of each front is not a matter of maintaining the line, and the desperate battle of the Sixth Army, which is now isolated in Stalingrad, also shows the German plan for the future of the war. The battle for Rostov is now the most critical juncture in this winter campaign. The geographical value of Rostov is of great importance to the future of the war between Germany and the Soviet Union. Especially for the Soviet army, isn't it now pouring all its elite forces into a decisive battle under the conditions of winter to defend the Volga and the Caucasus? The taste of the current stage of the war is significantly different from the situation during the Soviet counteroffensive last winter, roughly as follows:

(1) Last winter, the severe cold was another 40 degrees below zero, and the average climate in central and southern Russia this year is about 25 degrees.

(2) The Soviet Union hoped to bring all the reserve troops training in the rear together and concentrate them in the southern war zone, starting operations before the completion of the German winter front-line positions.

(3) The international situation in North Africa has changed, and a part of the military has already moved.

However, this Soviet counteroffensive was blocked by the German army's ability to defend and fight well. In a blink of an eye, the spring and summer when the front line will be active will soon arrive. At that time, the Soviet Union will be shocked by its own losses. The German authorities now frankly admit that part of the Eastern Front war situation has been lost. At the same time, the new sharp troops who have been fully prepared after General Winter and General Mud have passed are about to appear. The current Eastern Front war situation can show one end of the German authorities' determination. (Xiang: Translated from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, February 1)

### Soviet Troops Surge into Kursk from Northeast and Northwest - Fierce Fighting Still Underway in the City - Entire Toropitz Soviet Team Annihilated

Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - Extreme cold on the Southern Route of the Eastern Front. The construction of German fortifications is also hampered by the cold. Soviet soldiers, accustomed to the cold and far outnumbering the Germans, are in a superior position compared to the German army. Today, the center of the Soviet offensive remains in the middle reaches of the Donets River, but its pressure on other points has also increased. According to reports last night, Soviet troops have surged into Kursk from the northeast and northwest, and fierce fighting is still underway in the city. Soviet troops in the lower reaches of the Donets River, which had been quiet for many days, have begun to move again, but have not yet achieved any success. Enemy troops on the other side of the Don River have repeatedly tried to cross without success. There is also fierce fighting in the Krasnodar and Novorossiysk areas. The enemy's heavy troops are still concentrated in the middle reaches of the Donets River, but there has been no significant advance, it is said.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - The central part of the Donets River was also the center of fierce fighting on the Eastern Front yesterday. The Soviet army launched successive attacks, and the German army fought hard against it. The intensity of the battle was even greater than last winter, but the German army did not engage in positional warfare with it, so the enemy army had a possibility of breaking into our army's position, but the danger of being annihilated by our army was also extremely great. There was also fierce fighting in the Novorossiysk area yesterday. There were no major battles in the Rostov area yesterday.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - According to reports here last night, fierce fighting is still underway in the Kursk region. Under the snow and wind, the Soviet army launched as many as fifteen attacks on the German defense line outside the city. The German defense line in the north of the city was finally broken through, but the German army launched a counterattack that evening and recovered most of the lost ground. On Tuesday morning, the German army launched another counterattack, and the battle is now underway.

Berlin, 10th (Haitong Agency) - The battle between the German army southeast of Toropitz in the central part of the Eastern Front and a Soviet team of 2,000 men ended on February 7. The entire Soviet team was annihilated, and the German army captured a large number of war materials.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German authorities explained the war situation on the Eastern Front on the 9th. The most prominent fact of the recent Eastern Front war situation is that the Soviet army is continuously opening up the front with a large number of reserve troops, while the German army's counterattacks are also extremely fierce. The situation in the Kursk area has been quite serious for several days. The Soviet army has been constantly attacking the north and east of the city in recent days, and fierce fighting is currently underway in the outer areas of the city. There is also fierce fighting in the northwest of the Donets River. The Soviet offensive has been greatly slowed down due to the German army's fierce counterattacks and flank attacks. The Soviet army is now concentrating large forces to increase pressure from Slavyansk to Mariupol on the coast of the Taganrog Bay.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced the war situation on the 9th: Eastern Front (1) The Soviet army's counterattack in the southern part of the Eastern Front is becoming more and more fierce, and it has repeatedly attempted to break through the German position with powerful troops, but all have been repelled by the German army. (2) Although the German army in the Don River estuary has been actively counterattacked by the Soviet army, it is still progressing smoothly under favorable conditions. In the area west of the Antonetsos Al of the lower reaches of the Don River, the Soviet army launched a full-scale counterattack and engaged in a fierce battle with the German army, but it has been repelled. The German army is also conducting counterattacks to stop the Soviet army from advancing, and fierce fighting is still underway in the area. Although the German army is under severe weather conditions, it is still bravely resisting and holding on to its original position.

The German authorities pay close attention to the health of foreign workers, so only 2% of the total number of workers are sick. This figure is even lower than the record of German workers. At the same time, Germany is extremely satisfied with the work of foreign workers.

### Italian Newspaper Discusses Axis Powers' Submarine Victory

Rome, 9th (Havas News Agency) - The Italian Daily recently published a commentary saying that the victory of the Axis submarines is not due to the lack of production in Britain and the United States, and there is no way to prevent it, but because there are too many German and Italian submarines.

Although January every year is the season of shocking waves and swift waves, German and Italian submarines still sank 700,000 tons of enemy ships last month, while British and American ships sunk by the Japanese army in the Pacific and Indian Oceans are not included. In the first few months of this month, 210,000 tons of Allied ships were also sunk by us, it is said.

It has been four months since the Allied forces landed in North Africa, and French people who wish to serve the Allied forces and their own country are still being held in prison, which is incomprehensible.

The Fierce and Unmatched Japanese Navy Air Force

### On-the-Spot Report by American War Correspondent: Deification of Japanese Military Combat Skills - Using Ingenuity to Make Themselves Elusive - Charging into Combat and Treating Danger as Nothing

The attempt by the main force of the US military to carry out a desperate battle in the Southwest Pacific was shattered by the continuous counterattacks of the Japanese army. Throughout the United States, the magnitude of the sacrifices and the depth of the blows were shuddering, and people increasingly felt the "terror of the Japanese army." An American reporter on the front line in that area made the following report on the Japanese army's unpredictable, brave, and decisive combat in the jungle, which attracted widespread attention. The bravery of the Japanese army in the Southwest Pacific is like that of a tiger in the forest. Former Ambassador to Japan, Grew, based on his past experience, said: "The Japanese army is a formidable enemy of the United States." The Japanese army does not like to fight defensive battles but often takes the offensive. Their melee attacks, with their spirit of charging forward and never retreating, often terrify the US military, leaving them at a loss. In forest warfare, both sides are buried in piles of ancient green leaves, and the distance between the two sides is only a few feet. In such difficult and dangerous circumstances, the Japanese army skillfully uses camouflage tactics to achieve great results, often firing at the enemy from secret locations, and the enemy simply does not know where the bullets are coming from. This tactic is especially used in night battles, making it impossible for the enemy to grasp their own location, often causing illusions. Japanese soldiers often call out the names of American soldiers in a low voice, such as Smith or Brown. Infantrymen on guard duty in the forest, exhausted, actually think that their squad leader or company commander is approaching. If they are even slightly careless and answer, they are simply telling the enemy where they are, and then they are suddenly attacked. They also often hum popular American songs and sneak into American military positions. In order to prevent the enemy from noticing the sound of rubbing against trees when the troops move through the forest, the army often imitates the cries of birds and beasts, or the roar of lions, to startle and confuse the American army. Before they are even aware, the flying generals have descended from the sky. When the Japanese army moves, they are silent, as light and quiet as a raccoon dog. You can't hear a sound, and you can't see a shadow.

The Japanese army often uses a small unit to suddenly appear in front of the American army. The American army, of course, immediately starts firing, but the main force of the Japanese army, lurking to one side, unexpectedly launches a fierce attack on the American army, catching them off guard and wiping them out. The American army is also often subjected to a sudden attack directly into the heart from the front, while simultaneously encountering a deadly blow. Night raids are even more tragic. During one attack on an American position, the Japanese army first used large bombers with sun symbols on both wings to bomb the American position fiercely. Immediately, Japanese soldiers suddenly appeared from the forest, charging from both sides, shouting "Banzai," throwing grenades, and waving Japanese swords, rushing in like a raging tide. No matter how hard you try to defend, those in the back keep coming one after another. In the darkness, they engage in a desperate melee battle with grenades, pistols, and bayonets, finally breaking into a corner of the American position, starting to sweep with machine guns, and continuing the brutal fighting.

During these two days of fierce fighting, three Japanese soldiers, one of whom was an officer, suddenly jumped out of the forest, shouting "Banzai," and waving their swords, broke into the headquarters of American commander, Major General Bundacliff. The headquarters was unprepared, and this attack was completely unexpected. These three Japanese soldiers killed dozens of American soldiers, and the commander barely escaped with his life, fleeing into the depths of the forest. Because of this battle, the bravery of the Japanese army caused the entire American army to shudder. The Japanese army's equipment is extremely suitable for forest warfare. The Japanese army effectively uses mortars and other military equipment, and the exquisite mortars and grenades are very light and easy to carry. One person can carry them, and can fire the mortar after bracing it on the knee. The Japanese army also has flame throwers, and its grenades are also more powerful than those used by the American army.

The Japanese army's rifles are extremely accurate, and the grenades used to deal with the war are very powerful. The soldiers who throw them often even use themselves as human bombs, approaching tanks and detonating together. The Japanese army also has many steel boots, which they use to climb coconut trees and snipe at the enemy from above, which is extremely brave and well-trained. American commander, Major General Bundacliff, sighed and said: "If we do not abandon obsolete military tactics and adopt new tactics, there is no hope of victory." The Japanese army treats difficulties and dangers that other armies would consider impossible as nothing, and marches forward bravely. This kind of battle is still continuing fiercely. The enemy is extremely tenacious and full of confidence. It is worrying whether we can reap great results from the Japanese army in this area."

### French Concession Revises Household Registration; Residents Must Not Conceal; Movement Must Be Reported to the Baojia Office; Violators Will Be Fined 30 Yuan

In order to thoroughly investigate and clarify the accurate number of residents in the concession and to detect any suspicious individuals, the Baojia authorities of the French Concession have decided to revise the household registration. This matter is now actively underway. Household registration forms have been distributed by the authorities in each district to the Baojia offices under their jurisdiction. After obtaining these household survey forms, residents must fill them out in detail and must not conceal, falsely report, or misreport. Furthermore, recently, the Baojia authorities have noted that residents often do not report their movement to the Baojia office, resulting in discrepancies between the household registration and the information filled in on the household registration form. In the future, if it is discovered during the revision of household registration that there has been movement of households that has not been reported to the Baojia authorities, a fine of 30 yuan will be imposed and no leniency will be granted. Residents are urged to pay attention to this.

### Careful Handling of Overdrafts Between Exchange Firms; Old Customers Begin Sending Current Account Books

After the members of the Money Trade Association and the various exchange firms listed on the market, regarding the new policy for the operations of each firm, they adopted a prudent policy. For credit loans, the legitimate purpose and reliable guarantor must be explained. The collateral for goods must be limited to the goods themselves, and the term must not exceed three months. The overdraft quota must be stipulated for overdrafts, and a guarantee from a person with a good credit history is required. Recently, each firm has begun to send current account books to old customers with reliable credit, allowing them to do business. As for the interest on deposits and debts, it will be calculated in accordance with the market price announced by the association each month. It is reported that the association has scheduled a general meeting of members of each firm on February 17th at the North City Conference to celebrate the Lunar New Year. In addition to offering sacrifices to the former directors, the association will also report on matters related to business innovation.

### United Relief Association of Charities, New Initiatives for Poverty Alleviation: Already Established an Almshouse and a Ciji Children's Home

In order to provide relief to orphans, widows, impoverished men, women, disabled elderly, and poor children on the streets, the Shanghai Charity Organizations Joint Relief Association, in addition to continuing to set up shelters as usual, has recently established an almshouse and a Ciji Children's Home in accordance with the principle of human mutual assistance. The reporter has learned the details and recorded them as follows:

More Than 800 Orphans, Widows, and Disabled

The almshouse is located on the site of the Tongren Fuyuan Hall Public Cemetery at the intersection of North Zhejiang Road and Qipu Road. Several sheds have been built. As of yesterday, it has taken in more than 100 elderly men and women who have no home to return to, more than 80 disabled men and women, more than 80 elderly widows, more than 200 orphans, and more than 200 extremely poor men and women, for a total of more than 800 people.

Accepting Beggar Children; Half Work, Half Study

The Ciji Children's Home is located at the same location as above and specializes in taking in beggar children from the streets. To date, it has more than 300 children. They are divided into half work and half study on weekdays, receiving half a day of adequate education and guiding the cattle in production work in order to cultivate skilled talents. With regard to the almshouse, most of the women go out to work, about 100 people, divided into sewing, picking tea leaves, and rolling cotton clothes.

Handicraft Income, Small But Helpful

Another part of the men and women work indoors, about 200 people, including more than 50 people knitting velvet yarn gloves and weaving colored wax yarn mesh bags. Each day, they can knit 60 dozen mesh bags, which are specially sold to Wing On, Sincere, New Wing On, The Sun, China National Products Company, and major stores. On average, each person can earn between 3 and 5 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes per day. However, elderly women are unable to do manual labor and specialize in pasting tattered cloth shoe linings, which can also generate some income.

Shelters Have Six Sheds

The 11th Shelter is currently located on Alabaster Road and has six sheds. It has been open since the 1st of this month and has taken in 213 extremely poor men and women who are stranded on the streets. The cost of providing supplies is about 20,000 yuan per month, for a total cost of 40,000 yuan for the two months until the end of March, all of which is funded by the Seventh District Public Welfare Association and the Chinese Red Swastika Society.

It is reported that the association's statistics show that the monthly expenses for the almshouse and the Ciji Children's Home are about 60,000 yuan. In addition to a small subsidy from the Disease Relief Association, the shortfall is significant.

### Siren Alarm Test This Afternoon

Shanghai (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Naval Fleet Headquarters in China has scheduled to test the air raid sirens this afternoon (11th) from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM for one hour. Citizens of the city are asked to pay attention.

The Japanese authorities will test the siren alarm on the afternoon of the 11th of this month from 2:00 PM to 3:00 PM, with two long sounds lasting 12 seconds each, separated by 15 seconds. These siren sounds will continue to be rehearsed several times. It is hoped that the public will not misunderstand them as real air raid alarms.

### 96 Insurance Companies Registered in This City

The Ministry of Industry, in view of the recent rapid development of the insurance industry and the emergence of new companies like bamboo shoots after a rain, has specially established the National Insurance Supervision Bureau in Shanghai to protect the assets of merchants and residents. All insurance companies that are established and operating must apply to the bureau for registration and obtain a license before they are allowed to operate. Since then, new insurance companies have continued to prepare for establishment in this city in recent months. Observing the progress of the industrial and commercial promotion in Shanghai, the large number of insurance companies seems to be excessive. Therefore, the Ministry of Industry specifically issued a clear order last year to ban the registration and operation of insurance companies established after December 18th of last year. It is reported that the Insurance Supervision Bureau has now approved the registration and operation of 96 insurance companies. Recent applications for registration have been rejected.

### Fruit and Vegetable Industry to Implement Rationing

In order to prevent price increases and fix prices, the fruit and vegetable industry in this city has been issued certificates by the Public Works Department and the Association Course to organize the "Fruit and Vegetable Retailers Association." According to reports from the Datong News Agency, in the future, all fruits and vegetables sold by each fruit and vegetable seller in this city will be rationed by the joint organization.

### At the Reception for Reporters at the Japanese Embassy, Director-General Hanasui of the Currency Agency Gave a Talk on the Central Reserve Bank Notes; The Current Exchange Rate for Central Reserve Bank Notes and Military Scrip Remains Unchanged; Rumors of New Currency Are Pure Nonsense

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy held its customary reception for the press in this city on the 8th floor of the Cathay Hotel at 3:00 PM on the 9th. Those present included Information Director Hirota of the Embassy, Acting Director-General of the Financial Bureau Eiji Hanasui, and more than 20 reporters from various newspapers in this city. First, Mr. Hanasui gave a talk on currency issues, stating: "Currently, there are two types of currency in China, the Central Reserve Bank Notes and the Military Scrip. The exchange rate is 18 yuan in Military Scrip for 100 yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. This was jointly announced by Minister Zhou of Finance and Financial Officer Ohara when old currency was banned last year, stating that the exchange rate would never be changed. This has remained unchanged to this day.

No Consideration of Changing Currency

However, recently, rumors have repeatedly arisen in Shanghai, claiming that the value of Central Reserve Bank Notes may change, or that the Japanese Greater East Asia Ministry will issue Greater East Asia Securities to replace Central Reserve Bank Notes. All of these are pure nonsense. The Chinese and Japanese authorities have never considered changing the existing currency, and there is no possibility of realizing such a fact. The Chinese and Japanese authorities have already created a good foundation for the existing Central Reserve Bank Notes and have no need to issue new currency to replace them. Especially after the Greater East Asia War, not only the people in Central China will regard it as the only unified currency, but also South China and other places. After the National Government joined the war, China and Japan are fighting under the same position and the same ideals. People in both countries hope for final victory. Finance is even more important than the war. Therefore, Japan especially hopes that the Central Reserve Bank Notes can further consolidate its foundation and stabilize its circulation. Japanese Minister Aoki also clarified that 'The exchange rate between Central Reserve Bank Notes and Japanese currency will be jointly maintained by the two countries and will not be changed. In the past, the purchase of materials in various departments in China was exchanged with Military Scrip, but now it can be exchanged with Central Reserve Bank Notes, the purpose of which is to fully circulate the Central Reserve Bank Notes.' Minister Aoki was once the highest economic advisor in China, and his maintenance and consolidation of the value of the Central Reserve Bank Notes is inevitable. The rumors circulating in Shanghai can be dispelled from now on.

China and Japan Strive for Circulation of Materials

Mr. Hanasui briefly expressed his views on the issue of materials, saying: 'Although I am not directly involved in prices, I specialize in currency. Fluctuations in currency will cause riots in materials. Regarding this point, the phenomenon of material turmoil in Shanghai is actually caused by the interior. The turmoil in the interior of the guerrilla areas has affected Shanghai, causing prices to rise sharply. Enabling materials to flow smoothly in the future is the only way to stabilize prices. Recently, the National Government and the Japanese authorities have agreed to promote the mutual circulation of materials between the interior and Shanghai. It is expected that a specific plan will be announced soon. It can be expected that the agricultural production this year is unusually abundant, increasing by 30% compared with previous years. The cotton in North China has also doubled. These abundant materials can be supplied continuously, and the phenomenon of turmoil can be suppressed in the future. In addition, China can be self-sufficient in coarse grains and cotton. The lack of rice, sugar, and South Asian rubber and oil will be handled by Japan in the future to avoid the worry of shortages.' Then, Information Director Hirota made a brief report on the issue of the return of the concessions and the world situation in the past week.

Developing Enemy Property, Can Be Used

Hanasui also stated that Minister Zhou raised important issues in Shanghai: (1) to expand productivity; (2) to enrich the Central Reserve Bank Notes. The Japanese side also considers them to be important issues. Recently, Japan has returned new enemy property worth approximately 5.1 billion yuan in Central Reserve Bank Notes. China can fully utilize the recovery and management of this asset and further solve the above two major problems. He also said that due to the relationship of war, the currency of any country is showing a wartime phenomenon. But we should adopt the spirit of active construction, cherish the national currency, and protect its legal value. Do not have a critical and skeptical attitude. Then, he answered various questions raised by the reporters. At 5:30 PM, tea and refreshments were served and the meeting adjourned.

### Vaccination by Household in the French Concession's McLane District

In order to care for the health of the people and ensure public sanitation, the authorities in the two concessions have successively implemented vaccination programs. However, many ignorant residents often avoid them. The police station and Baojia district authorities in the French Concession's McLane district, in light of this, have decided to implement vaccination by household to achieve universal vaccination and maintain sanitation within the district. The Baojia heads will work with the doctors to administer the vaccinations. Preparations have been completed, and the work will begin soon. It is said that other districts will also implement this successively.

### First Phase of Flour Distribution Begins Yesterday in West Shanghai

The first phase of this year's flour distribution based on population in the West Shanghai district has officially begun yesterday (the 10th), with the district authorities working with more than sixty rice shops in the three neighborhoods within the district. Each person receives one catty and four taels of flour, sold for two yuan and seventy-five fen in national currency. Residents within the district are enthusiastically receiving their allocations from the various rice shops. Residents who have not yet received their allocation can go to the designated rice shops with their first phase flour purchase certificates to collect it.

### Sino-Japanese Calligraphy Symposium

Our country has always been known as a land of culture. The evolution of Chinese characters has a history of thousands of years. From tadpole script to Great Seal script, Small Seal script, and inscriptions on bronzes, oracle bones, and stone drums, all evolved from the Seal script. After the Han Dynasty, the Clerical script flourished again. Subsequently, the Cursive script, Running script, and Regular script gradually developed with the changing times. Therefore, calligraphy is valued as a specialized academic discipline by the literati and is listed as a required subject. Moreover, writing can express a person's personality, cultivate temperament, and nurture the body and mind. Calligraphy, in particular, has a profound effect. Therefore, those who study calligraphy must undergo academic examination in order to advance. China and Japan share the same writing system, and it is necessary to study the art of calligraphy together. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, recognizing this, is holding a Sino-Japanese calligraphy symposium at the Japanese-Chinese Club branch of the Cathay Hotel at 2:30 PM on the 13th of this month to promote the exchange of art between the two countries and to study calligraphy. The Chinese side has invited Wang Ge Yi, Bai Jiao, Lu Shi Qian Ji Shou Zheng, Wu Dong Mo, Zong Lu Gu Zhang Yan Chang Ma Gong Yu, Xia Jing Guan, Deng Fen Weng, and others. The Japanese side has invited Matsumura, Otani, Fujita Jyoichi, Takahashi Yasui, and about twenty others. All are well-known figures in the calligraphy world of both China and Japan.

On the morning of the 25th of last month, at about 2:00 AM, a sudden fire broke out at the Welcoming Sun Building inside Hardoon Garden (also known as Ai Li Garden) at 1273 Jing'an Temple Road. At that time, the wind fanned the flames, making it difficult to extinguish. It was not until dawn that the fire was extinguished by the fire brigade. However, the magnificent Welcoming Sun Building was completely destroyed. Fortunately, the more than 200 residents of the entire building were alerted early enough to avoid casualties. However, the estimated losses amounted to no less than one or two million yuan. After the incident, the Jing'an Temple police station in charge ordered an investigation into the cause of the fire. It was found that Luo Lingzhi (34 years old, from Shanghai), the adopted granddaughter of the late Hardoon Garden hostess, Luo Jialing, had returned to her room after finishing a mahjong game that evening. She boiled water on an electric stove in front of her bed to make tea. However, while boiling the water, Luo talked with Nara, the eldest adopted daughter of Luo Jialing, causing the water to boil over, damaging the electric wires, and causing a short circuit, which led to the disaster. The police station believed that Luo was not without fault and should be held responsible for the crime of arson under the criminal law. Therefore, she was arrested and prosecuted by the First Special Court for the crime of arson. Yesterday, after hearing the case, the Special Court sentenced Luo Yunzhi to six months of imprisonment for arson and destruction of a residence used by people. If she chooses to pay a fine in lieu of imprisonment, it will be calculated at three yuan per day. Luo expressed her willingness to accept the sentence.

### Zhao Guangfu, the Major Criminal Who Assassinated Tang Jiapeng, Dies

Zhao Guangfu, a notorious thief from Yangzhou, was 38 years old this year. He was originally a carpenter. In the summer of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933), he was instigated by others to collude with accomplices to shoot and kill Tang Jiapeng, the former manager of the Great World amusement park. He then used the gun used to kill Tang to form a gang and commit robberies, and was arrested. The Tang case was tried three times, and he was sentenced to life imprisonment. This case caused a sensation at the time. Later, Zhao was transferred to the second prison under the jurisdiction of Beixinjing to serve his sentence. During the August 13th Incident, he was transferred to the rear to serve in the military. He took the opportunity to escape back to Shanghai and continued his life of theft and robbery. He was arrested by the Public Concession police and found to be an escaped convict from the previous case. He was transferred to the Second Special District Prison by the Third High Court to continue serving his sentence. He was granted amnesty and a reduction in his sentence the year before last, and his sentence was reduced to 15 years in prison. Zhao suffered from beriberi in prison and died the other day after treatment failed. After reporting the death and conducting an examination, his wife could not be located, so the charitable organization provided for his burial.

### Do Not Carry More Than Two Dou of Rice Per Household; Failure to Produce a Transport Permit Will Result in Punishment

The Baojia district authorities of the two concessions, fearing that some residents may not yet be aware of the ban on transporting rice, successively notified all household heads and their families the other day not to transport more than two dou of rice on the streets. Even if it is rice for household consumption, the same rules apply. Residents who wish to transport more than two dou of rice must obtain a transport permit, otherwise they will be subject to punishment.

### Rationing System for Cooking Oil to Be Implemented Within Next Week; Group Sales Method to Be Discontinued

The Cooking Oil Traders Wholesale Office has been responsible for maintaining the supply of cooking oil for residents of this city, and has always adopted a rationing system for sales. In the early stages, it was able to provide for the needs of residents. However, due to the high demand from buyers, the amount of cooking oil rationed was reduced compared to before, and some oil merchants monopolized and speculated, driving up the price of oil on the black market, resulting in a panic over cooking oil and a shortage of supply. Although the wholesale office improved the cooking oil rationing method by merging the 1,830 cooking oil retail stores in the city and dividing them into Class A and Class B sales outlets, this cooking oil panic has not been resolved. Therefore, the office has been approved by the military allocation bureau to implement a cooking oil rationing system based on population, so that every resident can purchase cooking oil, showing universality and eliminating the manipulative behavior of black market oil merchants. According to reporters' inquiries with the cooking oil wholesale office, the method of selling oil through Class A and Class B cooking oil stores previously implemented will be discontinued. Because current stocks of cooking oil have been sold out, after the subsequent batch of cooking oil is transported to Shanghai, the per capita rationing of oil can be implemented in about a week. The implementation measures for the per capita rationing of oil will be announced in the coming days.

Underwear Company Sympathizes with Scholarship Program

Yesterday, the China Underwear Company wrote, "Your newspaper has been running the scholarship program for four sessions, benefiting the poor and cultivating talent for the country, which is a great act of kindness. Our company, in view of the large number of applicants for this session and the high tuition fees, although the colleagues of the newspaper have made great efforts to appeal, still feel that there is not enough porridge for the monks. We are taking the initiative to send 5,000 yuan in Central Reserve Bank notes to fulfill our humanistic duty and do what little we can. In the future, we will consult with the company's board of directors and colleagues to continue to provide assistance to the best of our ability." In addition, there were also letters from anonymous apprentices and Dr. Ke Jin, expressing their enthusiasm for the scholarship program, for which we are truly grateful.

### Satisfactory Coal Ball Supply Expected to be Maintained: The Committee for Controlled Coal Rationing Annual Report

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Department announced that, for the sake of controlling coal rationing, the Council established a Committee for Controlled Coal Rationing, consisting of six members. Two of these seats were requested to be held by representatives from the French Concession Public Works Bureau, in order to seek close cooperation between the authorities of the two concessions. Furthermore, as a result of the efforts of the committee chairman, full understanding was maintained with the Japanese authorities.

Felt Panic Last Spring: Allocated Japanese Merchants' Stored Coal

In the early part of the first half of the year, coal imports completely ceased, and the coal reserves in the two concessions were very weak. As a result of the Council's organization of coal inventory registration, it was discovered that most of the stored coal was held by users. Most of these users purchased coal for emergency use, and very few held a quantity exceeding three months' needs. At the same time, the stock held by coal merchants available for sale was almost exhausted. If users had no stored coal, they felt significant hardship. At that time, all inventory was subject to the regulations of the Council's Announcement No. 564, issued on December 9th of the previous year, which stipulated that a moving permit must be obtained before transportation was allowed. This measure enabled the Council to implement the strictest control over coal distribution.

Because "free coal" (i.e., coal sold on the market) was in short supply, quickly clearing channels and increasing supply was a critical objective. It was learned that the Japanese authorities controlled a considerable daily amount of stored coal in Pudong, and were negotiating for the continued import of new goods. The Committee therefore decided to submit the entire coal problem to the Japanese authorities for consideration, requesting them to release a portion of the Pudong stored coal to meet the urgent needs of the two concessions, and to find ways to clear channels and maintain a normal supply.

The Committee conducted a detailed investigation into the coal needs of the city, and prepared a report for the reference of the Japanese authorities. This report was submitted to the Japanese authorities on January 15th of last year. By the end of January, the Committee Chairman announced that coal had begun to be allocated to the Shanghai Electric Power Company and the Shanghai Waterworks Company. At the same time, a large portion of the coal stored by Japanese merchants had been designated for supply to the two concessions.

Improved Distribution System: Gradually Lowering Prices

In order to control the coal supply, the Chamber of Commerce and the Shanghai Japanese Coal Importers Association jointly organized a Chinese Coal Merchants Association. Those who joined the association were all giants in the coal industry. Their task was to handle all coal supplies under the direct supervision of the Japanese authorities and in close cooperation with the Council, and to effectively distribute coal according to the stipulated prices. In early March of last year, the first batch of coal was allocated through the aforementioned organizations. Since then, coal has been allocated successively and periodically, and the types of coal allocated have gradually increased. The distribution system has been improved from time to time, while improving quality and gradually lowering prices. The direct allocation of coal to large users has not encountered any obstacles. The coal allocated to these users was in accordance with the stipulated prices and equivalent quantities. However, difficulties were experienced in the allocation of coal to small commercial users and households, because a significant portion of the coal allocated in this way was transferred to brokers, and when it reached the users, it often exceeded the limited price, and the amount did not match the originally allocated amount. The Japanese authorities and the Council, recognizing this, cooperated closely to implement crackdowns and take strong measures, and the situation visibly improved.

Currently, Shanghai's coal reserves are abundant, and arrivals are also strong, sufficient to meet the needs of the two concessions.

Satisfactory Coal Ball Supply: Samples Periodically Tested

Regarding the supply of coal balls, at the end of the year before last, the Hongji coal dust stored by various coal ball factories, used to manufacture high-quality coal balls, was only enough to supply the city's needs for two months. Subsequently, the Committee found ways to sell coal dust stored by some major coal merchants to coal ball factories at reasonable prices, and urged the coal ball factories to continue to fully operate and produce goods in order to avoid a coal ball panic. They also contacted the aforementioned coal allocation organizations to continue to supply coal dust. Retail coal ball stores were ordered to register in order to closely monitor the distribution situation.

Coal balls are a necessity for cooking for Chinese residents, and are the most important of all fuels. The Committee therefore paid special attention to this important commodity. The limited price of coal balls was absolutely not changed, and coal ball users quickly reacted to situations where prices exceeded the limit. At the same time, the Coal Ball Manufacturers Association was able to maintain a high level of cooperation with the Council, so controlling the price and quality of coal balls was easier than controlling coal. There was almost no occurrence of people queuing to buy coal balls in the market, which proves that the allocation of coal balls was indeed satisfactory. The Council then issued Announcement No. 6164 on November 16th of last year, stating that no permit was required to transport coal balls.

The types and quality of raw materials obtained by various coal ball factories are inconsistent, so it is not yet possible to strictly regulate the standard quality of coal balls. However, due to the periodic testing of coal ball samples, the quality of coal balls can be maintained at a fairly good level.

### Cooked Noodle Industry to Obtain Raw Noodles: Must Fulfill Promise to Sell, Cooked for Customers Only, Never Sold Outside the Store

Regarding the request by noodle shops and stalls to restore flour allocation in order to produce and sell noodles, maintain the livelihoods of workers, and facilitate the purchase of food for the poor and laborers, the Datong News Agency has learned that flour for the cooked noodle industry will be allocated to the raw noodle industry, and then the cooked noodle industry will obtain raw noodles from the raw noodle industry. This can relieve the livelihoods of workers in both industries. However, the amount of flour allocated is too small to be distributed among the industry, and they are still requesting to improve the allocation method. The fried dough sticks and pancake industry and the pancake and steamed bun industry are considering a joint flour allocation and production method due to the same membership scope in both industries, in order to improve the lives of lower-class people.

Cooked Noodle Industry Guarantee

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Office, in order to prevent the cooked noodle industry from receiving raw noodles from noodle shops and then failing to act in accordance with their promises, has printed a guarantee form to order the cooked noodle industry to fill out and submit. The letter is as follows: "To whom it may concern, due to the convenience of purchasing a large quantity of raw noodles granted to our store by your office, we hereby promise to cook all the raw noodles purchased and sell them to customers, limited to consumption within the store, and to sell them according to the prices set by the authorities. Under no circumstances will they be sold for consumption outside the store. If there is any failure to fulfill the above-mentioned promises, we will allow your office to stop the convenience of supplying a large quantity of raw noodles and revoke the business license."

Fried Dough Sticks and Pancake Industry Petition

The other day, the United Benefit Association of the pancake, noodle, and fried dough sticks industry sent Dai Ziquan and others to the Shanghai Municipal Council to continue their petition. Representative Dai Ziquan guaranteed that the members of the association would abide by the regulations set by the authorities for future operations, crack down on black market phenomena, and submit the proposed price list for pancakes, fried dough sticks, and other goods for review. The price list does not include the profits, electricity, and rent of each business. They requested the authorities to consider the good intentions of each business and increase the original cost by 20% so that each business could make a living. The Pancake and Steamed Bun Industry Association also sent representatives Zhang Guanshou, Tang Miaoquan, Wang Guisheng, and Zhang Jinsheng to the Public Association Section and Material Control Office of the Shanghai Municipal Council to petition for the early restoration of flour allocation in order to maintain the livelihoods of workers and enable the poor to purchase food.

### New Shanghai Movement Discusses Scout Organization

The Shanghai Special Municipal Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee held its second committee meeting at 3:00 PM on the 8th in the Municipal Government Conference Room. Fifteen committee members including Shen Siliang and Hu Dunfu attended. The general director of the committee was also present. Chairman Chen, concurrently the chairman of the committee, spoke first, followed by Xi, concurrently the secretary, reporting on the committee's affairs. Then, proposals were discussed, as follows: (1) The chairman submitted for discussion a draft plan for the organization of youth groups and boy scouts in the city, signed by Xi, concurrently the secretary, in order to expedite the completion of the organization of Chinese youth groups and boy scouts according to orders, and to set March 30th of this year as the official establishment date of the team headquarters in various provinces and cities, stipulating that a grand review should be held simultaneously in various places. Resolution: Passed according to the original plan. (2) The chairman submitted for discussion a memorandum from Xi, concurrently the secretary, stating that in order to complete the first phase of the organization of city and school teams of youth groups and boy scouts in the city, and to adapt to the grand review, it is proposed to first hold a training class for instructors of youth groups and boy scouts in the city, and to propose various methods. Resolution: Sent for review. Finally, Committee Member Mo made a temporary motion: (1) In order to promote the New National Movement in the city, it is proposed to organize New National Movement Practice Groups in various organizations and groups (including public and private organizations). Resolution: Passed, and a deadline of March 30th of this year was set for the organization and establishment. (2) In order to train rural youth and establish a new foundation for rural construction, and to fulfill the mission of the New National Movement, it is proposed to organize youth groups and boy scouts in various districts of Shanghai Special Municipality. Resolution: Passed, and the proposed methods were merged with the ninth proposal for consolidation. (3) In order to compile and review various relevant teaching materials and reading materials, it is proposed to organize an Editorial and Review Committee. Resolution: Passed.

### Leather Shoes: Rubber Soles to be Used Instead: Material Control Office Circular

The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Office, in view of the current shortage of cowhide soles, has issued a circular to the leather shoe industry association in the city, requiring all kinds of leather shoes to use rubber soles instead, in order to reduce costs and keep prices down. The association has notified its member shoe stores to comply. It is said that leather shoes sold on the market will universally adopt rubber soles in the future.

### Transfer License: Late Fee Required for Supplementary Application: 30 Yuan Fine for Overdue Applications

The deadline for landlords in the Public Concession to obtain transfer licenses for January to June of this year was set from December 14th to 23rd of last year. However, many landlords have not yet obtained the application forms. They are currently applying for supplementary applications at the Transfer License Office, No. 180 Fuzhou Road, Shanghai Municipal Council Building. In order to deter them, those who have not obtained the application forms must pay a fine of 30 yuan, and a late fee of one yuan per day of delay.

### Forty Detectives: To Serve in Various Police Stations

### Various Banks' Reserve Funds: To be Paid at the End of the Month: At Least 10% of Deposit Amount

After the Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Bank implemented the temporary measures and detailed rules for managing financial institutions and the deposit reserve system for various banks, the implementation process, after consultation with the silver and money industries, involved first paying at least 5% of the reserve funds for fixed deposits and special current deposits. Then, the reserve funds of at least 10% of the current deposits were processed. Since the reserve funds for fixed and current deposits were divided into two installments, the reserve amount of each financial institution has been based on the high or low of monthly deposits as the standard for paying the reserve funds. The reserve funds for current deposits will begin to be paid at the end of this month.

### Inscriptions and Calligraphy (1)

— Bai Jiao of Yun Jian

Mr. Bai Jiao of Yun Jian is a renowned calligrapher. His orchid paintings and seal carvings are highly praised in his time. This article is a transcript of a speech, making a fair judgment on the debate between inscriptions and calligraphy in the field of calligraphy. Its outline is sufficient to guide future generations.

The debate on inscriptions and calligraphy in calligraphy dates back to the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras. Proponents of inscriptions criticize calligraphy, while those who favor calligraphy attack inscriptions. Broadly speaking, the so-called "Inscription School," from Si Shenbo to Li Meian and Zeng Nongran, with their sawtooth edges and earthworm calligraphy, once swept the scene and dominated the so-called "Calligraphy School." But now, the tide seems to have turned again.

From the perspective of mutual attacks between those who advocate learning inscriptions and those who advocate learning calligraphy, it seems to me to be merely a dispute between worm-eaten peaches and rotten persimmons. I will explain this later. Now, let's first talk about the inscriptions and calligraphy themselves. To discuss inscriptions and calligraphy, we must first understand what is called "inscription" and what is called "calligraphy." What are the definitions and boundaries of inscriptions and calligraphy themselves?

Inscription: Setting up a stone is called an inscription; inscribing words on a stone is called an inscription. The characters on the inscription are directly written on the stone by the calligrapher and then carved. This includes various stone carvings such as commemorative inscriptions, spirit paths, epitaphs, and cliff carvings.

Calligraphy: In ancient times, there was no paper, so writing on silk was called calligraphy. Silk was difficult to preserve for a long time, so ancient calligraphy was copied and carved onto stone or wood, which was also called calligraphy. The writing and carving are indirect. This includes rubbings of letters, memorials, poetry, and so on.

Generally speaking, the categories of calligraphy are based on the style of writing: such as seal script, official script, cursive script, running script, and regular script; based on the person: such as Zhong Yao, Wang Xizhi, Ouyang Xun, and Yan Zhenqing; when the calligrapher is not specified, it is based on the dynasty: such as Xia, Shang, Zhou, Qin; based on the state: such as Qi, Lu, Chu, Hao; or based on the object: such as the San Shi Pan, Mao Gong Ding, Qi Hou Lei, Lai Zi Sun Stele, Heng Yue Stele, and Yi Ying Stele. Dividing superiority based on inscriptions and calligraphy, and dividing schools based on north and south, is a new theory in calligraphy.

Originally, the one who stirred up this great wave of "honoring inscriptions and belittling calligraphy" was An Wu Bao Shenbo; following up, promoting and fueling the flames to "honor Wei and despise Tang" was Kang Changsu of Nanhai. Both Bao and Kang were eloquent debaters. Bao wrote the "Art Boat Double Sculls," and Kang wrote the "Expanded Art Boat Double Sculls" (actually, it was only one oar). These two books had a considerable impact on the calligraphy world. However, the one who started this theory was not An Wu, but Yi Zheng Ruan Yuan. And Ruan's innovation was not without the suggestion of Wang Xuzhou's saying "Jiangnan rubbings are not as good as Hebei broken steles." Ruan was an expert in classics during the Qianlong and Jiaqing eras of the Qing Dynasty. He took it upon himself to promote scholarship wherever he went, wrote extensively, and carved books widely. He was also able to write small seal script and Han official script, which were quite impressive. He first had two articles on the North-South calligraphy schools and the North Inscription-South Calligraphy theory (Yanjing Shisan Ji, Volume 1). Scholarship in the Qing Dynasty, especially textual research, was particularly developed. At that time, ancient philology made great progress. Discovering new meanings in the characters of ancient steles, tablets, and bronze inscriptions was valuable enough to correct the classics and history. Ruan was a master of classics and paid attention to calligraphy and painting. He saw that the calligraphy of the time was confined to the Pavilion Calligraphy and the Preface to the Orchid Pavilion, especially since Emperor Qianlong liked to learn Dong Qichang's calligraphy, which was itself vulgar. And the upper echelons followed suit, and the calligraphers who were called masters specialized in elegance and beauty, with no backbone at all. It had really reached a point where it could not be tolerated. Therefore, Ruan, who took it upon himself to correct abuses and raise the spirits, thought of opening the eyes of the world and finding a way out. Thus, his two innovative theories were like giving a strong heart injection to a patient, and prescribing a croton and rhubarb medicine for the patient, causing quack doctors to look at him with new eyes. The essence of the two articles was something of textual research. It can also be said that he was very revolutionary in issuing research-based essays from a historical, geographical, and political perspective. He really had insight, and it was not for nothing. Originally, scholarship is the public property of the world. He promoted inscriptions, but his spirit was entirely a scholar's attitude of establishing a new theory in scholarship. Now, let's excerpt the arguments of the two articles to explore them.

Theory of the North-South Calligraphy Schools: "The transformation from official script to regular script, running script, and cursive script really occurred between the late Han and Wei-Jin dynasties. Later, regular script, running script, and cursive script were further divided into the North and South schools. The Eastern Jin, Song, Qi, Liang, and Chen dynasties were the Southern school; Zhao, Yan, Wei, Qi, Zhou, and Sui were the Northern school. The Southern school, from Zhong Yao, Wei Guan, Wang Xizhi, Wang Xianzhi, Wang Sengqian, etc., to Zhi Yong and Yu Shinan; the Northern school, from Zhong Yao and Wei Guan, An Jing, Cui Yue, Lu Chen, Guo Shi, Shen Fu, Yao Yuanbiao, Zhao Wenshen, Ding Daohu, etc., to Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang."

"The Southern school's calligraphy was not very prominent from generation to generation. It was not until the Zhenguan period of the Tang Dynasty that it became popular, but the calligraphy style of Ouyang Xun and Chu Suiliang also originated from the Northern school. Even the 'Kaicheng Stone Classics' written after the Yonghui period of the Tang Dynasty still have the remnants of the Northern school."

"The Southern school is the style of the literati of Jiangzuo, sparse and beautiful, good at letters, and often uses simple strokes. Since what is valued is biased, it has gradually reached the point where it does not recognize the legacy of seal script. In the Eastern Jin Dynasty, there were already many changes. In the subsequent Song and Qi dynasties, the so-called ancient method was completely lost."

"The Northern school is the ancient method of the Central Plains, restrained, ancient, and clumsy, good at monumental inscriptions. The legacy of Cai Yong, Wei Dan, Handan Chun, Wei Jing, Zhang Zhi, Du Du, etc., in seal script, official script, eight-part script, and cursive script, still existed until the late Sui and early Tang dynasties."

"The Northern and Southern schools are as distinct as rivers and lakes that do not mix, and even the aristocratic families do not communicate with each other. This trend still existed in the early Tang Dynasty. Emperor Taizong was originally from the North, but he only loved Wang Xizhi's calligraphy, so he was close to Yu Shinan. Wang Xizhi's calligraphy actually combined the strengths of both the North and South schools, which can be verified in the existing Wang calligraphy. For hundreds of years, the Northern school has been popular, and the common people have also used it a lot. Examining the characters commonly carved on stones and tiles at that time, they all have the calligraphy style of the Northern school in the Qi and Zhou dynasties, and there are very few like the Pavilion Calligraphy or Wang Xizhi's Southern school style. After the Pavilion Calligraphy became popular among the people, there were no more Northern school styles in steles and stone carvings."

"Wang Zhong of the Liang Dynasty was a master of the Southern school. He entered the service of the Northern Dynasty, and Emperor Gaozu of the Tang Dynasty learned his longevity, so his son Emperor Taizong also loved Wang Xizhi's calligraphy."

Commercial News

### Most of the Chinese Stocks Retraced and Fell; Public Utilities Stocks Had a Unique Advantage; Zhabei Water and Electricity Reached 90 Yuan

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market mostly retraced and fell, which was mainly because the increase was too large in the ten days before the Spring Festival holiday, causing holders to sell for profit. Moreover, the plan for the year lies in spring, and some people sold their stocks to invest in establishing industries. People's hearts were even more uncertain. However, the upward trend of public utilities stocks intensified. Under favorable circumstances, there were many people who bought in anticipation of higher prices.

### Government Bonds Pour Out; Prices of Type A and C Were Side by Side

The government bond market suddenly tightened yesterday due to tight money supply. Money houses slightly sold off due to head position relationships. Although the market price once rose, it eventually fell. This is also a temporary phenomenon and has little relationship with the bond market itself. However, it is only slightly threatened temporarily. Yesterday, Type C initially traded at 70 yuan and 5 cents. Because the people's sentiment was still strong, it was raised to 73 yuan. Later, as spot goods were sold, it gradually declined, and finally it was 70 yuan, which had not broken into the big barrier. Other types such as Type A initially traded at 69 yuan and 5 cents, rose to 70 yuan and 5 cents, and finally about 70 yuan.

### Central China Cotton Improvement Association Plans to Increase Cotton Production to Achieve Self-Sufficiency

The Central China Cotton Improvement Association held its fifth board meeting at the Japanese Club at 2 pm on the 9th. The attendees included President Mei, Minister of Industry (represented by You Xiaobiao, Director of the Agricultural Department of the Ministry of Industry), Chairman of the Board Tatsuo Funatsu, Managing Director Takashi Tsutsumi, and more than 20 Chinese and Japanese directors to discuss the budget and business plan for the 32nd year of the Republic of China. First, Minister Mei delivered a speech on behalf of the association, and then Chairman Funatsu reported on the business plan, briefly stating that since the establishment of the association, it has been four years, and with the sincere guidance and assistance of the Chinese and Japanese governments and related parties, the organization has been enriched, the business has been expanded, and the cotton production in Central China has been improved. During the cotton growing season last year, the weather was not very good. The harvest was poor. Moreover, due to the soaring food prices, some cotton fields were converted to food crops, so the area of cotton fields decreased, and the production tended to decline, which is deeply regrettable. However, in the areas guided by the association, the harvest increased due to the cultivation of superior seeds. Currently, due to the improved quality, the selling price is also high, and the income of farmers is higher than before. Therefore, it has made many contributions to the cotton industry economy. In order to meet the needs of the military and civilians in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is necessary to increase the cotton production in Central China. The association is adapting to this need, expanding its organization, developing its business, and at the same time, it will work with the Cotton Industry Management Office and other related agencies. If the situation allows, it plans to popularize superior seeds to Yancheng in Jiangbei and other major cotton producing areas, encourage the improvement of cotton cultivation, and also guide wheat cultivation as an incidental measure, so that it can also contribute to the food policy. It is currently striving to increase cotton production, improve the welfare of cotton farmers, and revitalize the countryside. (Ren: Translated from the February 10th Mainland New Daily)

### Japan and China Cooperate to Increase Agricultural Production; The Japanese House of Representatives Budget General Assembly; Prime Minister Tojo Answers Questions from Members

At the general meeting of the House of Representatives budget on February 2, a member asked about setting the basic policy of the food production zone in Japan, China, and Manchuria. Prime Minister Tojo replied on the spot: The permanent policy of food in Japan, China, and Manchuria is being promoted. It is not necessary to rely on the South. Cooperate with China and Manchuria throughout, and encourage agriculture so that the supply is abundant. The Japanese government is currently guiding the Chinese side to revive Chinese agriculture and stabilize the lives of Chinese farmers. The government is guiding the improvement of the technical level of Chinese farmers.

In order to revive Chinese agriculture, the Japanese government established the North China Industrial Science Research Institute in Qingdao in the 11th year of Showa (1936). It has now been moved to Beijing, with complete equipment and the world's best research institute. It can be called the root of developing Chinese industry, engaging in improving cotton seeds and raising goats. The Japanese government has provided a lot of assistance to it and has great expectations. A large number of agricultural personnel have also been dispatched. The Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry has successively selected Japanese agricultural technicians to go to provide practical guidance. This year, the Ministry of Greater East Asia has proposed an additional budget of 250,000 Japanese yen to assist Chinese agriculture, which has been passed and decided to subsidize the Central China Agricultural Assistance Association. In addition, the National Government and major national policy companies have also provided assistance in various ways, dispatching technical personnel to promote the revitalization of agricultural production in Central and North China.

Prime Minister Tojo also said: In order to achieve Chinese agriculture, the necessary fertilizers are supplied, canals are opened, water conservancy is promoted, and artesian wells are drilled in North China to benefit water sources.

In the past, Chinese agriculture's fertilizers were mainly river mud, so the fertilizer content was insufficient. Fortunately, the Yongli Chemical Industry Company in Nanjing now manufactures ammonium sulfate to make up for this deficiency. The annual output is quite large, and the fertilizer problem in Chinese agriculture has been almost solved. As for other fertilizer issues, farmers are encouraged to manufacture their own, and the results are remarkable. The largest project in developing Chinese industry is the five-year plan for North China Agricultural and Civil Engineering Projects under the General Construction Department. The main purpose is to increase agricultural productivity and achieve self-sufficiency in food in North China; and to promote water conservancy facilities in order to strengthen shipping. The planned water conservancy facilities projects are the Luan River, Ji Canal, Baiyangdian Canal, Shijin Canal, and Dongping Lake. These five areas are mostly paddy fields, so the water demand is very large. The project materials are found locally. As for the start date, the rural leisure period will be used so that farmers can help with the work. There are no obstacles to the five projects since the design.

Artesian wells are being opened everywhere, especially in Shandong Province in North China, which is promoting it more vigorously. It is planned to complete 2.3 million artesian wells from January to mid-May of this year. The China-Japan Cooperative Association and local county authorities are supervising the construction day and night. The project is progressing, and the results may exceed expectations. The Japanese government has allocated 12 million Japanese yen to subsidize its expenses. (Ren: Translated from the February 5th Mainland New Daily)

### Yarn Industry Vows to Eliminate the Black Market

The Shanghai Yarn Industry Association market originally had news of resuming business the day before yesterday (the 9th), but after the resumption of business, only spot transactions were allowed, and the price limit could not be exceeded. However, because the current prices of various yarns have greatly exceeded the price limit, it is difficult to open market transactions within the price limit, so the resumption of business was postponed. It is learned that the association bureau is still planning for the resumption of the market. Since yesterday, it has ordered all association members to solemnly swear that they will abide by the price limit announced by the authorities for cotton yarn transactions and will never exceed it. The cotton yarn black market can be gradually eliminated. Once the members have sworn, and the cotton yarn price is brought into line, the yarn industry association market can be officially resumed.

### Cotton Cloth is Sold Off One After Another; The Black Market is Severely Cracking Down; A Fierce Fall in Prices Occurs

Yesterday morning, the cloth market was affected by the authorities' severe crackdown on the black market. Holders sold off one after another, so a fierce downward trend occurred in the market with more selling than buying. Fine cloth was 30+ yuan down.

### Reader's Required Understanding

— Gao Tang

Those who are literate all want to read, but what to read is the question. Some people’s attitude toward reading is: only new and good books are worth reading, even limiting themselves to books on political theory. Therefore, those living in big cities suffer from having too many books, both good and bad, old and new, fearing to read a bad book and thus not knowing what to read. Those living in remote, poor villages suffer from the lack of new books, and the ones available are not worth reading. At school, some feel what they learn cannot be applied, and they only cope with homework, seeking extracurricular books to read—this is one type. Another type specializes in one subject, not reading anything unrelated (as they deem it unrelated). Thus, some doing technical work or engaged in artistic work only read a few books they need, and ignore everything else.

Both of these attitudes have shortcomings. Seeking new and good books to read is correct, because reading is for increasing knowledge, and reading new and good books enables us to learn good and useful knowledge. But old books are not completely devoid of good things. For example, old novels describing the current state of society, such as *Water Margin*, *The Scholars*, *The Bureaucrats*, etc., can enrich our social knowledge. And researching Chinese history inevitably requires using many old historical books as materials. These kinds of books are not only available in big cities, but can also be found in remote, poor villages. But this is not to say that everyone should go and read old books; it's just saying that besides reading new books, old books also have their value. Things are different at school. School textbooks may not all be good, but there are indeed many things that must be learned, such as mathematics, physics, chemistry, engineering, history, geography, accounting, etc. These are all things that can be learned well in school. As for foreign languages, it goes without saying. In culturally backward China, reading materials often cannot satisfy our needs. Therefore, learning a foreign language well means acquiring a powerful tool for reading. Should extracurricular books be read? Of course, they should, but one cannot completely ignore one's schoolwork while reading extracurricular books. Secondly, we should also know that new and good books are not available everywhere, and even if they are available, we may not be able to read whatever we want due to various reasons. Therefore, I believe both new and old books can be read.

Furthermore, specializing in one subject is the right thing to do. Not only that, but we also advocate "learn what you do." Because if I do technical work and cannot do it well or master the technology, I will never be proficient. Engaging in artistic work without understanding art is even worse. But we cannot therefore put up a sign saying "Don't talk about national affairs" and not read other books. No matter what subject we study, we must have a general basic knowledge. Moreover, no matter what we learn, it is to serve society. If we don't understand what kind of society the current society is, even if we shout about service a lot, it's just empty talk. Therefore, in addition to specializing in one subject, we must also study other books.

In this way, I think at least the following books are worth reading: (1) Various progressive theoretical books, (2) Natural sciences, (3) History and geography, (4) Old novels, ancient books. In addition, novels, dramas, music, and various other books that are beneficial to personal improvement, the masses, and cultural cultivation can all be read. And in order to increase reading tools, learning foreign languages is also necessary. But no matter what books one reads or what subjects one studies, one must strive for depth in a certain area. If one reads every book and studies every problem without seeking deep understanding (in fact, one cannot achieve deep understanding in this way), one will become a jack-of-all-trades, master of none. Knowing a little about everything, but not truly understanding anything, is like being skilled in all eighteen martial arts, but proficient in none.

Some people put a lot of effort into reading, even being able to recite the sentences in a book, but they cannot apply them. There are also people who read superficially, skimming through without seeking thorough understanding. After reading, they can only say that they have read such a book, but have not gained anything from it. There are also people who do not distinguish between right and wrong when reading books with completely opposing views, seeking correct opinions. This book is right, that book is also right, and ultimately they don't know who is right, becoming even more confused after reading. There are even people who are satisfied with having a bookshelf full of progressive books, flipping through them when they are happy, and letting insects eat them when they are not. This is not reading, but using books as decorations. In fact, such decorations are not only useless, but sometimes harmful. Reading in this way not only fails to gain useful things from bad books, but also fails to gain useful things from good books. Therefore, studying the method of reading—how to read—becomes necessary.

### Round and Square

— Ke Wei

Round and square are two different adjectives, one is multi-faceted, the other is round and smooth.

Whenever we talk about someone who is serious and inflexible in doing things, we call him "walking square steps"; for someone who is not subdued by power and wealth, we call his personality "upright." At the same time, for someone who can adapt to the environment on all sides and please everyone, we call him "slick," like a ball that is in equilibrium in physics and can survive in any environment.

On the surface, a slick person seems to always get the advantage. He can adapt to the environment and get praise from all sides. Slickness is indeed a good adjective, but it should be used in moderation, otherwise it will become sycophancy.

An upright person is often cursed as a "stubborn head," but his loyalty, seriousness, and integrity are his virtues. The world's great men and scientists have this spirit of serious work to achieve ultimate success.

### Scenes from the Countryside

### Self-Respect and Self-Boasting

— Jie Ren

If a person wants to achieve some success in life, he must have self-respect—respect for his own personality, thoughts, actions, and responsibilities. This is also a mentality that everyone should have.

With self-respect, humanity has new developments, and society can move forward. Conversely, if humanity does not have this kind of self-respecting and competitive spirit, then humanity does not know its own value and its own position, and indeed does not trust its own strength, not believing that its own strength can achieve great undertakings. Therefore, it loses its enterprising spirit and cannot seek the development of life, and society will never have the hope of moving forward. So self-respect is the most reliable capital in life. It is more effective than money, power, and any help from relatives and friends. It can enable people to overcome difficulties and obstacles, and achieve success in their careers.

However, a self-boasting person is not necessarily a self-respecting person, nor does he necessarily have an enterprising spirit. Nowadays, in society, there are self-boasting and arrogant people everywhere. They will describe their family's small assets as vast, and how lavishly they can act in social situations, and how rich their lives are. Many people can be deceived by him, and he can become even more successful. But once the truth is exposed, the result he gets is only everyone's contempt, and he can never be trusted again.

Exaggerating oneself not only fails to make others respect you, but sometimes even if you have very good achievements, the result of self-boasting can make them insignificant. A great person never boasts. Once he boasts, no matter how great he is, he will become small. A self-boasting person is definitely not a self-respecting person. Only those who can respect themselves can be respected by others. Loyal friends! A person without self-respect will never leave deep traces on the road to success. Let us never boast! Let us uphold our self-respect! No matter what kind of undertaking, we will never fail!

### Teacher for All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin

Then he mentioned that he had been at Brookfield for forty-two years, and he was very happy there. "This has been my life," he said simply. "O miki praeteritos refora i i jupiter annos... uh hum—I don't have to—of course—translate it." Much laughter.

I remember many changes at Brookfield. I remember—uh hum—the first bicycle. I remember when there were no gas lamps or electric lights. In our administration department, we always used a person called a lamp-lighter—he did nothing else but wipe, trim, and light all the lamps in the school. I remember that winter term when the ground was a sheet of ice, and it refused to thaw for seven weeks—there were no other games, and the whole school was learning to skate on the swamp. That was probably around 1880. I remember when two-thirds of the school had German measles, and the hall was turned into a hospital ward. I remember our grand fireworks display on Victory Night. It was placed too close to the big awning, and we had to call the fire department to put it out. But the firefighters were also holding their own celebrations, and most of them—uh hum—were also getting into quite an embarrassing state. (Laughter) I remember Mrs. Brool, whose picture still hangs in the snack shop. She worked there until an uncle in Australia left her some money and she stopped. Indeed, I remember a lot, and so I often think I should write a book. What should I call it now? "Memoirs of a Cane and Chalk," how about it? (Cheers and laughter. This was a good joke, everyone thought—one of Chips's best.) Well, well, someday I will write it. But I still like to tell you about it. Really. I remember... I remember... but mainly I remember the faces of each of you. I will never forget them. In my mind, there are thousands of faces—the faces of children. If you come to see me again in a few years—I hope you all do—I will remember those old faces of yours, but perhaps it is very likely that I will not remember—and then one day you will see me somewhere else, and I still won't recognize you, and you will say to yourself, "This old fellow doesn't remember me."

### A Practitioner of Wealth Preservation

— Qi Ji

Since this newspaper published Mr. Nie Yuntai's method of wealth preservation, it has been widely circulated and recited, touching the hearts of many people. However, it is not yet known how many wealthy people can put it into practice, because it is easy to talk about, but when it comes to practice, there are bound to be difficulties. As the saying goes, knowing is not difficult, but doing is. We don't need to talk about this, and we will see the results in the future. What I want to introduce to readers now is a practitioner of wealth preservation from the Ming Dynasty, whose behavior is worth studying.

In Zhang Dafu's *Meihua Caotang Ji* [Collected Writings from the Plum Blossom Cottage] there is such a record:

"A eunuch from Western Shu [Sichuan] served as an investigating censor. He had five sons, and he set up middle and lower-class properties for each of them, only giving them porridge and gruel. He himself wore and used only what was necessary, never allowing any surplus. When he was old and long-lived, he took out the accumulated emoluments he had saved over his lifetime, which amounted to ten thousand taels of silver, and wished to donate them to supplement the public treasury. The officials reported that the public treasury was not in deficit and that there were no public affairs to which to contribute. The eunuch then requested that he be allowed to dig a hole in an abandoned courtyard and bury the money, inscribing on a stone tablet: 'Returning to the Creator.' After a hundred years, the cellar remained as before. In the *Xin You* year of the *Wanli* reign [1621], the bandit chief created chaos, and public and private property in Chengdu Prefecture was almost completely looted. The scholars and people of Chengdu Prefecture had nothing to eat and were on the verge of collapse. Someone who knew about this matter reported it to the officials, and they were able to avoid complete ruin. This old man's noble righteousness pierces through the ages. Regardless, the eunuchs who served in this land, and the scholars and people of this land, were all honest officials and upright men."

Readers may laugh at this gentleman for being too foolish, and asking why he had to bury the money. My point is that perhaps there were no charitable organizations at that time, and he originally wanted to donate it to the government, but the government did not accept it. At this point, another person might have changed his original intention and still divided the property among his children. Others could not say that he was going back on his word, because there was really nowhere to put the money. But this gentleman regarded this money as if it were poisonous snakes and fierce beasts; no matter what, he would not allow it to remain in the hands of his children, and would rather request to dig a hole in an abandoned courtyard and bury it, rather than bequeath a hundred generations of misfortune to his descendants. When we see this, we can't help but admire his foresight. It is really beyond the reach of ordinary wealthy people. His understanding of the principles of wealth preservation was so thorough that he knew everything about it, not just a little superficial knowledge. Therefore, once he made up his mind, he would never change it. When we read about wealth preservation, we should also carefully consider the truth it tells. If we don't understand it very well after reading it once, we may as well read it several times until we fully understand it, so that when we put it into practice, there will be no hesitation.

### After Reading "Korean Spring"

— Xiao Shuming

In the long-silent Shanghai literary world, I recently read a literary work that is quite endearing, namely "Korean Spring" by the Korean writer Zhang Hezhu.

There are so many similarities between the Korean and Chinese peoples. Therefore, in Korean literature, we often find our own shadows, and sometimes we find our own character even more. Of course, these shadows and characters are somewhat different in terms of the era, that is, the character of Koreans in this period may be found in the character of Chinese in the previous period, but we cannot deny that in many parts of China today, we can still see the characters of many people in "Korean Spring."

"Korean Spring" is a landscape painting drawn with a painter's brush, and also a recitation poem accompanied by moving music. From the descriptions of the author Zhang Hezhu, we see the flowers and plants of Korea, the people of Korea, the mountains and rivers of Korea, the villages of Korea, and even the architecture of the cities. There are many landscapes and plants that can evoke our emotions, and many lonely people and events that can arouse our sorrow. And the author's method of description, as the translator Fan Quan said in the "Preface," is to use "a fine steel needle to gently prick the skin of people," so its "hidden pain penetrates deep into people's hearts." But the author does not only make people feel "hidden pain," and sometimes uses a passionate tone to speak for the future of Korea. For example, at the end of "Korean Spring," he says, "Although the fields and mountain peaks are coming to spring, it is not known when the spring of humanity will come. Can spring only be in flowers and no longer have a time when 'spring is in humanity'?" At the end of "Beautiful Korea," he says again: "The nature of Korea should be beautiful, and in fact there are many beautiful places. If people can have a prosperous life, then I think it will definitely be even more beautiful." So he finally shouts: "So I eagerly look forward to the early appearance of such a Korea!"

Therefore, for so many years, the translator's criticism of the author is correct: "He gave candor, sincerity, and passion to the readers, and with a burning pen, powerfully implied the future spring of this Korea." (See "Preface")

It is also this candor, sincerity, and passion that makes us—Chinese readers—feel infinitely kind! Reading it, it feels as if the author's words are our own, and we feel that what the author says is what we want to say.

In the long-silent Shanghai literary world, the publication of such a vibrant literary work that makes Chinese readers feel close is a fortunate achievement worth celebrating. So here, I have written this short essay to express my praise for this meaningful work with a little enthusiasm.

### Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund—Hospital Doctors Start to Sponsor

The "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" initiated by this newspaper has received enthusiastic responses from all parties. "Those with money contribute money, and those with strength contribute strength." It has gained widespread sympathy from people in society, which is precious and touching! Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Song Guobin, former president of the Chinese Medical Association, who generously donated 500 yuan of New Year's entertainment expenses to the medical aid fund, and attached the following simple rules for preferential treatment of elementary school teachers for the diagnosis and treatment of lung diseases: (1) Elementary school teachers must present proof of identity from their school when seeking medical treatment.

The Shanghai Chinese Hospital Department Hospital at 32 Huade Road, Tilanqiao, and the branch hospital at 251 Xinzha Road, have also formulated free outpatient and hospitalization measures. In addition, the Shanghai distribution office of Minsheng Pharmaceutical Factory sent a letter generously donating 1,000 yuan worth of medicines. All of these benevolent and righteous acts are truly inspiring.

### Free Schools Directory

In addition to charging only 15 yuan for books and 10 yuan for miscellaneous expenses, all other expenses are waived.

### Amateur Library

The Chinese Amateur Library on the 7th floor of Pudong Building has a collection of more than 20,000 volumes and more than 2,000 readers. Established three years ago, it has lent more than 150,000 books of various types. Recently, a board of directors was formed, and Zhang Yipeng and Gui Yanfang were elected as chairman and vice-chairman, respectively. Chen Qingshi, Lu Gaoyi, Li Hongshou, and others serve as executive directors, carrying out fundraising, with excellent results. The library's affairs have been greatly refreshed, and there has been an increase in books, newspapers, and magazines. It is now planning to promote a book collection campaign and expand the recruitment of readers. It is said that the procedure for joining the library is very simple. In addition to filling out an application form and paying a deposit of 10 yuan to obtain a reading card, there is only a reading fee of 1 yuan per month. If the family is impoverished and unable to pay the fees, there are still free methods stipulated.
