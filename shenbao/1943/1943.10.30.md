### Editorial: Grasp the Key to Inevitable Victory: Thoughts on Japan's 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session

Japan's 82nd Extraordinary Diet Session concluded successfully on the 19th, having commenced on the 26th. The significance of this session's convocation, during the decisive phase of the world war and as East Asian peoples face total mobilization to strive for final victory, needs no elaboration. Overall, the achievements of this session are truly sufficient to broaden a smooth path for the future liberation of East Asian peoples. We especially feel compelled to inform our countrymen of the following key points:

The first important task accomplished by the 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session was to strengthen Japan's domestic war footing, concentrate total power to ensure victory, and pass crucial laws and budget proposals related to domestic administration guidelines to meet the urgent needs of the current situation and guarantee victory in the coming decisive battle. Regarding the current situation, as Prime Minister Tojo has indicated, the enemy, the United States and Britain, is resorting to any means to attempt a counteroffensive, seeing that the East Asian nations, united under the Empire, are becoming increasingly close-knit, and their abundant resources and combat power are growing ever stronger. The coming battles will only intensify. Japan, and indeed all East Asian nations, should be keenly aware and rouse the total power of each nation to deliver the final blow to the enemy. To this end, Japan is already working to strengthen its domestic war system. Key measures include reforming government offices, implementing administrative streamlining for wartime, and establishing the Ministries of Agriculture, Commerce, Military Procurement, and Transportation & Communications. Simultaneously, efforts are underway to expand national mobilization, suspend general student deferments, broaden the scope of recruitment, unify domestic defense strategies, establish an Air Defense Headquarters, and decide on evacuating urban populations. All measures to strengthen the domestic situation and concentrate total power to face the coming decisive battle are being thoroughly implemented.

We admire the decisive judgment of the Japanese government in this regard. Without hesitation or delay, they swiftly decided to implement various extraordinary measures necessary to strengthen domestic war politics in order to complete the war. As Prime Minister Tojo pointed out, "In this urgent time, the only responsibility that we, the people, should fulfill is to rapidly increase combat power, and swiftly continue to develop the inevitable combat power to destroy the United States and Britain, to meet the demands of the front lines. However, fulfilling responsibility is no easy task. We cannot achieve anything if we think and act as we did before. The entire nation must truly eliminate all inertia, overcome all obstacles, and dedicate all our strength to succeed." On one hand, we recognize the completeness of the Japanese national organization and the loyalty of the people in supporting national policies. On the other hand, we recognize the Japanese authorities' spirit of trusting the people and respecting public opinion. For example, regarding the decision to strengthen the domestic war posture, the Diet was solemnly convened for discussion. Prime Minister Tojo presided over the meeting from beginning to end, candidly explaining the situation, analyzing policies, answering questions, and appealing for the cooperation of the Diet members. Only in this way, only by thoroughly realizing full coordination and cooperation between the government and the people, can we concentrate the total power of the nation to implement all policies and strive for final victory. This is truly worthy of deep consideration and emulation by our country's authorities.

Prime Minister Tojo solemnly stated: "Regarding the revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, it will soon be materialized. I express my heartfelt respect for the spirit of achieving the ideal of a 'China for the Chinese' and advancing for the liberation of the one billion people of Greater East Asia." He also said, "At this time, it is truly regrettable that Yu (Chiang Kai-shek's government) is still engaged in internal strife and cannot participate in China's historical grand plan, nor can it join the common cause of the Greater East Asian nations. However, I deeply sympathize with the people under Yu's rule." We are deeply moved by these words! The fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Treaty, which will soon materialize, is truly the unanimous expectation of our country's government and people, and an important factor in promoting new relations between China and Japan, especially in promoting comprehensive peace in China! The ideal of a "China for the Chinese," as well as the sympathy for the people under Yu's rule, will especially arouse unanimous excitement throughout our country. We firmly believe that the ideal of a "China for the Chinese" and the victory of the Greater East Asia War are an indivisible whole, and we must take on new tasks from here.

During the Japanese Diet session, Prime Minister Tojo detailed Japan's policy of assisting the independence of China, Manchukuo, Thailand, Burma, the Philippines, Malaya, Sumatra, Java, Borneo, Celebes, and even the Indian peoples, and indicated that their welfare would be further enhanced, "so that all nations can each find their place, and all people can live in peace." This is not only Japan's founding ideal but also a prerequisite for building a new world based on righteousness. The Diet ultimately passed the Greater East Asia General Mobilization Act, and the six principles of Greater East Asian ethnic policies were clearly discussed:　Eliminating racial discrimination,　Mutual equality and concession among ethnic groups,　Implementing economic cooperation,　Developing and communicating culture,　Liberating resources,　Jointly defending Greater East Asia. All of these are fundamental conditions for the one billion East Asian peoples to unite as one, jointly destroy the enemy, permanently liberate East Asia, and establish lasting world peace. From here, we can see the epoch-making significance of this Diet session in world ethnic history, and it is not merely the most powerful weapon in a political offensive against the United States and Britain!

From the achievements of Japan's 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session, it is clear that the key to opening the door to final victory in the coming decisive battle is already in the hands of us East Asian peoples! Today, we must strengthen the unity between the government and the people domestically, and promote national unity and peace. Internationally, we must establish new Sino-Japanese relations and promote the total power of one billion East Asian peoples. Only in this way can we forever grasp the key to inevitable victory! However, Prime Minister Tojo is right: "The evolution of the war situation does not allow us even a moment's hesitation." May our countrymen be keenly aware!

### Revision of Sino-Japanese Treaty: Negotiations Proceed Smoothly, Implementation Imminent

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) In his policy speech at the 83rd Extraordinary Diet Session on the 26th, Prime Minister Tojo stated that the fundamental revision of the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty has recently begun to materialize. When Chairman Wang Jingwei visited Japan last time, he sincerely exchanged views with me on completing joint war strategies between China and Japan, and as a result, both sides' opinions have converged. Currently, both China and Japan strongly expect that Prime Minister Tojo's statement can be realized in the near future. Chairman Wang visited Japan in September, and although his stay was only two days, in addition to meeting with His Majesty the Emperor of Japan, he held long talks with Prime Minister Tojo, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and Greater East Asia Minister Aoki before leaving Japan and returning to Nanjing on the 23rd. After safely returning to Nanjing, he issued an important statement. Furthermore, Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani, returned to Japan in mid-September to consult with various parties on important matters. After completing his official duties, he immediately returned to Nanjing to resume his post and is currently engaged in negotiations with the National Government. The negotiations are proceeding extremely smoothly. According to Japan's formal expression of opinion, considering the new situation after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Japan finds it necessary to revise the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty. This was stated by the Japanese government after China's entry into the war on January 9 of this year. In that statement, Japan stated: "To adapt to the future development of Sino-Japanese relations, the established terms should be reconsidered." Prime Minister Tojo also delivered a policy speech at the 82nd Extraordinary Diet Session of Japan on June 16 of this year, in which he stated: "Japan intends to fundamentally revise the treaty between China and Japan to make the cooperative relationship between the two countries closer." Since Prime Minister Tojo's statement, Japan's attitude has become clearer. Recently, the authorities of China and Japan have been conducting various negotiations in accordance with the spirit of the aforementioned statement, and it is expected that it will be implemented soon.

### Manchurian Food Production Increase

Xinjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) In order to increase food production in Manchuria, the country has been establishing wartime agricultural production emergency increase policies since the beginning of this year. In addition to expanding arable land by reclaiming wasteland and establishing self-sufficient farms, it has also been actively promoting increased yields per unit area. So far, it has been able to secure its production increase targets. The market situation at the time of the autumn harvest is better than in previous years, and the purchase targets can be guaranteed without problems. Japan's expected amount from Manchuria is also guaranteed without worry. Regarding next year's production increase countermeasures, the goal is to ensure food self-sufficiency. The main measures include further thoroughly implementing the wartime agricultural production emergency increase policies implemented this year, and planning to actively implement land improvement and reclamation by the Land Development Corporation and other institutions. In addition, a two-year plan is underway to reclaim several hectares of new arable land in the lower reaches of the Second Songhua River and the Dongliao River area, with the aim of increasing rice production, and introducing Japanese settlers and labor service corps. Although this still requires the import of materials and technical personnel from Japan, this has been resolved during the visit of Chief of General Affairs Takebe to Japan. As the Japanese authorities have reiterated their determination to provide strong support for Manchuria's production increase plan, the agricultural development of Manchuria, which has more spare capacity for rapid production increase than mainland Japan, is worth looking forward to, and the joint Japan-Manchukuo food self-sufficiency plan can be achieved sooner.

### Sino-Japanese Authorities Release Statements Regarding the Transfer of Japanese Shares in Central China Salt and Silk Companies to China

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) - To promote the economic development of our nation, our ally Japan has decided to transfer all Japanese-owned shares in the Central China Salt Company and the Central China Silk Company. The Ministry of Finance held a press conference yesterday, the 29th, at 3:00 PM, attended by both Chinese and foreign journalists. Chief Secretary Cha, representing Minister Zhou of the Ministry of Finance, made the following statement: The Central China Salt Company was established in October of the 28th year of the Republic (1939), jointly operated by China and Japan to restore salt production in the Haizhou salt fields. Through diligent management, Central China has not faced a salt shortage in recent years. Now, with the transfer of shares by our ally, the company will be reorganized as the Sino-Chinese Salt Industry Company, a joint official-private enterprise, which will be established soon. It is expected to have a significant impact, not only solving the salt problem in Central China, but also maintaining the same policies regarding industrial salt for our ally. Furthermore, our ally will also transfer its silk industry to China. A new organization is currently under consideration by the relevant authorities and is expected to be established within this year. The Ministry has already established a special tax office for silk industry development in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces, with branches in the Ministry and Guangdong. Xu Jiang has been appointed as the director of the special tax office for the three provinces, and Li Dong as the deputy director and head of the Guangdong branch. Direct collection will increase tax revenue from silk, and the Ministry will do its utmost to revitalize the silk industry.

Government Authorities' Statement Regarding the Central China Salt Company

The statement from our government authorities regarding the Central China salt company is as follows: Since participating in the Greater East Asia War, our nation has received support from our ally in military, political, and economic affairs. Our government is concentrating all its efforts to fulfill this important mission under the wartime system. Our ally has returned concessions and abolished extraterritoriality after our participation in the war, fulfilling the necessary conditions for China's independence and sovereignty. They are now actively cooperating in adjusting the various companies jointly operated by China and Japan after the war, which greatly assists our government's political penetration, economic recovery, and popular support. This is deeply appreciated. Recently, concrete solutions have been reached for the Central China Salt Company and the Central China Silk Company in Central China. Both sides have reached a consensus that Japan will transfer all of its shares in the Central China Salt Company to China, making it a Chinese-owned company. The Central China Silk Company will be dissolved, and its assets will be returned to the investors. The Central China Salt Company was established in August of the 28th year of the Republic (1939). At that time, the Haizhou salt fields had suffered losses due to incidents and disasters, and the fields were almost abandoned. The company provided salt transport machinery, loans to field operators, and subsidies to salt farmers, enabling them to continue production and ensuring that the salt needs of Central China were met. Furthermore, it exported industrial salt to Japan and also operated the Dapuna new salt field and salt factory, contributing to technical improvements for our country. This is truly commendable. With the good intentions of our ally, the Japanese share capital will be transferred to China, and the company will be reorganized as the Sino-Chinese Salt Industry Company, a joint official-private enterprise, named the China Salt Industry Company. Our government will supervise the newly established China Salt Industry Company to continue its original mission and seek greater development. The potash and raw material plants planned by the former Central China Salt Company will continue to be developed by the China Salt Industry Company in cooperation with our ally, forming a new company to manage them. The Dapuna new salt field and fine salt factory will be entrusted to this new company for integrated management, using Japanese technology to improve Chinese salt fields and advance the salt chemical industry.

As for the Central China Silk Company, when the normal Chinese silk industry was declining, the company strived to develop the Chinese silk industry and imported superior silkworm eggs from Japan to improve the original Chinese breeds and increase production, thereby securing Sino-Japanese textile resources. Its contributions are considerable. This time, our ally will dissolve the company and transfer its silk business to China for implementation. Our government will supervise the silk industry to intensify efforts for sound development. However, the production of silk fabrics, short fibers, and refined raw silk is still in the experimental stage in China and still relies on Japanese support. It will be designed and operated in the form of a new enterprise.

After these two companies are adjusted, our government feels the increased responsibility in the future. We will do our best to actively operate, on the one hand, to make our economy tend to recover, and on the other hand, to supply Japan's needs, so that production under the wartime system can be increased daily, in order to live up to our ally's ardent expectations.

Statement by Japanese Authorities

The Japanese Embassy issued the following statement regarding the Central China Salt Industry and Central China Silk Industry: More than three years have passed since the National Government returned to Nanjing. Thanks to the comprehensive support of the general Chinese public and the cooperation of influential industrialists in Shanghai and other fields, its foundation has become increasingly solid. After the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9th of this year and participated in the Greater East Asia War, long-standing issues such as the recovery of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality were resolved in one fell swoop, and the epoch-making act of marching towards Greater East Asia construction by exerting all-out efforts in the joint war began.

Since the implementation of the adjustment of Sino-Japanese joint ventures, key enterprises have gradually been managed by the Chinese government and influential private industrialists. This is truly gratifying for the National Government. The specific plans for the adjustment of the companies are still under discussion by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and related parties. The opinions on the Central China Salt Industry Company and the Central China Silk Industry Company have completely converged. The former has had all its shares completely transferred to China by the Japanese side and will be operated by a Chinese company. The latter will be dissolved, and all assets will be returned to the investors.

Regarding the chemical plant that uses bittern as raw material, which is under construction and planned by the Central China Salt Industry Company, the policy has been determined based on the nature of the project: a new Sino-Japanese joint venture will be established to operate it. The salt fields and refined salt factory owned by the Central China Salt Industry Company will be entrusted to this joint venture so that it can be integrated with the new chemical plant. With Japanese technology, Chinese salt production methods and salt chemical industries can be developed. The Central China Silk Company will be dissolved as a result of this negotiation. The silk business will be entrusted to the Chinese side. However, in terms of new technologies such as silk fabrics, short fibers, and raw silk processing, it is still in the experimental stage. It seems that enterprises in the form of participation in Japanese technology and capital will be operated, and the Chinese silk industry will ensure East Asian materials.

But its mission is extremely important, and it is hoped that redoubled efforts will be made in the future to promote the sound development of the silk industry.

Among them, there are even Japanese born there. This time, more than a thousand people went on strike during the harvest of agricultural products, making it difficult for administrators. They have been working hard to recruit laborers from various places. A spokesman for a certain administrative authority said that although the striking Japanese Americans refused to work, there have been no riots so far. The direct cause of this strike was a military truck accident that killed one Japanese coward and injured several others.

### German Troops in Southern Italy Hold Firm: Intense Battles in the Upper Reaches of the Futo River

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - A statement from the German Supreme Headquarters stated that after the German troops in southern Italy successfully countered the enemy's offensive, they retreated from both banks of the Volturno River to mountainous positions a few kilometers west.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - General Alexander once announced that the anti-Axis forces in Southern Italy had recently learned the true main line of the German army there, and the past battles would certainly be considered only side wars. Military figures here recently commented that this was a clear confession of the anti-Axis army. According to reliable sources, the current German front in Southern Italy is as follows: From west to east, the entire line roughly extends along the northern part of the Campania Plain, continues to cross the middle section of the Apennine Mountains, through the area near Campobasso, and straight down to the Adriatic coast between Termoli and Vasto. Each road in the mountainous area of this war zone is favorable for defense, as they are all fortified with artificial bunkers everywhere. These figures also said that the key point of Isernia may be the target of the anti-Axis attack on the Western Front.

### German Reinforcements Arrive in the Nogais Steppe for a Counteroffensive: Tank Battles Unfold in the Fight for the City of Kerch

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - Transocean News Agency: The Soviet army is continuing its offensive on the eastern Qiannan Road, and the battles are most fierce in the Nogais Steppe. The flat terrain is the most ideal place for tank and mechanized forces to fight. The enemy is transferring reinforcements to join the battle. In Melitopol, the Western army has penetrated into our army's positions and is now attempting a fan-shaped advance. There are currently two vanguard units of the Soviet army in the far south, one targeting Kenigsberg and the other advancing southwest along the Leccop Isthmus, attacking west and northwest, targeting the Lower Dnieper River between Nikopol and Bolsral. However, their concentrated pressure is also encountering strong counterpressure from the German army, as large German reinforcements have also arrived to stop their progress. The enemy launched another offensive between Crimea and the Lower Dnieper River yesterday morning, and fierce battles are still underway. The situation in the Dnieper River remains unchanged. The German positions east of Krivoy Rog and Zappruki were subjected to strong attacks the day before. There were only local battles in the middle reaches of the Dnieper River. The Soviet army's offensive against our positions north of Gomel was unsuccessful. The Soviet army's attempts to break through west of Krichev and east of Orsha were also unsuccessful.

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - A war report from the Supreme Headquarters stated that west of Melitopol, the Soviet army launched an attack to break through the gap, but was repelled. The offensive and defensive battles north of Krivoy Rog have become a tank battle, and fierce battles are currently underway.

### The Future of the War is Still Favorable to Germany: Goebbels Publishes Essay

Berlin, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to the Transocean News Agency, German Propaganda Minister Goebbels published an article in the latest issue of "German Weekly" stating that German generals are still paying attention to the Soviet Union's continuous resources, so the German military's operational plans still focus on the Eastern Front. The military positions that the people wanted to rely on in Western Europe, Northern Europe, Southern Europe, and Southern Europe during the "Second World War" are now still in German hands in the fifth year of this war. Furthermore, during the First World War, the enemy was not under pressure from the Japanese army in East Asia. Now, Japan is also fighting with our country, which weakens the strength of the Allied countries a lot. The domestic situation in Germany in 1942 is also different from that in 1918. There is no opposition force. The whole country is under the guidance of the National Socialist Movement, and the people are united. Therefore, the enemy's so-called German "military and industrial circles have friction" is purely their fantasy. The occasional fatigue after long-term operations may exist, but this can also be seen in the enemy's camp. The special allocations during the Christmas season can prove that Germany's food situation is still extremely stable in the fifth year of this war, the military machine is also extremely complete, the people are also strong, and the strength of defensive warfare is increasing day by day, giving the enemy significant losses. It concludes by saying that the air raids on the enemy will also be retaliated against.

### Additional Postage Surcharge of 100% to be Implemented Starting Next Month, November 1st

Shanghai. The political and business management bureau, in order to collect postage surcharges, issued a notice yesterday stating: "Starting November 1st of this year, a new surcharge of 100% will be added to the basic postage and existing surcharges listed in the fee schedule for all types of mail in the first category (local delivery within the city), second category (domestic inter-bureau mail), fourth category (Japan, Korea, Kwantung Leased Territory, Taiwan, and Hong Kong), and fifth category (Macau and the Shanghai Concession)."

Talk from Postal Authorities

A reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit to the person in charge yesterday, who gave the following statement: "This increase in surcharges is truly a last resort. In recent years, commodity prices have soared, some exceeding pre-incident levels by hundreds of times, while current postage rates have only increased tenfold. This has resulted in severe deficits for postal bureaus across the country, making it impossible to make ends meet. Therefore, we had no choice but to submit a request to the Ministry of Construction, which was then forwarded to the Executive Yuan, to double the current postage rates, which is only twenty times higher than before the incident, to make up for the losses. However, this will undoubtedly increase the burden on the people. We sincerely hope that postal employees will work even harder and be more dedicated, overcoming all difficulties, to achieve the highest standards of service to the public, so as not to fail the government's mandate and the public's expectations."

### City Propaganda Department Convenes Second Regular Press Conference to Discuss Municipal Issues

Central News Agency Report. The City Propaganda Department convened its second regular press conference at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 29th) in the City Government Conference Room. Reporters from various newspapers attended, including Sun Ming from the Chinese Department of Domei News Agency, Cheng Yiping from the Central News Agency, Jiang Lingzhang from the China Daily News, Liu Han'er from Shen Bao, Tang Xiongfeng from Ping Bao, Xu Wei from Xin Zhong Guo Bao, Cao Youzhi from Xin Kai Bao, Liu Xinggong from Guomin Xin Kai Bao, Yamazaki from Dalu Xin Bao, and representatives from various agencies: Secretary Ma Mingfu from the City Government Secretariat, Liu Wenzhen from the Food Bureau, Yu Pingshan from the City Baojia Association (represented by Qi Tianliang), Suo Chen, Director of the Health Bureau, and Fang Qian, Section Chief of the City Propaganda Department, totaling more than twenty people. Director Liang, head of the Propaganda Department, presided over the meeting. Representatives from various agencies answered questions raised by the newspapers. The questions and answers are recorded below:

Clearing Garbage in the Southern City

China Daily News asked: "Garbage piles up in the Southern City, which hinders the appearance and sanitation of the city. How will the Health Bureau address this issue?" The Health Bureau replied: "The Sanitation Office of the Southern City drafted a plan in March of this year to thoroughly reorganize the sanitation of the Southern City and submitted it to the City Government for approval. Subsequently, the City Government decided to first start with clearing the accumulated garbage in the plan, and work began on May 13th. By June 10th, the accumulated garbage in all listed locations had been completely cleared. However, due to excessively low wages for sanitation workers, they have been leaving one after another, resulting in an inability to clear garbage daily and the appearance of accumulated garbage. The completion of sanitation tools is underway. In areas far from the terminal, temporary dumping grounds are set up, transportation is organized, and garbage boats are used to solve the garbage disposal problem. Restricting the time for dumping garbage, setting up public trash cans, and supervising shops to provide their own trash cans are all measures that can be implemented one by one once funding is sufficient."

Prohibiting Smoking and Gambling

China Daily News asked: "The prohibition of opium smoking and gambling has been repeatedly proclaimed, but has not yet been thoroughly implemented. What specific measures does the City Government have in this regard?" Ping Bao asked: "Strictly prohibiting smoking and gambling is an urgent task in the process of actively building a new Shanghai. What measures will the authorities take and when will they be implemented?" The reply was: "The government is well aware of the harm caused by smoking and gambling. In the past, due to the city's financial situation, gambling taxes were levied in the Southern City. Recently, the special tax in Zhabei has been stopped. Efforts are now being made to offset the impact in the Southern City, and the prohibition is scheduled to be implemented by the end of the year. As for opium, it is a special tax levied by the state and is absolutely prohibited, which must wait for the country to be relatively prosperous. However, the sale and smoking of opium by the Central and South Central News Agencies have become an open secret, and strict orders have now been issued to prohibit it."

Resolving the Coal Briquette Panic

Xin Zhongguo Bao raised four questions, which were answered by the City Government Secretariat. "How to resolve the coal briquette panic?" (Answer) "The coal briquette panic is caused by a shortage of supply and coal merchants hoarding goods for speculation. The only way to solve this is to clear the supply channels and suppress prices. The government is paying attention to the investigation and research in cooperation with relevant parties." "The black market for cigarettes is rampant. Has the City Government already taken over the market and implemented price controls?" (Answer) "Cigarettes are also within the scope of price controls. As for cracking down on the black market, the police agencies will be ordered to strictly enforce the law." "Has the merger of the Eighth and Thirteenth District Public Offices been decided, and has the merger date been determined?" (Answer) "The City Government has decided to merge the eight districts, but the date is still under consideration." "How to resolve the edible oil panic?" (Answer) "We are currently studying methods with the relevant parties in the Chamber of Commerce to hopefully increase the supply, and the panic can be reduced."

### Lieutenant Shi Yan Talks About the Pacific War Situation, Crushing Enemy Counterattack Attempts

Central News Agency Report. Lieutenant Shi Yan, representative of the Fleet Press Department, gave a detailed report on the Pacific war situation at yesterday's Army and Navy Joint Press Conference. Lieutenant Shi Yan stated, "In the South Pacific, the enemy's counteroffensive operations are becoming increasingly fierce. We can also foresee that the enemy will attempt to push forward in the Western Pacific. The enemy country is mobilizing its total production capacity to produce aircraft to use in Japan's occupied territories. Once occupied, they will immediately establish air bases there, adopting the so-called 'island hopping' strategy. The most intense enemy counterattacks are aimed at Rabaul in New Britain, attempting to recapture it. Therefore, they are constantly bombing various places in the Southeast Pacific, such as Bogenville and Finschhafen, and sending large formations of aircraft to attack the Gilbert Islands and Makin Island in the central Pacific. In order to hinder Japan's production capacity, they are also fiercely counterattacking areas such as the Celebes and Borneo, which are rich in resources. Their intention is nothing more than to make up for the losses suffered at the beginning of the war, using aircraft and warships manufactured at the highest level of production to suppress the Eastern Pacific, cut off Japan's connection with the south, and eliminate Japan's war power. Therefore, they disregard any sacrifices, concentrating their forces in the Southeast Pacific, and adopting aircraft carrier-based guerrilla warfare in an attempt to sink Japanese ships.

Planned Strategy

In a nutshell, if the enemy does not take advantage of the current opportunity when their production capacity is at its peak, they will never be able to cut off Japan's connection with the South. But in fact, the enemy's production capacity has already reached its peak this year. The Japanese side is crushing the enemy's counterattacks everywhere, achieving brilliant results. Japan had already anticipated that the war would develop to today's stage before the war, and had a predetermined operational plan. If people deeply desire to achieve final victory, they must go through the following stages, and they are already in the plan.

First Phase

The first stage is to ensure the resources needed to maintain the war effort. In order to cope with the two major empires of the world, it is necessary to ensure the resources needed to maintain the war effort. Therefore, the Japanese army made every effort to occupy the South and tried its best to bring the front line closer to India. Therefore, there must be an air raid on Hawaii and an air raid on Midway and the Indian Ocean naval battle. It is also necessary to crush the enemy's production capacity before establishing the sure-win state of the Greater East Asia War. This battle plan has been successful.

Second Phase

The second phase is the current battle situation where the enemy is trying to recover its production. This year, the enemy's production capacity has reached this point, so they are using all their strength to counterattack. However, the Japanese side continues to crush the enemy's war power, and gradually reduces the loss of war power by reducing the value of islands to the point of necessity, and prevents the enemy from consuming warships, manpower and material resources. At the time, the South was used as a warehouse to convert our production power, and the political merits of Greater East Asia were implemented, and the South was actually strengthened. The same is true in terms of manpower. Our extremely capable students will participate in the front line's southern economic war, and we are extremely confident in our participation in the sharp military strength on the front lines. The system for participating in the war by the labor of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity nations is also complete. In short, from the perspective of both human and material resources, in the near future, the enemy's combat power will be extremely effective. How the human and material resources obtained through defensive tactics will appear at that time and what kind of weapons will appear next cannot be told, but it can be predicted that the enemy will be driven out of the Pacific Ocean and the Indian Ocean.

Third Phase

The first and second phases can be carried out in accordance with the predetermined guidelines, so the third phase to achieve final victory can also be realized in accordance with the predetermined plan. The establishment of Greater Asia reflects the great political merits of Greater East Asia for a number of achievements. For example, the independence of Great Britain and the establishment of the Indian Provisional Government are the counterattacks against the British exploitation of Greater East Asia. In this way, while our side crushed the enemy in combat power, it established the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere based on the spirit of justice in politics and economy, and deeply believes that with the power of Greater East Asia, we will be able to achieve final victory.

### Director of the Press Bureau, De Yuyuan, Speaks on the South Pacific War Situation, Japanese Army Bleeding Strategy is Successful

Central News Agency Report. Director of the Press Bureau of the Shanghai Army Department, De Yuyuan, gave a detailed report at the Army and Navy Joint Press Conference yesterday on the Solomon and New Guinea war situations in the South Pacific. The details are as follows:

Victory and Invincibility

Director De Yuyuan first stated: "Since the spring of this year, the Japanese army has not made progress in the four Pacific directions, and the enemy has taken advantage of the opportunity to move. This situation should exist in the current stage of the war. Our side had already anticipated this and fully deployed a strong defensive operation, which was quite fierce. At the beginning of the war, the Japanese army completed its must-win and invincible position, and initially achieved a great victory. On the other hand, the enemy suffered a setback and a major defeat, so they had to engage in a campaign to try to recover the situation and eliminate past losses. Therefore, they launched a counteroffensive. When we reviewed the enemy's counteroffensive situation, our side had a predetermined and adequate plan. As we implemented the plan, such as the fact that the enemy captured a few small islands in the Solomon Islands and a very small part of New Guinea, the enemy used tremendous power to achieve very small results. Therefore, our side had already achieved great results in the war, and established many strategic bases in the South and South Pacific. However, since this month, the battle situation has been less intense. In short, the enemy's counterattack cannot really be described as a counteroffensive."

Bleeding Strategy

Looking back at the past offensives launched by the enemy in the Solomon Islands, New Georgia Islands, and in New Guinea, they were quite small. However, the troops stationed on our side were not strong enough to easily resist the enemy's large forces and engage them in battle. At that time, our troops were small in number, but they displayed great strength. Therefore, the bleeding strategy that our side adopted was able to exert 100% of its effectiveness. Therefore, in order to capture an island, the enemy must first expend enormous air force power, followed by large numbers of troops to fight. Since we adopted this strategy, the enemy has suffered severe wounds, and the result has still been a loss. Judging by the example of enemy aircraft damage, our side was 1, while the enemy was 4. The damage was enormous, as can be seen from this. At the same time, the Japanese army damaged and shot down 5 enemy aircraft, sank 50 ships, and caused more than 14,000 casualties. In short, the enemy's counteroffensive achieved no results and suffered heavy losses. The enemy's consistent goal is to launch a general counteroffensive towards the Japanese mainland, but this is really impossible. While the enemy cannot make progress and is increasing losses, our side is making full use of the resources within Greater East Asia to prepare for a counteroffensive that will deliver a head-on blow to the enemy.

Planned Strategy

Now our side is adopting an offensive posture, conducting defensive warfare, making every effort to secure various parts of Greater East Asia, and striving to reduce our losses, while inflicting great blows and significant wounds on the enemy. This is the bleeding strategy, while preparing for a full-scale counteroffensive in the future, all in accordance with the predetermined war plan. Also, on the previous day, the former US Ambassador to Japan, Grew, issued a warning to the American public once again, stating that the strength of the Japanese navy is unmatched, but it is difficult to predict when it will launch an offensive. Therefore, in terms of strategic planning, it can be seen that the United States is deeply wary of Japan's power. Although the United States is ostensibly strong and optimistic, its heart is filled with apprehension and it is quite afraid of Japan.

### The Greater East Asia Sphere is Firmly United: Talk by Section Chief Hirota

Central News Agency Report. The Japanese side held a joint press conference by the three authorities of the Shanghai Army and Navy yesterday (29th) at the Hui Zhong Hotel, following the usual practice. The Army Department Press Bureau was attended by Director De Yuyuan and Trustee Akahoshi. Fleet Department Press Bureau Director Matsushima returned to Japan on official business and was represented by Lieutenant Shi Yan, as well as reporter Uzaki, Mr. Wang Bingnan, and representatives from the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, including Chief Hirota of the Information Section, Consul Fukuma, and others. Fleet Department Press Bureau representative Lieutenant Shi Yan and Army Department Press Bureau Director De Yuyuan successively gave reports on the Pacific war situation. Chief Hirota then answered questions from the press corps on the unity of spirit within the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere in great detail. The conference ended at 4:30 PM.

Chief Hirota of the Information Section, at the Army and Navy Press Conference yesterday, explained the strengthening of the unity of various countries within the Greater East Asia Sphere in response to questions raised by reporters. Chief Hirota first stated that since Japan declared war on the United States, Japan no longer recognizes the League of Nations organization. Hirota further stated that the countries of East Asia have strengthened their unity within the Greater East Asia Sphere due to national group relationships, which is more powerful than the unity outside the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere. At the same time, the unity of each group within the Sphere has been strengthened, and the hub is extremely strong. He would explain this further. Finally, he stated that he asserted that this kind of unity is more solid than the League of Nations organization.

### Grain Control Committee Takes Over Grain Warehouses in Various Districts, Selecting Cadres to Go and Take Inventory

### Commentary: Yearning for Rain Clouds

In today's wartime state of the national economy, the greatest majority suffers from poverty and hardship! We look forward to the comprehensive implementation of wartime economic policies with the yearning for rain clouds. "The vast majority of the Chinese people," as this newspaper's commentary has said before, "are struggling below the minimum standard of living today. Therefore, while the authorities are promoting wartime economic life among the people and encouraging them to endure pain and hardship, they should use persuasion and encouragement, and at the same time, they should promptly investigate the people's hardships and grievances, and strive to ensure that everyone works hard for the country, the nation, and the liberation of East Asia, and that no one can take advantage of the situation to seize and hoard wealth and obtain windfall profits."

The most difficult things to endure in life are hunger and cold. The people can endure the sacrifices of wartime life, but the minimum level of food and clothing must be taken care of. Therefore, since the implementation of the giant-mouth rice system, our greatest desire has been to obtain a reasonably satisfactory solution to the problem of food for the people. Since the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth has been restricted, our greatest desire has been for the early announcement and implementation of a rational yarn and cloth allocation plan. Now, thanks to the cooperation of the Shanghai Grain Distribution Adjustment Association and the Rice Control Association, the amount of rice distributed per capita per month can be gradually increased to more than six liters in the short term. From then on, the food of the people of Shanghai can be worry-free, and the black market price of rice will plummet sharply. Due to the cooperation of the Materials Control Review Committee and the Chamber of Commerce, the method of allocating yarn and cloth for civilian use will be announced and implemented after it is amended and passed today. The above two pieces of news, one concerning the follow-up of the people's clothing problem and the other concerning the solution to the people's food problem, are sufficient to comfort our longing. However, after allocating cotton yarn and cloth and increasing household rice, we must pay attention to planning for the future, so that the supply of rice and cloth to solve the people's hunger and cold can be lasting. Therefore, it is best to have a five-year production plan for rice and cotton yarn and cloth in the coming year.

### Silver and Money Industry Prepared: Safe Passage Through the End-of-the-Month Period; New Credit Loans Granted Discretionally

The end-of-the-month period for Shanghai industry and commerce has arrived. Various firms and businesses have notified those with long-term credit loans due to repay them to maintain credibility. However, established customers with a good credit history and legitimate uses for the funds will be accommodated. They must:

Repay Previous Interest Due

A new loan agreement will be drawn up with the interest rate increased appropriately based on market conditions. As for new credit loans, they will be granted selectively under a tightening principle. However, examination will be particularly thorough to prevent use of firm and business funds for speculation and hoarding. Extending old loans and processing new loans must be completed before the end of the month. Therefore, various firms and businesses have been very busy these days due to the end-of-the-month period. The receipt and disbursement of cash and the exchange of bills have increased sharply. However, the entire financial market remains stable due to the effective regulation by the Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Bank Preparatory Committee's money industry reserve.

Financial conditions are even looser than before. As for the settlement of interest among Shanghai money houses, it will be settled according to the internal market rate of 7.5 yuan per tael set by the association. Therefore, there is no problem with various industries safely passing through the end-of-the-month.

### Tobacco and Drug Control: New Organization to be Established

Regarding tobacco and drug control matters, a new organization will be established through the cooperation of Chinese and Japanese tobacco merchants with a capital of 10,000 yuan. This new organization will be responsible for conducting controlled purchasing and distribution. Under this new organization, the Japanese side will participate through the China Branch Company, while the Chinese side will participate in the control organization through a joint association of various cigarette factories. It is reported that this plan may be submitted for review at today's material control review meeting in Nanjing.

### Central China Salt Industry Company to be Reorganized

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency dispatch) - The Central China Salt Industry Company was established on January 21st of the 22nd year of the Republic (1933). At that time, due to the dispersal of salt farmers everywhere and the near abandonment of salt fields, the company, with its salt transportation organization, temporarily provided loans to salt field merchants and subsidies to salt farmers to enable them to restore their former conditions, engage in production, ensure that the supply of edible salt in the Central China area was not deficient, and export poultry salt to Japan. In addition, it operated the Dapu New Salt Field and refined salt, making considerable contributions to improving salt industry technology in our country. After the transfer of shares from friendly countries to the National Government, the company will be reorganized into a joint state-private-run salt industry company, named the China Salt Industry Company, to continue its past mission and make further progress.

### Starving India

— Niwa Go

Before arriving in India, I never thought that the people lived such a tragic life. It probably wasn't like this before. How could a country with such excellent philosophy, literature, architecture, science, and religion have reached the point it is now? It is extremely strange. The northern Indian land of Hindustan is vast and the population is large, but the people cannot be said to be well-off. They live in narrow earthen houses, and it is considered good if they have a piece of coarse cloth. The whole family is seven or eight together, living an unnatural life stuck to the mud. On clear days, sand covers everything. On rainy days, the water flows into small rivers, making it impossible to distinguish roads. It doesn't look like a tribal village where people live. There are no electrical facilities, of course. They take horses to warm themselves and light lamps with seed oil.

Farmers are destitute

Because of poverty, methods such as fertilization are never considered. Farming methods are also not studied, and the yield per acre is lower than anywhere else. On this land under the scorching sun, the convenience of water conservancy is never considered. Irrigation is only fifteen or sixteen. The government does not pay attention to these things and only knows how to squeeze them. So why should India be regarded as a treasure trove of Britain and guarded, lest it be lost? That is because weaving, mouth-to-mouth, and rice and hemp are absolutely huge and small. There are 450,000 to 600,000 available for export every year. But every civilian is so poor that these things are never added. As long as it can be increased, that's fine. How did a previously excellent nation reach this point? Simply put, it is the defect of the social structure and the class system. In the monk class, there are Brahmins, in the warrior class, there are Kshatriyas, in the merchant class, there are Vaishyas, and in the slave class, there are Shudras. These four classes are strictly and clearly divided, and the phenomenon of not being aggressive from generation to generation is completely blocked. In terms of religious killing, there is the so-called decay, which refers to the decline of India today. This is also true, but the reason for the killing is greater than this. I would like to assert that it is British imperialism. It is a very terrible organization.

Tax Contracting System This term was only known after coming to India. That is the tax contracting system. That system was started by Clive after winning the famous Battle of Plassey. He defeated the French and the local lords, seized hegemony, and used his power to start this system. Its meaning is to contract the taxes of a certain piece of land to a certain person. The contractor only pays a certain tax and can freely dispose of the land. He can also divide it into small pieces and divide it among others. The rent can be further subdivided to others. Therefore, its price increases layer by layer, and the rent paid by the people is also increased layer by layer in proportion, even through the hands of fifty people. From the point of view of collecting personal taxes, no organizational method is so harsh that it cannot ensure so many sources of wealth. Although this is the powerful property of the East India Company, today it is the source of wealth for Britain. The crops that the farmers work so hard to cultivate cannot be obtained in their own homes and are all stripped away. Although the people of India grow crops, what they grow is not their own. Borrowing money is becoming more and more important. They are born in borrowing, live in borrowing, and pass on the debt to their children and grandchildren until they die. The poorest farmers are in northern India, where the Ganges is most abundant. The reality is crueler than imagined. It is better to say that he is alive than to say that he is on the day before death.

Supply Site for Military Supplies

The empire of England, the people of its land are on the starvation line. Usually, on October 25th, 140, Alexander Jess came to New Delhi to guide the convocation of the Eastern Needs and gathered representatives from the British mainland and other colonial governments to discuss the self-sufficiency of the British territories east of the Suez Canal. It was then decided that wheat should be supplied from India. The Eastern Needs Council was permanently established in New Delhi. India has become a supply base for military supplies. As a result, ships to various colonies are full and sent out in extremely large numbers to Africa, to Asia, and to the army. Therefore, the shortage of materials in India is very serious. Due to the Japanese attack, Burma suddenly became independent. The 500,000 tons of rice that entered from Burma every year was also cut off, and the food shortage was extremely severe. In addition, under the pressure of the Japanese, coastal routes in India were constantly threatened, and land routes were extremely unfree, so objects were biased and the land could not be announced.

The Bengal Uprising

Recently, there have been rumors that the province of Bengal has experienced uprisings due to food shortages. Ninety-three percent of Indians are illiterate and poor. The uprising is probably a bloody struggle before starvation! The average mortality rate in India is 23-24 for men and 24-5 for women. The infant mortality rate is the highest in the world. British gentlemanliness is showing its true face here. No matter how much famine Indians suffer, they are unmoved. Britain is also trying its best to suppress them. They think it can be solved with guns. However, the surging independence movement is sweeping the country. Now is the time for the Indians themselves to wake up. They are seeking the power to advance. That is for the future of mankind. (Xiang: Translated from "Asahi Weekly" October 31st issue)

National Forum

### The Basis for Solving Personnel Problems

— Yang Su

In an editorial in the Shen Bao on the 6th of this month, "On Concurrent Warfare," attention was repeatedly paid to personnel issues, and the words were earnest. It can be said that it is a sharp and insightful comment on the current political situation. However, when solving personnel problems, there is a prerequisite that must be considered first.

The most important and most basic issue is naturally the treatment issue. There is no need to dwell on the theory of the issue. What we want to observe is the facts. The current salary schedule for civil servants is based on the standard of the 26th year of the Republic of China (1937), with a maximum increase of three times. For example, a section chief has a base salary of 3680 yuan, which amounts to about 1150 yuan after the increase, averaging less than 40 yuan per day. Currently, a meal costs at least 20 yuan, which is not enough to cover the cost of one person's meals, let alone other expenses, let alone the support of the family. The position of section chief cannot be considered low. The section members below are even more out of the question. Even those with positions higher than section chief, such as councillors and directors, are in the same boat, worrying about poverty and sighing about hardship.

Because the treatment is not enough to maintain the minimum standard of living, the following phenomena occur among today's civil servants: First is to "go elsewhere when the land is insufficient," which is a natural trend. The Shen Bao editorial bitterly criticizes the abuse of moonlighting, but now civil servants have to do it. Senior officials go to moonlight themselves and also have to find ways to get their subordinates to moonlight. Junior officials also scramble to find ways to moonlight. The more they moonlight, the more ways they have. Therefore, civil servants who hold five positions at the same time are probably not uncommon today. Putting aside the efficiency of the career, it is always the most important thing for the government to do its best to make a few hard-earned money. We should start by improving the treatment. The second is to slip away. Since the income of civil servants is not enough to maintain a living, they naturally cannot be satisfied with their positions and seek to leave every day. When there is an opportunity, they develop externally, forming a phenomenon of civil servants escaping. For example, taking the rice control association mentioned in the Shen Bao editorial, to take the rice control association, some of the association's staff members that I know are indeed old members of the chamber of commerce, but the reason for the change is not a matter of interest, but a matter of treatment. For example, working in the chamber of commerce earns about 600 yuan per month, while an assistant in the rice control association can earn more than 1000 yuan. The treatment of the Rice Control Association cannot be considered high. If the cost of living is a hundred times higher than before the war, it is only equivalent to 20 yuan, but the salary of the chamber of commerce is indeed too low. Since the holders of the Rice Control Association and the Chamber of Commerce are the same people, it is only natural that long-suffering companions be newly missing. This is only an individual case. It is impossible to enumerate the rest who give up B for A and give up public service for other industries. The phenomenon of slipping away has become the way out for civil servants. The third is mediocrity. Those with supernatural powers and methods are either moonlighting or slipping away. Those who come down are mostly mediocre, incompetent, and at the end of their ropes. It is not intentional to despise civil servants, but the actual situation is indeed like this. In fact, society has despised civil servants for more than a day. Carpenters and masons want 70-80 yuan a day, while civil servants only need 30-40 yuan. The fourth is to meet. Because the income from the regular salary is not enough, they can only find ways to make extra money. Those who have experienced it do not think it is wrong, but the bystanders often turn their blessings and officials often become corrupt, and the breakdown of discipline is even more unspeakable. This situation, although not common, is not uncommon. The government has increased the treatment of civil servants several times, and this spring it also announced measures for material salaries. It cannot be said that they are not concerned, but the number of increases has fallen far behind the rise in prices, and the material salaries have finally been blocked a lot. Today, only Nanjing agencies distribute six dou of rough rice to each person at an official price of 450 yuan per stone, which is better than nothing. Today, the government's political difficulties are also real. If we do not sing high-profile, then reducing bureaucratic agencies, eliminating redundant personnel, and realizing administrative simplification to increase the treatment of current civil servants may be the most appropriate method.

The treatment problem is the basis of personnel problems. If a reasonable treatment standard cannot be set, then any strict implementation of integrity and political harmony, the request for administrative efficiency, the recruitment of outstanding talents, and the realization of personnel management will all be out of the question. This point is worth paying attention to and continuing to serve the poor and sick as usual.

Each book of fifty coupons costs five yuan and can be sent to the association's office at No. A, 70 Lane, West End of New World, Ansi Road.

The Poor Need Help. My relative, Qi Shi, is originally from Guangdong and is 67 years old this year. She lost her husband and daughter in middle age. Later, she lost her job and went to Vietnam with his wife. In the beginning, she still sent remittances to Shanghai, but after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the voice was cut off. Zheng Shi became ill from remembering her daughter and was suffering from poverty and illness. After medical treatment, her illness has gradually recovered, but she has lost everything in half a year of illness. She is in a desperate situation and has no relatives to turn to. Moreover, the days are long, and rice is expensive. She often thinks that the environment is like this, and she often has suicidal thoughts. I, Jiang Youxin, have a limited amount of cotton. If I can give a little help, I can save Zheng Shi from the depths of the fire and prolong her life. One day, mother and daughter will be reunited and enjoy the joy of family life. The merit is immeasurable.
