### Welcoming Our Friendly Nation's "China Economic Investigation Group"

The "China Economic Investigation Group," organized by the Japanese East Asia Economic Roundtable Association, arrived in Shanghai yesterday. The mission of the group was previously explained by the group leader, Mr. Ogura, and others in Tokyo on the 3rd of this month. Its main purpose is to "engage in concrete discussions with Chinese financial giants and the National Government regarding economic cooperation between the two countries, fully accept the opinions of Chinese personnel, and not only take collective action but also conduct private, in-depth talks to gather opinions. Sufficient research should be conducted on Chinese economic issues, such as prices, finance, trade, and food, to benefit the co-existence and co-prosperity of the industries and economies of both countries." We believe that the group's ability to engage in private discussions in addition to collective action, exchange opinions, and fully accept the opinions of Chinese personnel is a characteristic of the group's investigation mission, and it can also be said that this is where the group can adapt to the times. At the same time, we can predict that the group's future success will surely be due to these characteristics. We, in the position of the Chinese people, are willing to take the lead in providing a few points of advice to contribute to the members of the group, so that they may have an outline of understanding of China's current economic problems.

(1) The Price Problem: In recent years, the most painful thing for the Chinese people has been the high prices and the heavy pressure on life. There are many factors that contribute to high prices. Some points are unavoidable in the wartime phenomenon, such as the reduction of supplies, which is common to all countries. However, some points are unique to China, such as large-scale hoarding; some points are more serious in China than in other countries, such as the decrease in currency purchasing power and poor transportation. The speed of rising prices must be considered a miracle by friendly nations. The Chinese people also understand that a hard life during wartime is within their duty, and that rising prices are a necessary phenomenon, but it is unbearable when it exceeds hardship and becomes pain, and when it not only rises but soars. This is one.

(2) The Food Problem: Food is the people's food, and the people's food is the most important part of the people's livelihood. Frankly speaking, the largest number of Chinese people, the farmers, generally believe that life is for "food," and their entire lives are entrusted to "food." Therefore, it is useless to talk about stabilizing the people's livelihood without solving the food problem. Chinese farmers have always valued reality and are most unaccustomed to hearing empty words, especially when people talk about "heaven" but do "earth." This is what the Chinese people find the most discredited and unpleasant. The food problem is even more so. This is two.

(3) The Problem of Increasing Production: Increasing production means increasing supplies. Abundant supplies can strengthen the overall war effort externally and quickly complete the Greater East Asia War; internally, it can stabilize prices and reduce the pressure on people's lives. The National Government has clearly stipulated this in the wartime economic policy program. We believe that the implementation has not been done with all our strength. Taking the industry in the Shanghai area as an example, not only has there been no increase in production, but there has also been a decrease in production. The reasons for this include power restrictions, lack of raw materials, and transportation difficulties. We hope that the policy decisions and the implementation of the facts are completely consistent. On the one hand, we are vigorously increasing production, but on the other hand, we are not actively eliminating the causes that hinder production. Even unintentionally creating causes that hinder production, all of these should be paid attention to and corrected. This is three.

(4) The Problem of Material Exchange: Material exchanges between the peaceful areas of Central China, North China, and South China, each with what they have in excess to exchange for what they lack, are very important to the price problem and the people's livelihood problem. In the implementation of exchanges, the most urgent issue is the limitation of transportation. We believe that the importance of material exchange is no less than other economic issues, and it is worth paying attention to and trying to smooth it out as much as possible. This is four.

(5) The Currency Problem: Currency is closely related to all economic activities and the daily life of the people, and its importance needs no explanation. At present, the Central Reserve Bank is the only currency in Central China and South China. Its foundation is stable and its reserves are abundant, as the government authorities have repeatedly stated. However, the continuous decline in purchasing power is a matter that must be addressed, both in terms of national financial resources and people's faith. This is five.

Finally, we sincerely look forward to intensifying and strengthening Sino-Japanese economic cooperation under the principle of equality and mutual benefit. To be honest, according to the current factual environment, it is impossible to achieve satisfactory results in adjusting China's economic problems without the full assistance of Japan. In other words, China itself should do its best to revitalize all economic issues, and at the same time, friendly nations must actively and thoroughly help. For example, in March of this year, our friendly nation returned the economic control rights of Central China to China, which gave the Chinese people a good impression. Although we have not done as well as expected, this is a personnel issue, and we will of course try to adjust it. At the same time, we hope that the authorities of friendly nations will further encourage and correct us enthusiastically so that we can succeed. We absolutely accept the enthusiastic support and instructions of friendly nations, and at the same time, we also expect friendly nations to listen to the opinions and suggestions of most of our people. Only in this way can we achieve true cooperation. At the same time, friendly nations must take the improvement of China's economic problems as the most important object of Sino-Japanese cooperation; otherwise, it will be a burden in the process of cooperation.

What we have said above is our report on our own condition. Of course, it is intuitive, but it is sincere. We ask the brilliant doctor to consider the condition we have described, then add to it by examining each part, and then use his superb knowledge and rich experience to give an accurate diagnosis and the right medicine, so that the patient can take it and of course recover. Who is this brilliant doctor? It is the "China Economic Investigation Group" of our friendly nation, Japan, which has already come to China. We are very fortunate to have this brilliant doctor come to visit us during our illness, and we believe that our illness will surely be cured because of this. In this mood, we sincerely welcome the members of the friendly nation's investigation group and wish them a smooth future and good health!

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 7th that: (1) In the Solomon Islands area, after the enemy forces landed on Rentoba Island on the 30th of last month, they are now trying to advance on New Georgia Island, and have landed at several locations on the island. Japanese troops are currently continuing to fight the enemy in various parts of the island. (2) The situation in the Kula Gulf area of northwestern New Georgia Island is as follows: The Japanese naval garrison on the island and the Japanese mine warfare squadron fighting in the area sank three enemy ships at dawn on the 5th. The type of ships is unknown. (2) On the morning of the 5th, the Japanese air force engaged in combat with enemy aircraft over Kula Gulf and shot down ten enemy planes. (3) Several destroyers belonging to the Japanese mine warfare squadron attacked the enemy at midnight on the 5th. A strong fleet composed of more than ten enemy cruisers and destroyers was attacked, sinking one enemy cruiser, destroying and burning another, and causing the rest to flee in disarray.

Argentina, Jingcheng, 7th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from New Jinshan, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Military Headquarters announced yesterday that Japanese air squadrons bombed Rentoba Island again on the 5th, and US fighter planes engaged in aerial combat with the excellent Japanese air force.

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency): According to news from Washington, the United States Navy Department issued a public statement yesterday announcing that the American destroyer "Strong" has been lost in the southwestern Pacific. It is said that the ship was sunk by a Japanese submarine with a torpedo on the evening of July 4 in the Solomon Islands waters. At the same time, the public statement also admitted that the American fleet suffered slight damage during a battle in the Solomon Sea yesterday.

The Situation on Rentoba Island

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Since June 30, the enemy forces have launched a very tenacious and fierce counter-offensive in the Solomon Islands area. The Japanese army units in various areas have also dispatched air, sea, and land forces to bravely counterattack. The two sides are currently engaged in combat day and night in the vicinity of New Georgia Island and the surrounding islands, which are close to the enemy's base on Guadalcanal. The battle situation is recorded as follows: First, at dawn on June 30, the enemy forces, divided into ten (sea trucks) and landing boats, and protected by a fleet of dozens of military transport ships, escorted by a large number of protective aircraft and ships, landed at several locations around Rentoba Port on the north coast of Rentoba Island, near the southwest coast of New Georgia Island. Fierce fighting immediately broke out with the Japanese army. On the same day, the enemy forces landed at several locations on the southeast and northwest coasts of New Georgia Island. Until dawn on the 5th, the Chetsu Army again attempted to land with a large number of boats at several key points on the island facing Kura Qian. However, the Japanese mine warfare squadron had anticipated this, so it immediately attacked the enemy escort fleet. Under the waning moon, it directly approached the dark enemy ships and launched the traditional Japanese naval night attack, sinking three enemy ships in an instant. At that time, the Japanese field artillery positions also fiercely bombarded, responding to the friendly ships, controlling the enemy fleet, and recording great achievements. The fierce fighting on land also continued. The Japanese land and naval garrison fought fiercely with the enemy landing forces in several locations, and finally repelled a part of the enemy forces. After this fierce battle, the sky had cleared, and the Japanese warships again fired artillery at the enemy landing forces. At this time, the Crystal Army air force also flew to the top of the Junla Qian, where the enemy was patrolling, and immediately engaged in a large air battle with 40 enemy aircraft. The fierce battle was very fierce, and ten enemy aircraft were hit by bullets and emitted black smoke, forming an arc in the air, and then crashed into the sea or forest one after another, turning into a ball of fire. Until after sunset, the fierce fighting on land did not stop. That night, the enemy forces again attempted to land reinforcements, and a fleet of more than a dozen enemy ships, including cruisers and destroyers, appeared in the sea area near Kangla, thus becoming the good bait for the Japanese mine warfare squadron. Several Japanese destroyers immediately carried out operations, forcing to the closest distance to the enemy camp, and fiercely bombarded the enemy ships with torpedoes and secondary guns. When an enemy cruiser seemed to explode suddenly after a red line of fire gushed out, and an enemy cruiser was also hit by bullets and caught fire. The land battle is still continuing.

War Results of Japanese Troops on Both Islands

### Overview of Japanese Military Operations in China in One Year

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Six years have passed in an instant since the Lugouqiao Incident. On the occasion of the 6th anniversary, the Japanese Imperial Headquarters specially announced on the 6th the comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army in China in the past year since last July. It is estimated that about 457,800 corpses of the Yu army were abandoned, about 149,000 were captured, and about 96,000 surrendered. In the most recent period, the number of Yu army captured and surrendered on each front was far greater than the number of dead. As a ratio, if the number of corpses is set to 100, then the number of prisoners in the previous year was 45, and it increased to 67 in the past year. By this year, the number of Yu army captured and surrendered has exceeded the number of abandoned corpses, with a ratio of 100 to 138. In addition, Yu Fang's generals and cadres have recently come one after another to participate in the peace movement. The most notable among them is General Yan Bingdong, commander of the 24th Army Group, the only direct line unit of Yu Jiang in North China, who recently led 70,000 troops to participate in the peace movement, which proves that the Yu army's awareness of resistance has become increasingly low. After the National Government participated in the war, the Japanese government adopted a new policy toward China, and the Yu Fang's significance in the war was completely lost. At the same time, Japan's true intention to seek the development of the Chinese nation has gradually and deeply penetrated into the Yu Fang's interior. The significance and war results of the Japanese army's various battles with China in the past year are divided into the following: (1) Zhe-Gan Operation (from mid-May to mid-September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the third war zone of Yu in Central China) The Japanese army launched this operation in order to destroy the only stronghold in southeastern mainland China that the United Kingdom and the United States relied on to form a second war. Its scale was slightly smaller than the Wuhan raid. After the collapse of Yu (third war zone), its counter-offensive attempt was also completely crushed. The war results are estimated to be about 42,000 Yu army abandoned corpses and about 11,000 captured. (2) Conghua Operation (from the end of May to the beginning of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the seventh war zone of Yu in South China) In order to respond to the Zhe-Gan Operation in Central China, this operation was launched against Yu (seventh war zone). Because the Japanese army made the first move, it inflicted heavy damage on the Yu army. (3) Second Northern Hebei Suppression Operation (from the beginning of July to the middle of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in the Northern Hebei region of North China) The Japanese army started this operation in cooperation with the Manchurian army in order to completely suppress the communist bandits entrenched in the mountainous areas of Northern Hebei. As a result, it dealt a great blow to the Yu army. (4) Southern Taihang Mountain Operation (from mid-June to the end of July of the 31st year of the Republic of China in North China) This was the third phase of the operation continuing the Jin-Ji provincial border operation, targeting a part of the Yu (21st Army) and (24th Army) Army Group, and launching this operation in the steep Taihang Mountains. As a result, the Yu army was completely destroyed. (5) Second Central Shandong Operation (from mid-August to the beginning of September of the 31st year of the Republic of China in Shandong Province, North China) Since the beginning of August, a mutiny occurred in the army of Shandong Gan Xuezhong. The Japanese army launched this operation to annihilate it. Due to skillful tactics, it achieved remarkable war results. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 3,000 corpses and 1,000 people were captured. (6) Eastern Shouhu Western Region Suppression Operation (from late September to early October of the 31st year of the Republic of China in North China) In order to completely annihilate the remnants of the communist army near the old Huang Ze of Xi, the Japanese army formed a tight encirclement and gradually compressed it, giving it a major blow. The communist army abandoned 1,300 corpses and 1,300 people were captured. (7) Autumn Suppression Operation (from late October to late November of the 31st year of the Republic of China in Shanxi Province, North China) This operation was launched to destroy the communist army entrenched in the southern part of the Taihang Mountains. The war results were further expanded to the entire territory of Shanxi Province, and a thorough suppression war was carried out. (8) Su-Huai Operation (from mid-February to mid-March of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Jiangsu Province, Central China) Under the cooperation of the National Government army, Yu (89th Army) and the communist army (New Fourth Army) entrenched in the Su-Huai area of Jiangsu Province had their base destroyed, blocking Yu Fang's activities within the Japanese-occupied area. The total number of corpses abandoned by the Yu-Communist army was 1,800, and 7,000 people were captured. (9) Jiangbei Annihilation Operation (from early February to the end of March of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Hubei Province, Central China) In the northern area of Dongting Lake, Yu (Jiangbei Advance Army) and (118th Division) and Wang Jincai's army were surrounded and suppressed and annihilated. The public security in the area has been restored. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 8,600 corpses and about 23,200 people were captured. (10) Taihang Spring Operation (from mid-April to the end of May of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in Shanxi and Henan provinces, North China) A fierce attack was launched on the Yu 24th Army Group entrenched in the border area between Shanxi and Henan provinces and the communist army which was acting in the border area between Shanxi, Chahar and Hebei provinces, completely suppressing the Yu-Communist forces in the Ji-Cha war zone. Pang Bingxun, commander of the 24th Army Group of Yu, and Sun Yinying, commander of the newly formed Fifth Army, etc. participated in the peace movement, giving a major blow to Yu Fang. The Yu army abandoned 11,500 corpses, and 75,000 people were captured and surrendered. (11) Jiangnan Offensive Operation (from the beginning of May to the middle of June of the 32nd year of the Republic of China in the northern part of Dongting Lake in Central China and the area opposite Yichang) A surprise attack was launched on the Yu (29th and 10th Army Groups) acting in the Dongting Lake northern shore area, the Yu Fang's granary area. Yu's key points were continuously seized, and finally Hunan's granary was occupied and placed under the rule of the National Government. In this battle, the Yu army abandoned 45,700 corpses, and 6,400 people were captured. The Chinese Japanese Expeditionary Force fought 11 times during this period, among which, in the Su-Huai Operation, the number of Yu army captured was nearly three times the number of frozen corpses. In the Jiangbei Annihilation Operation, it was nearly two and a half times, and in the Taihang Mountain Spring Operation, it was nearly six and a half times. This proves that Yu Fang's resistance has been significantly reduced.

### Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Cai Peizhen, Broadcasts to the Country, Introducing Japan Under the Wartime System

Tokyo, 7th (Central News Agency): Chinese Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Cai Peizhen, gave a broadcast to his compatriots in China at 3:00 PM on the 6th at the Central Broadcasting Station here, introducing Japan under the wartime system. He listed four points: the rationalization of Japanese people's lives during wartime, the recognition of the national position, the efforts to increase production, and the training situation of Japanese teenagers. Finally, he pointed out the determination of China and Japan to fight the enemy together and kill the enemy.

### Overseas Chinese in Thailand Explain Their Determination to Cooperate with Japan

Bangkok, 7th (Central News Agency): The Bangkok Chinese General Chamber of Commerce and various overseas Chinese organizations in Thailand stated that six years have passed since the outbreak of the July 7 Incident. They specially issued a letter to their compatriots on the 7th, expressing their determination to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War. The main points are as follows: Looking back since 1937, Chiang Kai-shek, manipulated by the United Kingdom and the United States, combined with the Communist Party, causing the 400 million Chinese people to suffer misery, which has lasted for six years. Now, because friendly Japan has swept away the British and American forces in East Asia, Yu Fang has also been forced to retreat to Chongqing and is declining. Fortunately, China is working hard to promote construction under the leadership of Chairman Wang, and the National Government's declaration of war on the United Kingdom and the United States has given the Yu Fang generals and soldiers great stimulation, and they have successively supported the National Government. In addition, regarding the restoration of Chinese sovereignty, it has been confirmed in the Sino-Japanese Treaty. On January 9 of this year, when the National Government participated in the war, Japan decided to return all special concessions in China, abolish extraterritorial rights, and other privileges, and will immediately implement them. For the future prosperity of the East Asian nation, we must further strengthen our strength and move toward the ultimate goal of defeating the United Kingdom and the United States. We, the overseas Chinese in Thailand, will make our greatest efforts to achieve victory and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Overseas Chinese in the Philippines Issue a Circular Telegram

Manila, 7th (Central News Agency): The Philippine Overseas Chinese Association issued a circular telegram to Yu Fang on the 7th, the sixth anniversary of the Sino-Japanese Incident, urging it to reflect, based on the general will of all overseas Chinese in the Philippines. The main points of the telegram are as follows: Six years have passed since the outbreak of the Lugouqiao Incident. During this period, Yu Fang always hoped for British and American assistance to resist Japan. However, in fact, the so-called British and American assistance has been decreasing, and the hardship of the anti-Japanese war zone has been increasing, only making innocent people suffer sacrifice, which does not help the country and the nation. Now that Japan has implemented a new policy toward China, the unequal treaties that have bound China for more than a hundred years have been cancelled one after another, and the concessions of various countries in China have been successively taken back. All these facts prove that Japan and China have sincerely cooperated, closely cooperated, and cooperated to liberate the East Asian nation and build the East Asian Co-Prosperity Sphere. From this point of view, Yu Fang has lost its significance in the anti-Japanese war, and the elimination of the anti-Japanese war goal is even more self-evident. We, the 100,000 overseas Chinese in the Philippines, deeply hope that our compatriots in the anti-Japanese war zone will quickly stop this meaningless anti-Japanese war and rise up to participate in the work of building a new East Asia, because only the early realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is our supreme mission.

### Ministry of Food Urges Public to Save Rice and Use More Coarse Grains to Replenish Grain Reserves and Adapt to Wartime System

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - In view of the fact that the grain output of our country has been insufficient in the past, the Ministry of Food believes that the population in the peaceful regions has increased sharply recently, and the consumption of rice has increased even more. The reason is that most Chinese people are accustomed to the habit of southerners eating rice, so that other agricultural products such as wheat, sorghum, corn, and sweet potatoes, although a large amount are produced every year in various places, are mostly used as staple foods by some civilians, and most of them are used as non-staple foods, which are mostly consumed and are not suitable for the wartime principle of frugality. Now that the Greater East Asia War is underway, our government is cooperating in ensuring the stability of the people's food and the security of military needs. It is necessary to have sufficient food and long-term reserves to be effective. The storage of food is most durable with rice, which is suitable for storage, so saving rice is the most urgent task. Using coarse grains as the main food can save rice. Reducing the consumption of rice means more grain reserves for the country. It is hoped that the entire nation will change its concept and use coarse grains as substitute food in the future. Saving rice consumption, this proposal has been sent by the Ministry to the provincial and municipal governments and the National Commercial Control Association to quickly announce to the public and earnestly persuade them. Recently, the prices of coarse grains in various places have exceeded the price of rice. Please also find a way to limit it, and still maintain the ratio of one to one point seven with the price of rice, in order to encourage it.

### German Offensive Advances in Belgorod Area

Stockholm, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, the Soviet Supreme Command stated that the German army launched an offensive and admitted that the German army had made some progress in some areas of Belgorod. However, Berlin military personnel said last night that the Axis powers claimed that the German army had launched an offensive in Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod. The claim that the goal of the German army's offensive was to occupy Moscow was also a propaganda tactic, which could be used to claim its failure if the German army did not implement this plan. As for the British claim that the German army lost hundreds of tanks, it is absolutely a rumor. According to the military interviewer of Haitong News Agency, the current battle of Kursk is due to the fact that the Soviet army feels that its protruding front is unfavorable and will inevitably cause a German attack sooner or later, so it wants to strike first. The commander of the Soviet army on the central front seemed to misunderstand the intentions of the German army's local attacks last weekend, believing that it was a large-scale German offensive against Kursk, and that the only way to prevent the Kursk salient from being cut off was to take the initiative. As a result of this misunderstanding, the war was launched from the first day of the week, centered on the south of Belgorod and Orel. This situation is the same as in May of last year, when the Soviet army attacked. At that time, Marshal Timoshenko wanted to take the lead in the German offensive on the southern front, so he launched a large-scale offensive with the assault troops transferred from the Izyum area in the spring, and at the same time launched an offensive north of Kharkov to support it. The purpose was to encircle the German army in Kharkov and break through the line of the Dnieper River. The limited gains made by Ding氏 at a heavy price soon proved to be the beginning of his greatest strategic failure. The German army strictly surrounded its vanguard, causing the entire Soviet Southern Front assault force to be wiped out. Since May of this year, German reconnaissance has found that the Soviet army has been constantly concentrating on Kursk in a semi-circular shape, with the string of the salient point measuring approximately 260 kilometers. Belgorod in the south is located 140 kilometers south of Kursk and is the center of the Soviet army at this salient point. Orel in the north is located 120 kilometers north of Kursk. Last winter, the Soviet army fought bloody battles for several months in an attempt to retake the area without success. The Soviet Command seems to have fully understood the exposure of its position, and in view of the failure of the Morsenko, it only launched offensives in Orel or Belgorod to improve its unfavorable strategic position. The current local German offensive in Belgorod has forced the Soviet Command to abandon its conservative policy and order an offensive. At this time, the war on this front has begun. In the next few days, it will be possible to determine whether the Soviet offensive is the same as the Morsenko offensive in May of last year, and will be defeated and impossible to recover. At the same time, fierce battles have been taking place in the Belgorod area since the first day of the week. When the Soviet army tried to defeat the highlands it lost on Sunday, it added new divisions and tank brigades to the battle, attacking the highlands and surrounding areas. The Soviet air force also assisted in the battle. The Soviet army concentrated a large number of troops in the area, and the German Command had to draw a large number of reserves to counterattack the Soviet tank force. At present, news about the German victory is still unavailable because the war is still in full swing. However, judging from the initial front-line information, the Soviet army has undoubtedly lost a large number of tanks. German modern defensive weapons have annihilated many Soviet troops on the vast front south of Orel. At first, the Soviet army seemed to have a winning appearance in the area, but before the Soviet army reached the main German line, it was subjected to a fierce bombardment by German artillery, and the German infantry took the opportunity to counterattack and drive the Soviet army back to its original position. The battle is still in progress, and both sides continue to draw reserves to respond. According to a report from the German News Agency, the battle situation on the first day of the week can be described as follows: (1) The German positions on all sections are being defended, and the Soviet army has failed to break through anywhere. (2) German tank forces have not been used on a large scale. (3) German flat-firing guns have destroyed many Soviet tanks. Currently, while there are fierce battles on the ground, the German air force is also extremely active. It is reported that the Soviet aircraft lost a total of 122 aircraft on the first day of the week. According to last night's Reuters Moscow dispatch, German tanks have penetrated the Soviet line in two or three locations. One of them occupied two villages. The Soviet Information Bureau issued a communiqué at midnight yesterday, saying that on July 6, the Soviet army continued to fight against the strong German tank and infantry forces in the three areas of Orel, Kursk, and Belgorod.

### Large Air Battle Over Sicily - Allied Flying Fortresses Intercepted and Suffered Heavy Losses

Lisbon, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Haitong News Agency, American Broadcasting Corporation special correspondent Budidet released a message last night, describing the battle over the Mediterranean Sea as a battle for air supremacy. He said that the Flying Fortresses that raided Axis targets in the Mediterranean theater often encountered strong counterattacks from Axis air defense forces. For example, when 30 American aircraft raided Sicily on Monday, they encountered 100 German and Italian aircraft in battle. Allied aircraft were also intercepted by 50 Axis aircraft in a battle on Sunday. The intensity of the air battle on Monday was unprecedented. Axis aircraft attacked Flying Fortresses fiercely, like a swarm of wasps.

Rome, 7th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Stefani News Agency, the Allied Air Force fiercely engaged Axis aircraft three times over Sicily on Sunday. A total of 25 aircraft were shot down. The most intense battle occurred over the Catania plain, when a large number of four-engine American bombers, escorted by fighter planes, attempted to fly over the target in the area, but were intercepted by the Italian Air Force. 98 American aircraft were indeed shot down, and another five were largely destroyed, and 95 were heavily damaged. An air battle also occurred south of Cape Cesaro. A large number of Allied aircraft were dispersed. Five enemy aircraft were shot down in this battle, and another two were largely destroyed, and ten were damaged.

### Return of the French Concession in Shanghai - Authorities Conduct Negotiations - Chinese and French Officials Met Yesterday, Mayor Chen Spoke Cordially with Minister Chu

Regarding the implementation terms and understandings of Japan's return of the Shanghai International Settlement, relevant Chinese and Japanese officials presided over the signing of the return agreement in the capital on June 20, and the National Government will implement the return on August 1. Foreign Minister Chu Minyi came to Shanghai from Beijing with Chen Guofeng, Director of the General Affairs Department, to inspect the situation in Shanghai, and it is reported that he also negotiated with the French side on the return of the Shanghai French Concession. Mayor Chen specially visited Minister Chu in the morning at nine o'clock for a cordial discussion. It is reported that they discussed the return of the French Concession and various issues related to the implementation of administration after the International Settlement was taken over for a long time.

Chinese and French authorities met once - Since Foreign Minister Chu Minyi arrived in Shanghai from Beijing the day before, the French Ambassador to China and the Consul-General in Shanghai also arrived in Shanghai on the same day. Foreign Minister Chu met with the French Ambassador once at 4:00 PM yesterday to negotiate the takeover of the French Concession.

Ling Xianwen's Broadcast Speech

Director of the Municipal Party Department Shen Yiwen broadcast on the Shanghai Broadcasting Station the day before, titled "After the Shanghai Settlements Are Recovered." He said in brief: "The Shanghai International Settlement will be recovered on August 1 this year with the help of our friendly nation Japan. Although the date for the recovery of the Shanghai French Concession has not yet been determined, our determination must be carried out, and we believe that it will be recovered in the shortest possible time. From now on, there will be no settlements in our country, and the century-old shame will be washed away in one day. However, there is still much work to be done and our responsibilities are exceptionally heavy, because Shanghai is not only an important commercial port in the country, but also a major city in East Asia, occupying a very important position politically, economically, and culturally. We must continue to work hard and actively, so as not to betray the meaning of recovering the settlements."

### The 41st Ration of Household Rice Will Be Restored to Two Sheng - 20,000 Stones of Suzhou Rice Will Be Shipped to Shanghai Soon, and Other Locations Will Continue to Ship

According to a report from the Datong News Agency reporter: The Rice Distribution Office of the Public Works Department of the two settlements has decided to restore the 41st household rice ration to two sheng. Once the rice from outside the port is shipped to Shanghai, the deficit will still be supplemented. As for household flour, it will continue to be sold as usual from the 11th.

The Director of the Municipal Grain Bureau issued a statement - In recent days, the city's rice has risen in the black market, and all citizens are concerned. The Central News Agency reporter specially visited Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Grain Bureau, at his official residence yesterday morning, and asked about the city's rice situation. He gave a statement, saying in brief: "Since the city's rice procurement and transportation were transferred to the Shanghai District Rice Joint Venture, the black market price of rice suddenly experienced an unprecedented surge during this transition, which is obviously the result of rice merchants making trouble and once again using their collection and hoarding branches to ignore people's livelihood, which is deeply distressing. An inspection of the city's rice supply shows that there is no shortage anywhere, and citizens can rest assured. All rumors are purely unfounded. The fact is stronger than rhetoric, and the rice supply will not be interrupted. 100,000 bags of rice from Suzhou, 20,000 bags from Yangzhou, and 30,000 bags from Huzhou will be shipped to Shanghai separately. The Shanghai District Rice Joint Venture is now actively engaged in expedited shipping. A telegram from Suzhou was recently received, stating that 16,000 bags of rice, totaling 20,000 stones, have been scheduled to be shipped today (8th) and can be shipped to Shanghai on the 9th. The remaining 84,000 bags of rice from Suzhou will also be shipped to Shanghai continuously, so there is no need to worry about the people's food in the urban area as the source of rice arrives."

Procurement procedures are gradually becoming smoother - A Commercial News Agency reporter quoted the person in charge of the Joint Venture as saying: "The first batch of rice, about 150,000 bags, is expected to be shipped to Shanghai today or tomorrow. The personnel sent by the company to purchase the rice departed separately on the 3rd of this month, and the main locations were Suzhou, Huzhou, Yangzhou, and other places. The rice could have been shipped to Shanghai earlier, but because the rice in various places was scattered in the suburbs, it took a lot of time to concentrate it, and it was also difficult to collect a huge amount of sacks for a while, and all the work was a first attempt, so it was delayed for four or five days. Now, the various procedures are gradually becoming smoother, and part of the rice has already been loaded on the ship and departed. It is estimated that the quantity is about 150,000 bags, which can arrive in Shanghai in the next two days.

It is also learned that 20,000 bags of rice from Yangzhou to Shanghai, of which 7,000 bags, according to a telegram from Yangzhou, have already been shipped.

Wheat purchase actively promoted - The reporter also learned from the Wheat Professional Committee that the association's work of buying wheat is also being actively promoted. According to the estimation that this year's wheat harvest is very good, and the new wheat in various places in Jiangnan has already been harvested, the estimated output of wheat flour in various places, in addition to local consumption, may be as follows (in thousands of dan): Suzhou 100, Wuxi 200, Changzhou 200, Zhenjiang 200, Nanjing 200, Anting 100, Danyang 100, Kunshan 100, Taicang 100, Jiading 100, totaling 1,400. In addition, the possible shipping volume from various places in Jiangbei is 3,000, totaling 5 million dan that can be imported from Shanghai.

### Investigate House Subletting Based on Baojia Household Registration

The subletting licenses for the first half of this year in the two settlements expired at the end of June. All second landlords should renew these licenses for half a year and must obtain a renewal application form from the Public Works Department or the French Public Bureau before the end of June. It is learned that about 50,000 licenses were issued in the first half of the year, but the number of applications issued now is less than the above amount, so the authorities will send officers to investigate. The method is to record the names and housing locations of the second landlords who have not renewed their licenses, and then go to the Baojia office in that area to investigate whether their attached households have been canceled. If they have not been canceled and the renewal is delayed, they will be punished according to the Regulations on Subletting Licenses.

### Temporary Suspension of Moving Applications During Household Registration Period

The Baojia authorities in the International Settlement have ordered all Lianbao to order all Baojia to re-fill the original household registration investigation form and send it out within a week. It is reported that the Changju Bureau in Xinzha and other districts has informed the Baojia chiefs that after reviewing the household registration, it is required to compile a new household registration book, but during the period of整理 this household registration book, applications for household migration will be temporarily suspended. After the整理 is completed, the collection will be resumed. However, this sorting period will last at most one or two days.

### Fourth Period of Cooking Oil Will Be Sold in Mid-Month

The Shanghai Cooking Oil Wholesale Office has already sold out the fourth round of cooking oil purchase with housing tax tickets for the three districts of Nanshi, Huxi, and Pudong at the end of last month. The two settlements and Zhabei and other districts have delayed in the handling of the goods, and the sales could not be carried out at the same time. According to the person in charge of the office, most of the cooking oil has been taken out of the warehouses and distributed to the oil shops for retail sale. There is still a part of it that is being processed, and it can be sold generally around the 15th of this month.

### Thoughts on Unifying and Promoting Charitable Undertakings - Wen Lanting, Lin Kanghou, Yuan Lüquan of the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association (3) The Ideal of Charitable Undertakings

Based on the above-mentioned several issues and certain difficulties regarding the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, Lanting and others exchanged views and generally believed that unified promotion is indeed the path that charitable undertakings must follow in the future, and the sooner it is implemented, the more beneficial it will be to private interests. However, in order for unified promotion to be more than just a slogan, it is necessary to ensure that it effectively produces results, so that the unified promotion of charitable undertakings can develop smoothly, fill in the gaps in humanity, eliminate social misfortunes, and truly realize the ideal of "not only loving one's own parents and children," so that in the new society of the future, charitable undertakings will no longer be needed. The following points are the common ideals of Lanting and others, and they are willing to share them with those who have the Tao. They also hope that they can encourage each other:

First, the unified promotion of charitable undertakings does not depend on the laws and orders of the government authorities, but relies on widespread and in-depth publicity and explanation. Therefore, for this movement, it seems appropriate to start with Shanghai and gradually promote it to the whole country. In particular, it is hoped that major newspapers and opinion organizations will widely promote and encourage it. At the same time, those who operate charitable organizations and enthusiastic people from all walks of life should hold seminars on this movement, conduct individual research, publish opinions in newspapers, or provide opinions to relevant parties, so as to mobilize public opinion in the shortest possible time, launch a heated review, concentrate conclusions from all aspects, and seek the most accurate and perfect specific methods. We believe that the plans created in this way will definitely be more practical and powerful than those that a few people come up with at home through arduous thought. In this open discussion process, the above-mentioned issues and difficulties can also be resolved invisibly.

Second, for the unified promotion of charitable undertakings, the organizational aspect naturally requires a central organization. This central organization is the general authority for investigation, design, guidance, promotion, review, and supervision for the unified promotion of charitable undertakings in the future. Therefore, first of all, it must concentrate talent. It should not only recruit outstanding leaders and workers who are currently running charitable undertakings, but also recruit those who have previously achieved success and are rich in experience. At the same time, it should also recruit experts in investigation, statistics, design, and other fields from outside of charitable undertakings, so as to gather wisdom and pool efforts. Secondly, this central organization should receive strong assistance from the government and relevant authorities, but at the same time, the government should not interfere with personnel and internal affairs, except for providing necessary convenience in principle guidance and implementation work, so that it can fully exert its effectiveness. As for the original charitable organizations and their undertakings, they should be properly investigated to ensure that they are necessary for unified promotion and reasonable development. Those that should be expanded should be expanded, those that should be reduced should be reduced, and those that must be merged should be merged, so that the will of charitable undertakings in the future is concentrated, the power is concentrated, and no manpower, material resources, or financial resources will fail to exert their full effectiveness.

Third, in the practical work of unified promotion of charitable undertakings, the basic principle is to maintain the original work achievements of each charitable organization, and then promote certain particularly good working methods and methods of some charitable organizations, so that all charitable organizations uniformly implement them to improve work efficiency. At the same time, accept the experience and lessons of various charitable organizations that have been running charitable businesses for decades or even centuries, and establish the working guidelines and specific methods for promoting charitable undertakings in the future. It is also necessary to calmly review the errors and shortcomings of certain social organizations and the reasons for the failure of their undertakings, so that we can know what to avoid in future work. In terms of personnel, the original system of each charitable organization should be maintained, and any interference or changes should be avoided as much as possible, in order to achieve the practical effect of assisting various charitable organizations through unified promotion. What should be particularly emphasized is that charitable undertakings in the future must be proactive. Therefore, in terms of work, it is necessary to closely cooperate and cooperate with educational institutions, cultural institutions, and even various business sectors, no longer limited to isolated and passive relief work.

Finally, regarding fundraising, after unified promotion, it is natural to change the past practice of each going its own way and conduct organized fundraising under a unified and comprehensive plan. For example, on the one hand, determine fundraising targets based on actual needs, and on the other hand, adopt appropriate plans based on the strength of the people. In principle, it is "those who have money give money, and those who have strength give strength," so that in every fundraising event, no one does not give money or strength. The charitable fundraising methods of advanced countries are indeed worth emulating. In terms of individual fundraising, it is necessary to be universal, with no one not participating, and to be ashamed of not giving money or strength. In terms of fundraising for social organizations, companies, and factories, a progressive ratio donation method can be adopted, stipulating that each manufacturer should contribute one-thousandth of its annual net profit as a fixed donation for charitable undertakings based on the progressive ratio. Under unified and planned fundraising, the funding problem of charitable undertakings in the future, even if it cannot be immediately improved, will often not be as serious as it is now.

The above are the key points of the exchange of views between Tuan and others on this newspaper's "Charitable Undertakings Urgently Need Unified Promotion." Now we sincerely provide them to gentlemen of understanding, and we hope that all parties will launch discussions and generously give advice, so that charitable undertakings in the future can create greater achievements and more glorious records. (The End)

Economic Circle Commentary

### Industrial Spirit

Running an industry should have a vision that does not seek immediate profits, especially not seek exorbitant profits, and a down-to-earth step, especially listening to the environment. Then there is hope of success. We believe that running a factory today should have the following four spirits:

(1) Creative Spirit: It is not appropriate to imitate others in running an industry. It is even more inappropriate to stick to old methods. It is necessary to be creative, be able to use one's own mind and ability to seek new styles and new methods in order to surpass others and avoid falling behind.

(2) Scientific Spirit: All organizations, equipment, and technologies should strive for rationalization. In particular, there should be a spirit of scientific management. Everything should conform to scientific methods in order to modernize industry.

(3) Rule of Law Spirit: Running an industry should strive for the rule of law. There should be a spirit of the rule of law, eliminating personal likes and dislikes and the sentiment of relatives and old friends. If one is concerned about sentiment and does not follow the law, one will destroy public rules and regulations and jointly followed discipline.

(4) Enterprising Spirit: Running an industry should require constant efforts. One should not be complacent and fall behind. The operation of industry will retreat if it does not advance. If there is no spirit of courage and advancement to seek the development of business, one will undoubtedly be eliminated.

This is the spirit that industrialists today should have in common. The revival of Chinese industry during the war depends on this, and the development of Chinese industry after the war also depends on this.

### Japanese Economic Delegation Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday by Plane; Mr. Ogura Masatsune, the Head of the Delegation, Gave a Speech

Mr. Ogura Masatsune and his party, members of the Sino-Japanese Friendship Economic Delegation, arrived in Shanghai by plane at 4:50 PM yesterday (the 7th). They immediately went to the Biao Zhong Pagoda in Dachaang Town, the Bahsien Garden, and the Shanghai Shrine to pay their respects. Then, they drove to the Cathay Hotel, where they were staying. At 8:00 PM that evening, Minister Tianji hosted a welcome dinner at the Broadway Mansions. Mr. Ogura, the head of the delegation, met with the press corps at the Cathay Hotel and gave the following speech:

We have long had the desire, as members of the non-governmental economic community, to visit China, have friendly talks with everyone, and investigate the current state of the economy. Today, the opportunity has matured, and we have fulfilled our long-cherished wish, which is a great pleasure. It is clear that the Chinese and Japanese people are neighbors and also of the same culture. Since ancient times, exchanges have been frequent. Since the modern era, Asian nations have called for resistance to the aggression of Western European countries in order to revive Asia. The cooperation between China and Japan has been inevitable. This has been advocated by the pioneers of the two countries, and the goal of those with unique vision in both countries has been to focus on this. However, due to various circumstances, it has not been successful, but has instead caused unfortunate events, which is deeply regrettable. Fortunately, Japan later clarified that its East Asian policy aims to build a new order in Greater East Asia based on the spirit of morality, with the three principles of anti-communism, friendship, and economic cooperation with China as the fundamental guidelines. In China, people of insight, led by Chairman Wang Jingwei, rose up and responded, defecting from Chongqing, expressing their determination to cooperate with Japan, save China, and move towards building Greater East Asia. Furthermore, in January of this year, they declared war on the United Kingdom and the United States, participating in the Greater East Asia War with Japan, sharing life and death. I cannot help but celebrate for the two countries and the hundreds of millions of people of Greater East Asia. In this way, China and Japan have resolved the long-pending issue of Sino-Japanese cooperation with facts. However, it is unprecedented in the history of Sino-Japanese relations that the two countries can cooperate to resist foreign enemies. However, this unprecedented fact is by no means artificial, but is the inevitable trend of history. Moreover, Japan took the opportunity of China's participation in the war to abolish the extraterritorial rights that had shackled China for a century and return the concessions. The mutual cooperation between the two countries in East Asia has taken a further step. As such, China and Japan are now working together with all of East Asia to carry out the Greater East Asia War and build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. However, judging from the nature of the current world war, if the Greater East Asia War is not won, then the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be impossible, and if the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere cannot be built, then the people of Greater East Asia will never have any hope of happiness. However, whether it is war or construction, the economic responsibilities are very heavy, which is unnecessary for us to elaborate on. Therefore, we must fully recognize the facts of the times and cooperate economically as members of the non-governmental economic community, which is the most important thing. However, no matter how loudly we call for cooperation, if we ignore it in our hearts, then the result of the so-called cooperation efforts will become just lip service. Therefore, in order to achieve harmony, it is necessary to be respectful in communication and trustworthy in action, otherwise it will never be effective. The purpose of our organization of the non-governmental delegation here is nothing more than to express our congratulations to China on recovering the concessions, being able to break away from the British and American shackles that it has suffered for a century, and restoring the face of a new China, and to implement exchanges with the Chinese government authorities and the non-governmental economic community as members of the non-governmental economic community, so that Sino-Japanese cooperation will be further consolidated. We hope that you will give us assistance.

### Speech by President Tang of the General Chamber of Commerce

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency): Tang Shoumin, President of the National General Chamber of Commerce and member of the Materials Control Review Committee, came to Nanjing to attend the fourth regular meeting of the Materials Control Review Committee. The reporter took this opportunity to visit Mr. Tang. He answered the various questions asked. The main points of his answers are as follows. Since the establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce, the main commodity trade associations of the lower-level organizations in Beijing and Shanghai have been established one after another. There are currently 69 types that have been completed and reported to the association for record. Currently, the General Chamber of Commerce is working to popularize the control policy throughout the country. The establishment of the Wuhan Branch and the Hunan-Hubei-Jiangxi Branch has been discussed in detail at today's meeting. In the future, the central and local control organizations will be complete, and the application will be more perfect. The office in the capital will be established within this month and is actively planning. As for the collection of wheat by the General Chamber of Commerce, there are currently 29 offices, which will be gradually expanded in the future so that large quantities can be absorbed. The loans for buying wheat have now reached 100 million yuan, so there is no need to worry about large-scale purchases. Furthermore, some trade associations have not yet been able to achieve perfection and exert their strength. This is because the establishment period was short, and although it has been three months, it is not easy to contact and negotiate. One of the reasons for this is that the person in charge lacks experience, but it is hoped that people from all walks of life will provide guidance from time to time, so that things can be done with half the effort and achieve results. Currently, the General Chamber of Commerce is subordinate to the Executive Yuan, and its organizational regulations are currently being revised. In the future, the organization will be strengthened. Regarding the issue of material exchange between Central China and North China, there is already a complete plan, but it is still under research, and a satisfactory method will be realized in the future.

### Research by Various Industry Evaluation Committees: New Countermeasures to Stabilize Prices; Strengthening the Organization and Hiring Experts as Committee Members

The evaluation committees of the various industry trade associations in this city recently convened temporary committee meetings to resolutely implement the previously set price limits without any leniency. However, in order to increase the stock of goods in retail stores, they appealed to the authorities to allocate more materials for sale at limited prices. Currently, the evaluation committees of various industries, in view of the heavy workload in recent times and the urgent need to thoroughly investigate the sales situation of member stores, have strengthened their organizations, hired powerful people in the industry to serve as committee members or consultants, and sent letters to member companies to provide opinions for reference.

Setting up a Secret Complaint Box: According to a reporter from the Shanghai News Agency, the evaluation committees of various industries have, after careful consideration, implemented the evaluation work in accordance with the established steps and dispatched personnel to investigate the buying and selling situation and limited price lists of various member companies. However, it is inevitable that there will be shortcomings. In order to strive for smoothness and achieve effective results, secret complaint boxes have been set up at the entrances of various trade associations, allowing anyone to report violations. Any member of the association who sells goods without following the limited price or has other illegal activities can report the facts directly into the box. Once the investigation confirms that there is such a thing, the person in charge of the company will be summoned to publicly discuss the punishment.

Posting Notices: A notice is posted next to the secret complaint box, which reads: "To whom it may concern, This association, in accordance with the instructions of the authorities and for the welfare of the industry, has established an evaluation committee in accordance with the association's constitution. Since its inception, meetings have been held to evaluate and set price limits, which have been sent to the authorities for approval and forwarded to all member companies for unified compliance. It has been found that the price increase trend has become rampant again recently. This association is deeply disturbed by the news. However, in order to adhere to our original intention, we have to take effective measures. In addition to being happy to accept the goodwill contributions of all parties, we also hope for extra assistance in order to achieve success. At the same time, we especially hope that our member companies will abide by the regulations and not violate the law. We hope you will understand."

### Organizational Structure of the Cotton Industry Special Committee

Since its establishment, the Cotton Industry Special Committee of the National General Chamber of Commerce has been devoted to the discussion of specific aspects of the cotton industry. Its internal organization includes a secretariat, three departments: the General Affairs Department, the Review and Investigation Statistics Department, and the Supervision Department, and two departments: the Cotton Department, which takes over the former Central China Cotton Control Association, and the Cotton Textile Products Department. A committee has been established to focus on researching, designing, purchasing, allocating, and increasing production, including the Cotton Committee, the Cotton Cloth Committee, the Cotton Yarn Committee, the Cotton Textile Committee, and the Processing Committee.

### Powder & Wheat Special Committee Registers Certificates in Beijing

Nanjing, 7th (Central News Agency) - The Nanjing Office of the Powder & Wheat Special Committee of the National Commercial Control Association completed the registration of applications for commissioned merchants from wheat businesses in various locations on the 7th, and will no longer accept applications. A total of seven applications for commissioned merchant registration were received and have been forwarded to Shanghai for approval. As for wheat businesses and sellers in the Beijing area, the Cereal Industry Association will compile and submit applications to the Nanjing Office for certificate issuance.

### 200,000 Bags of Wheat to be Shipped to Shanghai

Wheat, a staple food, has been purchased from various production areas since the new harvest, as the authorities recognize the importance of food during wartime. The Powder & Wheat Special Committee, organized by Chinese and Japanese merchants, is responsible for the procurement and is provided with various forms of assistance. It is reported that the procurement work has achieved considerable success, with 200,000 bags of new wheat currently being collected in the production areas, awaiting shipment to Shanghai. The transportation permit is still pending approval. Meanwhile, flour mills in the city, such as Fuxin, Fufeng, and Huafeng, are actively preparing to resume operations as the new wheat is expected to arrive in Shanghai soon.

### Merchants of Various Industries Apply for Permits

The National Commercial Control Association, in order to strictly control and prevent the outflow of important materials, previously issued a public notice stipulating that for 25 categories of goods, including automobiles and their parts, hemp and its products, sugar, cotton yarn, and cloth, those intending to transport them from the Yangtze River downstream areas to South China, North China, Mengjiang, Nanchang, Hankou, Jiujiang, and other places, must apply to the association for a transportation permit in advance. It is reported that merchants are now complying with this regulation and obtaining certification from their respective trade associations as members of the association. The transportation of these materials to the aforementioned areas remains brisk. However, the Material Movement Permit Office of the Commercial Control Association, upon receiving applications and supporting documents from merchants, will conduct a thorough review and issue permits only to those deemed qualified. No separate letters will be sent for notification. Instead, the permit numbers for the materials will be posted at the office entrance. Applicants can claim the permit by following the prescribed procedures if the numbers match the ones they have obtained in advance. Furthermore, the transportation permits must be returned after the materials have been transported and cannot be deliberately concealed or used as an excuse for other purposes.

### Four Banks Including Siming to Convene Board Meetings to Determine Restructuring Steps

In order to strengthen financial institutions, the National Government promulgated guidelines on the 26th of last month to reorganize the four banks, "Siming, China General Chamber of Commerce, China Industrial, and China National Products", removing the Chongqing faction's influence and transforming them into purely commercial banks. Simultaneously, chairpersons, directors, and supervisors for the four banks were appointed separately, ordering them to proceed with the restructuring immediately. The registered capital of each bank was set at four million yuan. The original official shares held by the Chongqing faction will be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank and may be sold to merchants. It is reported that the first batch of directors and supervisors have been actively preparing for the restructuring after receiving the order. The China General Chamber of Commerce Bank and China Industrial Bank already convened their first board meetings on the 5th and 6th respectively, to determine the restructuring steps and appoint internal managers and assistant managers. Siming and National Products banks will hold board meetings today and tomorrow to proceed with the restructuring. It is said that the banks' operations will continue as usual during the restructuring period.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks continued to plummet. Investors' confidence was already weak, and the gold price decreased, causing commodity prices to fall as well. New and old investors halted their activities, leading to a sharp decline in stock prices. Some buying activity occurred at the noon break, suggesting a potential stabilization. The department store sector experienced the largest decline, with Wing On, Sincere, China National Products, and Neiliansheng all closing near their lowest prices. Kwong Wah Department Store was relatively stable, while King Lun Shirts and Socks stood alone, rising nearly a yuan. King Fook was slightly depressed.

Correction: In yesterday's advertisement (Dr. Ding Jiwan certifies the efficacy of Baosheng Jindan), "Baosheng Jindan" in the second line was mistakenly printed as "Baosheng Jindan", "leukorrhea" in the third line was mistakenly printed as "bloody discharge", and "pregnant women should discontinue use" in the last line was mistakenly printed as "pregnant women should avoid use." This is hereby corrected.

### Scolding

— Ouyang Menglei

Openly "scolding", secretly "scolding", tearfully "scolding", with hidden daggers "scolding"... "Scolding" is everywhere, I almost suspect this is a world of "scolding people". "Scolding" when you encounter something unsatisfactory is like shouting loudly: "I'm coming, make way", because they don't discuss, so you "scold".

And so the more you "scold" the worse it gets. And the worse it gets, the more fiercely you "scold".

Perhaps sometimes you suddenly feel that all kinds of "scolding" don't help you much, and you yourself are "scolding" very hard. So you think like this, and say like this: "I won't scold people anymore", "I forgive everything"...

When you say: "I won't scold people anymore", it means: "They are still worth scolding, but I'm not happy to scold, that's all". When you say: "I forgive everything", it also means: "Others are wrong, and I am right", so you forgive them... How ridiculous it is, you moved the judge's mouth onto your own mouth, and put on subjective eyes, no wonder everything has to be "forgiven" by you.

So how can we correctly avoid inappropriate "scolding"?

We should always carefully think like this:

"Those people who are scolded by me in various ways, have I ever known them? Understood them? Comprehended them? What are the reasons why they are not reasonable? What are their difficulties? What are their shortcomings? How do they 'explain' themselves?" After thinking, it's worth trying to "put yourself in their shoes". Then you can discover them and me.

### Truly Happy People

— Ji Chen

"Happiness" is intuitive, so ordinary people "seem" to understand what "happiness" is. However, it is very doubtful whether this intuitive "happiness" is truly "happiness". Part of it is just a momentary "stimulation".

Is seeking pleasure in brothels happiness? Is being addicted to gambling happiness? Is speculating and hoarding happiness? Is singing, dancing, and lavishly spending thousands of gold coins without being stingy... is that truly "happiness"? Of course not! I think these are not truly happy, they are the results of "sex maniacs", "money-grabbing maniacs", and "greedy maniacs"... These are just momentary stimuli, stimuli... that make their brains "numb". The result of this kind of behavior is nothing more than destruction, pushing oneself into a bottomless abyss.

Why do people "willingly degenerate", willingly run to the edge of destruction? Because they don't understand what true "happiness" is.

A truly "happy" person must first make others "happy"; then, when he feels comfortable and relaxed, he won't be awakened by the pangs of conscience and ruin his moment of pleasure. Because whoever bases his "happiness" on the suffering of others will never get true "happiness".

True "happiness" is expressed from the heart, and cannot be compared to external stimuli. Many people travel by car, live in high-rise buildings, and eat delicacies... everything is as luxurious as possible; outwardly they may seem leisurely and "happy", but we can also easily imagine their inner pain! Therefore, a truly "happy" person is definitely not one who thinks about how to enjoy themselves all day long; on the contrary, they are the ones who work hard and devote themselves to the welfare of society.

### Spark

— Liang Yue

People often don't pay attention to the "small" things; in fact, a major event is brewed from a "small" thing; conversely, if you want to handle affairs, you must start with the "small" things. "A prairie fire starts from a single spark", don't forget this sentence.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

"Staff Officer Zhang, take them outside and, together with that person who colluded with the bandits, interrogate him severely. Tonight, you must turn over the weapons and reveal the bandit party, and await my disposal," Commander X said to a person in gray cloth standing next to him.

"Town Chief Li, let's go outside! Don't disturb the Commander anymore," Staff Officer Zhang said as he waved his hand to Town Chief Li and the others. So the three of them bowed ninety degrees to Commander X and exited the Commander's office. Staff Officer Zhang walked in front. The orderly outside glanced at the three of them coming out, and leaned over, whispering to Town Chief Li: "What's the matter? Is it settled? I'll come to your house tomorrow morning. I have something to tell you." Town Chief Li nodded, followed Staff Officer Zhang, and stood in another dark and low place that looked like a firewood room. In the corner of the room, Ah Kun was tied up with his hands behind his back.

"Town Chief Li! You were too agitated. What you said to the Commander just now was too boring. We are all on the same side. I don't want to implicate you." Staff Officer Zhang seemed like a good person, speaking to Town Chief Li in a caring tone.

"Staff Officer Zhang! This matter is really too embarrassing! The one surnamed Wu—referring to Ah Kun—is indeed so poor that he can't even get enough food, you can't squeeze oil out of a stone, and he's quite honest. We really can't bring ourselves to deal with this matter. I think it's better to ask Staff Officer Zhang to help us." Chief Lu couldn't help but interject first.

"Really! Staff Officer Zhang! You are from this area, even though we are distant neighbors. We are still fellow villagers. I have done so many unconscionable things in the past two years as this cursed town chief, I don't know how many times. Today this unit is leaving. They want this and that, tomorrow that unit will arrive. They want this and that. Wasting time and spending money doesn't count, and I still get scolded. Listen to what the Commander said just now, it's as if we are also colluding with bandits. They insist on handing over this, they insist on handing over that. This sin is enough for me. I don't want to be this damned town chief anymore. I've lived for more than fifty years, dying now isn't considered short-lived!" Town Chief Li had just been scolded, and remembering the past, he vented a burst of resentment.

"Town Chief Li's grievances are indeed enough to bear. But this time, the matter must be settled. Staff Officer Zhang! You are a fellow villager, please smooth things over, otherwise, if things get stiff, it won't be fun for anyone, and it might lead to someone's death, which wouldn't be good!" Chief Lu also felt a little impatient, and a fire of injustice burst out from the bottom of his heart.

"I understand very well. I don't really approve of this kind of thing either. But, I really have no way to say a fair word. If you don't do it, then there is nothing else to do; if you do it, then you will be fed up. To be honest, you two are not suffering too much as town chiefs. I have been in the team for a few months, and what I have seen and handled are too many evil things! Today is not the time to complain, we will have the opportunity to talk another day. However, today that person—pointing to Ah Kun in the corner of the room—I think it is better to settle the matter, otherwise he will suffer. He seems to be sick. And he can't bear hardship. What do you think?" Staff Officer Zhang seemed to be a bit self-righteous and unable to extricate himself, saying the above paragraph of words very sadly. (6)

### Sympathizing with Cheng Keguang's Family, Master Kuqi Generously Donates Relief Money

Master Kuqi wrote yesterday saying, "I read in your newspaper that the artist Cheng Keguang was tragically killed four years ago, leaving his wife without support. She was overwhelmed with grief, and because of the family's poverty, she could not fulfill her responsibilities to her elders and children, and had no choice but to attempt suicide several times. Fortunately, she was rescued each time. This news is truly heartbreaking. As a fellow human being, I cannot bear to stand idly by. Therefore, starting from July of this year, I will donate one thousand yuan per month until June of next year, temporarily for one year, or possibly continue. I am sending a relief certificate to the Cheng family, please forward it. In the future, they can withdraw funds directly from the designated location. This small amount is just a token of my sincerity." Master Kuqi's generosity and righteousness are truly admirable. The relief certificate will be temporarily kept here. Please have the Cheng family provide a guarantor with a seal and a citizen's certificate to collect it from this office, to show our seriousness.

### Medical Guidance

The weather is unpredictable, with frequent sunshine and rain, so people with colds and those with lung diseases often cough and spit blood.

The association will provide free service. The extremely poor can receive medicine. Clinic hours are limited to 9:00 AM to 11:00 AM. The location is the association on Shengmuyuan Road.
