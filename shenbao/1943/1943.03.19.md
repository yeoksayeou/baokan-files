### Total War and Resource Mobilization

Ancient warfare was a war of manpower, where the decisive forces were the size of the army and the superiority of strategy. However, modern warfare is much more complex. While the advantage in troops and excellent strategy are still the main factors for victory, it is also necessary to have material strength, especially the collective strength of national spirit and resources. Hence the term "total war." We are now participating in the war, and the enemy is the world's largest imperialist country, the largest industrial country. If we do not have adequate material preparation, but only shout slogans, we will never defeat the enemy. Therefore, "total war" means not only the government's participation in the war, but also the people's participation. It is not only spiritual participation but also material participation. Only by using the full power of the country to participate in the war can we achieve ultimate victory. Therefore, it requires not only the mobilization of manpower but also the mobilization of materials. Japan's gradual strengthening of mobilization work in these two areas shows its importance. However, we have a unique national situation, and copying and imitating may not yield the same results. Especially in the mobilization of resources, due to the loose organization of our society and the underdevelopment of modern industry and transportation, complete control and general mobilization plans, as well as absolutely strict mobilization plans, may not be effective. Instead, we must take appropriate measures at the right time and place, emphasize guidance over restriction, and promotion over intervention, to achieve effective mobilization.

In the above sense, we should strive to avoid using legal power to requisition materials from the people. Especially for materials that are easily destroyed or hidden, requisitioning will not achieve the desired results. Therefore, the government should adopt the principle of purchasing at high prices. Whether it is land, food, horses, vehicles, or other materials, the highest principle should still be "do not recklessly take even a single blade of grass or a single tree from the people." In this way, the people will have no loss and will have a reputation for patriotism. However, the high-price policy inevitably stimulates price increases and gives huge profits to a few people, so it should not be used too widely, and should not be used lightly unless absolutely necessary.

Secondly, for materials that can be produced by the private sector and are relatively abundant, with a surplus for civilian use in addition to military use, the government can order them from the people through purchases. However, producers must prioritize fulfilling government orders and only deliver ordinary orders after fulfilling them. This method imposes very little restriction on private production and is a relatively good way to mobilize resources. As for general necessities, especially the inventories owned by merchants, the government authorities can conduct a general registration and store them in warehouses designated by the government, which can prevent hoarding and speculation, and can be requisitioned by the government at an appropriate price when necessary.

However, no matter what methods and steps are taken, to achieve complete success in mobilizing resources, we cannot rely solely on government laws and the authority of officials. Instead, we must focus on the work of publicity, explanation, and encouragement. In particular, we must use public opinion organs and mass organizations to carry out the work independently. The essence of "autonomous economic mobilization" lies in this. The government only needs to be in a position of guidance and supervision, and the laws only need to focus on preventing and punishing those who engage in private gain and malpractice. If this can be achieved, all the people's efforts, labor, and materials will not be hidden, but will be spontaneously concentrated under the government's control. This will not be limited to materials alone, and "total war" can then be "true to its name."

### Strengthening the Greater East Asia Financial System

The Federal Reserve Bank of China has been in operation for five years. The Bank of Japan provided the Central Reserve Bank with a credit loan of 100 million yen on July 28th of last year, and the Ministry of Finance of Thailand with 200 million yen on June 18th of last year. Now, it has followed up by providing the Federal Reserve Bank of China with a credit loan of 200 million yen. This concretely demonstrates that the currency and financial institutions in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, with the Bank of Japan as the center, are being organized and strengthened.

When the Federal Reserve Bank of China was established in 1938, it was the time of the most intense international currency war. The establishment of the Federal Reserve Bank overcame the stubborn obstruction of Chongqing, Britain, and the United States, and its very existence is an astounding achievement. Now, the Federal Reserve Bank notes, reserve notes, and Japanese yen are closely linked and cooperating, and have taken firm root in their respective fields. Britain and the United States once asserted that Japan's currency work would surely fail, but now that they see the spread of its roots, they will be amazed!

The 200 million yen this time is used to replace and expand the credit loan of 100 million yen originally lent by fifteen powerful Japanese banks when the Federal Reserve Bank of China was established. Under the established policy of establishing the Greater East Asia Financial Sphere, the Bank of Japan will be at the center, providing it solely.

The lower-level structure of a wide-area economy is, of course, currency. The construction and strengthening of currency is not only necessary for the exchange of essential materials in the current stage of the war, but also has significant implications for the future after the war.

However, the spirit of a wide-area economy is manifested in the removal of political national border barriers within the wide-area sphere, allowing currency and materials to flow freely. In today's situation where war is being waged in various fields, the existence of many obstacles is unavoidable. At present, currency and materials are not flowing freely within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Naturally, we should gradually move in this direction in the future. At a time when the movement towards political unification of Central and Northern China is underway, the coexisting Federal Reserve Bank notes and reserve notes are eagerly awaiting their rapid integration into a unified currency after their solid growth and development.

### Large Formation of Japanese Naval Aircraft Fiercely Attacks Darwin Harbor, Military Facilities Heavily Damaged, Sixteen Enemy Aircraft Shot Down

Tokyo, 18th, Domei News Agency: The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4 PM today that Japanese naval aircraft attacked Darwin Harbor on the 15th of this month, heavily damaging its military facilities. At the same time, they engaged with more than 30 enemy aircraft, shooting down 16 of them. One Japanese aircraft did not return. From the 6th to the 11th of this month, the Japanese Navy sank 6 enemy submarines. The Japanese side had two merchant ships sunk.

Lisbon, 18th, Domei News Agency: The Allied Headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced today that Japanese naval aircraft again attacked Milne Bay on the south coast of Dutch New Guinea yesterday.

Lisbon, 18th, Central News Agency: According to Australian broadcasts regarding the bombing of Darwin by Japanese aircraft on the 15th, the Japanese aircraft attacked Darwin close to noon on the 15th. This was the most intense bombing in the past few months. The commander of the Allied forces in the Southwest Pacific, Macarthur, has repeatedly warned the Australian people about the power of the Japanese Air Force, and the bombing of Darwin is a demonstration of this fact.

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: The Japanese Naval Air Force launched a large-scale air raid on Darwin Harbor, an enemy military base in northwestern Australia, during the daytime on the 15th. The intensity of the Japanese aircraft's attack was said by Australian broadcasting stations to be unprecedented in recent months, so it is not difficult to imagine the severity of the damage. The enemy forces are attempting a counterattack, and have recently been actively increasing the number of aircraft sent to Port Moresby and Guadalcanal Island in the eastern South Pacific, intending to use these as forward bases. Their fierce battles with Japanese aircraft day and night are well known to the world. However, the enemy forces have recently been more actively strengthening various combat capabilities in the Darwin Harbor area, preparing for a counterattack. To preempt this, the Japanese Naval Air Force, on the morning of the 15th, launched a joint large formation of attack aircraft and fighters, penetrating the skies over Darwin Harbor one after another, dropping bombs like rain under close coordination. A large number of oil depots caught fire from the hits, and all harbor facilities were destroyed. The enemy's British and American joint fighter squadrons, seeing that the situation at the airfield was also critical, rose to meet them. More than 30 enemy aircraft of the Spitfire and P40 (Kittyhawk) types began to engage with the Japanese fighter squadrons. The Japanese attack aircraft squadrons also fiercely attacked more than a dozen enemy fighters. A fierce aerial battle immediately unfolded. As a result of the Japanese fighters' valiant efforts, 15 enemy aircraft were shot down. The attack aircraft squadrons also shot down one enemy Spitfire aircraft. Only one Japanese aircraft has not yet returned. As a result of this battle, the enemy's counterattack posture suffered a major setback.

### Manchukuo Reforms Administrative Structure, Revamps Police Administration, Strengthens National Defense

Beijing, 18th, Central News Agency: The Manchukuo government, in order to strengthen the domestic decisive battle system, has decided to reform the internal structure of the government. After many days of research, all preparations have been completed. It was finally decided at the Senate Council meeting on the 18th, and all procedures have been completed. It will be implemented from April 1st. The main points of this administrative structure reform are as follows: (1) Establish a Ministry of Education and Culture to oversee education, religion, moral instruction, customs, arts, culture, sports, and other matters related to people's livelihood, as well as the artistic administration under the Public Information Office of the General Affairs Agency, to promote education and culture. (2) Establish a Police General Bureau to separate the police administration under the Department of Security and change it into an external bureau of the General Affairs Agency, in order to enrich the police organization and unify the administrative and police affairs. (3) The Department of Military Affairs and the Department of Security will be renamed the Department of Military Affairs, which will be in charge of national defense, military administration, and other purely national defense matters, in order to make the Manchukuo defense at the present time more and more substantial.

Beijing, 18th, Central News Agency: The Manchukuo government authorities recently issued a statement explaining the reasons for this administrative structure reform. The statement said that when the government is implementing the second phase of construction work, in order to revitalize the people's administration and build a highly national defense state, it believes that it is necessary to make some reforms to the current administrative structure. Therefore, it has taken this measure based on the outline of the basic national policy. In order to revitalize culture and education, the Education Division and the Welfare Division are separated from the Department of Civil Affairs to establish a Ministry of Education and Culture. Since the promulgation of the National Military Law in the seventh year of Kangde, the foundation of the National Army has been established, and the importance of military administration has become increasingly important. Therefore, in order to adapt to the progress of our country's politics and to coordinate police administration with the general situation, it is an urgent task at present. Therefore, the Police Division is separated from the Department of Security, and the Department of Security is renamed the Department of Military Affairs, which specializes in military affairs. A Police Bureau is added to the General Affairs Agency to take charge of police affairs, in order to strengthen the relationship between police administration and various administrative departments. It is firmly believed that the implementation of our country's administration will be more and more smooth as a result of this reform.

Takasaki Appointed Economic Advisor

Changchun, 17th, Havas News Agency: The "Manchukuo Daily" reported that the Manchukuo government has appointed Takasaki, chairman of the Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation, as the government's economic advisor. According to the government, there are four economic advisors, the other three being Omura, president of the South Manchuria Railway Company, Kamagawa, former chairman of the Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation, and Okada, president of the Manchukuo Industrial Bank. The Manchukuo Industrial Development Corporation controls various heavy industries in the country, so Takasaki's appointment as economic advisor this time is the most appropriate. In the future, he will surely be able to promote various economic measures.

Japan Sends Youth to Develop Manchuria and Mongolia

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: A total of 237 members of the Japanese Youth Volunteer Corps from Tokyo and Kanagawa Prefectures have been dispatched to Manchukuo and Inner Mongolia to assist in development.

### Burmese Chief Executive Invited to Japan

Tokyo, 18th, Central News Agency: Among the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, a strong system centered on Japan is now being established, gathering the total power of China, Manchukuo, Thailand, etc., laying the foundation for the formation of a large ethnic group in Greater East Asia. Burma, as a powerful wing of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, has always actively cooperated with Japan. In his policy speech at the Diet meeting on January 28th of this year, Prime Minister Tojo has already recognized that "Burma will become independent within the year." At the invitation of the Japanese government, Burmese Chief Executive Ba Maw, along with Minister of Home Affairs Dakin Miya, Minister of Finance Dai Ying Mo, and Commander of the Burmese Defense Army Major General Aung San, broke through the 5,300-kilometer air route and arrived safely at Haneda Airport at 1:00 PM today. Yamamoto of the "Greater East Asia Ministry," Matsumoto of the "Ministry of Foreign Affairs," Tominaga of the "Army Ministry," and Sawamoto, the Vice Ministers of the "Navy Ministry," and Takeuchi, Director-General of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and many other officials and civilians welcomed them at the scene. Chief Executive Ba Maw and his entourage immediately took a car from Haneda Airport to the annex of the official residence of the capital, Hiro-cho, to rest.

Rangoon, 18th, Central News Agency: After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Burmese were most cooperative with the Japanese army in combat. After the Japanese army settled Burma, the Burmese once again directly and indirectly cooperated with the Japanese military administration in restoring and building Burma, and increasing the Japanese military's combat power. Moreover, Burma is the richest place for rice production in the South, so that the Japanese army has no worries about the rear in combat, and supplies rice to Japan, Java, and other places. In addition, it also supplies green vegetables, cattle, pigs, chickens, eggs, fruits, etc. From this, it can be seen that Burma has sufficient self-sufficiency in food and even has a surplus. This kind of food self-sufficiency system constitutes a major driving force for the Japanese army in the bordering areas where the Japanese army and the Chongqing, British, and American armies are confronting each other, laying a major foundation for maintaining治安, and becoming a major element in strengthening Burma's defense system. In addition, Burma is rich in timber, which can be used to build wooden boats, which also occupies an important position in increasing ships.

### The Increasingly Declining Chongqing Army's Organization and Deployment

Nanjing, 18th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Japanese army's spring offensive in the Central China area has dealt fatal blows to the Chongqing forces in the Sixth War Area ("Hubei Front"), the "Ninth War Area" (near Nanchang), and the "Lu-Su War Area" ("Su-Huai Front"). However, the Chongqing side still possesses several hundred divisions, totaling approximately three million troops. Acting as a link in the anti-Axis camp and willingly serving as traitors in East Asia, they continue their blind resistance. Their operational foundation lies in dividing defense areas into combined warfare zones, forming strategic unit groups. Under the "War Area Commander," command is delegated to "Army Groups, Armies, and Divisions." The following briefly describes the organization and troop deployment of the Chongqing forces in each war area to illustrate the foolishness of their struggle, which can only lead to decline. "First War Area," Commander-in-Chief Jiang Dingwen, with Tang Enbo as his deputy, has a total strength of forty divisions. Among them, approximately twenty divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. They are entrenched in southwestern Shanxi and the mountainous areas of Henan. During the Central Plains Campaign, they suffered heavy blows from the Japanese army and sustained severe damage. "Second War Area" encompasses various regions in northern Shanxi. "Commander-in-Chief" Yan Xishan, "Deputy Commander-in-Chief" Yang Aiyuan. "Third War Area" is centered around the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway, including the four provinces of Anhui, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, and Fujian. They suffered a severe defeat by the Japanese army during the Zhejiang-Jiangxi campaign last May. Commander-in-Chief Gu Zhutong, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Tang Shizun, with a total strength of thirty divisions, half of which are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. The Fourth War Area governs the entire province of Guangxi, Commander-in-Chief Zhang Fakui, with a total strength of only six Guangxi divisions. Since the Japanese army occupied the French concession of Guangzhou Bay, Zhang Fakui's attempt to use his position as front-line commander to seize Guangzhou Bay has been foiled. The Fifth War Area includes southern Henan, northern Hubei, and western Anhui, Commander-in-Chief Li Zongren, with Sun Lianzhong as his deputy, has a total strength of thirty-two divisions, but only four divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. The Sixth War Area governs the western part of Hubei province, along the Yangtze River, serving as a barrier to Chongqing, Commander-in-Chief Chen Cheng, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Wu Qihui, with a total strength of twenty-six divisions, of which approximately twenty divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. Although Chen Cheng once proclaimed that he would retake Yichang, he has suffered heavy blows from the Japanese army in Central China and sustained significant damage. The Seventh War Area is limited to Guangdong province, Commander-in-Chief Yu Hanmou, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Jiang Guangnai, with a total strength of fifteen divisions, all of which are Guangdong troops. After the Japanese army occupied Guangzhou Bay, Yu Hanmou's troops in the vicinity have been cleared out. The Eighth War Area spans the three northwestern provinces of Shaanxi, Gansu, and Ningxia, Commander-in-Chief Zhu Shaoliang, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Fu Zuoyi, with a total strength of fifty divisions, of which fifteen divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. It is reported that a portion of them has been stationed in Xinjiang. The Ninth War Area encompasses Hunan and Jiangxi provinces, Commander-in-Chief Xue Yue, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Yang Sen, with a total strength of thirty divisions, of which fifteen divisions are directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. In addition, a Tenth War Area was established in Yunnan province at the end of last year, with Guan Linzheng rumored to be the Commander-in-Chief. Furthermore, there is a special war area, the Lu-Su War Area, which is a corner in the middle of the Lu-Su Peace Zone, where the Chongqing army is recklessly active, Commander-in-Chief Yu Xuezhong, Deputy Commander Han Deqin, with a total strength of ten regiments, of which only one division is directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction. Since generals such as Wu Huawen, Li Wenli, and Li Yingping successively pledged allegiance to the "He Yun" (likely referring to a collaborationist movement), the strength of this war area has significantly diminished. The second is the Ji-Cha War Area, comprising remnant Chongqing troops scattered in the Hebei-Chahar region, Commander-in-Chief concurrently held by Jiang Dingwen, the Commander-in-Chief of the First War Area, Deputy Commander-in-Chief Pang Bingxun, with a total strength of nine divisions. There are also two border areas, one being the Lu-Su-Yu-Wan Border Area, Commander-in-Chief Tang Enbo, and the other being the Lu-Su-Wan Border Area, Commander Wang Zhonglian. The troop strength in both areas is extremely weak, consisting of only one division directly affiliated with the Chongqing faction and some guerrillas, attempting to stir up trouble in the border regions of Henan, Shandong, Jiangsu, and Anhui. Secondly, there are approximately 250,000 Communist troops entrenched in the Central and North China areas. Among them, the Commander and Deputy Commander of the Eighteenth Group Army are Zhu De and Peng Dehuai, respectively. Those entrenched in the North China area include Nie Rongzhen, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji Border Region, Xu Xiangqian, Commander of the Lu-Su-Yu Border Region, He Long, Commander of the Jin-Northwest Military Region, and Liu Bocheng, Commander of the Jin-Cha-Ji-Lu-Yu Border Region. The total strength of these four border regions is approximately 160,000 to 170,000. There is also the Shaanxi-Gansu-Ningxia Border Region centered around Yan'an, the base of the Chinese Communist Party, with approximately 35,000 troops. The New Fourth Army, with its base in northern Jiangsu, Commander-in-Chief Chen Yi, divided into seven divisions, has a strength of approximately 50,000 troops. Since the Nationalist government forces and the Japanese army jointly launched a suppression campaign, it is now on the verge of collapse.

### British Foreign Secretary Eden Holds Lengthy Talks with Roosevelt Discussing War and Post-War Issues; Prior to That, He Held Sincere Talks with Litvinov

Lisbon, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Washington dispatch: British Foreign Secretary Eden had a lengthy meeting with Roosevelt last night, discussing war and post-war issues. Prior to that, Eden had first met with Roosevelt's personal advisors, Hopkins and Berle. It is reported that today Eden will meet with American senators and the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.

Lisbon, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - According to news from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden met with Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov yesterday afternoon. Strang, a Soviet affairs expert from the British Foreign Office, was also present.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Diplomatic circles here believe that Eden's visit to Washington is an inevitable result of the Casa Blanca and Adana conferences. The purpose of the Casa Blanca conference was to adjust the anti-Axis military plans among the Allied nations, but the United States and Britain could not reach a consensus on their attitude towards the Soviet Union. At that time, Roosevelt and Churchill decided to further clarify the Soviet issue in Washington later. Recently, due to the Polish-Soviet dispute and the Soviet Union's lack of trust in the Casa Blanca and Adana conferences, London wanted to conduct British-American negotiations as soon as possible to discuss countermeasures. Churchill was unable to go to Washington due to illness, so he ordered Eden to go in his place. It is reported that during the Adana conference, the United States and Britain mentioned the organization of a united front to deal with Russia after the victory. The Kremlin was suspicious of this, so it instructed its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, to demand that Britain formally recognize the minimum demands of the Soviet Union, thus triggering the Polish-Soviet dispute. Therefore, this Washington conference is of great significance. However, it is generally expected that the United States and Britain will not adopt a clear attitude of firm rejection towards Soviet demands, so as not to strengthen Soviet distrust.

### Plans to Establish a New Europe to be Announced by Axis Powers

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - The Axis powers are currently discussing the future state of Europe. Authoritative sources will make an announcement soon. It is generally believed that the form of the new Europe cannot be decided solely by politicians at the conference table, but should be based on past experience and determined by the needs of the environment. The relationship between the Axis powers has long been developed according to this principle. Now, it is possible to make a clear announcement of the final goal. The communique issued after the meeting between German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and Italian Prime Minister Mussolini has already revealed some hints. Since the Soviet Union and the Polish government had a dispute over the border issue, and Britain expressed no interest, all European countries, especially neutral countries, felt terrified. Recently, there has been talk of British Foreign Secretary Eden visiting the United States to consult with Washington on revising the Atlantic Charter. These rumors are not without cause. Therefore, the Axis powers' announcement of the plan to establish a new Europe is eagerly awaited by all parties.

### Wallace Visits Central and South America

### Hitler Inspects Front Lines; Fierce Fighting East of Kharkov; Soviet Offensive Suffers Heavy Losses in Manpower and Material

Berlin, 18th (Allied Press Telegram) - It is reported that Führer Hitler is currently inspecting the southern sector of the Eastern Front, accompanied by General Zeitzler, Chief of the German General Staff. It is expected that the German army will take new actions in that area.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Berlin newspapers yesterday all carried photos taken when the Führer recently visited the southern sector of the Eastern Front and met with various military commanders. The location was at an airfield somewhere behind the front lines. General von Manstein, Commander-in-Chief of the German Army on the southern sector of the Eastern Front, and General Richthofen, Commander of the Air Force, were both present. Military circles in Berlin believe that the Führer's visit was to study future strategies after defeating the Soviet army's winter offensive.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - There have been no major changes in the Eastern Front in the past 24 hours. Fierce fighting is still ongoing east of Kharkov on the Donets front. The Soviet army's manpower has been exhausted, with only one division withdrawn from the Mius front being transferred there for combat. West of Belgorod and northwest of Kursk, the German army continues to make progress in its eastward offensive. The fighting in the Orel area is only of a local nature.

Stockholm, Sweden, 18th (Allied Press Telegram) - Reuters correspondent in Moscow reported last night that the Red Army has so far failed to stem the German counteroffensive on the Donets River. The two armies are fighting a desperate battle there, with positions being gained and lost several times in a single day. According to the Red Army's official newspaper, Red Star, yesterday, fierce fighting is taking place on a major road in a certain city. The German offensive involves 60 tanks each time.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Responsible sources announced that in the past three months, the Soviet army's losses, including killed, wounded, and captured, totaled 1,500,000. Soviet losses north and south of Orel were approximately 200,000, Soviet losses between the Don and Dnieper rivers were 215,000, Soviet losses in the Kursk area were 5,000, Soviet losses in the Kupiansk bridgehead were 120,000, Soviet losses in the Donets Basin were 100,000, Soviet losses in the Battle of Stalingrad were 300,000, Soviet losses in the central sector of the Eastern Front were 50,000, Soviet losses south of Lake Ilmen were 150,000, Soviet losses on the Volkhov Front were 250,000, and Soviet losses in other areas such as Velikiye Luki, south of Rostov, and the Mius Front totaled 100,000.

Berlin, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Responsible sources revealed last night that since November 20th last year, the Soviet Union has lost a total of 12,000 tanks, of which 9,600 were destroyed by the German army and the remaining were destroyed by the German air force.

Ankara, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - According to Moscow Radio, the Chairman of the Supreme Soviet of the Soviet Union, Kalinin, has appointed General Novikov as Air Force General. He recently received the Order of Suvorov.

### German Fleet Concentrates off Northern Norwegian Coast; Lays Mines off Stavanger; Aims to Cut Off Supply Lines to Soviet Union

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Havas Agency Telegram) - According to Swedish newspapers, British sources in Lisbon reported that the German navy will intensify its activities on the convoy route between Murmansk and Arkhangelsk and in the North Atlantic. The German side is currently concentrating most of its fleet (including battleships, cruisers, and aircraft carriers) near the northern coast of Norway.

Oslo, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - The German naval authorities have issued an order that mines have been laid outside the port of Stavanger, Norway, and ships are prohibited from entering the port from 11:00 PM to 6:00 AM the next morning.

### British Army Launches Offensive on Mareth Line; Axis Forces Still Firmly Defend Original Positions

Berlin, 18th (Allied Press Telegram) - Official sources here announced last night that a part of the British Eighth Army in southern Tunisia launched an offensive on a broad front against the Mareth Line on Tuesday night. The German Africa Corps is firmly defending its positions. The British army has been deploying for several weeks, so this move was long expected. However, it is not yet certain whether its nature is a general offensive or merely a probing attack. What is known is that only a part of the British artillery has begun shelling. It is expected that the British offensive will intensify in the coming days. The British offensive was launched at 10:30 PM on Tuesday night at the coastal end of the Mareth Line, followed by heavy shelling, which intensified in the evening. It is not yet known whether the Allied forces will launch an offensive in central and northern Tunisia to support it. However, according to aerial reconnaissance, the American Fifth Army has been deployed extensively near the Axis forces' front lines in central Tunisia.

### Franco Clarifies Spain's Position; Seeks to Ensure Domestic Security

Madrid, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - The new Spanish Cortes (parliament) opened yesterday. Head of State Franco personally attended and delivered a speech, clarifying the direction of domestic and foreign policy. He stated that Spain was unified by victory on the battlefield, so in the future, if there are obstacles, it will spare no sacrifice to overcome them. This world war is closely related to the threat of Bolshevism. The source of this threat mainly lies in Stalin's destructive and divisive world revolutionary ideology. The Red Army was initially built with the expectation of waiting for an opportunity, but since the Soviet Union joined the war, the war has become a struggle of life and death. Today, Germany has a population of 100 million, and Italy and Britain also have vast populations at their disposal. At this time of historical turmoil, Spain should do its best to maintain order and ensure domestic security, so that it can shoulder a major mission for Europe on the day the war ends.

### Relying on Military Force as Backing; Safeguarding National Interests; Turkish Prime Minister Clarifies National Policy

Ankara, 18th (Haitong Agency Telegram) - Turkish Prime Minister Saracoğlu stated in a speech to the National Assembly yesterday that Turkey's foreign policy should be based on protecting the country's interests as a prerequisite. The Anglo-Turkish Agreement is based on mutual benefits. The Turkish President has a long-term vision and a strong military to back it up, so he can implement such foreign policies. In 1943, Turkey's military expenditure reached 500,000,000 Turkish pounds, while in peacetime, 100,000,000 pounds would be sufficient. Due to the government's large expenditures and financial difficulties, the budget has been balanced after much effort, and the state of paper currency has also improved. As for supply, the government is determined to eliminate the black market and will now find ways to implement state control over all necessities. Although Turkey's supply situation is not very good, it is ten thousand times higher compared to other countries.

### Pilgrimage to the Northern Border of Vietnam; Japanese and Vietnamese Troops Jointly Defend Against the Chongqing Army on the Opposite Shore

Following the Japanese army's entry into the French concession area of Guangzhou Bay and the Vichy government's declaration of abolishing extraterritorial rights in China and returning the administrative rights of the concessions, the issue of adjusting the Japan-Vietnam Economic Agreement, which was established in 1941 to adapt to the new situation in East Asia, has also been resolved recently in Japan-Vietnam relations. From late February to early March, France clarified its attitude of cooperation with the Axis powers, especially its deep understanding of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. At the same time, Vietnam itself is also getting closer to Japan. Regarding this trend, when the Japanese army entered Guangzhou Bay, the Chongqing regime protested to French officials in Chongqing, and the Chongqing diplomatic mission in Vichy, using the Vichy government's declaration as an excuse, withdrew from France, and its feelings towards France deteriorated. The Vietnamese border bordering the Chongqing regime will naturally become tense. In order to investigate the local situation, this reporter surveyed the northern border of Vietnam and first visited the city of Lao Cai.

Departing from Hanoi along the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway, we arrived at Phuc Xa station, one station before Lao Cai, at 5:00 AM the next day. Staying at the inn at the station, which was bombed by the US Air Force last summer, the glass of the two main doors inside and outside was shattered, covered with blue cellophane. The walls of the station staff's dormitory were also repaired with cement. One can imagine the intensity of the bombing at the time. Fragments of bombs are still visible today.

The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway was a major artery for aiding Chiang Kai-shek. When its transportation capacity reached its peak, more than 200 cargo trains ran every day. One Lao Cai station was not enough to operate, so a new station was opened two kilometers behind Lao Cai to facilitate transportation. The inn inside the station is not inferior to the inns in Hanoi. Today, seeing the remnants of the bombing by the Chongqing side, I cannot help but feel a sense of vicissitudes.

On the afternoon of the day the reporter arrived at Phuc Xa station, an old man from the inn suddenly knocked on the door and said, "The enemy planes are coming! The enemy planes are coming!" He advised me to take shelter in the air-raid shelter. In the steel-concrete air-raid shelter, there was a team of Annam honor guards that I had met in front of the inn, who were originally preparing to welcome Governor Ervin of Tonkin, who was scheduled to stay at the inn that evening, also looked uneasy. After the enemy planes passed beyond the border, the French old man at the inn ran out angrily and said, "What's all the fuss about!" Enmity was obviously written on his face.

The city of Lao Cai is located at the intersection of the Red River and its tributary, the Nanxi River. The intersection of the two rivers forms a swastika shape, which constitutes the border between Vietnam and China. The Yunnan-Vietnam Railway has a 120-meter-long iron bridge over the Nanxi River, which enters Hekou, China, and extends along the valley of this river from Mengzi to Kunming. The railway bridge was blown up by the Chongqing side after the Japanese army entered northern Vietnam. Now, a section of about 20 meters of the first bridge pier on the Vietnamese side still remains. The bridges behind it are all rusted and have fallen into the river. Standing at one end of the damaged bridgehead, the Chongqing army walking back and forth on the opposite shore, their gray uniforms and yellow faces, can all be seen clearly.

The Chongqing army has built the first to fourth lines of defense in the mountains surrounding the rear of Hekou, cleverly concealed behind the trees. They are equipped with mortars and defended by a part of the elite 19th Division of the 54th Army of the Central Army in Yunnan.

On the Vietnamese side, a hundred meters away, soldiers from the 〇〇 unit and Vietnamese troops are monitoring every day. The foremost line of the border is jointly defended by Japan and Vietnam.

Through special arrangements by the 〇〇 unit, we heard about the situation on the other side of the border from Lieutenant Liu (25th Division of the 52nd Army of the Central Army) and Lieutenants Gan and Tai (184th Division of the 1st Army of Yunnan), who had fled from Yunnan and surrendered.

The Chongqing army is afraid of the Japanese army's attack, so it has thoroughly destroyed the 177-kilometer-long railway between Hekou and Mengzi on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway. The 466-kilometer section between Mengzi and Kunming is operated under the supervision of the Central Army, but it only runs once a day in both directions. As for the highway, the motor road to Kunming has been destroyed, and the enemy's contact between the front line and Kunming relies only on radio, walking, and horses. It takes one month for the fastest and three months for the slowest. Therefore, the army's food supply is gradually becoming insufficient, and the local small sales are also due to the barren terrain, which previously relied on Vietnam for supplies. Therefore, the extent of the lack of supplies is worrying.

From ordinary soldiers to lieutenant-level officers, they only rely on a small amount of corn and sweet potato porridge every day. Every six days, each company is given five catties of lard, which is dissolved and cooked with wild vegetables, which is already considered a happy thing. As a result, prices are high. A box of Vietnamese-made tobacco costs only 35 cents in Hanoi, but costs about 20 yuan across the border, and is worth 25 yuan further inland.

The soldiers' salaries are 8.5 yuan for second-class soldiers, 9.5 yuan for first-class soldiers, 10.4 yuan for privates, 160 yuan for captains, 60 yuan for lieutenants, and 56 yuan for second lieutenants. Therefore, lieutenant-level officers cannot afford cigarettes. The central army in Yunnan Province has become very radical. The main parts centered on the Yunnan-Vietnam Railway are all occupied by the central army, and the Yunnan army is only in the part west of the railway. The military powers of the Yunnan leaders have now been eliminated, and they only have administrative powers. The prestige of the central army is greatly enhanced, but there are often reports of residents and the central army being estranged due to language barriers.

The central army facing Lao Cai is the 5th Division and the 54th Division, which have fought with the Japanese army in the Central China area and know the strength of the Japanese army. In addition, the 5th Army, which Chiang Kai-shek regards as elite, was also defeated on the Burma front. Coupled with the lack of supplies and internal turmoil, the general morale is very low. This is naturally regarded as a troublesome matter by Chiang, so he plans to transfer troops from the Hunan area to renew the morale of the area. He also plans to mobilize the spirit mobilization team centered on Kunming to instill war consciousness into the residents, but it has no effect.

The city of Hekou feels an extreme lack of supplies, so it is discussing with the Vietnamese side to open the ferry to Lao Cai from 8:00 AM to 11:00 AM during the day, so that residents can buy main foods, side dishes, and food items.

For this three-hour round trip, the boat fare is 20 cents. Residents of Hekou cross the Nanxi River to Lao Cai, go through physical examinations by Vietnamese military police and customs, and use their resident permits as collateral to shop in the city. On average, 300 to 400 people come every day, 80% of whom are women, buying vegetables, rice, etc. to take back.

According to Vietnamese police officers, after the Japanese army bombed Hekou, most of the residents seem to have decreased, and most of those who remain are poor people who have lost their hostility, but are still being driven to do useless resistance. On this side of the river, the Japanese and Vietnamese armies are jointly defending firmly. Although the sound of enemy artillery can be heard from time to time in the mining area outside Lao Cai, they are still leisurely mining apatite, carrying out industrial construction, exploiting endless buried treasures, and exporting them to Japan.

### Thailand Economic Overview: Refreshed Drama Group Becomes Part of the Co-prosperity Sphere

The core of Thailand's economic structure is agriculture, followed by forestry and mining. The main agricultural products are rice and rubber, forest products are malili trees, and minerals are mainly tin. However, in Thailand's industrial economy, only rice production has the Thai people's own subjectivity. The production of other major industries is almost entirely dependent on foreign capital, especially British capital. Even in the commercial field, it is dominated by overseas Chinese forces. This was the whole picture of Thailand's economy before the Greater East Asia War.

With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, Thailand concluded a defensive alliance with Japan. On January 25th of last year, it issued a proclamation declaring war on Britain and the United States, completely breaking away from its dependence on Britain and the United States. The face of the Thai economy has also changed dramatically, with a comprehensive reorganization of its economy from a new perspective—that of becoming part of the co-prosperity sphere. The exchange of goods between Japan and Thailand has also proceeded smoothly. The currency policy has shifted from being linked to the pound and the dollar to being linked to the Japanese yen. Public finance has shifted from peacetime finance to wartime finance. Other changes, such as the strengthening of economic controls and the significant progress of state capital, all indicate changes in the face of the Thai economy, which are noteworthy phenomena. The following is a description of the recent changes in the Thai economy.

Finance: Before the war, the reserves for the issuance of Thai banknotes were mostly in British and American currencies. When the war broke out, the Thai economy lost its pound and dollar funds, causing a temporary turmoil in the financial world. Withdrawals of deposits increased sharply, gradually presenting a dangerous malignant inflation. In response to this situation, the government made great efforts to suppress inflation, implementing restrictions on the use of bills and checks, and restrictions on the withdrawal of deposits. As a result, the amount of banknotes issued was limited to 316 million baht (Thai currency, end of March 1942). However, behind the decrease in total deposits in the city's banks, there was a shift from gold to goods, gradually showing a tendency for a decrease in time deposits and an increase in demand deposits. Therefore, the financial world cannot be said to be stable.

However, on the other hand, according to the Japan-Thailand Economic Agreement, an equivalence relationship between the Japanese yen and the Thai baht was established. As a result, the connection between the baht and the pound rapidly shifted to a connection with the Japanese yen. At the same time, Thailand, through the establishment of Japan-Thailand loans, obtained a loan of 200 million yen. The banknote issuance reserves also increased to 330 million baht due to the inclusion of 130 million baht in domestic gold reserves, achieving a 100% reserve ratio for the issuance of banknotes. Furthermore, by using the special yen, which is the external settlement currency of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, as its reserve, the stability of the external value of the baht was ensured. However, the tendency to exchange goods has not yet been changed. In addition, there is an increase in government fiscal expenditures, a sharp decrease in the volume of trade due to the severance of overseas trade, and industrial damage caused by floods. Therefore, the future of Thailand's financial economy is not optimistic. However, although the Thai economy has encountered an unprecedented period of drastic change, the transition of the financial world, generally speaking, has been relatively calm. This is largely due to the Thai government's appropriate handling of financial policies and its great efforts in organizing financial institutions.

Overviewing Thailand's financial policy, the government first implemented restrictions on deposit withdrawals to suppress inflation, and then implemented the New Currency Exchange Control Law (February 1st of last year), clearly stating that it was breaking away from the gold and pound connection, stopping the exchange of gold and pounds for Thai baht, and adopting an exchange permit system, making great efforts to prevent overseas remittances from overseas Chinese and other means.

While the Thai government adopted policies to stabilize the value of money internally and externally from the monetary aspect, it also worked hard to improve financial institutions. The first thing worth noting is the promulgation of the Central Bank Law. The Central Bank Law was promulgated on May 5th of last year, and the Bank of Thailand (with a capital of 20 million) was established on December 10th of the same year in accordance with the law, giving it the functions of a purely central bank. Due to the establishment of this bank, the unification of the financial world has been further strengthened, and its future activities are highly anticipated. In addition, savings associations have been organized in various places, and the state-owned Thai Life Insurance Company was established in June of last year. Through these means, efforts are being made to absorb excess purchasing power. On the other hand, credit cooperatives are being added in various prefectures and counties to promote the enrichment of agricultural finance.

Finance: As Thailand's economy entered the stage of a wartime system, military expenditures also increased significantly in fiscal expenditures. In 1942, the total of regular and special expenditures for national defense was 116 million baht, accounting for 41.6% of the total budget expenditure. Secondly, the significant increase in industrial construction funds (121 million baht) is also noteworthy.

In addition, there are many expenditures related to promoting industry, such as the establishment funds for the central bank, government funds for rubber companies and tin production companies, which are enough to see the future direction of the Thai government.

As for the revenue side, although it has gradually increased, it is still insufficient. Although there is an intention to make up for this shortfall from the natural increase in rice transaction tax, direct tax, indirect tax, and public enterprise income, the result is that it is intended to be made up for by the issuance of national bonds and local construction bonds of 1.177 million baht and the acquisition of the right to issue construction bonds of 60 million baht. The national bonds are planned to be taken over by the central bank, but because it has not been established, the provisional method is to borrow from city banks and temporarily borrow from the currency section of the National Treasury to make up for it. This result inevitably leads to an increase in the issuance of government banknotes. However, in order to avoid inflation, the government is now working hard to improve financial institutions, increase production, and establish price control policies.

Price Control: Regarding price control, the Controlled Price Law and the Daily Necessities and Food Control Order have been implemented. Due to the former, a central committee was established in the center, and local committees were established in various counties. The local committees are subject to the command and supervision of the central committee. The committee stipulates controlled materials and their types, and has the power to conduct investigations, allocate, and set official prices. The latter grants broad powers regarding the control of transactions in daily necessities and food, the allocation of goods, the determination of maximum prices, and the investigation of inventories. However, because the official prices set by the committee did not take into account the actual market prices, the market prices and the official prices were very different. Therefore, black market transactions were rampant, which contributed to the tendency of rising prices. In August of last year, the official prices of daily necessities and food were abolished, and fair prices set by the operators themselves were used as the basis. Only for nineteen important commodities such as sugar, soap, clothing, iron nails, and medicines, official prices were re-set, and the relevant laws and regulations were revised to strengthen the penalties for violations, and strict penalties such as the death penalty and life imprisonment were stipulated. Before the war, the quantity of imported goods was about 25% of the total production. After the outbreak of the war, it was completely cut off. For this reason, the Thai economy has an inevitable tendency for rising prices. However, although there has been such a period of change, prices have gradually stabilized. This is due not only to the appropriate measures of the Thai government, but also to the gradual increase of Japanese goods in the Thai market. In short, Thailand keenly feels that on the one hand, it is necessary to urgently seek the closer relationship between Japan and Thailand's economies, and on the other hand, it is necessary to urgently seek the development of its own industries. The recent question of how to transform from an agricultural country to a light industrial country is precisely a manifestation of the government's policy, which is noteworthy.

Industrial Policy: After the outbreak of the war, the main goal of the Thai government's economic policy is also clear in its direct statement in the declaration of war. It is to drive out the traditional foreign capital and operate with Thailand's own economic strength. Therefore, the first thing they started to do was to improve the economic structure. The government, with the proclamation of the State Council on February 17th of last year, established the Construction Industry Committee, and divided it into seven small committees such as soap, steelmaking, and ceramics. In April of last year, the Executive Industry Committee was established. In September of the same year, the two committees were merged and reorganized into the National Industry Committee. In the committee's plan, it is planned to establish a central industrial company to become a general investment company. It is also planned to increase the number of pottery factories, spinning factories, and daily necessities factories. In short, that industrial plan indicates that Thailand's urgent necessities are light industrial products mainly based on sugar (40,000 tons), cotton cloth (20 million baht), mineral oil (120 million liters), and other tobacco, matches, soap, and chemical products. The government first focused on increasing the production of beet and cotton. In April of this year, it planned to expand the existing sugarcane planting area of 50,000 rai to produce 22,000 tons of sugar, and established a sugar production increase plan, increasing the number of state-run sugar refineries in northeastern Thailand to expand production. Regarding the promotion of cotton production, the government has selected fifteen counties in northern Thailand since the previous year to work hard to promote cotton production, and established two cotton spinning factories. Between January and September 1941, the total cotton production reached 100,000 dan, 25% of which was for domestic consumption, 25% for the Thai spinning industry, and the remaining 50% was exported. The cotton planting area is also gradually increasing as a result of the government's promotion. Tobacco has always been overwhelmed by British and American tobacco, and the domestic tobacco industry has been depressed. However, the government promulgated the Tobacco Control Law in 1939, and the following year, it bought the tobacco factories of British and American tea and converted them into state-run enterprises. As a result, the Thai tobacco manufacturing industry was monopolized by the government. Matches were almost self-sufficient before the war, but after the outbreak of the war, there was a temporary shortage due to the severance of drug imports. In this way, the government, while seeking to increase the production of daily necessities, placed the country's major factories under military management to expand the production of important industries during wartime. In June of the same year, the National Industry Conference was held to discuss in detail the promotion of home industry, the promotion of forestry and mining development, etc. The government's intention is to turn all these important industries into state-run enterprises and completely drive out foreign capital. Therefore, it announced the establishment of the Thai Tin Mining Rubber Company (with a capital of 50 million baht) and the Timber Company (with a capital of 25 million baht). The government invested 25% of the capital in the two companies, both of which were operated by inheriting the confiscated property of the British system, and their business has already begun. In addition, the establishment of cooperatives is noteworthy in agricultural policy. These cooperatives are generally established with government funds. The original intention of establishing this kind of cooperative is to establish a rural economy mainly based on Thai people, and at the same time to eliminate the power of overseas Chinese middlemen. Therefore, its future trend is worth paying attention to. In order to improve the distribution mechanism, there is a proposal to establish a domestic products company, which is currently in progress.

An overview of the Thai economy has been made. What is worth noting is that the economic relationship between Japan and Thailand has become closer after the outbreak of the war. At the same time, the exchange of important materials such as rice, tin, and rubber from Thailand and textile products from Japan has also been promoted smoothly. On the one hand, the entry and exit of state capital has replaced the declining British capital. However, Thailand, which originally lacked the accumulation of national capital, is still dominated by the economic power of overseas Chinese. Considering this point, it seems that further policies are necessary for Thailand's economic development as part of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere.

### Public Associations with Similar Natures Will Be Merged or Abolished; Silver Money Industry, Grain Industry, and Others Will Be Merged into One Public Association

According to Shanghai News reporters, in order to revive the industrial and commercial industries in this city and stabilize prices, the relevant authorities in this city are trying to adjust the organizational structure of various industry associations, so as to have a strong organization to jointly seek the welfare of the industry. Now the authorities are proceeding separately, and it is planned to abolish or merge the same industry associations in the shortest possible time, such as (1) public associations of banks, money houses, and silver houses, which will be merged into "Financial Industry Association," divided into Bank Section, Money House Section, Silver House Section; (2) public associations of coal industry, coal balls, firewood, and charcoal, which will be merged into "Fuel Industry Association," divided into various sections; (3) public associations of miscellaneous grains, rice shops, and sales agents, which will be merged into Food Industry Association, and the internal affairs will be handled in sections according to the actual situation. Other industries such as cotton cloth, department stores, vehicles, and other industry associations will also be handled in accordance with the regulations. The organization of industry associations in this city is known to be more extensive than in other places. Before the war, there were about four or five hundred units. After the war, more than 300 units were approved for establishment by the social movement authorities. It is true that quite a few of the entire directors and supervisors of the various industry associations are legally elected by the members' congress. However, it has also been heard that some people despise the laws and do not elect and appoint candidates in accordance with the regulations. As a result, the candidates for the various industry associations are inevitably uneven. It is now learned that in order to adapt to the wartime economy and increase production, the authorities, in addition to rectifying the various industry associations, stipulate that the entire directors and supervisors of all public associations must be elected legally and must not be nominated in other ways.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Army Talks About the Current Situation of the U.S. and Chongqing Air Force

At 3:00 pm yesterday (18th), the press department of the Japanese Army in Shanghai held a routine meeting with the Chinese press corps in this city. During the meeting, the spokesperson of the press department of the Japanese Army gave a detailed account of the current situation of the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing. According to the spokesperson, the Chongqing Air Force, with the assistance of the United States, is actively rebuilding its air force, and the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing is also trying to launch a counterattack against Japan. However, the United States' assistance to Chongqing with aircraft has not progressed as desired. At present, the Japanese Air Force's continuous surprise attacks on the enemy's inland bases have repeatedly destroyed their offensive attempts. Observing the active situation of the Japanese Army aircraft for about a month from late January to late February, the number of sorties reached more than 20 times. The places that have become bombing targets include Wengyuan, Zhaoqing, Qingyuan, Huizhou, Sicheng Road, Laohekou Airport, Guoyang, near Sandouping, near Badong, Hanzhong Airport, Guilin Airport, Hengyang Airport, Lushi Airport, Liuzhou Airport, Liangshan Airport, and Wanxian and Anqing Airport, and other inland aviation bases, as well as important military facilities. Bombing is still continuing. The battle results are very great. The Chongqing Air Force, with the Aviation Committee as the center, is working hard to add factories related to aircraft, and newly build airports or air defense facilities. Especially in terms of air defense, since the beginning of March, the Sichuan Provincial Air Defense Conference has been held in Chengdu. As the bombing season is approaching, the air raids by the Japanese Air Force have made people panic. The aircraft of the Chongqing Air Force, whether bombers or fighter planes, have been mainly American-made in the past. There are also Soviet-made bombers mixed in. However, recently, a small number of British-made new aircraft have been added, which has made their types and models more complicated. At present, most of the Chongqing Air Force personnel were trained by Americans or Italians at the aviation schools in Hangzhou or Nanchang before and after the incident. Among them, some outstanding personnel were selected and sent to the United States to study. Some of them have returned home after two years of training, and some are still receiving training in the United States. Also, Mao Bangchu, the commander of the Chongqing Air Force, has recently gone to the United States to ask the United States to strengthen its assistance. Zhou Zhirou, the director of the Chongqing Aviation Committee, once said when he met with American reporters, "Although Chongqing is training pilots, the only defect is that even if the number of aircraft is increased, it will be of no avail." This exposed the fact that the increase in aircraft has not progressed as desired. After that, it is not known how many aircraft have been imported from the United States, but it is roughly estimated that 20 fighter planes are imported every month. Then the current strength of the Chongqing Air Force is about 200 in total. Bombers account for about one-fifth of them. Also, the P66 type has the largest number of fighter planes, followed by the P40E type and the E16 type. Its gathering bases are in Chengdu, Chongqing, Lanzhou, Liangshan, Kunming and other places. It specializes in lurking in the interior. The main force of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is placed in Kunming, Zhan Yi, and Guilin. The force is concentrated on the Burmese front. It has a rather negative attitude towards the Chinese battlefield. In mid-February, it attempted to jointly attack the Chinese front with the Chongqing Air Force, but on February 24, it was crushed by a joint surprise attack by Japanese fighter planes and bombers on Liangshan. In the future, there is still a possibility that the Chongqing Air Force and the U.S. Air Force will jointly attack when the opportunity arises. The current strength of the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing is about half of the strength of the Chongqing Air Force, estimated to be about 100 aircraft. Bombers account for more than one-fifth of the total number, and the number is gradually decreasing. However, all types are B25 type. As for the aviation-related factories currently in Chongqing, including the field repair factories, there are about 40 in total, scattered in Lanzhou, Chengdu, Jianzhou, Baishiyi, Suining, Liangshan, Jiading, Ya'an, Dading, Guiyang, Dushan Kunming, Duan, Liuzhou, Lin'an, and Hengyang and other places.

### Substitute for Automobile Fuel Costs 130 Yuan per Gallon

The French Municipal Council sells substitutes for automobile fuel at the gas station at 1244 Xiafei Road. However, the price of this substitute for automobile fuel needs to be adjusted. It has been decided that the price will be fixed at 130 yuan of Central Reserve Bank currency per gallon. The head of the finance department, Dou Ruifu, has notified all car owners to be informed, and will be implemented from the 18th of this month.

It is also learned that the substitute for automobile fuel will be distributed from the 4th of next month. After the vehicle is inspected, the substitute fuel stove will be branded. Those that fail the inspection must be transformed.

### Tobacco Distribution Association Holds Meeting with Wholesalers Yesterday; Centralized Distribution Will Be Completed by the End of This Month at the Latest

The China Central Tobacco Distribution Association has completed the registration and review of all wholesale cigarette companies in the city in order to unify and centrally distribute cigarettes. The approved wholesalers include: (1) 300 large wholesale companies, and (2) more than 5,400 small retail companies.

### Reorganization of the Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau; Policy for Promoting Maritime Affairs

The Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau in this city has been ordered to be transferred to the Ministry of Construction of the Executive Yuan. The reorganization was implemented on March 1st of this year, adjusting internal personnel and planning for the improvement of maritime affairs. The work has been extremely tense in recent days. The administrative policy after the reorganization is as follows: (1) Ship registration is to preserve the private rights of shipowners. Ship registration will always be more meticulous to ensure that shipowners have considerable rights and interests. (2) In order to ensure the safety of passengers and cargo transportation, the Bureau implements regular inspection of ships in accordance with laws and regulations. Shipowners often fail to continue to apply after the expiration date. In addition to urging them, the Jianghai Customs is also requested to assist. When ships that have not been re-inspected by the Bureau after the expiration date are declared, they will not be cleared. (3) The depth of ship personnel's qualifications is related to the safety of passenger and cargo transportation in the shipping industry, which has a huge impact. In the future, the Bureau will conduct more accurate assessments of ship personnel, and promote them in a short period of time, and request the Ministry to conduct inspections.

### Tongren Fuyuan Cup Second Charity Football Match - Tunghwa and Lunghwa Meet Again - Today at 5:00 PM at Yiyuan

To raise funds for the Tongren Fuyuan Hall charity, the Tongren Fuyuan Cup charity football match, initiated by the enthusiastic social entrepreneur Mr. Chen Zoudang, was held at Yiyuan on Albert Road last weekend. The two major Chinese giants, Lunghwa and Tunghwa, battled it out. Unfortunately, Lunghwa lost to Tunghwa by a score of five to two due to the absence of key players. A second duel is scheduled for today at 5:00 PM at the same location. The organizers have invited Mr. Hu Guoqiao of the French Public Works Department to serve as honorary chairman and appointed Zhang Daozhe, Song Qi, Xu Zhihao, Dong Xiaopei, Gu Rong, and Hu Guoan as organizing committee members and general affairs team cadres, and Qin Liang and Liao Shiming as ticketing inspectors.

All proceeds will be donated to the hall. The competition adopts a two-win system. The first battle was held last week. Today, the two teams meet again, and the victory or defeat is crucial. Tunghwa's strength is well-known, and their technique is superb. The Lunghwa team is on par with the Italian Navy in the Western League A Group League, leading the pack. Last week, due to the absence of key players Li Yichen, Li Tiansheng, and Gao Baozheng, and the fierce battle against Saint Francis at Jiaozhou Park the day before, the entire team was exhausted and lost control. Today, they will definitely give it their all. The victory or defeat of the two teams is difficult to predict, and there will definitely be a wonderful performance.

### Exchanging Cotton Yarn and Cloth for Cotton

The Central China Cotton Control Association, in order to alleviate the livelihood of cotton farmers in the interior who are deeply threatened by speculative merchants, plans to allocate cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other daily necessities in large quantities at official prices to stabilize their livelihood and increase the amount of cotton purchased. Cotton yarn and cotton cloth can be shipped and allocated to Jiangbei and other cotton-producing areas in mid-month. As for foreign goods such as cigarettes, matches, candles, soap, and sugar, allocation will also be gradually implemented from next month. In order to prevent the monopoly of intermediary merchants, the association has also ordered its subordinate institutions in various places to provide exchange coupons for cotton yarn, cotton cloth, and other daily necessities in proportion to the amount of cotton, in addition to paying cash when purchasing cotton in various places. Cotton farmers can transfer the exchange coupons and attach cash to the necessities exchange, and purchase allocated materials at official prices.

If the above measures can be carried out smoothly, the satisfactory results can be guaranteed. In short, there are about five points:

(1) The stable livelihood of farmers will encourage them to work hard to produce food and industrial raw materials to supply the cities.

(2) With a steady supply of food and industrial raw materials from farmers, the livelihood of urban residents will also be stabilized.

(3) With a source of raw materials and a sales channel for its products, Shanghai's textile industry will embark on the road to recovery, and other industries will also follow suit and recover.

(4) If cities can supply rural areas with low-priced industrial products, then rural areas can also supply cities with low-priced agricultural products. The height of prices of industrial products and agricultural products is closely related to each other. Now that Shanghai can resolutely supply rural areas with low-priced industrial products first, rural areas will also be willing to supply Shanghai with low-priced agricultural products. With low raw material prices and falling costs, the prices of Shanghai's industrial products will inevitably be lower in the future.

(5) After the prices of major industrial products and agricultural products are low and flat, the prices of non-major products will also be low and flat, which will cause hoarders to panic and come out of their cages, and the prices of general commodities will be low and flat, and the value of the currency will be maintained and rise. Some say that in this way, hoarders will suffer unbearable losses. This is a seemingly correct but actually wrong argument. Although hoarded goods fall in price, the daily necessities of hoarders also fall in price. What loss is there? Conversely, although hoarded goods rise in price, the daily necessities of hoarders also rise in price. What benefit is there? Harming others and not benefiting oneself, how foolish!

### New Central Savings Association to Convene Today - First Meeting of the Supervisory Committee

Central News Agency, Shanghai: In order to adapt to the current financial situation, encourage national savings, and use idle funds to develop legitimate businesses, the Ministry of Finance has decided to negotiate the takeover of the original Central Savings Association before the incident. It was approved by the National Government to establish a new Central Savings Association with funds raised by the Central Reserve Bank, inherit its assets and liabilities, and encourage general public savings. The Central Reserve Bank, in accordance with the regulations of the Central Savings Association Supervisory Committee, appointed Tang Shoumin and 12 others, as well as Liu Ruxiang, Wu Jiyun, and Shao Shijun, three directors and supervisors of the bank (Central Reserve Bank), as supervisory committee members. It is learned that in order to prepare for the takeover and reorganization of the Central Savings Association, a special meeting of the supervisory committee will be convened today (19th) to discuss and implement everything.

### Business Control Association Handles Material Movement - Many Applicants

Central News Agency, Shanghai: Since the National Commercial Control Association's Material Movement Application Office began handling material movement application permits on the 16th of this month, a large number of Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city have gone to collect the permit application forms, filled in the categories of materials to be moved in and out, and applied for permits from the office. The office's internal office system and the responsibilities of each department have been assigned. In order to unify and streamline the promotion of affairs, it is stipulated that the handling of application matters, in addition to assigning two people to be responsible for handling the application for the movement of each type of material, also stipulates that application documents will be collected in the morning, and merchants will only be allowed to collect permits in the afternoon. The application forms will be requested in writing by the trade associations of each industry. The Ministry of Industry and the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai have sent important personnel to assist and guide the matters to be handled. The Public Works Bureau has also sent police officers to maintain order. All office personnel follow the "fairness and integrity" indicated by the council to serve the society, and their work is quite serious.

### Ishiwatari Arrives in Shanghai

Nanjing, 18th, Central News Agency Telegraph: President of the North China Development Company, Tsushima, and Chief Economic Advisor of the National Government, Ishiwatari, left here for Shanghai at 9:00 this morning.

### Market Prices in Shanghai are Level

Since the implementation of the new regulations on material control, there has been no significant trend in Shanghai's economic circles. The scope of this reform is extremely broad, so we are still in a wait-and-see attitude. Positive economic activities will be launched in the coming weeks. However, market prices are currently very level, with almost no changes. The activities of speculators have been frustrated. On the one hand, the restrictions on movement in the interior have been lifted, and the production and sales of agricultural products are relatively strong. It is expected that agricultural products in Shanghai will tend to be cheaper, and the price difference between Shanghai and the interior may gradually balance. (March 18, Continental News)

### Banking Industry Eliminates Speculation - Seriously Handles Lending

After the banking industry and other firms implemented tight lending to eliminate speculation and suppress prices, they have become extremely cautious about all lending, such as mortgages, credit overdrafts, etc. Applicants for loans are limited to members of the association, and the purpose of the loans is thoroughly investigated. Those deemed to promote hoarding and speculation are rejected, and there must be a legitimate reason for the need. The term of the loan must not exceed three months at most. After the previous old loans expire, they should be repaid in full. Since the implementation, the entire financial situation has stabilized, the money supply has eased, and the interbank loan rate has fallen to 0.16 yesterday.

Translated Commentary

### Transformation of Economic Blockade Policy

The National Government has now decided to establish a National Commercial Control Association as the central control agency for material purchase and allocation in Central China, and to jointly establish a Material Control Deliberation Council with the Japanese side as its advisory body. At the same time, it has revised the current Temporary Regulations for the Prohibition of Material Movement in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River, effectively abolishing the restrictions on material movement in peaceful areas. These measures were implemented for local military operations, and the economic blockade policy in Central China, which was strengthened after the start of the Greater East Asia War, has now undergone a epoch-making transformation. After the National Government joined the war, the new strategy of gathering the total economic power of Japan and China was first realized concretely in the material purchase and allocation sector. From this, the National Government began to consolidate a unified and autonomous control mechanism for materials in Central China. After the National Government's strength is enhanced, what kind of effects can be achieved on the economic aspects of carrying out the Greater East Asia War depends on how the new agency operates in the future. The plan for this kind of material control agency has been tested and proved to be of great contribution to the revitalization of the economy in Central China.

Originally, a few months before the National Government joined the war, during the autumn harvest season last year, there was a reflection on the economic blockade in Central China's economic policy. After the successful opening of the Huai River in October and the establishment of the Joint Committee for the Purchase of Miscellaneous Grains by Japan and China in Bengbu, it was argued that the purchase and allocation of materials should be adapted to the actual local conditions, and the local Chinese capital and capabilities should be utilized as much as possible. This view gradually gained ground in the economic circles of Central China. The fact that the Grain Management Committee was upgraded and became independent as the Grain Department due to the reform of the National Government's administrative structure was not only aimed at ensuring grain, but also at enabling the Chinese side to actively participate in material purchase and increase production, so that the exchange of materials would become more flexible, and the link between Shanghai's industrial productivity and the interior's agricultural productivity would be strengthened, so that the value of reserve notes could be maintained, and the urgent price countermeasures in Central China would also be promoted by this.

The organization of the Material Control Deliberation Council has the participation of Chinese financial figures, and it is hoped that closer ties will be established between Shanghai's financial circles and the National Government. Their ideal of "Japanese-Chinese division of labor and cooperation" to combine the economic power of the two countries is first realized concretely in the commercial sector, so great expectations are placed on the future development of Japanese-Chinese economic relations. (Xiang: Translated from the March 13th issue of the Western Daily News)

### President Tsushima of the North China Development Corporation Discusses Future Economic Issues

President Tsushima Hisaichi of the North China Development Corporation came to Nanjing to inspect the economic situation in Central China. At 6:30 PM on the 17th, he met with newspaper reporters at the Ishibo Mansion and discussed the purpose of his visit to Nanjing and the development situation in North China. He said that he had been to Shanghai many times, but Nanjing was his first time. He felt that the capital under the war was full of vigor. He had long wanted to go to Nanjing to pay his respects to Chairman Wang and other important figures of the National Government, General Hata, and the military authorities, but due to excessive affairs after taking office as President of the North China Development Corporation, he was only able to fulfill his wish today. He met with his close friend Ishiwatari Advisor and Shanghai financial figures to hear about the situation here, so as to harmonize with the development policy of North China. This time, the purpose of coming to Nanjing was not for any specific issue, but to investigate the situation and seek exchange between the North and the South. He has a deep friendship with Mr. Takashima, the new President of the Central China Revitalization Company, but he did not have time to meet him due to time constraints. The development work in North China is progressing smoothly, and due to the progress of the Greater East Asia War and China's participation in the war, North China has become a rear military base, so its position is even more important. The related business companies are also constantly working hard, so this year's budget will be increased by a certain amount, and it is planned to return to Japan to discuss this matter with the central authorities. In concrete terms, because the material mobilization plan has not been determined, the details cannot be spoken. In short, the focus is on the development and increased production of coal, salt, and iron.

The biggest problem in the future is the exchange of materials between various parts of the mainland. The development of the mainland must provide materials to meet Japan's expectations. That is, China itself, since joining the war, must also seek the development of its industry and economy, so the exchange of materials in various places must be reasonable in order to cultivate combat power. The only good strategy for the development of the mainland economy is to produce and supply everything locally. This time, China's participation in the war is a great opportunity to solve this problem and promote economic development. It is hoped that we can go with sincerity and determination.

There are many discussions about the adjustment of state-owned companies, but in order to promote the future development of various companies, there are still two major issues that have to be considered, namely the composition of capital and the composition of personnel. At the beginning of this year, the five major coal mines managed by the military were merged into one and reorganized into a Chinese corporate company. All directors and supervisors below the president were appointed by Chinese, and the results were very satisfactory. I believe that this phenomenon will have a good impression on promoting Sino-Japanese cooperation in the future. At the same time, the transformation of Japan's policy towards China and the development of China will be able to speed up because of it.

Recently, the North China United Bank and the Bank of Japan concluded a 200 million yuan loan. This move has a very good impact on the economic circles of North China, promoting the allocation and utilization of funds, and it is believed that its contribution to promoting financial work is not small.

### After the Establishment of the National Commercial Control Association - The Functions and Powers of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce

The relationship between the functions and powers of the National Commercial Control Association and the original Municipal Chamber of Commerce is observed by powerful parties to be roughly as follows. The National Commercial Control Association will be the highest control agency for material purchase and allocation in Central China in the future, implementing control matters in accordance with the instructions of the government. However, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is different. The Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the representative of Shanghai's business community, responsible for making suggestions to the authorities and assisting them. At the same time, it can also serve as an agency for communicating opinions between the government and the people.

### Pig and Sheep Intestine Inspection - Inspection Fee Increased

### Japanese Coffee Extract Factory Plans to Form an Association with Chinese Merchants

There are as many as eight or nine coffee extract factories in this port. The five Japanese factories, namely Kimura, Shin興, Suginoya, Nihon屋, and Kotobuki商行, are facing difficulties in purchasing raw materials, and the soybean powder required for manufacturing is also very scarce. In addition, the competition among the same industry is at low prices, so the losses are huge. Therefore, a discussion meeting was held a few days ago. As a result of the discussion, it was decided to jointly form a trade association with Chinese coffee extract factories and be under the jurisdiction of the National Commercial Control Association. However, it is not known whether the Chinese side still has any opinions.

### Don't Be Afraid of Loneliness!

— Zhiyan

When you fight for a certain truth, and unfortunately fail, many people will flock to the banner of your opponents, become estranged from you, or even hurl abuse at you. A fear of loneliness will then quickly grow in your heart. However, in this situation, never be afraid of loneliness! You must continue to safeguard the truth and continue to strive.

Perhaps you think: many people are against the truth, what's the use of one person safeguarding and striving? You must know that the opposition of many people generally stems from two reasons: perhaps it is due to their instinct to curry favor with the powerful, or perhaps it is due to their attitude of echoing others.

Currying favor with the powerful can be said to be the instinct of most people in society. They fundamentally lack understanding of life. As long as someone gains a little success in fame or fortune, they will flatter them. Since your struggle has failed, your reputation is naturally not as prominent as that of your opponents. Therefore, for the sake of their own interests, they are bound to offer flattery. Originally, the fickleness of human relationships has been the same throughout history, but you must know that the power they curry favor with is inevitably bound to decline one day.

There are also people who, in their hearts, do not have the tendency to curry favor with the powerful, but hold an attitude of echoing others. The complex social environment has cultivated in them a habit of not being a "big shot" (?), a "yes-man" temperament. This temperament is less about being smooth and more about being cowardly. When encountering anything, they always think: "Everyone is doing it this way, so of course I will do it this way" or "Everyone tells me to do it this way, so I have no choice but to do it this way." The first viewpoint fully expresses the face of a yes-man; they have lost their own will. The second viewpoint even more reveals cowardice and incompetence.

Indeed, unconscious loneliness is unnecessary, but as long as you have clearly identified your goal, being lonely for the sake of truth is absolutely not to be feared. You certainly do not want to curry favor with the powerful like many people, nor do you want to echo others. Then, being lonely as a result of this is meaningful and valuable; and even if those who distance themselves from you to curry favor with the powerful and echo others, as long as they have not completely lost their souls, they will always admire you in their hearts.

Ibsen said in his play "An Enemy of the People": "The strongest man in the world is he who stands most alone." Don't be afraid of loneliness! As long as you always stick to the truth and constantly strive, you must firmly believe that you are always a strong person, and the final victory will surely come to your side.

### Socrates' Last Words

— Weichaifu

Socrates, the founder of Greek philosophy, gave two last words to the living in the minute before he was sentenced to die by drinking poison:

"Say it and do it. A passionate declaration alone is useless!"

"I owe Asclepius a rooster. Can you (to his friend Crito by his bedside) remember to repay this debt?"

The first sentence fully embodies his teaching of "matching words with actions." He saw through the world's tendency to say without doing, speaking grandly in front of people, but completely acting as if nothing had happened once they turned their backs. He knew that if everyone could do everything they said, the world would not be so bad.

The second sentence seems a bit humorous. At the point of death, he took owing someone a rooster so seriously, but there is truth in it.

The great philosopher's death was marked by regret for an unfinished small task. What about us ordinary people? The unfinished work is not just a rooster, right? So, ordinary people often have so much to say at the point of death that they don't know which sentence to say first. The reason is that there are too many unfinished things.

His revelation, "Say it and do it, and pay off your debts!"

### Enrich Yourself

— Zheng

How many professionals in the world are thinking day and night: how to please their superiors? So that their position can be promoted or secured. Therefore, they often try their best to exploit themselves and willingly offer flattery. At the same time, struggles and infighting often occur between colleagues.

What is the method to get promoted or keep a position? In fact, this is not difficult to do, and as long as you try your best to make yourself a capable and valuable person; so that your talent is sufficient to be competent in your position, then even if you do not diligently flatter others, they will naturally appreciate and respect you. Because all matters must be handled in an orderly and hopeful manner by a talented person. On the other hand, if one only uses flattery to obtain a superior position, but one's own talent is not competent, then later one will not only feel mentally distressed, but the result will inevitably be a day of demotion.

Therefore, a smart professional with aspirations will definitely focus his struggle on how to enrich himself.

### Being a Person

— Xiaolin

If others are one-eyed, you might as well look at their half-face. If they are deaf, don't talk to them incessantly in a loud voice. If they are mute, then don't argue with them. Everyone should build a deep and large tomb in themselves, and bury the shortcomings and faults of friends.

Your "hands" can be a little rough, dirty, and filthy, but your heart should always be spotless.

I advise you not to worry too much. There are many worries in the world that are superfluous and harmful.

### Root

— Xinbo

"And also Fan Lihua, Xi Shi, Wang Zhaojun, the Nine Heavens Mysterious Lady, Wang Baochuan..." Xue Fengchun sat on the kang and told Yougong one by one.

Yu Duzhou returned to his original position, as did Yang Zijie and Genming.

"How about this?" Yu Duzhou came up with an idea after being bothered by Yougong. "Let's write 'dead head, living tail', and only after three years can we turn back. The land price should naturally be higher."

"What do you think, Lao Gen?" Yang Zijie thought this was also a solution and looked at Genming to ask.

"Then, then, then 'dead head, living tail'," Genming replied hesitantly. In reality, he could not but agree at this point.

Yang Zijie walked to Huang Chong'an's side and spoke earnestly for a long time. Huang Chong'an shook his head at one moment and nodded at another, expressing his opinion.

"Like this, is it good?" Yang Zijie bent his waist for a long time and quickly straightened up, asking in a low voice.

"Mmm." There was only this response.

Yang Zijie hurried over, excitedly, and said to Genming, "With great difficulty, after telling Old Master Huang again and again, Old Master Huang finally agreed: 'dead head, living tail', priced at sixty-five yuan. If you still don't agree, then I won't care."

"Let's say seventy yuan," Genming was still struggling.

"No, no!"

Another stalemate of arguing over too much or too little ensued. After arguing for a long time, the result was sixty-seven yuan, during which Yang Zijie was indeed tired from going back and forth between the kang and the account table several times.

Yu Duzhou's pen rewrote on the mulberry paper, and after a moment, he wrote "Itemized as follows." Genming took out a paper package from his shirt pocket with trembling hands and opened it on the table. Yu Duzhou pressed down on each receipt in the paper package and copied in what should be copied, and then continued writing. (15)

### An Appeal for the Charitable Work of the Catholic Church

— Yao Hanbi

Recently, due to a certain opportunity, I saw: (1) The Xujiahui Sacred Heart Infant Home has more than 500 infants and children. (2) The Xujiahui Tushanwan Orphanage has more than 300 children. (3) The Nan Shi Jichang Street Nursing Home has more than 260 elderly people. (4) The Nanshi Guohuo Road Xin Pu Yu Tang has thousands of men, women, old and young. (5) The Sacred Heart Convent on Tianzhutang Street in the French Concession has more than 130 girls in a poor orphan care center. (6) The Renshan Tang Children's Clinic has fifty to sixty patients every day. (7) The Renci Hospital Clinic has one to two hundred patients every day. (8) The Renshan Infant Home has more than 40 infants. These are all charitable works of the Catholic Church in Shanghai, which are hosted by priests or nuns. Funding is a problem. Although the Poor and Sick Relief Association has recently provided some subsidies, it is difficult to sustain. Day in and day out, they have already spent most of their energy for the stomachs of many suffering people. Because of insufficient funds and inadequate food, many abandoned infants and those who are poor and sick cannot be taken in and die, and even those who have been taken in have a particularly high mortality rate due to lack of nutrition. It is truly sad to say! Even if we are not thinking of the country and the nation, for the sake of humanitarianism, we should never sit idly by and watch these many undertakings decline. We cannot but urgently make an effective appeal. I propose: (1) Please have the Social Service Department of Shen Bao initiate the establishment of a board of directors of the Shanghai Catholic Charitable Undertakings, inviting several well-known Catholic figures, such as Mr. Zhu Zhiyao, etc., to come out and call for it, with the consent of the heads of each undertaking, to govern the Catholic Charitable Undertakings. (2) Publicize the contents of each undertaking to the public, invite people from all walks of life to visit, and make practical publicity to arouse widespread sympathy. (3) Prepare a budget for unified planning and unified expenditure, and use it as material for a large-scale fundraising campaign from society. (4) Please have people from all walks of life purchase and customize the handicrafts produced by each undertaking. (5) Please have the French Concession authorities allocate a small portion of the repeatedly increased donations and taxes as effective subsidies. I firmly believe that with the large number, strong power, and firm unity of Catholics in Shanghai, if they put into practice sacrificing a small part of their material and spiritual resources for the sake of the Lord in order to arouse the sympathy of non-Catholics, then the financial difficulties of these many Catholic charitable undertakings will be easily resolved. (Editor's note: The various good deeds run by the Catholic Church in this city, such as hospitals, clinics, nurseries, Puyutang, etc., are currently feeling extremely strained. If we do not plan comprehensively as soon as possible, how can we cope with them temporarily? This newspaper has long felt the same way. I hope that enthusiastic Catholics will rise up and cooperate to jointly find a way to organize a powerful committee. The future of charitable undertakings depends on this.)
