### Editorial: On Political "Fighting Poison with Poison"

"Fighting poison with poison" was originally a term in medicine, a method of last resort for treating dangerous illnesses. When a patient is poisoned or suffers from a toxic condition, another poison is administered in the hope of achieving a cure. Of course, the physician also knows that the administered poison, if slightly mishandled, can be fatal. Therefore, several conditions must be considered: first, the nature and severity of the toxic illness must be carefully determined, and there must be no other treatment method available before administering the poison. Second, the patient's constitution must be examined to see if it can withstand the drastic measure of "fighting poison with poison." Third, it must be carefully assessed whether the administered poison is certain to counteract the original poison, and whether it will cause other reactions or side effects. Fourth, it must never be regarded as an experiment; it must be ascertained whether the original poison will be hastened to its deadly end by the administered poison. If the medicine is prescribed rashly without careful study, it will not only fail to achieve the effect of "fighting poison with poison," but may also hasten the patient's demise. Therefore, even famous doctors are unwilling to recklessly administer the treatment of "fighting poison with poison."

We believe that the medical practice of "fighting poison with poison," although a risky method, has a scientific basis in medical science, because when a poison meets a toxic illness, they produce a chemical reaction, counteracting and neutralizing each other, causing the original poison to disappear.

This medical term, this risky medical practice—"fighting poison with poison"—has also been borrowed by some in politics. Since the founding of the Republic of China, both Yuan Shikai and later Chiang Kai-shek, have used it as an experiment, but with failed results. Now, this saying is being advocated again. Perhaps the intention of those who borrow the term is to save politics from toxic illnesses, eliminate political crises, and achieve political clarity. However, politics and medicine are fundamentally two different things, especially with regard to "fighting poison with poison." In medicine, it has its scientific basis, while in politics, it has absolutely no factual basis. We know that those who advocate "fighting poison with poison" in politics are basing it on medical theory, but they are unaware that in medicine, "fighting poison with poison" works because when a poison meets a toxic illness, they produce a chemical reaction and neutralize each other, causing the toxic illness to disappear. In politics, when poison meets poison, they either combine and flow together to cause harm, or one poison lies dormant while the other rises. It is impossible for them to neutralize each other, because people and medicine are ultimately different, and people cannot produce chemical reactions. This theory is extremely clear, easy, and simple.

Therefore, in medicine, even a famous doctor would not dare to lightly administer "fighting poison with poison" without first resolving the four conditions mentioned above, lest they treat human life lightly. In politics, there is certainly no reason to abuse "fighting poison with poison." Moreover, in medicine, even if "fighting poison with poison" fails, it only results in one life being sacrificed. But in politics, the failure of "fighting poison with poison" sacrifices the masses of people, and the difference in importance is like heaven and earth. We wish to stand on the side of the masses of people and solemnly warn those who advocate "fighting poison with poison" in politics: do not use a risky method as an experiment. The failure of a few people's experiment is a small matter, but the needless sacrifice of the majority of people is a big matter.

The sole objective of normal political measures is always to stabilize the people's livelihood as the most important thing. Important political measures should also focus on preserving the people's vitality. If it is believed that toxic bacteria already exist in the political situation of a certain region, the most important thing at this moment is to investigate the cause of the toxic bacteria, use legitimate methods to quickly eliminate the toxic bacteria, and save the people from fire and water. If legitimate methods of eliminating toxic bacteria are not considered, but instead "fighting poison with poison" is adopted, the result will be one of two outcomes: first, when the two poisons meet, they will not consider old or new relationships, but only the stronger will merge with the weaker, making the poison even worse. Second, even if the old poison is eliminated, a new poison will emerge in its place. Not only that, but during the clash of the two poisons, the people's vitality, which was already greatly depleted by the corrosion of the original toxic bacteria, will suffer even more damage after another round of turmoil. This is contrary to the purpose of important political measures, which should be to preserve the people's vitality. Therefore, this kind of political measure that does not value the people, this risky method of "fighting poison with poison," will definitely not gain the trust of the masses, and will definitely not be adopted by wise and courageous politicians. As for those who misuse people and then claim to be "fighting poison with poison," we dare not blindly agree with them out of a lack of reason. We are willing to point out the gains and losses with an impassioned attitude, and strive for the benefit of the masses of people. We would rather be glared at by a few people than endure the suffering of the masses.

Everyone has strengths and weaknesses. Using a person's strengths while abandoning their weaknesses is the proper way to use people. Mistaking weaknesses for strengths, or using a person's weaknesses while burying their strengths, is the improper way to use people. Those who use people properly will succeed in their endeavors, while those who use people improperly will surely fail. This is common sense. To give an example, someone who is good at socializing and managing entertainment businesses has found their strength. Only in the entertainment industry can their strengths be brought into full play. In terms of their personal career, they can succeed. In terms of the entertainment industry itself, they can help social prosperity and provide people with leisure activities, which also has its legitimate role. However, if they are forced to abandon the entertainment industry and instead manage politics or even police administration, it would be mistaking weaknesses for strengths and burying their strengths. As a result, the individual's entertainment business will be diminished, which is a small matter. However, the inevitable failure of police administration will cause suffering to the masses of people, which is a big matter.

The country originally had a system of appointment and examination for using people in administration. Now, the examination system has not been widely implemented, so the appointment system is practically nominal. When new officials are appointed, whether their qualifications, knowledge, and experience are commensurate with their duties must be assessed with impartiality, and any improprieties must be rejected to fulfill the duties of oversight. Even if the recommender has subjective biases, they cannot pass under the objective judgment of the assessor. Therefore, we demand that government agencies at all levels fully utilize and exert the powers conferred by laws and regulations and ensure their effectiveness. Political clarity originates from the rational development of every agency. It is like a machine turning; even a single screw cannot be moved arbitrarily, lest the whole machine lose its vitality. May all political authorities at all levels share the same dedication to political clarity and strive to put it into practice. We, on behalf of the people, offer our sincere prayers and blessings!

### Nine Cities Including Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou Implement Registration of Cotton Yarn and Cloth; Establish Local Materials Investigation Committee

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): In order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, the National Government has promulgated emergency economic measures for wartime, gradually implementing control over various major commodities. Among them, rice, being essential to the people's food supply, has already been assigned a special department to be responsible for unified distribution. Among all major commodities, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are also most closely related to the people's livelihood. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area was explicitly ordered by the National Government in August of this year and actively implemented. Since its implementation, it has achieved the expected success in suppressing prices and stabilizing the people's livelihood. It is learned that the administrative authorities have also designated nine cities—Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and others—to conduct investigations and registration of cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventories outside of Shanghai. Furthermore, the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee will be officially announced on the 12th to allow for the establishment of committees to conduct thorough investigations. Chen Junhui, the Minister of Industry, specifically issued a statement yesterday, clarifying the intent and urging merchants to understand the government's earnestness in promoting wartime economic policies, truthfully apply for registration, and fulfill the fundamental objective of stabilizing the people's livelihood. The statement of Minister Chen and the organizational rules of the local materials investigation committee are published below:

Minister Chen Discusses the Significance of Registration

The Minister of Industry issued the following statement regarding the handling of cotton yarn and cotton cloth registration and investigation in major cities outside of Shanghai: The National Government, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, has had to gradually implement control over various major commodities. Among the major commodities, cotton yarn and cotton cloth are most closely related to the people's livelihood. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area has long been explicitly ordered and actively implemented. The amount of cotton yarn and cotton cloth inventory in major cities outside of Shanghai should also be thoroughly investigated. Now, the Executive Yuan has designated nine cities—Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu—to handle the registration and investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth. Regarding registration, the relevant local authorities in the above cities are actively implementing the registration rules for major commodities promulgated by the Ministry of Industry. At the beginning of the process, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants will take a wait-and-see attitude and intend to conceal information. To prevent such malpractices, the Executive Yuan has specifically promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee to allow for the establishment of committees to conduct thorough investigations. If concealment is discovered, severe penalties will be imposed in accordance with Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Major Commodities, without any leniency. It is hoped that merchants in the above cities will understand the government's earnestness in promoting wartime economic policies and promptly apply for registration truthfully. At the same time, it is hoped that the personnel handling the investigation will be considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants and handle matters impartially, so as to fulfill the fundamental objective of stabilizing the people's livelihood.

Minister Horiuchi Issues Statement

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): Japanese Minister Horiuchi recently issued a statement regarding the registration and investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth in major cities outside of Shanghai, stating that the Chinese National Government, in order to suppress prices and stabilize the people's livelihood, previously implemented registration, investigation, and purchase of cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai. This time, it has decided to implement registration of cotton yarn and cloth in nine cities, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu. This time, in addition to implementing the rules for the registration of major commodities, the Executive Yuan also promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee on October 12 by executive order to allow local authorities to establish committees to supervise and promote the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, with the aim of achieving perfection. As for the investigation committee, it is also a joint organization with Japanese committee members participating, as in Shanghai. The Japanese side will fully cooperate with the registration and investigation. In this regard, it is hoped that Japanese operators will take the lead in setting an example of fair registration and obey the investigation, so that the economic control under the Greater East Asia War can be perfected.

### Central Government Commemorates National Day; Chairman Wang's Address

Nanjing, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch): Today is the National Day of the 32nd year of the Republic of China.

Berlin, 10th (Central News Agency dispatch): German President Hitler sent a telegram to Chairman Wang of the National Government of our country to offer congratulations on the 10th, the first National Day commemoration since our country joined the war.

### Economy Strengthened After Materials Control

Nanjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The National Government previously established a materials investigation committee to investigate hoarding. It has thoroughly investigated and dealt with the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants in Shanghai, and the results have been quite significant. In particular, after the investigation of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, which are closely related to the people's livelihood, strict control has been implemented, allowing supply and demand to be balanced, which has greatly benefited the implementation of wartime economic policies. However, it is difficult to establish an entire wartime economic system by implementing this control policy only in the Shanghai area. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has re-promulgated the organizational rules for the local materials investigation committee, which will take effect immediately to conduct thorough investigations, aiming to obtain clear quantities of the storage of major materials in various important cities.

### Third Germany-Manchukuo Economic Agreement

Formally Signed Yesterday Afternoon

Xinjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The third agreement between Manchukuo and Germany was formally signed by representatives of the two countries at the Manchukuo Ministry of Foreign Affairs at 11:00 AM on the 11th, and a joint statement was issued. The agreement is effective from the date of signing. From now on, the friendly commercial relations between Manchukuo and Germany will become closer.

Xinjing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): Volkhart, the head of the German economic mission to Manchukuo, along with Rosendell, the general manager of the German East Asia Bank, went to Jilin on the morning of the 10th. They are scheduled to inspect the Songhua River Fengman Power Plant before leaving Xinjing on the 12th.

To implement a comprehensive system of control. After the implementation of these systematic policies, the wartime national economic system will inevitably become more consolidated, and the people's lives will gradually stabilize. This will make the national strength more solid, and there is no doubt that it will be able to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and establish the co-prosperity of the entire East Asia. However, based on past experience, a small number of merchants may disregard these policies and neglect national laws for the sake of personal gain. It is hoped that the authorities will not be lenient and will severely punish them, so that the cunning and stubborn will be restrained, and the establishment of the wartime economic system will be achieved as soon as possible, which is what the entire nation hopes for.

### Japanese Army in North China Operates Smoothly; Many Communist Strongholds in Western Hebei Swept Away

Beijing, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army in North China believes that the Communists are an obstacle to the construction of North China, so they frequently suppress them. Since mid-September, they have launched autumn anti-communist warfare in various parts of North China. The operation is progressing very smoothly, and as of the 5th of this month, great results have been achieved. It is estimated that over 13,300 Communist troops have been killed or captured, and the Japanese army is currently engaged in a fierce attack. According to the North China Japanese Army authorities, the results of the battle were announced at 4:00 PM on the 11th as follows: 347 Communist facilities have been destroyed, including munitions factories, landmine factories, munitions warehouses, clothing factories, flour mills, grain depots, printing presses, and barracks. 8,757 Communist corpses were left behind, and 4,517 people were captured. The Japanese army captured one mountain gun, 85 machine guns, 30 grenade launchers, 11 mortars, 5641 rifles, 732 pistols and rifles, 265,418 hand grenades, 3,660 landmines, and a large amount of other ammunition, communication equipment, clothing, and grain.

A Certain Base on the Western Hebei Front Line, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): In order to completely destroy the Communist army of the Western Hebei Military Region under Nie Rongzhen, a certain unit of the Japanese army launched a swift attack. Starting from a certain location in the south, they crossed Jianling on September 17, passed through Daomaguan on the 19th, and broke through the landmine field laid by the bandits. On the 24th, they invaded Weizhuang. Another unit advanced westward from Yinfang on the 19th, joined forces at Daomaguan, and approached the First Military Sub-district Headquarters of the bandits on Shenxiandao. Another elite unit of the Japanese army moved out from a certain location on the 16th and 19th, respectively, and swept away the bandits in the Shangzhai and Tianbaidao areas before approaching Shenxiandao, completing the encirclement. They responded to each other and began a fierce attack. The Communists resisted stubbornly, but under the brave and fierce attack of the Japanese army, they were defeated. The Japanese army took the opportunity to break into the Shenxiandao Communist military base on the 24th, annihilating them and thoroughly destroying the military facilities scattered in the area. The objective of the Japanese army has been achieved, and they have turned their sharp edge to vigorously sweep away the First and Second Military Sub-districts of the Communist Western Hebei Military Region and the Yanbei Command. The operation is currently continuing. Furthermore, other units of the Japanese army, in close collaboration with neighboring units, launched a fierce attack on the bandits of the Third Military Region in the east and west of Pingyang (about 16 kilometers west of Lingshanzhen) on the 28th, breaking through the center of the bandits. Another unit of the Japanese army relocated to the west, destroying the bandits in Sasakuramura (about 50 kilometers northwest of Lingshanzhen). Another unit seized the mountain top area on the left bank of the Nianyang River on October 1. Another unit pursued the Fifth Regiment of the bandits lurking in Wanli (15 kilometers west of Chenhua) and its vicinity. Another unit drove away part of the bandits in Liuyuan Village (5 kilometers north of Chenzhuang) at dawn on September 17 and broke into Nanmobacun, 7 kilometers northwest of Chenzhuang. On the other hand, a certain new elite unit of the Japanese army suddenly moved out from the Jinghan Railway line. On September 17, they broke through the mountain chain and launched encirclements everywhere northwest of Koutouzhen (20 kilometers northwest of Xingtai). Several units searched for the 35th Regiment of the bandits in the upper reaches of the Wenbu River. In early September, they captured the bandits near Wendu (about 7 kilometers west of Guosu), Beiping (11 kilometers west of Guosu) and destroyed their facilities.

Purge Near Hankou

Hankou, 11th (Central News Agency dispatch): The Japanese army in Hankou conducted a purge of the Chongqing army near the area last week, achieving great results. The details are as follows: (A) The Japanese army unit in the Yuehan area of Pubei fought with the First Detachment of the Chongqing army's vanguard force for about two hours near the 20-kilometer north area of Pubei on the 5th evening. The Chongqing army was defeated and fled towards the north. In this battle, the Chongqing side abandoned about 70 bodies. (B) On the Xinyang front, the Japanese army made a surprise attack and broke into the 521st Regiment of the 170th Division of the Chongqing army in Maitangdian (24 kilometers southeast of Xinyang) at dawn on the 9th and attacked them. In this battle, the Chongqing army left behind 63 corpses. (C) On the Yichang front, the Japanese army in Zhanlaobei (18 kilometers southeast of Yichang) attacked the bandit base of Zou Shu, who was active near Tumenwu (10 kilometers west of Zhanlaobei). In addition to capturing the bandit Zou, they also eliminated the bandits entrenched in the area.

### Japanese Planes Attack Finschhafen, Achieving Great Results; Torobrian Islands Bombed

Central News Agency from a certain base in the South Pacific, 11th: Five Japanese army planes attacked Finschhafen at 6:00 PM on the 10th. The first plane, at approximately 6:00 PM east of Krestler on the sea, discovered seven or eight enemy boats sailing, and immediately bombed them. Three were sunk, two caught fire, and the rest suffered heavy damage. The second plane, at 6:10 PM, bombed an enemy encampment near Finschhafen, causing two large fires. The third plane, at 6:20 PM, heavily bombed an enemy anti-aircraft artillery position near Finschhafen, hitting one and setting it ablaze. The fourth plane, from 6:20 PM to 6:50 PM, bombed an enemy supply depot near Finschhafen, hitting one and causing an explosion. Also, three enemy boats were found heading north east of Ant Point and were bombed. The fifth plane bombed a supply depot near Ant Point, inflicting heavy damage. Other Japanese planes observed the aforementioned supply depot receiving intense anti-aircraft fire from enemy ground forces. That plane has not yet returned to base, while the other four planes safely returned.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 11th: A dispatch from a certain Japanese naval base in the South Pacific states: Japanese naval air squadrons have carried out a series of night and day raids on the Troberiand Islands, Kiriwina Island, and Woodlark Island, braving heavy enemy anti-aircraft fire and scoring numerous direct hits. One position on Kiriwina Island was set ablaze. All Japanese planes returned safely. Following this, on the night of the 9th, another attack was launched on Buna and the Troberiand Islands. The enemy airfield at Buna was bombed, causing five fires, two of which exploded. Two other military supply depots also exploded and caught fire. All Japanese planes returned safely.

### Soong Tzu-wen Arrives in India

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 10th: Soong Tzu-wen arrived in New Delhi on Saturday from the United States.

### Three-Nation Conference Scheduled for Next Week

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th: The German News Agency quoted the "Stockholm Daily News" London correspondent as saying: Newspaper commentators are paying attention to the long awaited three-nation conference, which may be held in Moscow on the 17th of this month and will close at the end of this month. The Soviet Union will gain a psychological advantage because the meeting is held on Soviet territory.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 11th: Haitong News: A Swedish newspaper's London correspondent published an article reviewing the upcoming Moscow conference, stating in brief: British and American personnel believe that Britain and America may accept Soviet demands. The British Observer believes that Britain, America, and the Soviet Union are likely to establish a common policy, and even the Polish question can be resolved. London understands that the Soviet Union is in an advantageous psychological position because the meeting place is filled with a joyful atmosphere of victory. However, it is hoped that the Soviet Union understands the benefits of a united front against Germany. A Swedish newspaper correspondent in New York even predicted that the United States will make complete concessions, because informed American sources believe that surprising events may occur in Moscow and that there will no longer be disagreements regarding measures necessary for the security of each country. The issue of security will be of paramount importance at the Moscow conference. Countries reject Soviet territorial demands, but the United States is willing to abandon its opinions in order to achieve complete understanding with the Soviet Union. Although the United States wants to protect Finland and the Baltic states, the division of borders may emphasize practicality over ideals and give more consideration to military needs than to the rights of ethnic minorities.

### American Planes Indiscriminately Bomb Haiphong; Fierce Air Battles; Two Enemy Planes Shot Down Outside Rangoon

Central News Agency, Hanoi, 11th: The air raids on southern areas of Vietnam by the American air force stationed in China have intensified since the 10th.

Due to being fiercely attacked by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery, they fled towards Ha Giang at 2:00 PM. The Japanese military suffered minor damage, but the streets of Haiphong were bombed, causing considerable damage.

Central News Agency, Rangoon, 11th: Two enemy planes came to the vicinity of Mingaladon, outside Rangoon, in the middle of the night on the 9th. They were intercepted by Japanese anti-aircraft artillery and completely shot down. The Japanese side suffered no damage.

### The European War and the Balkan States (3)

Romania

If one says that the strategic objective of the anti-Axis powers in the Balkans is Bulgaria, then the first country targeted for military attack by the enemy is Romania.

In light of Italy's surrender, many people speculate that today the United States and Britain will launch a landing operation on the Dalmatian coast, clearly coveting the Romanian oil fields. According to the views of the United States and Britain, in order to weaken Germany's ability to resist, it is necessary to seize any one of the three areas: the Ruhr industrial zone, southern Silesia, and the Romanian oil fields. In short, Romania's contribution to the German war economy is highly valued. Therefore, the Anglo-American air force dared to use large formations of 150 to 200 planes, flying back and forth 2,400 miles, to carry out the quite difficult Ploiesti bombing. It is said that the Anglo-American air force lost 56 planes at that time, about one-third of the total number of attacking aircraft. This illustrates how difficult it is to bomb the Romanian oil field area from current Anglo-American air bases.

Romania's Diplomacy

We should still remember that after the start of the European war, a fierce diplomatic battle was waged centered on these Romanian oil fields. In November 1939, the German-Romanian trade agreement was established, and Britain supplied Romania with aircraft to counter it.

In 1940, the Romanian government established a Petroleum Control Commission to control the oil produced. Britain and France issued warnings to the Romanian government not to supply oil from British and French companies to Germany, and cooperation between Germany and Romania gradually became closer.

At the end of June, the Soviet Union entered Bessarabia. Romania lost 17% of its territory and 3.5 million people.

On July 10, Romania clarified its attitude of cooperation with the Axis powers, issuing a notice denying the British and French declaration of April 10, 1939, regarding the guarantee of Romania. Afterwards, due to territorial issues, the domestic situation in Romania showed slight fluctuations. On September 6, Germany and Italy instructed Antonescu to demand that King Carol, who had pro-British and French leanings, abdicate, and Crown Prince Michael I ascended the throne. At the same time, the Antonescu cabinet was formed, and the great power of Romanian rule was entirely entrusted to General Antonescu. The king acknowledged by decree that Romania was a national and royal country of the Iron Guard.

The Romanian nationalistic system was thus completed. The opposing Communist Party launched demonstrations in Constanta, Bucharest, and other places. 100,000 German troops entered Romania to protect the oil resources. At this time, General Antonescu declared: "The entry of German troops is based on the request of the Romanian government, with the aim of rebuilding the Romanian army." The German side also announced that it would follow Romania's wishes, dispatch a military mission, and send a flying squadron to protect the country's oil fields.

The direct cause of the aforementioned major changes in Romania was the second territorial cession following the cession of Bessarabia. That is, according to the Vienna Award of Germany and Italy, Outer Transylvania was ceded to Hungary (August 30), and Southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria. Due to these three territorial cessions, Romania lost nearly 40,000 square miles of territory and 4 million people.

However, General Antonescu's dictatorial regime smoothly overcame the domestic crisis. By promoting a policy of cooperation with Germany, the country was politically and economically stabilized. In November of the same year, it signed the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy, becoming a member of the Axis powers. The following year, on February 10, Anglo-Romanian relations were severed.

In June, the German-Soviet war broke out. Filled with the long-standing hatred of seizing Bessarabia, Romania gladly participated in the war against the Soviet Union, attacking Ukraine together with the German army. In addition to recapturing Bessarabia and Bukovina, it also occupied Odessa and the area up to the Dniester River, which was called Transnistria. Afterwards, the Romanian army continued to actively cooperate with the German army, fighting hard in Stalingrad. In the battles this summer, they withdrew from the Eastern Front to defend the Balkans.

Industry and Trade

Romania is the country with the most abundant resources among the Balkan states. About 70% of the residents are engaged in agriculture, making it a major agricultural country among the Danube countries. The main industry is petroleum. Before the war, it produced 8.7 million tons, ranking fourth in the world. Even now, it is said to produce as much as 6 million tons. Most of it is transported to Germany, making a great contribution to Germany's war effort.

In terms of trade, oil and grain account for an overwhelming proportion, making the country's trade a surplus. After the start of the European war, Germany's position as an exporting country greatly increased. In 1940, Greater Germany, including Czechoslovakia, accounted for 64.3% of the total in terms of imports and 49.3% in terms of exports. Recent statistics are unavailable, but trade with Germany has naturally increased further since breaking off relations with the anti-Axis powers.

Hungary

Since March 1920, when Admiral Miklós Horthy, the hero who overthrew the Bela Kun Red regime, was elected as regent by the National Assembly, he has consistently guided Hungary. His domestic situation has been closely integrated with the cooperation of Nazi Germany. Hungary declared itself the Kingdom of Hungary in 1921, but the throne was vacant. Regent Horthy became the dictator of Hungary, entrusted with full political power. Furthermore, according to the law of 1937, Regent Horthy was not responsible to the parliament. In February 1942, Nicholas Horthy resigned as regent due to old age, and his son Stephen Horthy served as regent's representative, but Stephen Horthy was killed while inspecting the German-Soviet war front, and old Horthy reassumed the regency.

Hungary is the country that had to endure the greatest sacrifices after the failure of the previous World War. Due to the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920, 70% of its territory and 63% of its population were forcibly divided among neighboring countries. The lost population included 460,000 people in Yugoslavia, 1 million in Czechoslovakia, and 1.6 million in Romania. Hungary attempted to restore this lost territory at every opportunity. Since the establishment of the Nazi regime, Germany has supported Hungary's demands and formed close diplomatic relations with it.

However, Hungary's long-standing desire to restore its lost territory was not achieved until the Munich Conference in October 1938. On November 2, the German and Italian foreign ministers held the Vienna Conference, which restored 4,200 square miles of territory in Czechia, with 700,000 Hungarians, 100,000 Slovaks, and 90,000 Ruthenians coming under its rule.

Hungary's second opportunity to recover lost territory came in June 1940, when the Soviet Union entered Bessarabia and pursued Romania. At this time, Hungary carried out large-scale preparatory mobilization on the Romanian border. Conflicts occurred between the Hungarian and Romanian armies. At the German-Italian-Hungarian talks on July 10, Hungary fulfilled its demand to recover lost territory in Romania. It was formally decided at the four-nation talks of Germany, Italy, Hungary, and Romania. As a result, Hungary recovered the northern half of Outer Transylvania, which it had lost in the Treaty of Trianon, from Romania.

On November 20 of the same year, Hungary signed the Tripartite Pact of Japan, Germany, and Italy, legally confirming Hungary's attitude of cooperating with the Axis powers.

In February 1941, Hungary's third opportunity to recover lost territory came again. When Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia, Hungary advanced into the territory ceded to Yugoslavia in the Treaty of Trianon, gaining the triangular area between the Tisza and Danube rivers.

In this way, Hungary has been able to gradually restore the lost territory of the Treaty of Trianon through cooperation with Germany, so it is more pro-German than other Balkan countries. Recently, the indefinite postponement of the Diet session due to the anti-government attitude of the first party of Imre is also intended to further strengthen Hungary's current policy of cooperation with Germany.

Economic Cooperation with Germany

Dividing the small countries of Europe according to the Treaty of Versailles ignores the capitalist economic requirement for a wider trading area. The national economies of the small European countries, isolated by various customs barriers, are on the verge of crisis. Hungary is no exception, resulting in an unstable economy. However, thanks to the realistic financial policies of the Gömbös cabinet, it acquired Ruthenia, increasing its territory and population. In addition, the economic cooperation policy with Germany has revived Hungary. The outbreak of the European war in September 1939 caused grain prices to rise, creating a favorable base for Hungary.

However, the progress of the European war severed Hungary's relations with Britain and France, and the Hungarian economy became completely dependent on Germany. At the same time, restrictions were placed on the participation of Jews, who had traditionally dominated industry and commerce, in enterprises, so German capital was also given the opportunity to comprehensively enter enterprises. At the German-Hungarian Economic Agreement Council held in the last sentence of July 1941, Hungary's agriculture and consumer goods industry developed jointly by the two countries. It sought to exchange Hungarian light industrial products for German heavy industrial products. Furthermore, in the financial sector, it concluded an agreement with Germany to implement centralized economic calculations, whereby payments and settlements with Germany-dominated European countries were implemented through Berlin.

### Major German-American Air Battle on the Baltic Coast; Main Force of German Warships Concentrated in Gdynia

Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: A squadron of U.S. Eighth Air Force bombers launched a large-scale air raid on the port of Gdynia on the Baltic coast at noon on the 9th. After receiving the news, the German fighter squadron immediately flew to intercept, and a fierce battle lasting several hours unfolded in the high altitude from Gotland to the Bay of Danzig. German Messerschmitt fighters shot down four U.S. bombers in just nine minutes after the engagement. Furthermore, when the U.S. Air Force approached the coastal area, German ground anti-aircraft artillery also fired in unison. As a result, 62 U.S. four-engine bombers were shot down. Assuming an average of ten crew members per plane, it can be seen that the U.S. military lost more than 600 pilots. It is generally believed that the U.S. military's long-range bombing of the Baltic coast was due to learning that the main force of the German fleet had gathered in the direction of the port of Gdynia. However, thanks to the brave interception by the German army, only the city streets and citizens of Anklam and Gotenhafen suffered minor damage. During the air battle, the German side also lost 11 fighters.

### Fierce German-Soviet Battles on the Plains of the Dnieper River; Unsettled Situation on the Southern Front

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 10th: German and Soviet armies are engaged in fierce battles on the plains of Ukraine along the Dnieper River. The city of Kyiv is in imminent danger. It has been over two years since the elite troops under the command of Field Marshal Walther von Reichenau occupied the city on September 19, 1941, and raised the banner. Now the city is about to be engulfed in war again. Kyiv is located on the western bank of the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, on hills as high as 100 meters to as low as 30 meters, offering a panoramic view of the Ukrainian plains, with beautiful scenery. It is the oldest city in Russia, built by the Scythians before the Christian era, and the birthplace of Prince Vladimir. Around 882 AD, it was once the capital of the Russian Empire. There are many ancient ruins, the most famous of which is the Great Church of Saint Vladimir, built by Saint Vladimir the Great on the bank of the river. At the end of the 10th century, Saint Vladimir the Great converted the country to Greek Orthodoxy, so the city became the center of Russian religion. From the great fire of 1240, which burned more than 600 temples, one can imagine the grandeur of the time. Even today, there are still more than 80 Greek Orthodox temples in the city. Kyiv was occupied by Grand Duke Andrei Bogolyubsky in 1169, invaded by the Mongols in 1240, occupied by the Lithuanians in 1320, and once became Polish territory in 1567. Only after 1654 did it return to Russia. In modern times, Kyiv has become a modern city and is the intersection of the Moscow-Odessa-Kharkiv highway, making transportation very convenient. Before the war, the population was about 850,000. The city has universities, museums, opera houses, and other facilities. It is truly the center of culture in southern Russia. Since ancient times, it has been a distribution center for timber, grain, and leather. In recent years, factories manufacturing refined sugar and machinery have been the most prosperous.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: According to a Haitong News report: After launching an offensive between the Sea of Azov and Melitopol on Saturday, the Soviet army launched an attack on the German bridgehead at Zaporozhye on Sunday. The enemy first bombarded with artillery, and the German artillery retaliated. According to news last night, the Soviet army's attacks on the strengthened German lines at Melitopol were repelled everywhere. Only one point was penetrated by the Soviet army, but it was surrounded by the German army, and the German lines at Melitopol remained intact. The situation between Melitopol and Zaporozhye is unstable. Newly arrived German forces captured a hill fought over by both sides and attacked the enemy behind the hill. In the middle reaches of the Dnieper River, the Soviet army is still trying to cross the river to establish a bridgehead on the west bank and expand the bridgeheads already established, but all attempts have been thwarted by concentrated German artillery fire. German counterattacks on the Pripet River continue to make progress, especially south of Chernobyl, where they have advanced significantly eastward.

Fierce Fighting Continues in the Nevel Area

Central News Agency, Berlin, 11th: German News Agency: The focus of the Eastern Front war continues to be concentrated in the swampy area south of Velikiye Luki. A great pincer movement was carried out in this area in 1941. At that time, Timoshenko's forces suffered their greatest defeat. This time, the Soviet army plans to expand the gap it broke through in the German lines a few days ago, regardless of heavy losses. However, German light infantry have built strong fortifications on the flanks and a short distance from the breakthrough, preventing the Soviet army from passing through. There has been fighting all day on the northeast side of the Nevel bend. In order to resist the pressure of the Soviet army, the German army withdrew to a new position on the night of the 10th. However, the position was recaptured due to another German attack and fierce fighting is still ongoing.

End of Fighting on the Taman Peninsula

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Since February of this year, the German army has firmly defended the Kuban bridgehead, repelling the stubborn offensive of the Soviet forces for more than nine months, allowing the German army in other theaters to operate smoothly.

### German Troops in Eastern Italy Retreat Northwest; Landing Anti-Axis Forces Attacked

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th: Anti-Axis forces landed a strong force in Termoli in eastern Italy under the cover of cruisers and destroyers. The German army engaged them and has retreated northwest.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 10th

According to a Haitong News report: It took the main force on the left flank of the U.S. Fifth Army five days to reach the Volturno River after the Anti-Axis forces occupied Naples, which shows the slow progress of the enemy army and the smooth resistance of the German army. Although the enemy army has reached Capua on the riverbank, it is still only engaged in local probing battles and has not built any bridgeheads on the north bank. East of Capua in the Apennine Mountains, attacks by the Axis forces were also repelled. In the center, south of Port d'Olfo, north of Caserta, the U.S. Fifth Army has intensified its efforts, but must increase resistance. In the eastern region, a large number of enemy troops landed under the cover of several warships, and the bridgehead northwest of Termoli was expanded. The German army's left flank has retreated slightly, but apart from heavy artillery bombardments, the enemy army has not made any progress. The British Eighth Army suffered heavy losses in the battle on the line between [unclear] and [unclear]. In general, although the enemy army is intensifying its activities on the southern Italian front, there is no sign that a major battle has already begun.

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Registration Implemented in Nine Cities Including Nanjing, Suzhou, and Hangzhou; Local Materials Investigation Committees Organized

Nanjing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, the National Government has promulgated emergency economic policies for wartime and is gradually implementing control over various major commodities. Among these, rice is essential for people's sustenance, so a special department was established early on to take charge of unified allocation and supply. Cotton yarn and cloth are also closely related to people's livelihoods among major commodities. Therefore, the control of these commodities in the Shanghai area has been actively implemented since mid-August of this year under the clear orders of the National Government. Since its implementation, it has achieved the expected success in suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods. It is now known that in order to ascertain the quantity of cotton yarn and cloth in major cities other than Shanghai, the Executive Yuan has designated nine cities, including Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, and Bengbu, to conduct investigation and registration. The organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee were officially announced on the 12th to facilitate the separate establishment of committees for strict investigation. Minister of Industry Chen Junpu specially emphasized the government's intentions and hoped that merchants and civilians would appreciate the government's sincere efforts to implement wartime economic policies and promptly and truthfully declare their registration, so as to achieve the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods. The following are Minister Chen's remarks and the organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee:

Minister Chen Discusses the Significance of Registration

Minister of Industry Chen made the following remarks regarding the handling of cotton yarn and cloth registration and investigation in major cities other than Shanghai: The National Government, in order to suppress commodity prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, has had no choice but to gradually implement control over various major commodities. Among the major commodities, cotton yarn and cloth are most closely related to people's livelihoods. Therefore, the control of these two commodities in the Shanghai area has long been clearly ordered for active implementation. The quantity of cotton yarn and cloth in major cities other than Shanghai should also be continuously investigated and clarified. The Executive Yuan has now designated nine cities, including Nanjing, Zhenjiang, Jiangyin, Nantong, Wuxi, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu, to handle cotton yarn and cloth registration and investigation. The registration is being actively handled by the responsible government agencies in the aforementioned locations in accordance with the Ministry of Industry's regulations for the registration of major commodities. At the beginning of the implementation, it is inevitable that a small number of merchants and civilians will adopt a wait-and-see attitude and intentionally conceal information. In order to prevent such malpractices, the Executive Yuan has specially announced the organizational regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee to facilitate the separate establishment of committees for strict investigation. If concealment is discovered, severe punishment will be imposed in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Regulations for Punishing Hoarding of Essential Commodities, without any leniency. It is hoped that the merchants and civilians in the aforementioned locations will appreciate the government's sincere efforts to promote wartime economic strategies and promptly and truthfully apply for registration. At the same time, it is hoped that those handling the investigation will be considerate of the difficulties faced by merchants and handle matters impartially, so as to fulfill the fundamental purpose of stabilizing people's livelihoods.

As with Shanghai, Japanese members will participate in the investigation committee, which is a joint organization. The Japanese side will fully cooperate with the registration and investigation.

### Central Government Sells National Day Commemorative Items; Chairman Wang Issues Instructions

Nanjing, October 10th, Central News Agency Dispatch: Today is the National Day of the Republic of China, the 32nd year. The entire nation, in light of the National Government's participation in the war, the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights by friendly nations, and the completion of independence, as well as the establishment of a solid foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, is celebrating this National Day with encouragement and joy. In addition to universally displaying flags to commemorate the occasion, celebrations are also being held separately in various locations. At 9:00 AM this morning, the central government held a grand celebration ceremony in the National Government Auditorium. Chairman Wang and the heads of various ministries, departments, and offices attended. Civilian officials wore new national formal attire or blue gowns, while military officials were fully armed. At 9:00 AM sharp, the solemn ceremony began amidst resounding music. The heads of the various ministries took their seats, the Chairman took his place, and the rituals were performed as prescribed.

### Economy Strengthens After Material Control

Nanjing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to investigate the hoarding of materials, the National Government established the Materials Investigation Committee. It has strictly investigated and handled the illegal hoarding of large quantities of major materials by merchants and civilians in Shanghai, with significant results. In particular, after the investigation of cotton yarn and cloth, which are closely related to people's livelihoods, strict controls were implemented, allowing supply and demand to be smoothly balanced, which greatly benefited wartime economic policies. However, it is difficult to establish an overall wartime economic system if only the Shanghai area implements this control policy. Therefore, the Executive Yuan has promulgated the Organizational Regulations for the Local Materials Investigation Committee, which will immediately begin strict investigations separately to ensure that the storage of major materials in important cities is accurately quantified in order to implement thorough control. It is widely believed that after the concrete implementation of this system, the wartime national economic system will be further strengthened, and the lives of the people will gradually stabilize. Thus, the national strength will become stronger. There is no doubt that it will be able to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War and establishing the co-prosperity of East Asia as a whole. However, based on past experience, some merchants and civilians may underestimate this policy, focusing only on their own selfish interests and disregarding national laws and regulations. It is hoped that the authorities will not be lenient and will severely punish them, so that the cunning and stubborn will disappear. The establishment of a wartime economic system and the early realization of its success are what the people desire.

### Japanese Army in North China Operates Very Smoothly; Many Guerrilla Bases in Western Hebei Swept Away

Beijing, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Japanese army in North China believes that the Communist bandits are an obstacle to the construction of North China. Therefore, they often carry out suppression operations against them. Since mid-September, they have launched autumn anti-communist battles in various parts of North China. The operations are progressing very smoothly. As of the 5th of this month, they have achieved great results. They have killed and captured more than 13,300 communist soldiers. The Japanese army is currently engaged in a fierce offensive. According to the announcement of the results of the war released by the Japanese army authorities in North China at 4:00 PM on the 11th, 347 communist facilities were destroyed, including munitions factories, mine factories, munitions warehouses, clothing factories, flour mills, granaries, printing houses, and barracks. 8,757 communist corpses were counted, and 4,517 people were captured. The Japanese army seized a mountain gun, 85 machine guns, 30 grenade launchers, 11 mortars, 5641 rifles, 732 handguns and rifles, 265,418 hand grenades, 3,660 landmines, and a large amount of other ammunition, communication equipment, clothing, and food.

A Certain Base on the Western Hebei Front, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to thoroughly destroy the Communist army of the Western Hebei Military Region under Nie Rongzhen, the Japanese army launched a vigorous offensive. One unit marched south from a certain place, crossed Chajian Ridge on September 17th, passed Daomaguan on the 19th, broke through the landmine zone laid by the bandits, and advanced on Mazhuang on the 21st. Another unit advanced west from Yinfang on the 19th and met at Daomaguan before approaching the headquarters of the First Military Sub-District of the bandits at Shenxiandao. Another elite Japanese unit, departing from a certain place on the 16th and 19th, swept away the bandits in the Shangzan Township and Tianbaidao area and forced their way to Shenxiandao, completing the encirclement. Responding to each other, they began a fierce offensive. The Communist bandits resisted stubbornly but were ultimately defeated under the brave and fierce offensive of the Japanese army. The Japanese army then took the opportunity to break into the Shenxiandao Communist base on the 24th, annihilating it and thoroughly destroying the military facilities scattered in the area. Having achieved their objectives, the Japanese army turned its sharp edge to conduct a fierce sweep of the First and Second Military Sub-Districts of the Communist Hebei Military Region and the Yanbei Command. It is currently ongoing. Furthermore, other Japanese units, in close coordination with neighboring units, launched a fierce offensive on the 28th against the bandits of the Third Military Sub-District east and west of Pingyang (approximately 16 kilometers west of Lingqiu Town), breaking through the center of the bandit forces. Another Japanese unit moved to the west and defeated the bandits in Cangcun (approximately 50 kilometers northwest of Hengshan Town).

### Three-Nation Conference Scheduled for Next Week

Stockholm, Sweden, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The German News Agency, quoting a London dispatch from the Stockholm Daily News, said that the Three-Nation Conference, which has been discussed for many days, may be held in Moscow on the 17th of this month and will close at the end of this month. The Soviet Union will gain a psychological advantage because the conference will be held on Soviet territory.

Stockholm, Sweden, October 11th, Central News Agency Dispatch: The Reuters dispatch: A Swedish newspaper reporter stationed in London published an article reviewing the future Moscow conference, stating briefly that British and American personnel believe that Britain and the United States may accept the demands of the Soviet Union. The British Observer believes that there is a good possibility that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, will establish a common policy, and the Polish question can also be resolved. London understands that the Soviet Union is in an advantageous psychological position because the location of the conference is filled with the joyful atmosphere of victory. However, it is hoped that the Soviet Union will understand the interests of the common front against Germany. A Swedish newspaper reporter stationed in New York even predicted that the United States would make complete concessions, because well-informed people in the United States believe that a surprising event may occur in Moscow. There is no longer disagreement on the measures necessary for the security of various countries. The security issue will be in a very important position at the Moscow conference. Various countries rejected the Soviet Union's territorial demands, but the United States is willing to abandon its views in order to achieve complete understanding with the Soviet Union. Although the United States wants to assist Finland and the Baltic countries, the division of borders may emphasize reality over ideals, and the consideration of annual needs may outweigh the consideration of the rights of small and respected nations.

### Baltic Sea German-American Air Battle

German Fleet Main Force Concentrates in Gdynia

Berlin, November 11th, Central News Agency: The U.S. Eighth Air Force bomber squadron launched a large-scale air raid on the port of Gdynia on the Baltic coast on the 9th. After receiving the news, the German fighter squadron immediately flew to intercept them, resulting in a fierce battle that lasted for several hours in the high altitude from Gotland to the Bay of Danzig.  The German Messerschmitts shot down four U.S. bombers within just nine minutes of engagement. Furthermore, as the U.S. Air Force approached the coastal area, German ground anti-aircraft artillery units also unleashed a barrage of shells, resulting in the downing of sixty-two U.S. four-engine bombers.  With an average of ten crew members per aircraft, it is estimated that the U.S. military suffered casualties of over six hundred airmen.  It is generally believed that the U.S. military's long-range bombing of the Baltic coast was likely due to information that the main force of the German fleet had concentrated in the Gdynia port area. However, thanks to the courageous interception by the German forces, only the city streets and residents of Angermünde and Gotenhafen suffered minor damage. In the air battle, the German side also lost twelve fighter planes.

### The European War and the Balkan States (3)

Romania

If it is said that the strategic goal of the anti-Axis countries in the Balkans is Bulgaria, then the primary target of the enemy's military attacks is Romania.

Given Italy's surrender, many observers believe that the Anglo-Americans will launch an amphibious landing in the Dalmatian Sea. This is naturally aimed at the Romanian oil fields. From the Anglo-American perspective, in order to weaken Germany's war effort, it is necessary to seize any of the following three areas: the Ruhr industrial area, southern Silesia, and the Romanian oil fields. In short, Romania's role in the German war economy is highly valued. Therefore, the Anglo-American air force dares to use large formations of 150 to 200 aircraft, flying back and forth 2,400 miles to carry out difficult bombing runs. It is said that the Anglo-American air force has lost 56 aircraft, approximately one-third of the total number of aircraft that attacked. This demonstrates how difficult it is to bomb the Romanian oil field region from the current Anglo-American airbases.

Romanian Diplomacy

One Week After the Start of the European War

We should remember the intense diplomatic war that revolved around these Romanian oil fields. In November 1939, the German-Romanian trade agreement was concluded, and Britain supplied Romania with aircraft to counter it.

In 1940, the Romanian government established a Petroleum Control Commission to control the oil produced. The British and French warned the Romanian government not to supply German with oil from British and French affiliated companies, and the cooperation between Germany and Romania gradually became closer.

At the end of June, the Soviet Union moved into Bessarabia, and Romania lost 17% of its territory, with a population of 3.5 million, in Prahova.

On July 10, Romania clarified its cooperative attitude toward the Axis powers and issued a notice denying the Anglo-French declaration of April 10, 1939 regarding the guarantee of Romania's integrity. Subsequently, due to territorial issues, Romania's domestic situation showed signs of instability. On September 6, the Germans and Italians instructed Antonescu to demand the abdication of King Carol, who had pro-British and pro-French leanings, and Crown Prince Michael I ascended the throne. At the same time, the Antonescu cabinet was formed, and the great power of Romanian rule was delegated to General Antonescu. The king recognized Romania as a national democratic state of the Iron Guard by edict.

The Romanian nationalist system was thus completed. The opposition Communist Party launched demonstrations in Constanta, Bucharest, and other places. 100,000 German troops moved into Romania to protect oil resources. At this time, General Antonescu declared that the German troops' entry was based on the Romanian government's request and was for the purpose of rebuilding the Romanian army. The German side also announced that it would dispatch a military mission in accordance with Romania's wishes and send a flight squadron to protect the country's oil fields.

The direct cause of the above-mentioned great change in Romania was the second territorial seizure following the seizure of Bessarabia. That is, according to the Vienna Award by Germany and Italy, Outer Transylvania was ceded to Hungary (August 30), and Southern Dobruja was ceded to Bulgaria. Due to these three territorial cessions, Romania lost nearly 40,000 square miles of territory and a population of 4 million.

However, General Antonescu's autocratic regime smoothly overcame the domestic turmoil. Due to the promotion of a policy of cooperation with Germany, the country became stable politically and economically. In November of the same year, it signed the Tripartite Pact joining Japan, Germany, and Italy, becoming a member of the Axis powers. On February 10 of the following year, Anglo-Romanian relations were severed.

In June, the German-Soviet war broke out. Filled with the long-held grudge of seizing Bessarabia, Romania gladly participated in the war against the Soviet Union and attacked Ukraine with the German army. In addition to retaking Bessarabia and Bukovina, it also occupied Odessa and the area up to the Dniester River, calling it Outer Transnistria. After that, the Romanian army continued to actively cooperate with the German army, fighting bravely at Stalingrad. In this summer's war, they retreated from the Eastern Front to defend the Balkans.

Industry and Trade

Romania is the most resource-rich country in the Balkans. About 70% of the population is engaged in agriculture, making it a major agricultural producer among the Danube countries. The main industry is petroleum. Before the war, it produced 8.7 million tons, accounting for the fourth largest in the world. Even now, it is said to produce as much as 6 million tons. Most of it is sent to Germany, making a great contribution to Germany's war effort.

In terms of trade, oil and grains account for an overwhelming proportion, making the country's trade surplus. The position of Germany as an exporter greatly increased after the outbreak of war in Europe. In 1940, Greater Germany, including Czechoslovakia, accounted for 64.3% of total imports and 49.3% of exports. Recent statistics are not available, but trade with Germany has naturally increased since the severing of relations with the anti-Axis countries.

Hungary

Since March 1920, when Admiral Horthy, the hero who overthrew the Bela Kun red regime, was recommended as regent by the National Assembly, he has consistently led Hungary, and its domestic situation has been closely linked to cooperation with Nazi Germany. Hungary declared itself the Kingdom of Hungary in 1921, but the throne was left vacant, and Regent Horthy became the dictator of Hungary, entrusted with full political power. Furthermore, according to the law of 1937, Regent Horthy was not even responsible to the parliament. In February 1942, Nicholas Horthy was elderly...? As regent, his son Stephen Horthy served as the regent's representative, but Stephen Horthy was killed in action while inspecting the German-Soviet front. The elder Horthy resumed his role as regent.

Hungary is a country that had to endure the greatest sacrifices after the failure of the previous world war. Due to the Treaty of Trianon in June 1920, 70% of the...? Land and 63% of the population were forcibly divided among neighboring countries. The lost population included 460,000 people in Yugoslavia, 1 million in Czechoslovakia, and 1.6 million in Romania. Every time Hungary had the opportunity, it attempted to recover these lost territories. Since the establishment of the Nazi regime, Germany has supported Hungary's demands and formed close diplomatic relations with it.

However, Hungary's long-held desire to recover its lost territories was not achieved until after the Munich Conference in October 1938. On November 2, the German and Italian foreign ministers held the Vienna Conference, where 4,200 square miles of territory were recovered from Czechoslovakia, with 700,000 Hungarians, 100,000 Slovaks, and 90,000 Ruthenians coming under its rule.

Hungary's second opportunity to recover lost territories came in June 1940, when the Soviet Union moved into Bessarabia and pursued Romania. At this time, Hungary implemented a large-scale mobilization on the Romanian border. Conflicts occurred between the Hungarian and Romanian armies. At the Tripartite Talks between Germany, Italy and Hungary on July 10, Hungary succeeded in recovering the lost territories from Romania. What was formally decided was the four-nation talks between Germany, Italy, Hungary and Romania. As a result, Hungary recovered the northern half of the Outer Transylvania region from Romania, which had been lost in the Treaty of Trianon.

In November of the same year, on November 20, Hungary signed and acceded to the Tripartite Pact among Japan, Germany and Italy. Hungary's attitude of cooperating with the Axis powers was legally confirmed.

In February 1941, Hungary's third opportunity to recover lost territories came. When Germany and Italy invaded Yugoslavia, Hungary advanced into the territory that had been ceded to Yugoslavia by the Treaty of Trianon, gaining the triangular area between the Tisza and Danube rivers.

In this way, Hungary was able to gradually recover the lost territories of the Treaty of Trianon by cooperating with Germany, so the pro-German sentiment was stronger than in other Balkan countries. Recently, the parliament has indefinitely postponed its session due to the anti-government attitude of Imre the First, in order to further strengthen the current Hungarian policy of cooperation with Germany.

Economic Cooperation with Germany

The division of small European countries according to the Treaty of Versailles ignored the capitalist economic law that demands a wider trading circle. The national economies of small European countries, isolated by various customs barriers, were on the verge of crisis, and Hungary was no exception, creating economic...? In recent years. Due to the pragmatic pro...? Policy of the...? Cabinet, it obtained Lodnia and increased its territory and population. In addition to the policy of economic cooperation with Germany, the Hungarian economy has been revived. The outbreak of the European War in September 1939 caused grain prices to rise, creating a favorable situation for Hungary.

However, the progress of the European War led to the severing of relations between Hungary and Britain and France, and the Hungarian economy became completely dependent on Germany. At the same time, the establishment of restrictions on the participation of Jews who had traditionally dominated industry and commerce in enterprises gave German capital a chance to advance comprehensively. At the German-Hungarian Economic Agreement held in late July 1941, Hungarian agriculture and consumer goods industry were developed jointly by the two countries. To exchange Hungarian light industrial products with German heavy industrial products, and in the financial sector, it concluded a mid-term settlement agreement with Germany, in which payments and settlements with Germany-dominated European countries were implemented through Berlin.
