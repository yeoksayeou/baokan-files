### Ways to Communicate Sino-Japanese Culture (2) - What is Expected of the Second National Congress of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association

The communication between Chinese and Japanese cultures is key to the future mutual assistance and development of the two countries, and therefore the cultural circles of both countries urgently need to work hard. What we expect from the Japanese cultural community was sincerely expressed in yesterday's editorial, and now we would like to talk about what the Chinese cultural community, especially the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, urgently needs to strive for, to silently give to all those attending the National Congress.

We say that Japanese scholars focus on ancient China and neglect modern China, which is certainly a rather strict statement. In fact, there are also people in the Japanese cultural community who painstakingly study modern China. However, looking back at our country's cultural community, the research on Japanese issues, whether "modern" or "ancient," is limited to superficial outlines. For example, now is the era when singing the praises of Sino-Japanese friendship is at its most fervent. May I ask, how many kinds of books and publications researching Japanese issues are published on the market? The lack of understanding of Japan in the cultural circle is already so great, so it is even more impossible to expect a thorough transformation of the general public's perception of Japan overnight. We dare to assert that if this phenomenon is not eliminated, then the so-called Sino-Japanese friendship and cooperation will inevitably remain official rhetoric and slogans. Therefore, we believe that organizations like the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association should profoundly recognize this serious phenomenon and earnestly do concrete work to communicate Sino-Japanese culture, especially to make Chinese people understand Japanese culture. Slogans, slogans, leaflets, and declarations can all be dispensed with, but practical work must not be relaxed in the slightest.

At present, there are two most urgent issues in communicating the cultures of the two countries: one is to strive to introduce knowledge of modern China to Japan, and the other is to introduce Japanese culture to China. Regarding the former, the cultural evolution since the Republic of China, especially the Chinese New Culture Movement since the "May Fourth Movement," which is manifested in politics, diplomacy, economy, culture, and folk thoughts and consciousness, is complex and subtle, and cannot be fully understood by ordinary foreigners. We should do our best to faithfully provide concrete information, without any prejudice, to truly and deeply understand China's modern culture and its trends? For the latter, we naturally also hope that friendly people can also provide us with the necessary information to understand Japan with a bright and clear attitude, and provide the greatest convenience for Chinese people to study Japan, especially modern Japan. But the main thing is our own efforts. We hope that the government, the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, and the folk cultural circles will cooperate closely. What needs to be done urgently at present is: (1) Establish a Japanese library in the capital, and set up Japanese book sections in public libraries in various provinces and cities, which can encourage the general public to study Japanese books and their culture. (2) Establish Japanese cultural centers in major cities, regularly hold lectures on Japanese issues, screen Japanese cultural films, hold Japanese cultural relics exhibitions, and universally teach Japanese, and then systematically compile and publish Japanese books and publications. (3) Establish Sino-Japanese cultural awards, and give awards to anyone who has made special achievements in communicating Sino-Japanese culture, regardless of nationality, gender, or qualifications, cultural figures or the publishing industry.

All of these tasks are indispensable and cannot be delayed in communicating Sino-Japanese culture today. Of course, it cannot be completed by any one party. There is no shortage of wise and intelligent people in China and Japan. The governments and the people of the two countries should work together to achieve it as soon as possible. And the current Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to shoulder the responsibility of leadership, must be reformed. To be honest, the current Sino-Japanese Cultural Association has more government personnel than folk cultural figures, and those in the government who have profound research on Japanese culture, such as Mr. Zhou Zuoren and Zhou Fohai, have not participated, which is a pity. We believe that this type of cultural undertaking is best managed by the folk cultural circles, while the government only plays a guiding and assisting role. If our sincere suggestions can become a reality in the near future, it will not only be a great fortune for the cultural future of China and Japan, but also the glory of East Asian culture. We hereby pay our respects to the National Congress and wish it brilliant success.

### Full Text of Chairman's Instructions

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 31st - Chairman's instructions at the first general review of the National Youth are as follows:

Dear youths, today is the day of the establishment of the Chinese Youth Model Corps and the Chinese Youth Corps, and the holding of the first general review of the youth. Youth corps from the capital and North China, Hankou, Guangdong, Shanghai, Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, Suhuai, and Subei provinces and cities have all come to participate. This shows that the spirit of the compatriots across the country is united, and the spirit of the national youth is also united. At the same time, the youth corps of our friendly nation Japan and the youth corps of our friendly nation Manchukuo have also sent representatives to participate. This further shows that the spirit of the East Asian compatriots is also united. The Greater East Asia War is a war of the entire East Asian nation. The Anglo-Americans are our common enemy. Now that our East Asian compatriots can unite sincerely, become comrades in East Asia, and work together to complete the Greater East Asia War and wipe out the common enemy, this is the most gratifying thing. Youth Corps, you may think that you are just a young man, a teenager, and how can you make any contribution to the country or to East Asia? This view of yours is wrong and must not be allowed. You must know that the responsibility of youth to the country is very important, and the contribution that they can make is also very important. Of course, teenagers are relatively young, but they will also make important contributions to the country in the future. This is true for the country, and it is also true for East Asia. Youth, as long as you all work hard in your respective positions, you will definitely be able to create great strength and produce great results. I believe that you will listen to what I said, be able to endure hardship, be brave, and be diligent, and you will definitely be able to shoulder the mission of reviving China and defending East Asia. To complete this mission, the most important thing is for East Asian compatriots to love each other, and for East Asian compatriots to form comrades. When I saw the vigorous spirit of the Japanese youth during the review just now, I was deeply impressed. Although the number of Manchukuo youth is small, their spirit and actions are also very good. Last May, when I saw the members of the Kyowa Kai Youth Corps in Xinjing, they were very serious and very nervous, and I was deeply impressed. The Chinese Youth Corps is still in the initial stage of organization, and the national general review is only the first time, and today it has such vigor and courage, which I am very comforted by. Finally, I hope that you will keep in mind one sentence, we must take out our own strength, take out our vigor, and take out our courageous spirit, work together, and move forward bravely. We must, as East Asian compatriots, form East Asian comrades and wipe out our common enemy.

### Soviet Wedge Tactic Fails in Ladoga Lake Area - German Defense is Strong, Soviets Make No Progress

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from the Military Correspondent of the Haitong News Agency, although the northern part of the Eastern Front is now muddy, the Soviet army is continuing its ineffective offensive south of Lake Ladoga. Moreover, the lake will soon thaw, and the Soviet Union will therefore lose an important transportation route, on which the Soviet Union has relied in the past few months to supply and reinforce the defenders of Leningrad. In January of this year, the Soviet army occupied a small swampy area on the south bank of Lake Ladoga, immediately erecting wooden bridges across it and laying narrow-gauge railways on it, but repeated attempts to open traffic were repelled by concentrated German artillery fire. Therefore, the Soviet Union has relied on the frozen surface of Lake Ladoga for transportation with Leningrad. Now that this lake route is about to become impassable due to thawing, the Soviet Union is obviously exerting all its efforts to widen the occupied swampy area so that the narrow-gauge railway can run directly along the south bank of the lake outside the range of German artillery fire. However, all these efforts have so far failed. In recent days, all Soviet offensives have been unsuccessful due to the strength of the German defenses. The Blue Division of Spanish volunteers also occupies a key military position in this battle. In addition, the Soviet offensive in the southwestern area of Vyazma also suffered the same failure. The Soviet army has repeatedly conducted armed reconnaissance in order to determine the strength of the German army in other sections of the Eastern Front. On Sundays, there are only local military actions.

Keijo, Sweden, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to reliable sources on the Eastern Front, the main Soviet forces, on the morning of the 30th, launched fierce attacks with mechanized units from the Leningrad area, the southern part of Lake Ladoga, and the Staraia Russa area on the tributaries of the Neva River. Among them, the Staraia Russa area was particularly intense. According to German front-line news, powerful Soviet mechanized units attempted to break into the German positions at a certain base point using wedge tactics. After the German army met and engaged in a long-term fierce battle, the Soviet army was defeated and retreated, abandoning more than 3,000 bodies. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue and is still conducting annihilation operations.

### Rommel's African Corps Repels British and American Attempts to Break Through - German Forces Withdraw from Gabès and El Hamma

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to official German information from Berlin last night, the African Corps under General Rommel fought fiercely on Sunday and repelled British and American attempts to break through in southern and central Tunisia. However, German forces have withdrawn from the port of Gabès on the east coast and El Hamma, about 40 kilometers west of the port. This withdrawal is based on a pre-determined plan to shorten the Axis powers' lines of battle. The Allied offensive has not abated, but all attempts by Generals Montgomery and Patton to break through the Axis positions have failed. The American forces under General Patton launched a fierce attack on German positions in central Tunisia and have been blocked in the mountainous area east of Maknassy. According to a Reuters correspondent accompanying the army last night, the American advance east of El Guettar has been delayed by fog and has encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces along the way. British forces operating north of the Djebel Abiod area in the coastal region of northern Tunisia have also encountered similar difficulties. Heavy fog has reduced visibility to only a few yards. Large-scale military action took place in the Béchateur area on Sunday. American tanks attacked German defensive positions with French troops, but were heavily damaged and retreated. American forces also repeatedly attacked near Fondouk, meeting the same fate. According to Berlin sources, the British army, with the help of heavy artillery fire, continued to attempt to encircle the right flank of the Axis positions on the Tunisian coast. Fierce fighting took place on Sunday, and the British suffered heavy casualties and retreated along the entire line. British reconnaissance activities were quite active in the Mateur area on Sunday.

### Eden Goes to Ottawa

Buenos Aires, 31st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, British Foreign Secretary Eden has been staying at the White House since the 27th, holding talks with Roosevelt, Hull, and others for several days.

According to reports, Eden's mission to Washington has completely failed. As a result, the United States has decided to send a delegation led by Under Secretary of State Welles to London soon to hold discussions with US Ambassador to Britain Winant, Yu Foreign Minister Song Ziwen, Yu Ambassador to Britain Gu Weijun, and Soviet Ambassador to Britain Maisky on measures to prevent rifts in the Allied camp.

### Macau Correspondence: The Oppressive Taxes of the Chongqing Regime (Part Two)

— Jin Yan

Numerous Tax Increases Fail to Reach Expected Revenue

(5) Increasing Mineral Resource Tax Rates

Mineral resource taxes were originally levied ad valorem. Except for alum, which was taxed at 2%, all other items were taxed at 5%. Due to the increase in prices of mineral products in various regions, it was deemed necessary to appropriately raise this tax. In September of the 30th year, a circular was issued classifying mineral products into essential and non-essential categories. Except for the three essential commodities of coal, iron, and oil, which continued to be taxed at 5%, all others were taxed at 10%.

However, although mineral reserves are abundant, mining is still limited. Therefore, tax revenue from this source is extremely limited. According to statistics, actual revenue was 2,398,982 yuan in the 26th year, 1,070,659 yuan in the 27th year, 1,894,357 yuan in the 28th year, 2,075,535 yuan in the 29th year, and 910,241 yuan in the first six months of the 30th year.

(6) Expanding the Scope of Ad Valorem Taxes

In the past, most taxes were levied ad valorem. Since the surge in prices, although the authorities had moderately increased the tax rates for various quantity-based taxes, the actual tax burden had relatively decreased. This created an imbalance between ad valorem taxes and quantity-based taxes. Therefore, on July 7th of the 30th year, the "Provisional Regulations for Commodity Unified Tax" and the "Provisional Regulations for Domestic Tobacco and Alcohol Tax" were promulgated. All unified taxes and tobacco and alcohol taxes were uniformly converted to ad valorem taxes. Part of the salt tax was also converted to an ad valorem tax in September of the 31st year. The new tax rates were set as follows:

Unified Tax Rates:

(1) Cigarettes - 80% ad valorem

(2) Cured Tobacco - 25% ad valorem

(3) Foreign Liquor - 60% ad valorem

(4) Beverages - 20% ad valorem

(5) Alcohol - Ordinary alcohol 20% ad valorem, denatured alcohol and wood alcohol 10%, power alcohol 5%

(6) Matches - 20% ad valorem

(7) Sugar - 15% ad valorem

(8) Cement - 15% ad valorem

(9) Cotton Yarn - 15% ad valorem

(10) Wheat Flour - 3.5% ad valorem

A. Tobacco Tax is divided into leaf tobacco and shredded tobacco. Leaf tobacco is taxed at 30% based on the assessed taxable price at the place of production. Shredded tobacco is taxed at 15%. Leaf tobacco that is shredded is still subject to leaf tobacco tax first.

B. Alcohol tax is levied at 40% based on the assessed taxable price at the place of production.

The salt tax was also changed to an ad valorem system starting in September of the 30th year, as mentioned above. It was stipulated that there would be both production and sales taxes. A production tax would be levied at the salt production site, and for salt sold inland, a tax of 40% would be levied based on the cost per "jin" (a Chinese unit of weight) in each region. Production and sales taxes could not be levied blindly. After the reform, all other regular and additional taxes, construction special categories, foreign debt surcharges, and public welfare fees were abolished, except for the production and sales taxes. It was estimated that the single item of salt tax could increase annual revenue from 30 million yuan to 60 million yuan after the reform.

Although Chongqing has made great efforts to adjust old taxes and repeatedly raised tax rates, tax revenue has not improved. If we compare the total tax revenue of 454,157,429 yuan in the 26th year to the total tax revenue of 846,811,085 yuan in the 25th year, there is a shortfall of 47%. Due to the change in the accounting year in the 27th year, the total tax revenue from July to December was 210,094,538 yuan. This shows the magnitude of the loss from old taxes. General public opinion strongly advocated the establishment of new taxes. The authorities, compelled by financial needs and for the sake of the tax system, then introduced various new taxes:

(1) Excessive Profits Tax

The Provisional Regulations for Excessive Profits Tax During Extraordinary Periods were promulgated on July 28th of the 27th year. It was originally scheduled to be levied from July of that year. However, due to the impact of the war on industry and commerce, merchants and the public requested a postponement, which delayed the implementation until January 1st of the 28th year. The profit exemption point for profit-making enterprises stipulated in the original regulations was changed from 12% to 15%, and the profit exemption point for property leasing tax was changed from 10% to 12% to show consideration. The highest tax rate was 50%. According to the regulations, those with one of the following excessive profits, in addition to income tax, would also be subject to excessive profits tax:

(A) Profit-making enterprises, whether companies, firms, shops, factories, or individual capital, with capital of more than 2,000 yuan, profit-making enterprises jointly operated by officials and merchants, and temporary profit-making enterprises, whose profits exceed 15% of their capital. (B) Profits from property leasing exceeding 12% of the value of the property.

The profit tax rates for profit-making enterprises are as follows:

(1) For profits exceeding 15% to 20% of capital, the excess is taxed at 10%.

(2) For profits exceeding 20% to 30% of capital, the excess is taxed at 15%.

(3) For profits exceeding 30% to 40% of capital, the excess is taxed at 20%.

(4) For profits exceeding 40% to 50% of capital, the excess is taxed at 30%.

(5) For profits exceeding 50% to 60% of capital, the excess is taxed at 50%.

The regulations for property leasing profit tax are as follows:

(1) For profits exceeding 12% to 20% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 10%.

(2) For profits exceeding 20% to 30% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 15%.

(3) For profits exceeding 30% to 40% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 20%.

(4) For profits exceeding 40% to 50% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 30%.

(5) For profits exceeding 50% to 60% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 40%.

(6) For profits exceeding 60% of the property value, the excess is taxed at 50%. After the excessive profits tax during extraordinary periods was levied, the budgeted revenue for the 28th year was 4 million yuan, but only 18,571 yuan was collected by the end of the year. The budget for the 29th year remained at 4 million yuan, but the actual revenue for that year reached 24,912,692 yuan. The budget for the 30th year was 45 million yuan, with actual revenue of 77,377,799 yuan, even surpassing income tax revenue.

(2) Inheritance Tax

The Provisional Regulations for Inheritance Tax were promulgated on October 6th of the 27th year, with collection starting on January 1st of the 29th year. According to the regulations: "If a person has inheritance within the territory of the Republic of China at the time of death, inheritance tax shall be levied; if a citizen of the Republic of China has a residence within the territory of the country and has inheritance abroad, tax shall also be levied." The scope of taxation is mainly based on the principle of territoriality and supplemented by the principle of nationality. The starting point for inheritance tax is set at 5,000 yuan, and those above 5,000 yuan are subject to a proportional tax of 1%.

(1) For amounts exceeding 50,000 yuan up to 100,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 2%.

(2) For amounts exceeding 100,000 yuan up to 250,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 2%.

(3) For amounts exceeding 250,000 yuan up to 500,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 3%.

(4) For amounts exceeding 500,000 yuan up to 750,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 10%.

(5) For amounts exceeding 750,000 yuan up to 1,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 5%.

(6) For amounts exceeding 1,000,000 yuan up to 1,500,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 7%.

(7) For amounts exceeding 1,500,000 yuan up to 2,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 9%.

(8) For amounts exceeding 2,000,000 yuan up to 3,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 12%.

(9) For amounts exceeding 3,000,000 yuan up to 4,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 15%.

(10) For amounts exceeding 4,000,000 yuan up to 5,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 20%.

(11) For amounts exceeding 5,000,000 yuan up to 6,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 25%.

(12) For amounts exceeding 6,000,000 yuan up to 7,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 30%.

(13) For amounts exceeding 7,000,000 yuan up to 8,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 35%.

(14) For amounts exceeding 8,000,000 yuan up to 9,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 40%.

(15) For amounts exceeding 9,000,000 yuan up to 10,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 45%.

(16) For amounts exceeding 10,000,000 yuan, the excess is taxed at 50%.

It can be seen from this that the inheritance tax rate is relatively low. The authorities originally intended to facilitate its implementation. Therefore, the budgeted amount for inheritance tax in the 29th year was only 2 million yuan. The year-end collection was 3,220 yuan, less than 1% of the budget. The budget for the 30th year was 5 million yuan, with actual revenue of 214,877 yuan, an increase of more than seven times compared to the previous year. Although there has been great progress, compared to income tax and excessive profits tax, inheritance tax performance is the worst. The main reasons are the difficulty in tax collection and excessive tax evasion. Strict enforcement of property registration and death registration is more difficult than usual. Therefore, before property registration and death registration are fully implemented, the benefit of inheritance tax to wartime finances will be very limited. However, the direct tax system has now been fully established.

(3) Wartime Consumption Tax

The Provisional Regulations for Wartime Consumption Tax were promulgated on April 2nd of the 31st year and were scheduled to be levied from April 15th of the 31st year. The scope of taxation is very broad. Except for necessities such as rice and wheat, which are exempted from tax, all other daily necessities, non-essential goods, and luxury goods are subject to wartime consumption tax. The tax rate is determined by the nature of the goods:

(1) Ordinary Daily Necessities - 5% ad valorem

(2) Non-Essential Goods - 10% ad valorem

(3) Semi-Luxury Goods - 15% ad valorem

(4) Luxury Goods - 20% ad valorem

The method of collection is to adopt a "pass-through tax" approach, collected by the customs authorities. Regarding this point, some public opinion has criticized it. Therefore, wartime consumption tax is considered a bad tax similar to "lijin" (internal transit tax). In fact, wartime consumption tax is only levied once and is valid throughout the country, which is different from "lijin" or transit taxes in various provinces. However, the excessively broad scope of taxation inevitably affects production aids, leading to nitpicking. Among countries worldwide that levy consumption taxes, France is the most comprehensive, but it has ultimately failed due to widespread public dissatisfaction with the nitpicking. Secondly, the taxed goods are divided into daily necessities and non-essential goods according to the Wartime Consumption Tax Regulations. In addition to non-essential goods, a semi-luxury category is added between non-essential and luxury goods, totaling four levels, which actually only increases complexity.

### Story of an Old Friend

— Wang Jingwei

It is hard to find a pair of fish in the Pearl River,
A night of sorrow makes me suffer unbearably.
Although parting feelings at Nanpu are easy to dispel,
Nightmares in Maple Forest are empty and meaningless.
If the cuckoo's soul transforms, where would it go?
I am ashamed to not be able to repay my debt like soldiers who die on the battlefield.
Desolate and tragic in the lamplight last night,
The appearance of old friends gradually fades.

On the evening of the thirtieth day of the third month of the Xinhai year (or perhaps the first day of the fourth month, I don't remember clearly), a jailer named Liu Yiming (who was the best to me among the jailers) quietly said to me when no one was around, "Hey, you guys have started another uprising, and a lot of heads have been chopped off in Guangzhou!" I was very sad when I heard this and asked him to find a newspaper for me to read. This was a major violation of the prison rules. He managed to bring one in. When I saw the news of Hu Zhantang's death, I was extremely saddened and wrote several poems. Later, he quietly told me, "That Hu Zhantang of yours is not dead," so I stopped. I knew most of the other comrades who had died, and I wrote two poems for each of them. The first one, "I want to use poetic thoughts," etc., was not well written and will be deleted in the future. The first four lines of the second poem are also not good, too vague, but the last four lines are factual, so I am recording them below.

"The appearance of old friends gradually fades." Now, thirty-three years have passed, and naturally it has become even more blurred. I can only offer a few stories of old friends as examples of vague memories.

One is Lin Shishi, from Houguan, Fujian. He was a handsome young man with very large eyes. He called himself "Lion Eyes," but he wasn't. Lion's eyes are round, but his eyes were large and long, much prettier than lion's eyes. He had two or three very special stories. At the time, most students bought reference books, such as Dr. Yamada Saburo's Private International Law and Onozuka Kiheiji's Outline of Political Science, which were all hardcover, black leather covers, with gold lettering, and carefully placed on the bookshelf, afraid of getting them dirty. He did the same. Suddenly, one day, he stripped off the covers of all his books. I asked him in surprise, and he replied, "If I care about the covers being beautiful, I won't bear to read them, won't bear to scribble on them. It's better to strip them off and save the pity." I flipped through a few books and, sure enough, they were covered in doodles. I laughed and said, "It's a good thing you scribbled on them. If you hadn't, you would have peeled the skin off your palms." He was very poor, and he had an older sister in Zhejiang who often sent him money. One day, he said to me, "My sister sent money, but she scolded me for not writing letters. Alas! It's no good lying, but telling the truth would scare her." The next day, he gave me three paintings and said, "Look, do you understand? I drew him alone in the first picture, hugging his knees, facing the lamp, with a sorrowful expression. There are a few slices of 'Xijing Roasted' on the desk" (this is roasted sweet potato, cut into slices, with some salt added, and dried, our only wonderful food when studying at night). The second picture shows him alone, full of smiles, holding a letter in his hand. The third picture shows him reading under a large tree. Each picture has the words 'Sister' on top and 'Brother X' at the bottom, with different dates on each picture. I remember it at the time, but now I've forgotten. I looked at it several times and didn't understand. I asked him, 'What are you up to?' He laughed and said, 'The first picture says that I miss her and don't have any money, so I can only eat roasted sweet potatoes; the second picture says that I received her letter and am very happy; the third picture says that I am not worried anymore and am studying leisurely. This is much better than writing letters, because I'm not lying and I'm not making her worry.' I said, 'Good, but I'm afraid she won't understand.' He said, 'Do you think she's as stupid as you?' (The ultimate insult for a dullard). Alas! I also have a fifth sister, but I'm not as witty as Lin Shishi, nor am I as good at understanding people's feelings. I only ended up going to my fifth sister's grave after returning to the country to write the poem, "The slant sun urges me to return, I turn my head to see a lonely grave."

Another is Li Wenfu, from Dongguan, Guangdong. What I admired most about him was his transformation of temperament. When he first joined the party, he complained incessantly. The only reason was that he couldn't hear the secrets of the cadres. He almost complained every day, even at every meal. But later, after he became a cadre, his temperament completely changed, almost like two different people. He often said, "Why was I so confused before?" He became humble and open-minded, never arguing back when scolded, and never showing resentment on his face. In short, he changed from an extremely bad temper to an extremely good one. I am sixty-one years old this year, and I have seen many comrades, but it is rare to see someone as brave as Li Wenfu in correcting their faults. Alas! It's a pity he died so young!

Another is Yu Yunji, whose given name was Peilun, from Xuzhou, Sichuan. He was frail and delicate. He studied at the Chiba Medical College. At the time, among the comrades, he was the most intelligent, meticulous in his studies, and devoted to science. In the beginning, he only knew how to make silver fulminate and mercury fulminate. Once, he accidentally blew up his hand, and half of his palm lost its mobility (I don't remember if it was his left or right hand). So he refined his skills, and he could make other nitroglycerin explosives, yellow explosives, etc. The ignition part was potassium chlorate and sulfur; the guiding part was mercury fulminate; the main explosive part was yellow explosives, etc. He took care of all three parts to create the contents of the bomb. He also took care of the outer shell, which had to be made of steel. He also took care of the wiring. He said, "I can only make it, but I can't use it. It's not that I'm afraid of dying, it's just that my nerves are not good, and I panic at the last minute, which would ruin your plans." Indeed, when it came time to implement it, his face would turn pale and his hands and feet would tremble. It wasn't that he was afraid of dying, it was just that he was too nervous! This wouldn't work! So, from the winter of the Jiyou year to the spring of the Gengxu year, we were together in Beijing, and after everything was arranged, he left Beijing and returned to Tokyo. But who would have thought that on that day, March 29th of the Xinhai year, he would be the bravest one! Later, I heard Huang Kecheng say that on that day, he was calm and heroic, without any sign of a pale face or trembling hands. So, Li Wenfu wasn't the only one who transformed his temperament!

"The appearance of old friends gradually fades." I am writing down these blurred memories under the lamp to pass this Lantern Festival night of the old calendar.

Under the lamp on February 19th of the 32nd year.

### Those Coming to Shanghai from Other Areas Without Identification Papers Can Hide in the French Concession; If Discovered, the Head of the Household and the Lianbao Chief Will be Punished; Sub-tenants Renting Must Be Investigated by the Baojia Chief

According to information from the Baojia side of the French Concession, any citizens coming to Shanghai from other areas who request the issuance of an identification card must attach a citizen's card or county resident's card issued by the other area. Those without the above certificates are not allowed to hide within the Concession. If there are such people of unknown origin or mixed backgrounds hiding within the Concession, the head of the household (second landlord) and the Lianbao chief will be severely punished. If people from other areas come to Shanghai to work and live and have a citizen's card or county resident's card issued by the other area, the procedures for requesting the issuance of an identification card can be handled directly at the Lianbao office. This measure is to prevent the Baojia chief from being lenient or deliberately harboring suspects. As for sub-tenants, they are not allowed to arbitrarily sublet or share their rooms with others. If it is necessary to sublet, the consent of the head of the household must be obtained first, and then reported to the Baojia chief. The Baojia chief will complete the investigation procedures and, if it is determined that subletting is possible, only then can it be sublet to others. Furthermore, the second landlord (head of household) is absolutely not allowed to allow people who have not applied for a transfer certificate to reside. If such an event occurs, once discovered, the second landlord (head of household) will be subject to the most severe punishment.

### Those Going from Shanghai to Suzhou and Other Places Must Prepare Two Types of Certificates: Smallpox Vaccination Certificate and Epidemic Prevention Certificate

When going from Shanghai to other areas, in addition to a citizen's card or residence certificate, a smallpox vaccination certificate must also be prepared. This regulation has been in effect for a long time. However, according to an investigation by a Datong News Agency reporter, residents who wish to travel to places along the Shanghai-Nanjing Railway line, such as Suzhou and Wuxi, recently need to prepare an additional epidemic prevention certificate. As for going from Shanghai to Ningbo, the requirement to prepare a smallpox vaccination certificate and an epidemic prevention certificate has been in effect for some time.

### Rickshaw and Taxi Prices

Since the gasoline shortage, the rickshaw business in the city has developed considerably. The establishment of rickshaw companies is like bamboo shoots after a rain. The industry has also followed orders to organize an industry association. To adjust rickshaw fares within the industry and achieve uniformity, the association has formulated rickshaw fares, which will be implemented from the 5th of this month.

Newly Revised Fares

(1) Minimum fare for 30 minutes: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 12 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 8 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 16 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 14 yuan. (2) Every 5 minutes exceeding the minimum: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 1.5 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 1 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 1.5 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 1.5 yuan. (3) Per hour: (A) Double-seat covered rickshaw: 21 yuan; (B) Single-seat covered rickshaw: 14 yuan; (C) Double-driver sedan rickshaw: 25 yuan; (D) Single-driver sedan rickshaw: 23 yuan.

Points to Note

(1) Of the above fares, the company and the rickshaw puller will split the revenue in three parts: the company gets 20%, and the rickshaw puller gets 10% (including wages and tips). (2) An exception is made for double-driver sedan rickshaws, where the company and the rickshaw puller split the revenue equally at 50% each. (3) Rickshaw pullers are absolutely not allowed to solicit tips from customers. (4) If rickshaw pullers make extra demands, it can be reported to the company for strict punishment.

Branch Station Licensing

All rickshaw companies in this port that have branch stations and open-air branch stations such as dance venues must obtain a license from the Public Works Department. (Excluding the 19 open-air branch stations stipulated by the Bureau). The department announced this last month, and the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Public Works Department Police Headquarters notified all companies. However, as of the day before yesterday, most companies had not followed the regulations. The section is now going to confiscate the business of companies that have not applied for a license.

### Municipal Social Welfare Bureau Mediates Rent Disputes

The Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, officially established at the beginning of last month, is reportedly paying close attention to the ongoing occurrence of rent disputes throughout the city. Recognizing that landlords often cut off water and electricity supply due to unsuccessful rent increases, leading to complex problems, the bureau, feeling responsible to the people, is unwilling to stand idly by. It has decided to find ways to resolve these issues. Therefore, landlords or tenants from all walks of life who encounter various problems and cannot resolve them through negotiation can directly request mediation from the bureau. Once the bureau receives requests from all parties, it will immediately summon both sides for questioning and impartially mediate.

### Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office Held Transfer Ceremony of Enemy Assets Yesterday; Transfer Procedures Scheduled Separately for Today

Yesterday at 2:00 PM, authorities from friendly nations, together with the Enemy Assets Management Office of our country, held a transfer ceremony of enemy assets at the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office. The transfer personnel from both sides agreed that starting from April 1st, transfer and handover procedures would be carried out separately at various enemy asset agencies. Mr. Zhang Suomin, the director of the Enemy Assets Management Office of the Ministry of Finance, stated briefly in his address: "After my inspection, I have one overriding impression, which is that I deeply admire the method of managing enemy assets by friendly nations. This is because friendly nations assign specialists to manage each type of enemy asset. These specialists are generally from famous large Japanese companies, and their expertise in management goes without saying. Today, friendly nations are transferring the first batch of enemy assets. I would like to report to everyone the principles of the takeover. First, I will seek the consent of the various companies originally entrusted to operate by friendly nations and continue to entrust them to operate, except for those where the conditions differ too greatly. Second, for those entrusted to Chinese operators, industrialists with outstanding credit will be selected. Third, for factories that have been shut down, efforts will be made to restore their operations, except in cases where there are special factual difficulties, in order to increase wartime production. I would like to express my special gratitude to the embassy and naval and army authorities of friendly nations."

### Japanese Embassy Reception for Reporters

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy holds receptions for the local Chinese press corps every Wednesday. Yesterday (the 31st) at 3:00 PM, the reception was held as usual on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel on the Bund in Nanjing Road. More than a dozen reporters from various local newspapers attended. On the embassy side, Deputy Consul Fukuma attended, and Lieutenant Commander Shiota of the Naval Press Department and Mr. Anchi were also present. Lieutenant Commander Shiota gave a detailed account of his recent visit to the China Central Naval Academy to observe the training of students, expressing his admiration for the new China's active efforts to cultivate outstanding naval talents.

### Fundraising for Police Posts in Nanshi

Regarding the police posts of the Nanshi Self-Defense Corps, since the corps headquarters actively planned for their construction, 396 units have already been completed in the entire district. However, according to the actual situation, 124 units are still lacking due to limited funding and the inability to complete all of them. The Nanshi Branch of the Police Department of the Friendly Nation's Consulate, in order to promote the early completion of police posts throughout the district and jointly strengthen local security, has specifically designated donation books to be collected by the corps headquarters from residents of friendly nations residing in the Nanshi district for the purpose of early success. Mr. Wang Delin, the commander of the corps headquarters, has specifically instructed the heads of each neighborhood, the chiefs of the security associations, and the patrol officers to carry the designated donation books of the police department, accompanied by translators, to start collecting donations according to the listed details.

### Shanghai Garrison Headquarters Reorganized into Security Office by Order

### Commentary: The Financial Industry and Production Enterprises

On February 13th, the Central Government promulgated the Outline of Wartime Economic Policies, which stipulated that loans from banks and money shops should be limited to production enterprises. Therefore, in the future, banks and money shops should devote all their efforts to lending to various sectors of production. Considering the current immaturity of production enterprises, large-scale operations and rationalized organizations are needed to promote the development of enterprises. Therefore, banks and money shops should jointly organize production loan syndicates under the guidance of the General Chamber of Commerce Control, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, the Bankers' Association, and the Joint Reserve Committee. They should recruit technical personnel, set various detailed rules, and organize industrial loan syndicates and agricultural loan syndicates to actively engage in lending to industrial and agricultural enterprises so that large-scale production enterprises can be established in various regions to assist the control policy and the exchange of materials. However, at the beginning, practical investigations, statistics, research, and design work should be done, especially in engineering and accounting, rational regulations should be made first: they must be operated scientifically and organized rationally before lending convenience can be granted. Not only large-scale enterprises must do this, but also small factories, small farms, as well as reclamation, fishery, should do the same, so that the loan of a business is sure to have the effect of a business, which is the only way out for the financial industry in the future. Hope that the relevant authorities of the banks and money shops pay attention to, in order to adapt to the government's economic policy and complete the economic mission of the people.

### Ministry of Food Strengthens Management; Orders Rice Merchants to Organize Joint Operating Companies in Various Districts

Nanjing, 31st Central News Agency: In order to strengthen the management of food in various regions, the Ministry of Food has ordered rice merchants to organize joint operating companies in various districts to jointly handle the rice business.

### The Hidden Pain of Elementary School Teachers

— Qun

How do I support my child?

My wife's belly is getting bigger day by day. Her thin, yellow face often looks at me with melancholy eyes, then looks at her own belly. I understand what she means, but it is difficult for me to even have enough food and clothing. How can I have extra money to prepare for childbirth!

People have already put on their lined robes, but I am still wearing a tattered cotton robe, which is both hot and heavy. In this day and age where "people are judged by their clothes," and I am still holding onto the teaching position, I always want to make one to fill the facade, but when I see her big belly and thin yellow face, I have to give up my prejudices. Let's save some money! The school fees have been increasing again and again, but the teachers' salaries are still stagnating. The money earned is not enough to eat, let alone drink porridge! How can I afford to be a father? After the child is born, I wonder if I can support my son?

For the sake of future life, I have also asked relatives for loans, but in this year only "icing on the cake", who would be willing to "help in need"? After suffering cold ridicule, still returned empty-handed. Alas! The world is cold and treacherous, full of snobbery! I scolded impatiently, but what's the use!

I am ashamed, I have been a sacred and poor teacher, and I can't afford to support a woman. Over the years, I have given her jewelry and clothes to others one by one. She just sobbed and wept, as if reluctant, but inconvenient to stop, just crying, to express her inner pain. I married her for several years, and I have not given her any happiness, but on the contrary, she has only suffered. Even though she is pregnant, she cannot ignore the housework. When I return from school every day, I always see her working with sweat all over her face and panting, as if she can't bear it anymore. Although she has no complaints, I feel ashamed myself! I am sorry for her!

I curse God, resent the injustice of the Creator, why do we have to divide the rich and poor by money?

I am afraid, I am worried, will China's education go bankrupt? I also wonder how we will survive the days after the child is born? These two questions are swirling in my mind, and I can't find the answer.

The child is born, I am a father! Is this future responsibility a joy or a sorrow for me?

### Struggle

— Hai Lin

The spring rain has been falling for days and continues.

A Long's dirty hand was digging at his sleepy eyes, letting the raindrops wash over his forehead, which he would never have the chance to wipe clean. But in his other hand, he held a basket of flatbreads and fried dough sticks, covered with a piece of faded oilcloth.

Dragging his shoes, he wandered among the rickshaw pullers: "Flatbreads and fried dough sticks, anyone?" The call reached the ears of every rickshaw puller. Especially his own, he heard it even more clearly.

It was noon, and his calls gradually grew quieter. He thought, "I must be hungry!"

Last night, after serving his master's wife at her late-night mahjong game, he had barely warmed the bed before his master dragged him up.

"Lazy ghost, go do business quickly, fifty of each, be careful when you come back if you don't sell them," he was pushed out the door just like that. He touched the flatbread, "It's cold, two days old."

How could he sell it? Rickshaw pullers would never spend money to buy day-old goods.

Thinking and thinking, he felt a bit dizzy. He walked to the corner of the wall and sat down.

"Go back and eat lunch? Don't even think about it."

"Then..." he looked at the basket.

The day-old goods now seemed so tender! He vaguely saw steam rising from them.

Goose-yellow fried dough sticks? Sesame-sprinkled flatbreads? Aromatic?

The fire in his stomach was burning.

A hand reached into the basket, but immediately retracted. His master's full face of flesh, those bulging fierce eyes, that giant demon palm, and his master's wife's mouth... all emerged in his thoughts like sea monsters.

He was desperate, he lowered his head... suddenly, he heard a commotion across the way... he focused his gaze:

Oh! It turned out to be street theatre, a woman was kicking a middle-aged beggar, the beggar had a piece of flatbread in his mouth... a piece of flatbread, his stomach grumbled. A lightning-fast hand reached into the basket.

Now he also had a piece of flatbread in his mouth.

### Root

— Xin Bo

After passing this stone wall, the road followed the mountain's contour, gently trending northeast, with low hills on the right and shallow valleys on the left, still offering a sense of winding and turning. At the narrowest point, we had to separate, with A Wu walking ahead and Da Gen behind.

"I didn't even come to see you when you were sick last year," A Wu suddenly brought up this topic. "How did you get better? Are you fully recovered now?" He turned around to look.

What A Wu saw was a grinning face, stocky, ruddy, and very healthy. He also noticed a prominently protruding chest and a taller stature than his own.

Da Gen politely said a few words, then said, "It just got better on its own, didn't even take medicine. Now I seem to be even better than before, I'm hungry all day long; but I don't eat much. You look like you're enjoying a good life, not worrying about food."

"Enjoying a good life, my ass!" Da Gen's words rekindled A Wu's old grievances. After cursing the Huang Zong'an family for a while, he said: "I'm thinking of running away, not eating that bowl of prison food there anymore. But after I get out, what will I do? I don't know. Someone invited me to the 'team,' I haven't decided. Da Gen, what do you think?"

"I'm not used to that," Da Gen said, kicking a small stone on the road into the valley with his straw-sandaled foot, "but I don't think the Huang family is a bad place to live. Old Master Huang was willing to buy our fields, so we could pass the winter safely, and this year we can still have some capital for farming and working. We are very grateful to him."

"Okay, okay! Da Gen," with a heavy tone, "you are really too honest! He was going to buy the land anyway; he seized the opportunity to exploit you, don't you know? Huang Chong'an is a good person, even dogs don't eat shit! You mean there's not a single good person in his whole family!" (23)

### The Philosophy of Leisure

— A Small Reader

People without a sense of career most readily place their time on the word "leisure." Leisure is the best friend of the general public, inseparable for a moment, leisurely during the day, even more leisurely at night. With so much "leisure," of course there is a need to "kill" it!

Our compatriots have the most "leisure" time. Whether old or young, male or female, they spend their lives immersed in the word "leisure," becoming more refined as they go. To this day, our methods of "killing" "leisure" also follow the rapid progress of the wheels of the times. Even the Western devils who hold the great banner of modern civilization sigh in admiration.

"Waiter! Two liang of baijiu, two pieces of dried tofu, some peanuts..." The wine is delivered, legs crossed, the bearded one strokes his beard, spending two or three hours, the cost of two or three hours is only two liang of baijiu... some peanuts... cheap.

Teahouses are the birthplace of leisure culture, and also a great collection of leisure for the general public. A Mao from the Li family ran away with a man, and after two or three hours, even a three-year-old child knows. Naturally, the tea server must collect materials every day to provide leisure topics for the patrons, oh! The collection of leisure, how admirable!

"Ping pong ping pong..." is the sound of mahjong tiles, the leisure of the elderly, young people, ladies and misses of our upper and lower classes;

"This miss is beautiful!"

"Chickens!" is the form of a male dog chasing a female dog, the leisure of degenerate youth, more active in the spring, and more common in the park. Theaters, cinemas, tea rooms, brothels, dance halls, cafes are the venues for people's leisure, day and night, millions upon millions of dark heads, moving like ants, studying the methods of leisure, spending their days in leisure.

Life is leisurely (?). Children crawl on the ground playing marbles, adults talk about romance, appreciate legs... leisure, killing leisure is the purpose of life, killing leisure is the philosophy of life.

### Willpower

— Chun Sheng

According to psychological judgment, a strong will has three essential conditions: energy, perseverance, and direction.

It is said that the process of will is the same as the process of emotion. Expressing it in words is not very meaningful, because words are only suitable for representing thoughts. The essence of will lies in the ability to "act" and "persist."

Willpower is often hazy. Because will cannot represent the entire personality, another type of impulsive emotion immediately replaces it as the driving force. When emotion and will come to a choice, they prompt people to adopt a rational rather than blindly obedient attitude to execute a conscious decision. Theory is like this, and practical requirements are also like this.

Will must be closely linked to self-confidence, and the difficulty of self-confidence lies in not stubbornly clinging to one's own views within the scope of stubbornness.

People have willpower, but most cannot achieve perfection. Even if we divide energy, perseverance, and direction into three parts for testing, at most, I can only get thirty points, or even have to take a discount in the eyes of others.

### Midnight Jottings

— Meng

(1) Poverty

The image of the Holy Son revealed a gentle smile, night! Spreading. I was immersed in a dark atmosphere, the sound of the watchman's clapper on the street, like the sad wail of a Hu jia, this dark night! Endless. How long have I been at peace? The tide of sorrow is flourishing in my mind.

"Poor kid!" Then suddenly a mud pellet broke through the air and drew near.

Emotions are in chaos, a chest full of blood, the bomb hidden in the bottom of my heart exploded, bang, my fist hit the table, I touched, pain, awakening, it turned out this is night, endure it. But, ah! This long night, when...?

(2) Hatred

Grandmother! You scold me, beat me. I hate, I resent, but this hatred seems to pass like a haze, disappearing. Yes, Grandmother, at the moment you hit me and scolded me, Grandmother's heart was even more difficult than answering!

I cry, tears filled my chest. I pray silently.

The high pressure of the environment makes you unable to breathe. All around are dry and astringent encounters, naturally, "emotions are stifled within, and expressed outwardly." I am useless, unable to share this burden for you, bitter wine and bitter cup, who will share the taste with you?

I should be beaten and scolded by you, beat me! Scold me! To slightly kill the pain in your heart.
