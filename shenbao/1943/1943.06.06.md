### From Political Lies to Opium Suppression

— Chen Fumu

The baseness of politics lies greater than lying. The evil of Chinese politics lies in the fact that those in power know only how to lie to the people, and never think about how to genuinely implement political reform. Three years ago, when the National Government returned to its capital, Chairman Wang once proposed a slogan: "Tell the truth, take responsibility." I feel that if a government can rarely gain the support of the people, it doesn't need to come up with grand plans or promote some profound and unpredictable political programs and doctrines. It only needs to sincerely and practically make the determination to "eliminate evil completely and follow good as a stream," for the sake of the country and the people, do one thing at a time, be able to say it and be able to do it, not tell lies, not do false things, and let the people know that this government is truly "beneficial and eliminates abuses" and is sufficient to do good. Then, if this government has even more grand plans and political programs, the people will not only believe it, but will also be encouraged and inspired to follow it.

Examples of political lies in China are more than ten thousand, and cannot be exhausted. I now want to cite a most base and shameless political lie, which is the so-called "opium suppression." The harm of opium is enough to destroy the race and the country, which is a truth known to women and children, and I don't need to waste words to describe it. The Chinese government has been promoting opium suppression for more than a hundred years, and not only has opium not been eradicated, but it has become even more rampant, with new tricks being invented. The government uses this to raise funds, and officials rely on this to make money. It is called opium suppression, but in reality it is promoting opium, fearing that the people will know its poison and not smoke more. It even cleverly creates names, clearly opium drugs, but beautifully calls them "opium cessation ointment." Clearly a smoking room, but calls it a "opium cessation room." Clearly the place where the crime of selling opium is located, but calls it a "opium cessation center." Taking this "opium cessation ointment" as an example, expanding on it, lying and deceiving people in politics, corruption is integrity, treason is patriotism, extortion is relief, and perverting the law is abiding by the law. All kinds of evils can be given beautiful names to deceive the world. The so-called political credibility, national laws, and discipline are all empty words. During the rule of the Northern Warlords, it was dark and lawless, and there is no need to talk about what tricks they played to satisfy their political sins. More than ten years ago, the Kuomintang rose to power with a revolutionary new attitude, but invented this shameless name to sell opium without correction, and the media also found it strange and no one criticized it, which is truly heartbreaking. However, the people spread the word, "The revolutionaries say all the good words and do all the bad things," and this "opium cessation ointment" may be one of them!

Thinking back to when the National Government was first established in 1925, the revolutionary atmosphere was flourishing, and there was a new atmosphere in all aspects of governance. Mr. Liao Zhongkai was the Minister of Finance, and he earnestly discussed his new opium suppression plan with me, and asked me to do my part to promote it in the newspapers when the plan was implemented. He had a very valuable saying, he said: "Some people think that genuine opium suppression will hinder fiscal revenue, but I believe that the more genuine the opium suppression, the more ways there will be to manage finances." Unfortunately, this Kuomintang leader and the most courageous practical statesman was assassinated by thugs a few days after he drafted the genuine opium suppression plan. From then on, the Kuomintang regime gradually fell into the hands of some people with hooligan consciousness, foreign slave consciousness, and those "silver lice," who only knew the preciousness of power and wealth, and had little sense of justice. And the eulogy of "The revolutionaries say all the good words and do all the bad things" was sung from the mouths of the people.

I also have a historical fact, which is that in the summer of 1926, Song Ziwen was the Minister of Finance, widely selling opium and favoring people with opium addiction to run the finances, which was clearly contrary to the policies of the National Government at that time. (The National Government ordered that no one who smokes opium should be employed as a civil servant in any agency.) At that time, I was a member of the Control Yuan and impeached Song Ziwen to the National Government. Chiang Kai-shek ordered Mr. Li Zhangda, my fellow villager who was the director of the Public Security Bureau at the time, to come and talk to me, saying that now the Northern Expeditionary Army was about to set out, and impeaching Song Ziwen would shake the finances, which would be equivalent to hindering the great plan of the Northern Expedition. He asked me to withdraw the official document. I replied to him: "It is my duty to impeach officials who violate the policies of the party and the government, and the Commander-in-Chief has no right to interfere. As for shaking the finances and hindering the Northern Expedition, I do not admit it. If it is necessary to violate the policies of the party and the government to carry out the Northern Expedition, then it is better not to carry out the Northern Expedition." At that time, Mr. Tan Yankai was the acting chairman of the National Government, and he also said to me: "Chiang is very unhappy about that impeachment case, and the National Government cannot approve it, so it is better to withdraw it temporarily." I replied to him: "It is the chairman's duty to approve or not approve, and it is my duty to impeach officials for violating the law. I cannot abandon my duty and withdraw the impeachment case." The National Government never approved that case, and the hateful and shameful lie of "opium cessation ointment" has been blindly telling until now. It is said that in recent years, some local tricks have become even more wonderful, naming the organization that sells opium as "Benevolent Hall," which is truly benevolent! Benevolent! Nothing can be added.

There are two most unpromising things for people in Chinese politics: First, it is unpromising to do things and want to gain a good name. In fact, politics cannot escape the two sides of good and evil. Doing things always requires having shoulders, a conscience, and the ability to act, being worthy of the country and the people, why bother to steal a good name to cover up everything. Like the political hypocrisy and lying in recent years, it is really embarrassing to hear. For example, collecting gambling taxes is euphemistically called "defense expenses," issuing lottery tickets is euphemistically called "charity," and collecting donations from prostitutes is euphemistically called "education expenses," making the hard study of students associated with the prostitution of prostitutes, which is even more unbearable. In fact, if the government has shoulders, responsibility, and courage, then gambling donations and prostitution losses can be like other tax revenues, planned and used properly, then there is no need to take some boring good names to cover up shame. If every political event has to think of a good and beautiful name, then why not change the prison to "Paradise" and the executioner to "Send Wang Po," wouldn't that be the biggest joke in the world. Second, it is unpromising to persuade people every day to follow the example of sages and admire heroes, but have no courage to be sages and heroes themselves. Taking opium suppression as an example, people in the government talk about opium suppression and talk about Lin Zexu, but I don't understand why the people who hold power don't think about being the second Lin Zexu themselves, and only praise Lin Zexu there? In the era of Lin Zexu, opium suppression was difficult because the government was in a dark age and diplomatic politics were muddled. It was difficult for one person to be the first to advocate it. At present, opium suppression is a household name, the government has a clear order, and there are no foreigners hindering it, then the mayor of every city and the magistrate of a certain county can be Lin Zexu in their jurisdiction. But for more than a hundred years, it seems that there is only one Lin Zexu for us to admire, this country is really a bit pitiful!

Whether the government has action and the determination to do good to the people does not lie in issuing long ten-thousand-word declarations, or in those great and profound programs with outlines and items. Just start from small places. Look at whether those small and easy things have been practiced and improved. Small and easy things are still unwilling to do, or even lazy to do, then there is no need to ask about other things. When we leave the concession and go to Nanshi, or along the Beijing-Shanghai Railway to various cities all the way to Nanjing, almost every city and town, every neighborhood has a "opium cessation room" or "opium cessation center." If a foreigner who does not understand the situation in China sees it, how will they praise the thoroughness of China's opium suppression administration? They will never think of how unbearable the content is.

I firmly believe that no government should use good names to do evil things. The government must be frank and determined. Only caring about raising funds and not paying attention to the fundamental disasters of the country and the nation is already wrong. Tolerating people to smoke opium and calling it opium cessation is even more wrong. The current National Government that "tells the truth and takes responsibility" must make it clear that it does not tell political lies, and fundamentally reforms the current opium suppression system. The first easy thing to do is to strictly prohibit these shameful and despicable terms such as "opium cessation ointment." Opium must be clearly written as "opium poison ointment," the opium selling room should be called "opium poison selling place," and the merchant should be called "merchant selling opium poison smoke," so that smokers can understand the meaning of the name, and traffickers can know shame when they see the name. This does not shake the finances, (genuine opium suppression actually helps finances, which is beyond the scope of this article, so I will not go into details) but it eliminates the stain of telling lies and shows that the government tells the truth and takes responsibility. I hope that the government will not fail to do it because it is a small matter.

### How to Increase Industrial Production

— Pan Wen'an

In the past, places like Shanghai were filled with floating capital, and everyone coveted immediate gains, flocking to the path of hoarding materials, which led to a sharp rise in prices. On the surface, it became a deformed prosperity, but in reality, it was strong on the outside but weak on the inside, and social life became increasingly difficult. Some blame it on the floating capital, but the floating capital is not used properly, and the floating capital has not entered the right path. Misusing floating capital is the fault of society, and the floating capital itself is not to blame. Now, changing course, the investment of our people should change the past trend and strive to increase production, in order to complete the task of wartime economy, which has become the unanimous goal of the people of the country. How to increase production? It is definitely not something that can be completed by one aspect. The whole country should be mobilized, and consistent efforts should be made from many aspects in order to achieve its goal. Therefore, based on what I have seen and heard, I will briefly describe its outline, in order to correct it with the gentlemen of the country.

First, I hope from the Japanese authorities that China's production is backward, and its industry is immature. Japan is an advanced industrial country, and it is worthy of China's learning in every way. It is its responsibility to support and assist. At this time when the difficulties of China's production sector have reached their peak, I hope that the Japanese authorities will provide convenience to Chinese producers everywhere. All raw materials supply, machinery transportation, and technology transfer, economic accommodation, all that is within their power, should be assisted as much as possible to solve difficulties. If the inland production sector still feels a lot of pain, it seems appropriate to thoroughly investigate, strictly ban, and eliminate the past habits of humiliation and encroachment. At the same time, since the Japanese business community has called for coexistence and co-prosperity, it should also embrace the meaning of equal distribution of benefits, eliminate selfish opinions, and cooperate sincerely, so that the lifeline of China's production sector will not be frequently extinguished, this is one.

Second, I hope from our government that the government authorities have put forward increasing production as the main principle of the current nation-building. Recently, they have been wary of the misuse of investment methods in the business community, and deeply know that there is no other way to save the country than increasing production. The key to increasing production is to benefit the people, not to harm the people. If the policies that harm the people are not eliminated, and the effects of benefiting the people are not seen, China's production sector will only become increasingly depressed, and all will perish. At present, the saying of material exchange has been very noisy, but it is as difficult as ascending to heaven to transport raw materials from place A to place B, and the bad habits of difficulty at every turn and layer-by-layer exploitation are probably not completely eliminated. It is even more difficult to make industrial products unobstructed and sell in the interior. The crux of this is, such as the unsound transportation institutions, the non-specialization of tax collection agencies, the incomplete services of financial groups, the insufficient guidance and protection forces of officialdom, and the defects in various man-made aspects, and the disconnection of mutual cooperation, if our government authorities have the determination, they should gradually improve them within the possible range. Relieving the production sector of one point of pain is to increase the strength of the country by one point, and to preserve one point of vitality of the society, which is also the cornerstone of the government's self-reliance in production to save the country, this is two.

Third, I hope from the financial sector that finance is the element of production and the backing of the industrial sector, there is no financial sector that can be more united. The only difficulty in China's industry is the weakness of capital. Only because of its weak capital strength, the large-scale operation of industry is still very lacking. In peacetime, the biggest difficulties are: first, the excessively high interest rate, second, the insufficient assistance from the silver and money industry, and third, the failure to fully popularize mortgage loans and acceptance discounts, and the lack of sincere cooperation between the financial and production sectors is indeed the biggest problem. In the future, financial institutions should not carry out production loans arbitrarily without goals, but should be a sincere cooperation with steps and meaning. In particular, they should concentrate their spiritual strength and devote themselves to several important undertakings, and carry out larger-scale liaison work. Such as the recent silk industry loan syndicate, flour and wheat loan syndicate, and the cotton loan syndicate that is currently under negotiation, all belong to the entire plan, and are worthy of advocacy and support, which is an excellent atmosphere for the transformation of the lending business of today's silver and money industry, extending it to the countryside and agriculture, all of which are waiting for the financial sector to support it from beginning to end, and give it the merit of nourishing and growing. At the same time, I hope that the financial sector will urgently recruit professional talents in the future, and provide technical guidance and improvement to the lending factories. It must be known that it is better to give loans at a low profit, which is of great benefit to the production industry, than to give loans at a high profit, which does not benefit the society and the country. As long as the work is meaningful and contributes, it is worth doing. Furthermore, the Central Reserve Bank, as the bank of banks, should devote all its efforts to production in its future business policy, regardless of directly or indirectly assisting the industrial sector, and should increase production as its only concern, without any evasion. Especially for businesses such as rediscount and transfer mortgage, and the support of production syndicates, all belong to the urgent tasks, and go all out, so as not to fail its due responsibilities, this is three.

Fourth, I hope from the industrial sector itself that the recent trend of capital increase in the industrial sector is popular for a while. On the surface, it is to increase the value of the industry and to increase the profits, but in reality, it is called the value of the industry, but it is formed by the depreciation of the currency value, which results in an increase in assets on the books, and paper wealth cannot be rushed to be optimistic. However, because of this problem, the industrial sector has developed a fluke mentality, only knowing how to study how to increase shares and increase capital after the value of the industry has increased, and how to issue premiums, and all the most important issues of work, technical problems, and all organizational management, etc., have no time to pay attention to, or even disdain to pay attention to. It is said that it seems inevitable to be pedantic and cautious and not adapt to the environment to talk about personnel management, scientific management, and industrial rationalization in today's production sector, which is really a sigh. It is not known that running industry and only knowing the market price, stock price rise and fall, and disdaining to pay attention to technical management, the result is undoubtedly failure. I still remember that in 1933, when I visited the Japanese textile factory, the authorities in the factory said to me: "The Japanese factory manager is buried in the factory all day long, working on technical improvements and management rationalization, while the Chinese factory authorities spend most of their time in the exchange calculating profits and losses, or raising funds and running around the doors of the silver and money industry." It can be said that the authorities of our country's yarn factories at that time did have shortcomings that could not be avoided, and their words can be greatly appreciated, and are a head-on blow to our people. Not only yarn factories are like this, but any factory that is managed must use real effort to work hard in terms of technology and management. Otherwise, after peace, the superior will win and the inferior will be eliminated, and there is no doubt that it will be eliminated. At this time of transition and preparation, there is room for my industrial sector to study and reform. All attention to work experiments, implementation of scientific management, implementation of cost accounting, and facilities for welfare undertakings are all good opportunities to start improving today. If you do not plan for this, it will be too late to regret it. My far-sighted industrial sector will not consider these words to be far-fetched.

On this day, the whole country of Japan uniformly stopped singing, dancing, music and gatherings, and each household flew the flag at half-mast to express condolences. Where the funeral procession passed, the sidewalks were filled with citizens, and their expressions of grief and respect were overflowing. Also, today, various institutions and schools held mourning ceremonies in the morning, and then continued to have classes and work as usual. The tense situation of working hard with sorrow is truly inspiring.

Prime Minister Tojo Issues a Statement

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) Japanese Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement on the 4th, which said: "Japan, in order to seek survival, had no choice but to declare war on Britain and the United States. After that, Marshal Yamamoto assumed the position of Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, and did not fail to live up to His Majesty the Emperor's expectations and Holy Majesty, and closely cooperated with the army to launch large-scale operations in the Pacific and Indian Oceans, starting with the world-shaking Hawaiian and Malayan naval battles. He defeated enemy troops everywhere and achieved unprecedented glorious results. In this way, under the Holy Majesty, due to the brave and valiant fighting of the Japanese soldiers, in just one and a half years since the start of the war, a strategic posture of certain victory and invincibility has been established. Now that the Greater East Asia War is gradually entering the decisive stage and the war situation is becoming more and more important, at this time, the Marshal commanded the Combined Fleet on the front line, engaged in battle with the enemy in a naval aircraft, and died heroically in the southern sea. He set an example and instructed all the soldiers, which is worthy of being an example for 100 million citizens. Feeling this heroic warrior's heart, we cannot help but burst into tears. The spirit of the Marshal commanding the battle on the front line and dying heroically has made the morale of all the soldiers even more agitated, and the anti-enemy heart of the whole nation is even more strengthened. If our people are discouraged and lose their souls because of the Marshal's death, this is definitely not to comfort the Marshal's spirit. At present, the internal and external situation does not allow for any complacency. Now, the path of my 100 million people is only to take the Marshal's noble spirit as our spirit and the Marshal's great fighting spirit as our fighting spirit. We must move forward towards the destruction of Britain and the United States with a hundred battles and an indomitable heart, so as to reassure the Holy Majesty. The strategic posture of certain victory and invincibility built by the brave fighting of the Japanese army has been established. Regardless of the front or the rear, with the spirit of 100 million people as one, we must do our best to achieve a glorious victory. Here, I express my heartfelt condolences for the Marshal's death. The Marshal's spirit is still there, and I pray for the Marshal's blessings."

The gist of his broadcast is recorded as follows: "This time, Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, died heroically. His Majesty the Emperor has specially conferred the Grand Cordon of the Order of Merit, First Class, and included him in the Marshal's Office, and specially bestowed the title of Marshal, and specially bestowed a state funeral. This is truly the supreme glory for a warrior. This preferential imperial concern is truly frightening and grateful. Also, at the time of the funeral, a special imperial envoy and envoy were sent to grant the honor of an imperial visit, and we were also honored to receive the honor of a visit from His Imperial Highness, which is also extremely frightening and grateful. The heads of allied countries have also sent telegrams to express their condolences, and have awarded the highest medal and bestowed special treatment, and have been uniformly condoled by officials and people from all walks of life in the country, which is especially worthy of gratitude. The entire officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet go without saying, and all the officers and soldiers of the Navy are deeply grateful for this imperial grace, and their determination to devote their loyalty must be even stronger. The commander-in-chief personally going to the front line to command his subordinates is the traditional spirit of our country's navy. Among them, Marshal Togo specially emphasized and practiced the experience gained in the Russo-Japanese War, and taught it to the younger generation. This kind of path regardless of danger is the main reason for our country's navy to win battles. Today, the war situation is becoming more and more important, and there are many difficulties in the future, but all the officers and soldiers of my Combined Fleet, under the command of the new commander-in-chief, Admiral Koga, with the certainty of victory, inheriting the spirit of Marshal Yamamoto, loyally and courageously, bravely fight forward, and in order to win the final victory, we are determined to fight to the end with an indomitable spirit until the purpose of the holy war is completed."

The news of the heroic sacrifice of Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Allied Japanese Combined Fleet, on the front lines has deeply grieved all people in East Asia. Today marks the national funeral for Marshal Yamamoto. As we remember Marshal Yamamoto's past achievements in safeguarding East Asia, establishing everlasting merits, and as we look forward to the bright future of victory in the Greater East Asia War, we cannot help but feel inspired in addition to our grief.

The traditional spirit of Marshal Togo of the Allied Japanese Navy, further developed through the collaborative efforts of both the government and the people, has long been a great maritime wall protecting East Asia. As soon as the prelude to the Greater East Asia War began, the British and American navies were surrounded and severely attacked by the Japanese naval fleet in Pearl Harbor and near Zhao Nan Island, immediately laying the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, the Japanese navy exerted its power in the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, the East Pacific, and other places, achieving remarkable results and sweeping away all British and American naval forces. This is not only the glory of the Japanese navy, but also the glory of all East Asian nations. Marshal Yamamoto was the commander who led these invincible fleets in establishing glorious achievements. Therefore, his glory is also the glory of all East Asia. Marshal Togo wrote the first page of the glorious history of the Japanese navy with his great achievements. Every time we East Asians read this page of glorious history, we feel the greatness of the East Asian nations' fighting spirit against the enemy, the strength of the East Asian nations' power to protect East Asia, and we inspire unlimited hope in all East Asian nations. Now, Marshal Yamamoto has written the first page of the glorious war history of the East Asian navy with his military exploits and his blood, increasing the determination of all East Asian nations to protect East Asia, and inspiring the courage of all East Asian nations to defeat the enemy. Marshal Yamamoto is the first person to inherit the immortal spirit of Marshal Togo, and he has expanded and spread Marshal Togo's spirit throughout the entire universe of East Asia. Marshal Yamamoto died in battle on the front lines as the supreme commander. This traditional spirit of Japanese soldiers has further increased the admiration of all East Asian nations. Although Marshal Yamamoto's physical body has died, his spirit will forever be immortal along with the spirit of all East Asian nations to protect East Asia. Marshal Yamamoto died in battle to protect East Asia. Before the Greater East Asia War is completed, we East Asian nations, who are jointly participating in this sacred war, certainly feel boundless grief for the sacrifice of this East Asian national hero. However, when we think of Marshal Yamamoto's heroic sacrifice, it is a great honor for him personally. Moreover, Marshal Yamamoto's sacrifice will inspire all 1 billion warriors in East Asia, creating the Yamamoto spirit of all 1 billion warriors in East Asia. If everyone inherits this great and immortal spirit and engages in a decisive battle against the common enemy of all East Asian nations, then the victory of the Greater East Asia War can be accelerated, and Marshal Yamamoto's spirit in heaven can be comforted.

During the meeting, the Chairman, regarding the trends of the world war situation, pointed out that while the United Kingdom and the United States are crediting their vaunted productive power in attempting a counteroffensive, the Axis powers' absolutely invincible posture remains unshaken and no difficulty is to be feared. Since participating in the war, Chongqing has undergone profound turmoil due to the unfolding of new policies. The premise for the collapse of the Chiang regime lies in the strengthening of the National Government itself. The National Government is exerting all its efforts to ensure security and enhance production. With the vigorous development of the New National Movement, it will jointly undertake the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War. The main points of Chairman Wang's speech are as follows:

Trends in the World War Situation

The United States constantly promotes the superiority of its productive power, believing that it can use it to carry out a counteroffensive. But from the perspective of the Greater East Asia War, the United States' productive power is not at all to be feared. If they really want to implement the so-called counteroffensive, crossing the vast Pacific Ocean is impossible. Moreover, they must recapture countless islands in the Pacific one by one, so no matter how much productive power they have, they certainly have no assurance of success. It has been a year and a half since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. The Allied Japan has secured great victories, repulsed the enemy's counteroffensive, and constantly taken the offensive. The defense of Greater East Asia has the solidity of a golden fortress. The feelings of gratitude and respect cannot help but arise spontaneously.

As the ancient proverb says, "Await the weary at ease." If the United States comes to counterattack, the relative advantages of rest and fatigue are already clearly distinguished, and the outcome does not need to be divined. To respond to Japan's fierce fighting on the front lines, China should exert all its strength to eliminate any worries behind it. The recent announcement by the Soviet Union of the dissolution of the Comintern can be said to be a means of abandoning the name while retaining the substance. Relations with Chiang Kai-shek will not improve as a result.

Turmoil in Chongqing

Since January 9th, thanks to Japan's extraordinary assistance, the National Government's autonomous measures have been actively progressing. The people in the peace zone, especially the intellectual class, seem to have firm beliefs and hopes for the future of East Asia. The business people in Shanghai, who previously did not want to come forward, will truly cooperate with the National Government as the National Government's new policies unfold. On the contrary, the turmoil in Chongqing is only intensifying. The recent large-scale return of Chiang Kai-shek's direct line troops is a manifestation of this fact. Observing the inside story of the turmoil in Chongqing can be divided into two categories: one category believes that Japan's assistance to the National Government is the true and concrete path of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and therefore holds doubts about the current War of Resistance; the other category is those who lack firm opinions, who believe that the unity of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union is gradually strengthening, and therefore consider it advantageous to attach themselves to the United Kingdom and the United States. But they have no accurate predictions about this. These two contradictory ideas often cause confusion and turmoil. To induce this turmoil in Chongqing to collapse, one can only strengthen the peace zone itself. I am convinced that this is the fundamental way to deal with Chongqing.

Solidarity of the East Asian Axis

I have visited Japan two or three times, and I have also visited Manchukuo. Each time, I feel that the solidarity of the East Asian nations is getting stronger day by day. There is infinite satisfaction with the future of East Asia. Japan and China have had relations for 2,000 years, but the disputes between China and Japan only occurred 50 years ago. Tracing back from this point, 100 years ago, the United Kingdom, the United States, and Russia had already begun to encroach on China. The United Kingdom came across the sea from the south, while Russia took the land route from the north. Japan and China were equally the first to bear the brunt of aggression. The Meiji Restoration was the year of Sun Yat-sen's birth. If both China and Japan had put their houses in order and defeated the United Kingdom and the United States, then disputes would not have arisen between China and Japan. The elements of resistance that hinder China's unification should recognize that before harboring erroneous hatred towards Japan, China itself also has a responsibility. From the current point of view, China and Japan can be said to be under the great encirclement of the United Kingdom and the United States. If the United Kingdom and the United States win, then East Asia will perish. The common life and death of China and Japan, and my own thoughts, truly lie in this point.

### Argentina, South America's Only Neutral Country, Experienced a Coup d'état the Day Before Yesterday; Ramirez Has Led Troops into the Capital; President Castillo Fled by Gunboat

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news transmitted by the UK and the US, a revolution has occurred in Argentina. It is said that the main reason for the revolutionary movement is opposition to the neutral policy of the Castillo government, and several legions have also joined the rebellion. According to a Reuters report from Montevideo, after the rebels entered the city, the President decided to leave the capital and is now fleeing overseas aboard the Argentine gunboat "Drummond." General Donazz, the former Minister of the Army, and another General Rosen, have both supported the rebels. It is said that General Rosen sympathizes with democratic countries. The rebellion seems to have been launched in the town of Mío, 15 miles from the capital, and General Rosen is leading 8,000 troops from that location towards the capital. According to the United Press, the capital's defense forces clashed with the rebels on the outskirts.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters dispatch from the Argentine capital, General Ramirez, commander of the Argentine revolutionary army, issued four demands to President Castillo on the 4th, simultaneously with the uprising: (1) Change Argentina's neutral policy. (2) Cooperate with the countries of the Americas. (3) Freedom of elections. (4) Rectify Argentina's political circles.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): It is reported that when the revolution broke out on the 4th, Argentine President Castillo appointed General Marquez as the Commander-in-Chief of the punitive forces. General Marquez is currently directing punitive military operations. It is also reported that Rear Admiral Fincatti has been appointed to succeed Ramirez as Minister of Defense. According to another report, Castillo, accompanied by his cabinet members, left the capital aboard the minesweeper "Drummond," and it is reported that they have arrived in Colonia, Uruguay, across from the Argentine capital. Furthermore, it was previously reported that most of the Argentine navy participating in the revolution has joined the revolutionary army under the command of General Ramirez.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): The German news agency, citing a Montevideo report, stated that Argentine rebel leader, Minister of the Army Ramirez, declared that the purpose of the revolution was to purify Argentine politics and administration, and to fully respect all international treaties stipulating cooperation with other American republics. He also issued an ultimatum to President Castillo, which was intended to adopt a more friendly attitude towards the United States. Argentina is the only country in South America that still maintains a neutral policy. Upon receiving the ultimatum, the President ordered the appointment of General Marquez as the commander of the punitive army to quell the rebellion, while General Rosen led more than 7,000 troops from Mío and advanced towards the capital. According to Reuters, the rebels also demanded that Costa withdraw from the presidential election. Costa is a far-right politician who was proposed as a presidential candidate by President Castillo. Subsequently, Reuters issued a message from the Uruguayan capital stating that President Castillo had not resigned when he boarded the "Drummond" warship. Government troops and rebels had a fierce battle at Oliveira Square. It is heard that the air force also supported General Ramirez, but did not participate in the uprising. The navy was inactive. According to another Montevideo report received in New York, President Castillo announced in a broadcast that the Argentine government had been established on a warship, saying that the government moved to the ship when the rebels entered the capital. Reuters reported from Montevideo last night that the rebels had occupied government offices in the capital yesterday afternoon. News from the Argentine capital received in New York stated that evening newspapers had issued special editions with the headline "Revolution Successful." According to news from the Argentine capital received in New York, an interim legislative assembly was formed yesterday, chaired by General Ramirez, to take over President Castillo's government.

Radio Buenos Aires Announces: Interim Government Formed

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): Radio Buenos Aires broadcast last night a declaration by General Rosen, the leader of the Argentine revolution, stating that he had the support of the military, had formed an interim government, and had taken over all military affairs, calling on the Argentine people to believe in the new government.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Argentine capital, after the Argentine revolutionary army occupied the capital, it established an administrative committee on the 4th. Real power is in the hands of General Rosen, General Basi of the First Division, and Minister of Defense Ramirez.

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): Today, observers here expressed the opinion that the revolution that overthrew the current government in Argentina seemed to have an American conspiracy behind it, pointing out that General Ramirez, the leader of the revolution, expressed support for cooperation with the United States, and that revolutionaries shouted American propaganda war slogans when they entered the capital. It is said that, given the nature of this revolution, the manipulation of the fifth column by the American side is clearly visible, so that Argentina will abandon its neutral policy, and further proves that the policy of the United States is to drag all countries reached by its power into the current whirlpool of war. According to recent news from Washington, the United States has been actively considering a blockade measure to force this only neutral Latin American country to join the anti-Axis side, while the United States continues to exert high-pressure propaganda on Argentina.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news from Washington, Washington officials indicated that the US government will undoubtedly recognize the new Argentine government. Semi-official sources declare that Argentina will join the anti-Axis camp, sever ties with the Axis powers, and join the war.

### Chinese, Manchu, and Thai Military Attaches Express Impressions of Java

Jakarta, 5th (Central News Agency): A delegation of military attaches from China, Manchukuo, and Thailand arrived here on the 2nd. After inspecting various places, they jointly issued their impressions of visiting Java on the 4th, stating in essence: The Japanese army's occupation of Java has acquired rich resources, which is of great significance for completing the war. Our first impression of visiting Java is that Java, the land of East Asians, has now returned to East Asians. Therefore, for the sake of East Asian co-prosperity, our determination to live and die together has become even stronger. We have inspected the remains of the fierce battle at Kalijati and are deeply impressed by the great achievements of Japan in seizing such an important base in a very short time. We have also inspected the cities of Jakarta, Bandung, and Surabaya, and seeing the bright lives of the residents, we have clearly understood the harmonious and close relationship between the Japanese military police and the residents. The Overseas Chinese in Java have changed from before the war, shed their enemy ideology, and cooperated with the Japanese army. Thanks to the efforts of the military government, Java has formed a powerful base for the co-prosperity sphere. We deeply feel that the future of Java will surely be a paradise for Greater East Asia.

### Italian Torpedo Squadron Active off the Coast of North Africa; 60,000 Tons of Enemy Ships Sunk in Six Nights; Defenses of Pantelleria Island Consolidated

Rome, 5th (Stefani News Agency): Italian torpedo planes have been attacking enemy maritime traffic near the African coast, sinking more than 60,000 tons of enemy ships in six nights. Although the enemy uses great force to protect ships and the attack location is close to the enemy base, Italian aircraft continue to carry out this difficult task without slackening.

Rome, 5th (Stefani News Agency): The situation of the first bombardment of the Italian island of Pantelleria by four British destroyers on June 1st is as follows: around 6:00 PM on the 1st, a team of enemy ships, consisting of four destroyers, was discovered off the north coast of the island and immediately opened fire, bombarding the shore. The coastal artillery immediately returned fire. After both sides exchanged fire several times, the Italian artillery hit one of the enemy ships. The ship was damaged and sailed westward, with flames seen on board. The remaining three ships also ceased fighting and escaped towards Malta under the cover of smoke. It is now known that after the Italian coastal artillery inflicted losses on the enemy, the enemy ships have all withdrawn from the vicinity of the island. The island's artillery has shot down several enemy planes. Pantelleria Island has now become the first line of Italian defense. The garrison and residents of the island have no fear of attacks by the United Kingdom and the United States, and are working more closely together to prepare for any eventuality.

Rome, 5th (Central News Agency): Local people commenting on the recent resistance of Pantelleria Island to the attacks by the anti-Axis naval and air forces believe that the island has an excellent terrain and very solid defenses, because its harbor is unusually small, making it difficult for even the smallest warships to enter. The island's air harbor is also impossible to land on without knowing the local terrain. The whole island is mostly mountainous, and military operations are impossible without knowing the routes. Therefore, most of the island's garrison is recruited from local residents, and the island has a population of about 10,000 people.

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a dispatch from the Stockholm Social Democratic Newspaper's correspondent in London, talk of invading Europe has greatly decreased in London. Most of the discussion is now focused on invading the small island of Pantelleria in the Mediterranean, rather than Europe. British military observer Wilson believes that attacks by naval and air forces may isolate the island and make it impossible to defend, and that it is also necessary to attack the nearby islands of Linosa and Lampedusa as soon as possible.

### 6,000 American Casualties in the Battle of Attu

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency): The U.S. Navy Department's report on American casualties on Attu Island is, as usual, a false statement. It initially claimed that the American army suffered only 600 casualties, but on the 4th, it said that the total number of casualties was 1,535. The statements are extremely contradictory, and are no longer trusted by its citizens. Because American citizens, after receiving news from the Japanese headquarters, already knew that the American army on Attu Island had actually suffered 6,000 casualties. The New York Times criticized that this statement was clearly intended to underestimate the extent of the damage, and this is a false official statement.

Buenos Aires, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of the Army Stimson announced that the total number of American soldiers captured since the start of the war has reached 78,083, of which 11,307 were captured by the Japanese army.

### Tensions on the Eastern European Front; Major Battles to Erupt; German Army Wins Decisive Battle at the Mouth of the Kuban River

Stockholm, 5th (Central News Agency): According to a Reuters dispatch from its correspondent in Moscow, the situation is quite tense as major battles are expected to erupt on all fronts. Artillery fire roared all day in the Lisichansk region of the Donets front, and a major German offensive is expected soon. In the Kuban region northeast of Novorossiysk, Soviet troops continue to pressure the German defense lines, but are limited by narrow mountain passes and valleys, making it impossible to deploy large forces. The German Air Force continues to heavily bomb the Soviet supply lines and supply bases on the Eastern Front.

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency): According to news from the Eastern Front, the third decisive battle in the Kuban River estuary area, which began on May 31, seems to have come to an end on the 3rd of this month under the absolute advantage of the German army after several days of fierce fighting.

### Churchill Arrives in London

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - According to London sources, British Prime Minister Churchill, who departed from Washington last week, arrived in London this morning after stopping in Algiers and Tunis. Foreign Secretary Eden and Chief of the General Staff Brooke accompanied him. Eden joined the Prime Minister's party in Algiers. The group reportedly visited General Eisenhower, Commander of the U.S. Allied Forces in North Africa, and also met with Giraud and members of the new French Committee of National Liberation before proceeding to Tunis to inspect the anti-Axis forces. It is noted that Churchill flew from the U.S. to Gibraltar a week ago, then directly to Algiers to meet with Eden. Reuters reports that the two did not participate in the conversations of Giraud.

### New U.S. Pacific Submarine Force Commander

Lisbon, 5th (Central News Agency) - Washington D.C. dispatches report that the U.S. Navy Department announced yesterday that Rear Admiral Lockwood has been appointed as Commander of the U.S. Submarine Force in the Pacific. Rear Admiral English, who originally held this position, passed away in the Pacific a few months ago, and therefore Lockwood will succeed him.

### Japanese Ambassador to Moscow

Kuybyshev, 5th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Naotake Satō, along with First Secretary Takeuchi and five other embassy staff members, departed for Moscow by plane yesterday.

### Recent Situation in Bulgaria

(Special Dispatch from Sofia by Umeda, 28th) Bulgarians, known as the "Japanese of the Balkans," have become increasingly tense recently due to the urgency of the situation in the Mediterranean and the looming war clouds over the Balkan Peninsula. During this significant period, from mid-February of this year until recently, terrorist incidents have occurred throughout the country, casting a heavy shadow on the national psyche. The list of victims includes General Lukov, revered as the father of the modern Bulgarian army, former Sofia Police Chief Captain Pantev, and Chairman of the Parliamentary Foreign Affairs Committee, Mr. Yanev. Two major sweeps were recently conducted in the capital Sofia, resulting in the apprehension of dozens of hidden criminals. As a result, it became clear that certain assassination cases were carried out on the instructions of the Third International, while others were aided by the British Secret Intelligence Service. Furthermore, several clandestine radio stations were discovered, including stations in Sofia transmitting to the West and to the Soviet Union, as well as a station in the commercial city of Philippopolis between Sofia and Istanbul transmitting to the West, and a station in the Black Sea port of Varna transmitting to the Soviet Union. Most notably, among the criminals, not only were six Jews directly involved in terrorist acts, but two of them were the actual assassins. Consequently, the government has recently adopted fairly stringent measures against all Jews. 13,000 Jews from strategically important areas along the Aegean coast, Thrace, and the hinterland of Salonika (Macedonia), were relocated to Poland in March of this year. These Balkan Jews, unlike those in other countries, exhibit a blatant defiance. The recent turbulent situation in Bulgaria is, of course, due to the secret operations of the British, Americans, and Soviets, each from their different perspectives, seeking to control this gateway to West Asia. The British and Americans aim to plunge Bulgaria into anarchy through these terrorist acts and to sever the ties between the well-trained Bulgarian army and the Axis powers.

Moreover, this is not limited to Bulgaria; in Greece, Serbia, Dalmatia, and other regions, the British and Americans are also carrying out such plots, especially along the Adriatic coast, where armed groups are carrying out terrorist acts. Bulgarian military experts have warned: "Pay attention to the Adriatic Sea!" The Soviet Union's thinking differs from the British and American method of separating the Balkans from Germany. The Soviet Union aims to incorporate Bulgaria, Romania, Yugoslavia, and Greece into its sphere of influence, forming a Balkan federation. In Serbia, Montenegro, parts of Albania, and Greece, the Soviet Union has considerable influence, countering the armed groups of the British and Americans to suppress their activities in these areas.

Therefore, the Anglo-American and Soviet strategies for the Balkans and their cooperation in Sofia are not only not in harmony, but they also harbor mutual suspicion, with an insurmountable divide existing between them.

The Soviet Union's goal of forming a Balkan federation is to seek an exit from the Dardanelles Strait to the Mediterranean Sea, consistently inheriting the plans of the Tsarist era. Before the German-Soviet war, Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov, during a visit to Berlin, stated: First, the Soviet Union should build Soviet bases on the Romanian and Bulgarian coasts. Second, it demanded that the Dardanelles Strait be managed by the Soviet Union. Later, Molotov's deputy, Potemkin, revealed the same demands during a visit to Bulgaria.

This fundamental Soviet policy toward the Balkans poses a great threat to Turkey, far exceeding the threat felt by Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries. Bulgaria, Romania, and other countries joined Germany and Italy, hoping to obtain guarantees of a fair new order and prospects. Turkey, due to its territorial holdings in a corner of the Balkans, intends to rely on the guarantee of the British and Americans to reduce the threat from the Soviet Union. The question is whether the British and Americans can provide such a guarantee to Turkey.

The British Ninth and Tenth Armies stationed in Iran and Iraq are poorly organized, while the First and Eighth Armies have just returned from the Tunisian war and are exhausted and in need of a long period of rest. Both require strengthening and reorganization, and the time required will be quite long. Turkey, aware of this, will at least maintain strict neutrality until the end of October of this year, calmly observing the developments of the German-Soviet war that will determine its own fate, hoping for a German victory. In this way, West Asia can forever remain under the balance of power of the British. The aforementioned assassination and terrorist acts are a desperate measure carried out by the anti-Axis side under these circumstances. The British and Americans, in order to make these terrorist acts an effective political check and balance strategy, use Jews to carry out various propaganda activities, making the general population of the Balkans feel that a war is about to break out in the Balkans, or that the cities of the Balkan states will soon be subjected to heavy bombing. However, judging from the direct and indirect meetings between the top leaders of Germany and Italy and King Boris III of Bulgaria and other Balkan heads of state, 35 million people have formed a Balkan defense line against the aggression of all hostile countries. Moreover, although the Bulgarian army has not yet participated in actual combat, it has accumulated a great deal of experience in the past, and its military organization is suitable for modern warfare. Therefore, Bulgaria, standing on the front line of the Balkan defense, participating as a member of the Axis alliance, will play an important role in Southeastern Europe.

### Remembering Disaster Victims as the Dragon Boat Festival Approaches - Urgent Fundraising for North China - Mr. Li of Dinghai Generously Donates 100,000 Yuan - Various Industries Automatically Cut Back on Feasts and Donate the Savings

Regarding the fundraising efforts for the disaster relief in North China, it has been nearly a month since the initiative was launched. Since the establishment of the Shanghai Emergency Relief Committee, various industries have become more aware of the severity of the disaster situation and the urgency of relief efforts. Under the promotion and guidance of leaders from all sectors, the number of donations has been increasing daily. As we approach the Dragon Boat Festival, we in Shanghai, thinking of the plight of the disaster victims in North China who lack clothing and food, are all willing to save as much as possible on festival expenses to contribute to the relief funds, hoping to fulfill our duty as compatriots to help each other in times of hardship, even if only to a small extent. The relief funds collected by this newspaper yesterday alone amounted to over 160,000 yuan, with Mr. Li of Dinghai donating 100,000 yuan alone, generously contributing with a sense of urgency and public spirit.

### Emergency Meeting of the Zhang Case Support Association Yesterday

Since the Zhang Jinhai tragedy occurred, the Chinese people have unanimously advocated that the perpetrators of the crime be punished as they deserve. Unexpectedly, the French police did not prosecute Guo Shiyuan and others. After receiving this information, the Zhang Case Support Association convened an emergency meeting yesterday afternoon, gathering representatives from the Shanghai First Special District, Second Special District, Municipal Joint Association, Shanghai Special City Farmers Association, Performing Arts Association, Li Jiao Society, Embroidery Industry Guild, Antique Industry Guild, Stone Powder Industry Guild, Fresh Food Industry Guild, Pawnshop Industry Guild, Used Western Clothing Industry Guild, Dyeing and Laundry Industry Guild, Hosiery Industry Guild, Suspenders Industry Guild, Used Clothing Industry Staff Association, Chinese and Foreign Cloth Industry Staff Association, Dongyang Shanghai Native Place Association, Chongqi Hai Shanghai Native Place Association, Anhui Shanghai Native Place Association, Changzhou Shanghai Native Place Association, and other organizations. At the meeting, it was unanimously resolved to continue to provide more vigorous assistance to the Zhang Jinhai tragedy, and would only stop when the goal of punishing the murderers was achieved. The resolutions of the association are recorded as follows: (1) Issue a declaration; (2) Dispatch representatives to form a petition group to request the competent authorities to severely punish the principal and accessory offenders as a warning to others; (3) Appeal to the press to uphold justice in public opinion and redress the grievances; (4) Urge the handling lawyers Shao Bao, San Gao Yun, Lv Ke Gu Ruwen to exert their legal strength to severely punish the principal offenders; (5) Offer condolences to the victim's family. The Support Association also issued a declaration, believing that the failure to prosecute Guo Shiyuan and the other three offenders was difficult to understand, and that Guo should be openly executed to demonstrate justice. However, the French authorities were biased in many ways, such as when the French police requested the Second Special Court to release Guo on bail, which was rejected. They also requested that Guo's shackles be removed, which was also rejected. Now that the Second Special Court has begun formal trials of Guo and others, in order to ensure the safety of the lives of compatriots in the French Concession, attention should be paid to its development. It is also hoped that the French Concession authorities will impose severe penalties on the perpetrators of the Zhang case.

### Representatives of Shanghai Cemetery Graveyard Owners Petition in Beijing

The Jiangwan Shanghai Cemetery has been established for 20 years, covering an area of several hundred acres, with over 2,000 tenant families. The scale is vast. Due to the excavation of graves and the removal of hundreds of coffins, representatives of the graveyard owners have been dispatched to Beijing to petition the Central Party Headquarters, the Executive Yuan, the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, and other departments to protect the cemetery. It is reported that the authorities have summoned the representatives and instructed them to await verification and handling.

### Brief Commentary - "Convention on Saving on Banquets"

We have repeatedly proposed practicing wartime living, starting with saving on consumption. Banquets, in particular, are among the most extravagant forms of consumption. Everyone uses banquets to express joy, to convey emotions, and to discuss matters. This is originally not unreasonable in terms of life and friendship. However, in large cities, due to the convenience of material enjoyment, it has gradually become an excessive and extravagant display, simply wasting materials. When we think of the "lack of food" and "lack of satiety" of our compatriots in disaster areas, soldiers on the front lines, and the poor masses, we always feel unbearable. Therefore, we would like to suggest and advocate a "Convention on Saving on Banquets." When hosting a banquet, one must abide by the provisions of this convention and automatically practice it in the spirit of "keeping faith." The content of this convention generally includes the following points:

(1) No foreign wine. Limited use of wine.

(2) No shark fin soup or bird's nest.

(3) No cigarettes provided.

(4) No singing girls hired.

(5) Specify the lowest-priced banquet in the restaurant.

(6) The amount of dishes should be enough to eat, finish, and not waste.

(7) Banquet time should not exceed two hours.

(8) The chauffeur's meal expenses should be self-paid.

The above are just some of the points that come to mind at the moment. Please readers express opinions to supplement and correct. If you agree to participate, please specify your name and occupation and send a letter to this newspaper to be published at any time for joint supervision and compliance.

Further, use the savings to donate to North China disaster relief, contribute to various good deeds, and provide to the government as national donations.

### Sports: Shanghai-Dalian Games: Shanghai Preliminary Selection to Be Held This Afternoon

### Economic Circle: Brief Comments: Commercial Profits and Public Life

Limiting profits is a condition required by controlled economic ideologies; stabilizing people's livelihood is a condition required by wartime economic policies. Therefore, the coordination of the above two conditions is absolutely necessary. Limiting merchants' profits is precisely to suppress commodity prices, and suppressing commodity prices is precisely to stabilize people's lives. This is perfectly clear.

The serious situation caused by the strike of more than 500,000 coal miners in the United States has forced us to trace the cause. Originally, what the American coal miners demanded was better living standards, but the result was that the mine owners raised coal prices, which directly affected the cost of various industries and indirectly increased the prices of various commodities. What the miners gained was only a nominal increase in wages, because prices, due to the mine owners raising coal prices, increased more than wages; the result of this chain reaction was a serious strike wave that was somewhat out of control.

Because of this "lesson," we feel even more that in the difficult wartime situation of people's lives, limiting commercial profits is indeed an important issue worthy of deep consideration. The profits of industrial and commercial enterprises with lower costs should certainly be limited, and the profits of industrial and commercial enterprises with large-scale operations should especially be limited; the so-called large-scale refers to some monopolistic enterprises, or those that supply military needs, or those that regulate supply and demand in the market. Because the larger the scale of industrial and commercial operations, the greater the impact of their every move on the prices of daily necessities.

In a word, legitimate industrial and commercial circles should take "national economy" and "public life" as the premise of their operations, and should not take "profit" as their prerequisite, because only when commercial profits are rationalized can commodity prices be rationalized.

### Merchants in All Industries Settle Accounts for the Dragon Boat Festival; Banks and Money Houses Consolidate Credit; Agricultural Product Loans Will Be Accommodated as Much as Possible

Tomorrow is the Dragon Boat Festival account settlement period. Companies, factories, and firms have distributed lists and sent staff to collect outstanding customer accounts. During the settlement period, all transactions are limited to cash. At the same time, for all matured loans to banks and firms, whether secured or unsecured, funds are being transferred and managed to repay them in order to maintain the inherent credit of commerce.

Market Finance

Due to the Dragon Boat Festival, banks and firms are particularly busy with collections and disbursements, and the amount of check clearing has surged. Market finance is tighter than before due to the preparation of reserves by banks and money houses and the tightening of loans by the Central Reserve Bank. However, legitimate needs of various industries, such as loans for purchasing spring cocoons, wheat, and rapeseed, will be accommodated as much as possible, with the aim of reviving the rural economy.

### North China Political Affairs Commission Stipulates Grain Prices

(Beijing, 5th, Central News Agency) The North China Political Affairs Commission announced the following (prices per 100 kilograms near the railway lines): Wheat 165 yuan, millet 139 yuan, corn 129 yuan, sorghum 109 yuan. This price determination will be implemented simultaneously throughout North China starting from June 21st. Those who violate this price for buying and selling will have the food purchased by the buyer and the profits exceeding the price by the seller confiscated, and will be severely punished. However, the prices in the Su-Huai area will be determined separately based on this price and in consideration of the local market price. In addition, due to the special economic relations in Shanxi Province, this stipulated price may be determined separately with the local procurement and transportation agency as the center. The current regulations apply to various regions in the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan.

### Municipal Economic Bureau Restores Price Review Committee

In order to effectively promote central laws and regulations and actively adjust prices in this city, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau, in accordance with the provisions of Article 4 of the Provisional Regulations for Stabilizing Prices, has restored the Municipal Price Review Committee. All statutory committee members have been appointed by relevant agencies in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Organizational Regulations for Central County and City Price Review Committees. The committee has now been organized and will convene its first inaugural meeting on the 9th of this month.

### News of Chinese Stocks

Chinese stocks, which had been sluggish for many days, suddenly showed their edge yesterday, and people from all sides are optimistic. Investors are increasingly eager to buy before the holiday. Among the new pharmaceutical stocks, Sino-French Pharmacy continued its upward trend from the previous day and reached an unprecedented new high price. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory also rose by more than one yuan, and buying interest also arose. The rise in department store stocks is still slight, with Wing On, Sincere, and China National Products each rising by several yuan. China Underwear rose slightly, and King Fook Shirt and Socks took the lead in rising by one yuan. The textile industry was also favored by buyers, with Wing On Textile suddenly breaking through a major barrier, and China Dyeing also showing higher prices. Nanyang Tobacco Company was firm; Great China Match Company still showed a slight decline. Shanghai Municipal North District Water & Electricity, China Electric Company, and Kung Sing Electric and other Chinese stocks are also progressing in the same upward direction. In the cultural industry, Chung Hwa Book Company rebounded close to a major barrier; World Publishing remained flat; the transaction price of The Commercial Press actually fell. In addition, various miscellaneous stocks, such as Chiu An Industrial and Tung Yih Trust, are trending firmly; New Estates and China Timber are also in greater demand than supply.

Also, it is reported that when the Chinese stock industry merchants held a regular dinner meeting the day before yesterday, everyone believed that investing in Chinese stocks should be provided with the latest and most recent reference materials. Therefore, it was decided to start widely soliciting customers after the Dragon Boat Festival to subscribe to the latest "Pocket Chinese Stock Treasure Book" jointly distributed by the Yao Gu Daily News and the Enterprise Weekly Society. Because the book is still being compiled, it will be published in mid-July.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: Remained firm yesterday. People are optimistic. Because it is heard that stocks and other lines are firm, public bonds cannot fall. Five types all saw upward squeezing, but trading was not active.

Gold and Silver: Local jewelry stores of this city, Da Hsin Tong, listed the price of jewelry gold at the beginning of the market, still exchanging at the limited price. Trading inside and outside the industry was not active. The price is rising in the trading, not far from the limited price, but there is little trading. The market condition of refined silver has not changed.

### Deadline for Selling Stockpiled Goods Has Passed; Materials Investigation Enters Tense Phase

Regarding the military procurement associations involved in hoarding incidents, the embassy has made a clear statement. Furthermore, Chen Gongbo, concurrent chairman of the Materials Investigation Committee, made a speech. At present, all parties are extremely concerned about thoroughly investigating hoarding, and the deadline specified for selling stockpiled goods before June 2 has also passed. Therefore, it is expected that the authorities will soon convene the first Materials Investigation Committee meeting.

According to the organizational outline of the Materials Investigation Committee passed at the Supreme National Defense Conference on May 13, more than twenty days have passed, and during these twenty days, the key points of the investigation policy have also been formulated, and it is heard that the list of investigators has also been internally determined. Therefore, when the first committee meeting is held soon, it will definitely be able to actively start dealing with the hoarding problem.

Article 8 of the Regulations for Punishing Major Commodities Hoarding, promulgated on May 3, clearly stipulates that members of non-major commodities industry associations who hoard materials before the implementation of the regulations should report to the competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of the regulations and sell them to the industry association at the limited price. Article 9 stipulates that members of major commodities industry associations who hoard materials before the implementation of the regulations should register with the competent authority within one month from the date of implementation of the regulations.

According to the deadline, it expired on June 2. Therefore, it is generally believed that the Materials Investigation Committee will use the registration before June 2 as the basis to start the investigation work, and the handling of the hoarding problem has left the preparation period and reached the stage of starting a comprehensive investigation. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland New Report of June 5)

### Authorities Decide to Crack Down on Firms Not Members of Associations

Industry associations in this city are complying with the intentions of the authorities. In order to adapt to the wartime system and strengthen their organizations, they have all been adjusted and reorganized separately, and are handling member registration. Legitimate businesses in each industry must join the association to maintain their business. It is understood that at present, the industry associations are actively handling member registration, and the deadline is approaching, in order to sort out and report to the authorities for review. As for stores that do not join the association or are found to be uncooperative after review, the authorities will crack down on them and order banks and money houses not to deal with them in order to maintain the law.

### Public Life: The Life of Civil Servants

— Chen Liqing

I have read articles about the lives of bank clerks and postal workers in this column before. In today's world of soaring prices, it is indeed difficult to make a living, but civil servants working in the government have a much harder time than bank clerks and postal workers, because the treatment of civil servants is restricted by qualifications and regulations, and is still based on the "Provisional Salary Table for Civil Officials, etc." promulgated on September 23, 1933, and amended on September 23, 1936.

The regulations of the official salary table stipulate that the entrusted level ranges from grade six to grade one, with a salary from 55 yuan to 200 yuan. Among the staff employed by each government agency, the number of entrusted grades three, four, and five is the largest. The monthly salary for grade five is 130 yuan, grade four is 140 yuan, and grade five is 160 yuan. It can also be said that the above numbers are the general standard for the salaries of civil servants. Although the government authorities, in order to make civil servants feel at ease in their service, issued a general order to affiliated agencies starting in November and December of the 30th year of the Republic to issue two temporary subsidies of 80%, those with a monthly salary of 160 yuan can receive a temporary subsidy of 160% totaling 256 yuan, for a total of 416 yuan; those with 140 yuan will receive a total of 364 yuan in salary and subsidies; those with 130 yuan will receive a total of 338 yuan in salary and subsidies, and so on. However, the position of a staff member receiving a basic salary of 160 yuan is already at the level of "section chief" or "chief clerk." The integrity of civil servants varies from corrupt to honest, but "the honest remain honest, and the corrupt remain corrupt." If a comparison is made between the honest and the corrupt, there are still more honest people than corrupt people. However, to bring things back, the treatment of civil servants is so low, and the standard of living is so high, those who are honest do not necessarily dislike money themselves, but most of them have other concerns and are unwilling to become corrupt.

I recall that before the 17th year of the Republic, during the military era, the monthly salary of staff handling likin taxes was mostly only six yuan, but the monthly food cost was seven yuan. The income from salary was not even enough to eat, so the staff came up with all sorts of ways to make money. Later, when the National Revolutionary Army came south, the likin tax was abolished and taxes were increased. The treatment of civil servants was also improved accordingly, and their lives were adjusted, and corruption naturally decreased. I think that using the current treatment of civil servants to manage their real lives is really likely to step into the era before the 17th year of the Republic. I think: civil servants are not provided with food and lodging. Now, if you pay for meals on a monthly basis, isn't each meal nearly 200 yuan per person? If you add up the three meals of breakfast, lunch, and dinner, one person's food expenses alone will cost more than 500 yuan. According to the salary schedule in the Civil Official Rank Salary Table, plus two temporary additional subsidies, unless you add the basic salary of the recommended rank, it is really difficult for one person to "eat" alone.

About two months ago, I read in the newspaper that the government authorities were suggesting ways to improve the lives of civil servants, and that daily necessities were planned to be rationed. Which of us civil servants does not hope that this plan will succeed? We also hope that it will be realized as soon as possible, so that we can reduce the suffering of our civil servants' lives as soon as possible.
