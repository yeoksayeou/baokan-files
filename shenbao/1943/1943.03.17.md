### Earnestly Guarantee Civil Servants' Livelihood

Good governance requires good people to implement it. Because without good people to implement good governance, the laws will not be fully executed, but will simply become empty words on paper. Since joining the war, the National Government has actively established a wartime system, and almost all wartime governance laws are "available in full." But the most important issue is still the issue of governing people, that is, who will implement these laws. There is no doubt that today's government, within a certain limit, is already striving to implement meritocracy. But at the same time, there are two other issues: First, can the existing "governing people," especially the middle and lower-level civil servants, wholeheartedly devote themselves to the implementation of the new policies? Second, if many talented people outside the government cannot be concentrated around the national policy and work together to promote the national policy, then what will be the future of all "governance laws?" We still cannot find satisfactory answers to these two questions. Why? Although there are many reasons, the lack of guarantee for the actual lives of ordinary civil servants is the most important point to consider. Therefore, after calling for improving the lives of civil servants, we are once again calling for guaranteeing the lives of civil servants.

The biggest problem facing middle and lower-level civil servants at present is the suffering of material life caused by the continuous soaring of prices. Because the formal salary of a middle-level civil servant is only enough to feed himself; and the meager income of a low-level civil servant is not even enough to maintain his own life. How can he be expected to be loyal to his duties? As a result, those with mediocre qualifications regard the officialdom as a temporary lodging, and only focus on outside business. Although this situation may not be a universal reality across the country, it is definitely not a groundless alarmist statement. If this phenomenon is not effectively remedied, then the civil servants in office will not be able to wholeheartedly devote themselves to their duties, and it will be even more difficult to attract talented people from outside the government. In that case, we really cannot be optimistic about the effectiveness of all wartime government orders.

Therefore, we sincerely urge the government authorities once again: First, immediately improve the material treatment of middle and lower-level civil servants through legislation, either by setting standards for salaries and allowances on a monthly basis based on the price index, or by providing food and daily necessities based on the family situation and actual income and expenditure of civil servants, so as to maintain the minimum living standards of individuals and families, so that they can serve the public with peace of mind and no longer have worries about the future. Second, regardless of whether they are civil or military, male or female, stipulate annual salary increases, medical assistance, subsidies for children's education, and pension systems for civil servants at all levels, and strictly implement performance evaluation and attendance methods, so that civil servants have spiritual comfort and can also make them work seriously. Our ideal meritocratic politics, clean politics, and strong politics can only be fully realized after the above two methods are implemented and both material and spiritual guarantees are in place.

To realize the above two requirements, it may be quite difficult given the current state of national finances; because it will inevitably increase a large amount of government expenditure, but if the authorities have far-sighted vision and great courage, they must not be constrained by increasing government expenses. Because after the lives of civil servants are guaranteed and political efficiency is improved, the benefits reaped by the country are impossible to estimate with numbers. Moreover, after providing spiritual and material guarantees for civil servants, meritocracy can be effectively realized. In addition, with the guarantee of civil servants' lives, corruption can be completely eliminated and politics can be completely cleaned up, and the so-called clean politics can be realized. Then, although the government will have one more expenditure now, the harvest tomorrow will be unlimited. We, the people, would rather spend this extra money in the hope of strengthening the government and clarifying politics, rather than having it consumed in the dark. We read about Mr. Yasuoka Masahiro's feelings about the current Japanese parliament as reported by the Tokyo Yomiuri Shimbun on the 7th of this month, which said: "Under the wartime system, the spirit and integrity of the people should be stimulated as much as possible. Therefore, the laws should be as simple as possible, and it is imperative to have good people to govern." We also have a deep feeling about the current political situation in our country. We hope that the wise authorities will resolutely and persistently guarantee the lives of civil servants and lay the foundation for a sound political system.

### Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Tokyo; Received in Audience by the Emperor Yesterday Afternoon; Reported on His Visit to China

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo returned to Fukuoka on the night of the 15th after visiting the National Government after its participation in the war. He stayed overnight in Osaka and arrived safely in Tokyo at 12:05 pm today.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Prime Minister Tojo entered the Imperial Palace at 2:30 pm on the 16th to pay his respects to the Emperor, reported on his visit to China, and answered all inquiries from the Emperor.

Tokyo, 16th (Central News Agency) - The visit of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo to China has made the relationship between China and Japan even closer, and the determination of the two countries' people to cooperate and strive for the final victory will surely be even stronger. In addition to the detailed coverage of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China in yesterday's evening editions, all the newspapers here unanimously published editorials in their morning editions today, discussing its significance. For example, the Yomiuri Hochi editorial, entitled "Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to China," stated that Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China to meet with Chairman Wang of the National Government and hold sincere talks was an unprecedented event in Japanese history. It also pointed out that Japan's repeated statements of respecting China's freedom and independence have now been fully materialized. The general idea is that Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is of great significance. First, it is the first time that a prime minister has visited a foreign country in his capacity as prime minister. It is especially unprecedented for Prime Minister Tojo to visit the capital of an allied country standing on the same front at the time of decisive battle and to have heart-to-heart talks with its head of state and senior officials. The Prime Minister's trip was to convey Japan's determination to strive for the final victory in the Greater East Asia War and to encourage the morale of the Allied forces. Second, since the Konoe Statement was issued, the relationship between China and Japan has become closer due to Prime Minister Tojo's visit, and a decisive stage has been marked in the future relationship between China and Japan. According to historical records, although opinions vary on our country's policy toward China since the Meiji era, its consistent policy has never changed. For example, although the Konoe Statement was issued during the Sino-Japanese Incident, its respect for China's independence is a manifestation of the traditional spirit of our country's policy toward China. The subsequent Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was also the same. After China's participation in the war, our country declared the return of concessions in China, the abolition of extraterritorial rights, and the cancellation of interference in administration. The so-called conversion of policy toward China is a temporary measure taken during the war and has not fundamentally changed our country's consistent policy in history. Since the Konoe Statement was issued, our country has repeatedly stated its respect for China's freedom and independence. Recently, at the time of China's participation in the war, Prime Minister Tojo visited Allied China in his capacity as the current prime minister, making the Sino-Japanese relationship enter a new era. In the future, Allied China will be able to cooperate more closely with our country, and its significance is extremely important and great. Also, the Mainichi Shimbun editorial stated that on the second day of Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China, the Sino-Japanese Concession Return Committee formally signed the agreement on the implementation details of Japan's return of the concession and the attached understanding matters in Nanjing, the capital of China, and stipulated that all Japanese concessions in China would be formally returned to China on March 30. The construction of roads, bridges, etc. in each concession will also be completely transferred to China without compensation. The National Government also confirmed all the real estate and other rights and interests of the Japanese government and its residents in the concession. Therefore, our country's concessions in China will be returned to China on March 30, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital, according to the agreement. It has been more than forty years since our country opened concessions in China, and it has been a foothold for our overseas Chinese to develop to the mainland and a base for the activities of Japanese residents in China. Now, it will be returned to China. We have unlimited feelings about this. However, thinking that the return of the concession is the basis for striving for a fair new policy toward China, we are even more delighted. Not only will Allied China gain independence and integrity of sovereign rights, but the relationship between China and Japan will also become closer as a result. It is believed that our local overseas Chinese will also warmly welcome and celebrate based on their overall view. In short, Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China and the signing of the detailed agreement on the return of the concession by China and Japan have made great contributions to tightening Sino-Japanese relations and completing the common war. Therefore, our country should overcome all difficulties and strive to implement policies to assist in the strengthening of the National Government. The National Government will also surely understand our country's true intentions and respond to our sincerity with sincerity, sincerely love our overseas Chinese in China, and at the same time respect our country's policies. Various departments will implement measures to promote the completion of the common war.

### Progress of Japan's Policy Toward China; Broadcasting Speech by Minister of Information, Kotomi, Last Night

Nanjing, 16th (Central News Agency) - Minister of Information of the Japanese Embassy, Kotomi, gave a broadcasting speech on the radio station on the evening of the 16th, entitled "The Progress of Japan's Policy Toward China." His main point was that "Prime Minister Tojo flew to Nanjing on the 13th to express his gratitude to Chairman Wang of the National Government for visiting Japan last December and to express his respect for China's participation in the war, met with Chairman Wang, held sincere talks, and sincerely exchanged opinions with the National Government authorities. The relationship between China and Japan has been strengthened. China and Japan originally had a close relationship. The development of Japan is also the development of China, and the prosperity of China is also the prosperity of Japan. Therefore, Japan takes cooperation with China in restoring sovereignty as the basic policy toward China. When the National Government returned to Nanjing, China and Japan signed the basic treaty. Japan, in accordance with its established promises, abolished extraterritorial rights in China and returned the concessions. On January 9 of this year, the Sino-Japanese Agreement was signed, recognizing China's recovery of the Beijing Legation District and the Shanghai and Xiamen Public Concessions. Since March 4, the Sino-Japanese Committee has actively carried out negotiations and signed the agreement on the return of the special concessions in Hangzhou, Suzhou, Hankou, Shashi, Tianjin, Fuzhou, Xiamen, and Chongqing on the 14th, scheduling the implementation ceremony for March 30, the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. At the same time, the members of the committee on the abolition of extraterritorial rights are currently conducting negotiations with the Chinese side and hope that they can also be realized soon. At this point, the relationship between China and Japan has become increasingly close."

### Ambassador Aikawa Pays Respects at the Mausoleum in Nanjing

### North China Actively Increases Production; Prices Will Not Rise

Beijing, 16th (Central News Agency) - After the National Government joined the war, the position of North China in various aspects such as politics and economy has become increasingly important. In the past, various policies in North China relied heavily on the comprehensive cooperation of friendly countries to advance, but in the future, it will depend on the efforts of North China itself to contribute to the restoration of the country and cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Under this new policy, how will everything in North China progress, especially how will the economy of North China be rebuilt, which is particularly noteworthy. North China is the region with the most abundant production of materials such as coal, iron, cotton, and salt in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and bears the important task of a military base. Therefore, the development and increased production of these industries should be planned first. The specific measures for this are currently being actively carried out by the authorities. Under this new policy, how will the organization of various Sino-Japanese joint ventures be adjusted and reorganized? This is a pressing matter, but the first thing to consider is that materials such as coal, iron, and salt are important military resources indispensable for winning the final victory of the war, and the importance of the transportation, communication, and electricity industries that complement them is also equal. Therefore, in the adjustment and reorganization, the principle should be not to reduce the productivity of such industries and hinder their operation. Therefore, although the organization of the institutions will have some reforms in form in the future, there will be no changes in substance. Regarding the actual adjustment situation, on the 8th of this month, the military management of 59 factories was lifted, and the five most important coal mines, including Zhongxing, Dakou, Cixian, Shanxi Yangquan, etc., established joint-venture limited liability companies on the 9th, and the chairman of each company was assumed by the Chinese side. This move is worth noting in terms of the operation and organization of the industry in the future. Currently, the materials purchased and allocated in North China are mainly food and cotton. Before the Sino-Japanese Incident, there were also Japanese and other foreign merchants involved, but the internal lower-level institutions were mostly operated by Chinese people. For example, for food, there were rice shops and grain shops, etc. For the operation of cotton, there were unique organizations such as flower shops. However, from the perspective of the stage of development of Chinese industry, its center of activity has not yet reached the commercial sector, because Chinese capital occupies a very important position in this area, and since the incident, due to special circumstances, the activities of the Chinese side in this area have also tended to decline. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides believe that the existing institutions for purchasing and distributing materials need to be re-examined and organized, and the implementation of this policy makes this need more urgent. In terms of the nature of this undertaking, all of it should be operated by the Chinese side. Although there are many problems in the economic aspect of North China at present, the price problem is the basic reason for the whole, and the food problem is the center of the price problem. At present, in addition to the supplementary measures of importing miscellaneous grains from Inner Mongolia, importing rice from the south, and transferring flour from Central China, increased production was also implemented last year, and the scope of increased production will be further expanded this year, with a plan to drill 300,000 wells throughout North China and carry out the project of diverting the water of the Yellow River to irrigate the downstream farmland in Tianjin. Regarding the establishment of measures to increase production, they are currently being actively carried out. Regarding the rise in prices, there is no possibility of a further rise at present, but if there is another bumper harvest this year, it can be expected to gradually fall back. Rising prices are an inevitable phenomenon in wartime, and it is impossible to maintain a normal state. But it is only sought not to affect people's livelihood too much, so that the operation of the entire economy is sufficient. Therefore, it is difficult to drastically reduce the current prices, so it is possible to suppress its continued rise and research solutions to various obstacles, so as to stabilize the market and gradually appease the people.

### "Living" in Guilin

— Wang Liu

More People Than Houses, Soaring Rents: Finding a Home is Harder Than Finding a Job

The Guilin Municipal Government, in order to stabilize rents, has formulated "Measures for Housing Leases During Extraordinary Times," which will determine housing rents based on land tax records.

Rapid Population Increase

Among the many cities in the rear areas, Guilin is one of the fastest-growing, especially with overseas Chinese from various places coming to Guilin to settle down, leading to a sharp increase in population and an exceptionally prosperous market. The reason for Guilin's prosperity is not only its scenery, which is "the best in the world," but also its relatively convenient transportation and cheaper prices. However, in the past year, prices have soared, almost reaching the level of Chongqing and Kunming. The most troublesome problem is housing. It is not easy to find a hotel to stay in when you first arrive in Guilin, and it is even more difficult to rent a house to settle down.

Difficulty in Finding Housing

Some say that finding a house in Guilin is more difficult than finding a job, which is indeed the case. In the urban area, the rent for a slightly larger house can easily be close to ten thousand yuan. Even a rural bamboo house costs one or two hundred yuan per room. The transfer fees and deposits are harsh, and even with these conditions, it is not easy to rent a house without an introduction from someone you know. Guilin, which used to be welcoming to guests, now makes people sigh, "It is not easy to live in Chang'an!" Why? The simplest explanation is that demand exceeds supply because there are too many people and not enough houses to allocate. Secondly, as prices rise, so too must rents. But on closer inspection, this reason is not entirely correct. First, the number of new houses built in Guilin in the past year is not small. The municipal government encourages people to build houses, making it particularly convenient to rent land, and the land rent is also very cheap. Generally speaking, building materials are not particularly expensive. Second, the average price increase in the past year is probably three to four times, but rents have almost increased tenfold. From this, we can see that the rental problem in Guilin has also been caught up in a wave of speculation and hoarding. To put it bluntly, landlords are making their properties scarce and valuable, and real estate merchants building houses are investing at the level of profiting from the national crisis. Classes such as second and third landlords have also become products of the times, like in Shanghai and Hong Kong.

Stabilizing Rents

It is now urgent for the municipal government to stabilize rents, and it is only right to determine rents based on land taxes. In addition to the land tax standard, grain prices can also be used as a reference for fair prices. Because while reducing the suffering of renters, the interests of homeowners must also be taken into account. Otherwise, building houses will be seen as a daunting task, and the problem of housing will become even more difficult to solve. Some suggest using grain and salt prices as a fair price standard, which may be difficult for general fair prices, but it is absolutely fair and applicable to rents. Because the labor costs for both are the same, and they are rarely related to transportation issues. For example, if the price of rice has increased by more than double in the past year, and rents have increased in the same way, the owners' profits cannot be considered small. How can it not be shocking to hear that they have increased tenfold or even twentyfold!

House Numbers and Road Administration

Because the municipal government is paying attention to stabilizing rents, it is associated with two other housing problems: first, the house number issue, and second, the road administration issue. The urban area of Guilin has developed too quickly. Areas that were once remote are now densely packed with houses. For example, Junjun Road and Zhesheng Li have become the center of residential areas. As a result, one house number is reincarnated several times. In addition to "number X of number," there is also "another number X." Often, even though they are several miles apart, they still have the same number. When trying to visit relatives or ask for directions, not only do passers-by frown, but even the police shake their heads. Recently, the municipal government has started to replace house numbers, which shows that they have noticed this problem. However, simply increasing or changing the house numbers is not a fundamental solution. Because the area is too large, and the number of houses will continue to increase in the future, it is necessary to divide the large area into smaller sections and then arrange new house numbers according to the section. This way, things can look brand new now, and there will be no difficulties in the future. As for road administration, the recent bridge and road repairs have only reached the new urban area south of the city, and other areas have not been taken care of. The municipal government's income is limited, and it is naturally difficult to build roads on a large scale in the short term, but at least there should be a road construction plan first. Especially in several residential areas that are developing particularly fast, the routes of the main and branch roads should be marked out first. This way, everyone will avoid crowding and having no way out. Rather than demolishing houses to make way for roads in the future, why not mark out the road lines once and for all today?

### Soviet High Command Admits: Kharkov Lost Again; German Forces Continue to Advance Southeast

German Supreme Headquarters, Haidong News Agency, 16th: Today's German war report states that German forces have launched a counteroffensive in the Kharkov and Belgorod areas and northwest of Kursk, making further progress yesterday. 56 more Soviet aircraft were shot down on the Eastern Front. Enemy forces southeast of Kharkov have been encircled. The elite Soviet forces counterattacking west of Belgorod retreated without success. Enemy forces on the Lake Ilmen front received reinforcements yesterday, attempting to break through German lines but were heavily bombarded and retreated after fierce hand-to-hand combat with heavy casualties. Yesterday, in aerial engagements between German and Soviet aircraft, only four German planes failed to return to base, while the enemy lost 56 planes, including four shot down by Slovak fighter-bombers.

Moscow, Allied News Agency, 16th: The Soviet High Command last night admitted that Kharkov had been lost again after being occupied by Soviet forces for a week. A communiqué issued at midnight by the Soviet Information Bureau stated, "Our forces have withdrawn from the city of Kharkov on orders from the High Command after fierce fighting."

Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 16th: The most important aspect of Sunday's fighting on the Eastern Front was the continued eastward and southeastward advance of German forces from Kharkov. A large-scale Soviet offensive at Staraya Russa has been repelled. The number of captured items in Kharkov has not yet been announced. Kharkov is an important transportation center, but the German goal is not to reoccupy the retreated areas, but to inflict significant blows on the enemy. The intensity of the winter fighting has not diminished, as evidenced by the Soviet offensives at Staraya Russa and Belgorod. The German operation to shorten the lines at Vyazma is still underway. The weather in the central and southern sectors is very good, suitable for large-scale combat.

Personnel Change on the Kharkov Front: Soviet Commander Replaced

A border area of the Soviet Union, Havas Agency, 16th: According to semi-official Soviet sources, the German counteroffensive at Kharkov concentrated 100,000 troops and 1,000 tanks, with fresh reinforcements arriving continuously at the front. The German offensive forms a semicircle from Zmiiv to Volchansk to Barvenkovo, advancing rapidly toward Belgorod. According to unconfirmed reports, the renowned Soviet general Yugov has replaced General Golikov in command of the Kharkov front. In addition, the Red Army is still attacking in the Vyazma area, encountering strong German resistance, particularly south of Bely. According to announcements from Radio Moscow, although the Red Army has broken through German lines in three places there, the Germans have another line of defense. South of Vyazma, after occupying the city of Kholm, the Red Army has reached the upper reaches of the Dnieper River in the northern sector of the Eastern Front. General Timoshenko's troops are also redeploying near Staraya Russa, with major developments expected in the coming days.

Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 16th: The German counteroffensive on the southern sector of the Eastern Front has expanded to the areas west and northwest of Kursk. The center of the fighting is now near Belgorod. German units that had been fighting in Siversk and Rogov have also joined the German offensive. Although the Soviet forces are retreating, they are doing so in an orderly manner. However, the resistance of the Red Army near Belgorod is very strong, as the Soviet command has redeployed reinforcements from elsewhere to join the battle. However, the German offensive is still very successful. Even the 1st Guards Tank Brigade of the Soviet forces, which came to reinforce, could not stop the German advance. After losing 44 tanks, the Soviet forces were forced to retreat. Now the German vanguard has reached the city of Belgorod, and the enemy is preparing to resist in the southwest of the city. At 6:50 PM on Sunday, after completely occupying Kharkov, German forces continued to advance 35 kilometers beyond Kharkov. Another part of the German forces advanced northeast from Kharkov, threatening Volchansk, which is 50 kilometers from Kharkov. The fighting in the Orel area over the weekend was relatively quiet. Soviet forces began to attack west of Sukhinichi with a large army, but were unsuccessful.

Major Battle in the Kursk Area Now Underway

Berlin, Allied News Agency, 16th: Official circles here stated last night that although Soviet forces attacked south of Lake Ilmen and west of Belgorod on Sunday, German forces in the southern Soviet territory have consolidated their control over the important transportation lines between Belgorod and the Donets River southeast of Kharkov, further influencing the evolution of the entire Eastern Front. Not giving the Soviet forces a respite, German forces departed from Kharkov on Sunday and advanced northeastward about 30 miles to Volchansk. According to German sources, General Hoth's German forces completely occupied Kharkov at 6:50 PM on March 14. At the same time, major battles in the Belgorod and Kursk areas are underway. German forces have assembled elite troops and are strengthening their pressure on the Soviet forces. Soviet forces launched counterattacks in several locations in an attempt to contain the German forces, but were heavily damaged and retreated. Although the Soviet forces resisted stubbornly, they were no match for the heavy blows of the German forces and retreated. In order to strengthen their resistance west of Belgorod, Soviet forces dispatched the 1st Tank Guard Brigade to the area, resulting in fierce fighting. In this battle, the "Greater Germany" Infantry Regiment of the German side destroyed 44 Soviet tanks. Recent war news reports that two German routes are now approaching Belgorod from the south and west, while Soviet forces are attacking in the Sukhinichi area, about 90 miles northwest of Orel, apparently attempting to break through the German flank. At the same time, they are again attacking in the Staraya Russa area south of Lake Ilmen, attempting to invade the German defense line but were unsuccessful. In the central Moscow area, German forces continued their planned operation to shorten their lines. The German mountain troops in the north launched several lightning strikes against strong Soviet strongholds, destroying several Soviet positions in the Kandalaksha, Lizha, and Murmansk areas. The German Air Force assisted in the battle throughout the previous two days, bombing Soviet positions, transportation lines, and bases.

### Exchange Control Law Implemented in Malaya and Other Areas

### British, American and Soviet Conflicts Surface; Dispute Over the Soviet-Polish Border Line

(Special Correspondent Taguchi from Zurich, 4th) (The dispute between the Polish and Yugoslavian governments-in-exile in London and the Soviet government regarding the restoration of the old borders has recently taken the form of a major and concrete manifestation of the contradictions and oppositions between the British, American, and Soviet governments regarding the principles and attitudes in dealing with postwar issues on the London political stage.

American newspapers openly support the Polish government-in-exile, while the Soviet government, through the TASS news agency, has clearly announced the following views:

(1) The demands of the Polish government-in-exile deny the rights of the Ukrainians and Belarusians to unity. The Polish government-in-exile's policy of forceful seizure fully exposes its imperialist intentions.

(2) According to the Atlantic Charter, the Polish government-in-exile believes that its demands are very legitimate, but the Soviet Union believes that the Atlantic Charter, which guarantees "the right of all nations to determine their own destiny," does not support the Polish government-in-exile's claims at all. Before the outbreak of the war, the Polish government-in-exile refused to compromise with Germany, but the Polish government at that time, especially Foreign Minister Beck, adopted a friendly policy towards the dictatorships and tried to compromise with Germany. The leadership of the Polish political circles should realize the wrongdoing of Slavic infighting in this war and join hands, but they do not know the lessons of this war and demand Ukraine and Belarus. The Poles have sown seeds of hatred among Ukrainians and Belarusians.

Rebuttal from the Polish Government-in-Exile

In response, the Polish government-in-exile retorted: "The majority of the areas now involved in the major dispute historically belong to Poland, and the residents are also Polish. The two major cities of Vilnius and Lviv both grew up on Polish culture and are purely Polish cities. Beck's policy was based on a balanced policy between the German and Soviet armies, so the Soviet Union's denunciation is unfounded." The dispute over the Polish issue reveals a conflict of opinion on the interpretation of the Atlantic Charter. The Soviet side, based on the Atlantic Charter, intends to set new geopolitical borders suitable for its own interests. The Polish government-in-exile, under the protection of the British government, opposes the demands made to the Soviet Union as a violation of historical facts. In this Soviet-Polish border dispute, the British and American sides, based on historical facts and on the basis of the Atlantic Charter, want to restore the geopolitical boundaries of Europe to the state before the German occupation. The Soviet side advocates the reconstruction of Europe, and even if it acknowledges the Atlantic Charter as its basis, its interpretation should still be based on the standpoint of each country. Because the Soviet issue proclaims the Slavic national issue, a new problem has arisen in the interpretation of the Atlantic Charter.

The Atlantic Charter and the Soviet Union

The Soviet side argues that all Slavic nations, such as Poles, Czechs, Yugoslavs, and Bulgarians, and the Slavic nations within the Soviet territory should unite and maintain friendly relations and live together. The Soviet Union believes that its demands are based on the British and American Atlantic Charter, so its attitude is quite justified. At the same time, the Soviet Union's open demand for solidarity among all Slavic nations is also something that has only recently begun.

This demand of the Soviet Union is now manifested in the border issue between the Soviet Union and Eastern European countries. What attitude will the British and American sides take towards this?

Britain's Deep Concern

According to the opinions of British government leaders as reported in newspapers:

"This issue can be resolved by the two parties involved, Poland and the Soviet Union, and the British government does not need to comment on this dispute. However, such a dispute is quite regrettable from the standpoint of the anti-Axis countries. It is hoped that the newspapers of the Soviet Union and Poland will no longer attack each other, so as to open up a path to resolving the problem."

It completely takes a respectful and distant attitude, which can also represent the general attitude. The fact that British newspapers are deeply concerned about this unsettling dispute is undeniable. Even high-level magazines such as "The Economist" focus on the significance of this dispute. "The issue of the entry and exit of Soviet territory and the economic issues of Eastern European countries cannot be solved separately. After fundamental reforms are made to the agricultural management of Eastern European countries, after the establishment of a joint committee on the anti-Axis countries, and after the important industries of the whole of Europe are publicly managed, it will be possible to prevent the invasion of Bolshevism and lead to the success of British and American social policies."

At the same time, the reconstruction of the European economy must obtain the understanding of the Soviet Union. The magazine's essay represents the most realistic attitude among British news magazines. (翔: Translated from the March 6 issue of the Western Asahi Shimbun)

### Propaganda Tactics of the British and Americans: Exaggerating a War of Attrition to the Utmost

(Special Dispatch from Buenos Aires, Argentina, by Correspondent Hosokawa, 4th) It is undeniable that since the Roosevelt-Churchill meeting in Casablanca, the Anglo-American camp has been frantically engaging in morale-boosting demonstrations, both domestically and internationally. While the Anglo-American statements have mentioned that "the war will reach its climax this year," they do not say that the war will end this year. Instead, they assert that despite the many hardships and difficulties that may arise, the decisive phase of the war will definitely be presented within this year. Whether it is Roosevelt, Churchill, or other Anglo-American representatives, they are all proclaiming: "The war situation has undergone a major change this year," or "We have shifted from defensive to offensive operations." Due to the unexpectedly rapid progress of the Soviet army's winter offensive on the Eastern European front, and the Japanese army's retreat from Guadalcanal in the Pacific, the anti-Axis powers have taken these two events as their victories and used them as a basis for exaggerated propaganda. Only then has the Anglo-American propaganda war become somewhat lively.

Churchill has declared that he will undertake a landing operation on the European continent within this year. Roosevelt has vowed to shift from defense to offense and attack the Japanese mainland. British Air Force Under-Secretary Balfour stated in the House of Commons on the 2nd of last month that the current bombing of the European continent by the Anglo-American air forces is "a preparatory action for the Anglo-American forces to engage in landing operations on the European continent." On the same day, US Army Air Force Commanding General Arnold, at a welcome meeting for Soong Mei-ling in New York's Madison Square Garden, made such boastful remarks as: "We must prepare to bomb the Japanese mainland, and a majority of American pilots are being dispatched to China."

Defensive Posture Cannot Lead to Victory

According to their propaganda, the above-mentioned actions are decisions made at the Casablanca meeting. If so, then what is the true intention behind the Anglo-Americans spreading such propaganda today? What plan is hidden within such aggressive propaganda? Considering the disputes occurring within the Anglo-American camp, has the Anglo-American alliance exhausted its potential power in this war? The answer is "no," and the Anglo-American people themselves are answering "no."

Therefore, the Anglo-American people are shouting in unison: "Adopting a defensive posture all the time cannot lead to victory. We must adopt offensive operations." In this war, there are two countries fighting with their total national strength: one is the Soviet Union, and the other is the Chongqing regime. These two have been regarded as the backbone of the anti-Axis powers, so it is no wonder that Stalin and Chiang Kai-shek view the attitude of their allies, the British and Americans, as cunning. Similarly, the Anglo-American people themselves are criticizing their governments for lacking courage and, filled with deep disappointment, are asking what the Anglo-American troops are actually doing. Is the American fleet only active in Hollywood film studios? This is not without reason. Although the Anglo-American forces began an offensive in North Africa, the Axis forces of Germany and Italy achieved resounding success in their operations in Tunisia, and the American forces suffered a heavy defeat. Before the Japanese army retreated from Guadalcanal and New Guinea, the US Navy also suffered significant losses that could not be concealed. In such an unsatisfactory war situation, to say things like "We will conquer the islands one by one, and then attack the Japanese mainland" would not be something any American would listen to patiently. Roosevelt and Churchill keenly felt the need for a "dramatic" and active performance, and thus there was the Casablanca meeting. According to their statements, it was to decide on two far-reaching and expansive results: the unconditional surrender of the Axis powers and the beginning of a large-scale offensive by the anti-Axis powers.

No Action, No Success

This reporter dares to say that although this meeting was just a staged performance, considering that it involved the participation of many anti-Axis leaders, it must be assumed that something will definitely be launched this year. Because if no action is launched, not only is there a possibility of a major backlash on the Anglo-American domestic front, but the Soviet Union and Chongqing will also be disappointed and resentful towards their useless allies. Because of this situation, the Anglo-American countries keenly feel the anxiety of "having to launch something," and thus they boldly launched the propaganda that "a major offensive is about to begin." However, this offensive is based only on the following motivations!

(1) The ultimate goal of the British and Americans, hidden within the propaganda of "the great offensive against the Axis powers is about to begin," is to preserve their military strength by resorting to a long-term war of attrition in order to fight the Axis powers to the end. This is their fundamental principle for this war and the only means for them to carry out the war.

(2) Behind the propaganda of a major offensive, the true intention of the British and Americans can be clearly seen, that is, they are attempting to demoralize the Axis powers and to alienate the three countries of Japan, Germany, and Italy.

(3) Since the Casablanca meeting, the Anglo-American camp has frequently propagated that they will begin this or that, but no matter what kind of offensive measures the British and Americans take, they will never go beyond small-scale attacks.

(4) The British and Americans want to keep the Soviet Union and Chongqing working like dogs and horses, so they engage in the propaganda of a major offensive and strive to keep the Soviet Union and Chongqing in their camp.

(5) On the other hand, the British and Americans not only want to create an unstable atmosphere within the occupied territories of the Axis powers, but also want to make it difficult for other countries to maintain neutrality.

Dragging the War On

In short, the purpose of the propaganda spread by the British and Americans since the Casablanca meeting is indeed to resort to a program of long-term attrition warfare. Hidden within the propaganda of "the great offensive that will decide the victory or defeat of this war is about to begin" is the true intention of "trying to prolong the war as much as possible." Although Britain's national strength has been considerably depleted in this war, it has recently achieved considerable recovery due to various forms of assistance from the United States. On the other hand, while the United States is currently in the process of wartime re-mobilization and is experiencing many contradictions and frictions, its domestic position has indeed gained considerable strength. At this moment, when we frequently hear "the war has only just begun," it would be very dangerous to continue to make hopeful observations, whether in terms of material resources or morale. If we look at this war with a fair eye, shouldn't it be seen as continuing endlessly? (Ding: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun, March 7)

### The Shanghai Business Control Association Begins Handling Material Movement Permits Yesterday; Application Form Requires Certification from Trade Association in Triplicate

The National Business Control Association, which has been organized and established in accordance with the provisional regulations promulgated by the National Government, began handling matters relating to applications for material movement permits yesterday (the 16th). All articles of association will be publicly announced once they are submitted to the Ministry of Industry for approval. It is understood that the association held its first joint meeting of directors and supervisors at the Bank of Communications at 9 Jing'an Temple Road yesterday (the 16th) at 4:00 PM to discuss matters such as the association's headquarters, the organization of various departments, the allocation of major responsibilities for each department, and the steps for future association work.

Relevant Parties Gave Guidance Yesterday

After the establishment of the Shanghai Business Control Association, in order to comply with Articles 6 and 8 of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement promulgated by the National Government, a material movement permit office was established. It began handling applications for material movement permits at the Hamilton Building (the former site of the Japanese Embassy Concession Office) at the intersection of Jiangxi Road and Fuzhou Road in Shanghai yesterday (the 16th). However, because the association was newly established and personnel assignments had not yet been finalized, the Ministry of Industry specially dispatched a number of officials to Shanghai to assist. The material movement permit application business handled by the Shanghai Japanese Embassy Office was also transferred to the association's office yesterday. It is understood that at 9:00 AM yesterday (the 16th), Zhang Jun, Director of the Special Commodity Transportation and Sales Administration of the Ministry of Industry, Abe, a technician from the Shanghai Japanese Embassy, and Mr. Kishigami, an investigator, went to assist and guide. Until noon, Chinese and Japanese merchants in the city went to inquire about the procedures for applying for material movement permits and to obtain application forms for permits, which were extremely crowded. The application form for the material import and export permit is divided into three copies. After the applicant fills out the form, one copy must be investigated and reviewed, one copy is approved and stamped by the office, and a certificate is issued for material movement, and one copy is a stub. All applicants for material movement must be certified by the industry trade association as a member of the industry before they can be approved to apply. It is reported that Yuan, the Vice Minister of Industry, and Huang Jiangquan, the Supervisor of the association, specially went to the office for inspection at 10:00 AM that morning.

Main Tasks

The National Business Control Association held its establishment ceremony the day before yesterday and began operating in the Hamilton Building on Jiangxi Road yesterday. Although the internal administrative structure has not yet been fully formed, in order to urgently implement the government's newly promulgated laws and regulations on special material control, it is proceeding with the handling of various tasks. The main scope of work, as learned by this newspaper's reporter, is as follows: (1) Purchase and distribution of materials in the Central China region; (2) Matters related to the signing and issuance of material movement permits; (3) Management of barter trade between Central China and North and South China; (4) Liaison with various industries and business groups; (5) Purchase of military materials and natural products required for military production.

Unified Control

Since the Control Association has begun work since yesterday, the establishment of its various departments and sections will surely be completed as soon as possible. The offices of each department of the association are under the jurisdiction of the Secretary-General of the General Office. Each department handles specific materials separately, and each department will be divided into several business groups to individually manage certain materials. These business groups will then contact the various Chinese and Japanese trade associations and, through the mediation of the associations, will come into contact with the various stores. In this case, the Control Association will designate stores to directly trade with producers to purchase materials. If stores purchase materials within the same region of Central China, then these stores will form a group to unify the purchase and distribution of materials. The association will establish branches in major cities in Central China to handle local material control matters.

System Management

The system for the unified management of materials is that the local trade associations of various industries will advance to the joint associations of various industries and finally concentrate in the National Business Control Association. In order to strengthen material control, the local authorities in this city previously ordered trade associations to register. Currently, more than 300 units have been registered. However, among the associations, those with similar characteristics will be gradually merged in the future to unify the control work. There are 28 textile companies, 25 food companies, 17 grocery companies, 16 metal companies, 13 manufacturing and search machinery companies, 9 wine, soy sauce, and fuel companies, 7 pharmaceutical, cosmetics, and paint dye companies, 6 clothing, food and beverage, leather, and oil companies, 5 grain and stationery companies, 4 tobacco, transportation, and finance companies, 3 furniture companies, and 17 other companies.

### The Shanghai Municipal Council's Control Department Adopts a Cooperative Attitude: Director Inagaki Expresses His Thoughts

Regarding the situation of the Public Concession's Material Control Department after the establishment of the National Business Control Association, a reporter from the Shen News Agency specially interviewed Mr. Inagaki, Director of the Public Concession's Material Control Department, yesterday (the 16th) morning. He was received and allowed to express his thoughts on the association as follows: The Shanghai Municipal Council's Material Control Department will do its best to assist in spirit and cooperate closely with the National Business Control Association. Regarding the specific policy for the future, the authorities of China and Japan have not yet announced the detailed rules for this material control, nor has any formal order been announced, so it is still impossible to predict. My opinion on the National Business Control Association is just like a paragraph in the speech given by Minister Tajiri at the association's establishment meeting yesterday (the 15th): "The issue of material control must be based on the starting point of its own nature. If you only want to make the material control smooth with laws and institutions, this is actually more difficult. Therefore, everyone must personally practice it, make reasonable activities, and always consider the control hub and assist it. If you rely solely on institutions, there will be no achievement." I think that the speech given by Minister Tajiri at the establishment meeting yesterday (the 15th) was a very famous and excellent talk. Yesterday (the 15th), I was also invited to participate in the establishment meeting of the National Business Control Association. I saw the proactive attitude of Tang Shoumin, the Director of the association, and the enthusiastic greetings of Mayor Chen, and I deeply feel that the National Business Control Association will definitely be able to achieve the purpose of control satisfactorily in the future. I believe that in order to fully develop the National Business Control Association, all the industrialists who have been elected as directors and supervisors can fully develop their strength and engage in work. This is also my deep expectation. As for the cooperative attitude adopted by the Shanghai Municipal Council towards this institution under the current situation, it goes without saying.

### Youth League Review: District Pre-Inspection

### Wu Hufan Charity Sale of Yanghua Scrolls Benefits Needy Students; Mr. Qian and Mr. Sun Jointly Donate 1,000 Yuan; Designated Specifically for the Newspaper's Student Aid Fund

### Re-registration of Companies Extended for Three Months

The Ministry of Industry stated that the deadline for companies to complete supplementary registration and re-registration was the end of February of this year, which has now expired and should be terminated as scheduled. However, after investigating the companies applying for supplementary registration, the procedures are simple. In addition to terminating as scheduled, all companies applying for re-registration, either because the person in charge of the company has not yet returned, or because the shareholders are scattered in all directions, making it inconvenient to hold a public meeting, may have a small number of applications for postponement, which should be extended again to protect the legal interests of merchants and the public. Therefore, it will be extended for another three months to allow these companies to apply for registration. The municipal government has approved the ministry's consultation and has informed the Economic Bureau.

### The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism

— Zhao Zhengping

Zhao Zhengping, the president of National Shanghai University, at the invitation of the Chinese National Anti-British and Anti-American Association on March 14th, broadcasted on Shanghai Radio a speech titled "The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism." The original text is as follows:

What I want to talk about tonight is "The Great Path of Anti-British and Anti-Americanism."

Last time, I broadcasted that opposing British and American interests is opposing British and American imperialism, not opposing ordinary British and American people. Why oppose imperialism? Because imperialism is aggression, and opposing imperialism is opposing aggression. This kind of aggression is not seen in our Eastern culture. In fact, those of us who have been immersed in Eastern civilization fundamentally lack the intention of aggression. To be fair, some parts of British and American imperialism, especially British imperialism, grew unconsciously, rather than being deliberately planned and intentionally created. Why did imperialism grow unconsciously? Because they already had a selfish and self-interested national concept. Therefore, wherever the British went, they formed a small Britain, infringing upon the rights of other countries. The East India Company's destruction of India is the clearest example. Establishing several independent countries and governments in the Americas and Australia is also a very clear example. They only knew about self-governance but did not care about the sovereignty of the local people. They only knew about self-sufficiency but did not care about the livelihood of the local people. They only knew about exercising their own political power but were unwilling to unite with or assist the local people in exercising political power. This is the reason why a completely aggressive imperialism was formed unconsciously. Therefore, while we oppose British and American interests, we must also recognize that the selfish and self-interested national concept is the cause of imperialism. However, we Easterners, especially the Chinese, not only lack a selfish and self-interested national concept, but fundamentally, even the so-called modern national concept is very淡薄. Our Chinese people's淡薄ness towards the nation is not because we Chinese are backward, but it is actually where our greatness lies. Because in the teachings of the Eastern civilization masters Confucius and Lao Tzu, as well as in the teachings of Confucius' disciples such as Mencius and Xun Qing, and the great philosophers before and after Confucius such as Lao Tzu and Mo Tzu, there is benevolence, etc., with humanity as the target. This kind of benevolence is not limited to one country but encompasses the whole world. In today's terms, it means taking benevolence towards all mankind as the target, without any selfish and self-interested national consciousness. According to Mo Tzu's theory of universal love, perhaps there are such instructions in Western religions, but they cannot be found in politics. Therefore, our Eastern philosophy inherently contains anti-imperialist factors. Therefore, in Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, it is clearly stated that British and American culture is the culture of霸道, while Eastern culture is the culture of王道. The culture of王道 of course does not allow the existence of the culture of霸道. Therefore, as long as we Easterners embrace this culture of王道, that is, develop and promote the culture centered on benevolence, righteousness, and morality, it will be the most powerful weapon against British and American interests.

As the ancient saying goes, under the sunlight, one cannot see the firefly. In the era when true王道 is flourishing, of course, one cannot see the shadow of霸道. Now the Axis powers are loudly advocating the establishment of a new European order, and our ally Japan is also vigorously promoting a new Asian order. What is the core idea of ​​this new order? Of course, it is mutual love between countries, not the strong bullying the weak. Of course, it is mutual assistance between people, not self-interest among people. In fact, only this spirit can establish a new order. For example, our ally Japan already has the eight紘一宇 character, which is a fundamental concept centered on justice and humanity, and is already steadily advancing it, such as the liberation of Burma and the liberation of the Malays. All facts have been realized. In the future, the days when the new Asia is mutually親善 and mutually supportive will be the time when British and American imperialism is completely eliminated. This is the great path of anti-British and anti-Americanism.

### Unregistered Coal Stockpiles Will Not Be Allowed to be Moved, Subject to Severe Penalties; Those Registered Can Apply for Movement Permits

The China United Coal Company has now completed all the stockpile registrations, totaling over 14,000 tons of bituminous and anthracite coal. The company has reported the registration situation to the Shanghai Coal Association, stipulating that registered stockpiles can apply for movement permits. It is said that measures have been determined for stockpiles that have not been registered as scheduled. In the future, in addition to not being allowed to move, they will also be subject to severe penalties in accordance with regulations. It is understood that the purpose of the China United Coal Company being entrusted to handle the stockpile registration is to clearly know the exact amount of bituminous and anthracite coal currently stored in Shanghai (including Pudong, Hongkou, the French Concession, etc.). Recently, due to the inability of various industries to produce in large quantities, and the weather is gradually warming, the daily coal consumption of factories and residents has sharply decreased. Therefore, the coal stocks in Shanghai are sufficient for application. Moreover, bituminous and anthracite coal produced from North China, Korea, and other places are still continuously arriving here. The future of fuel is becoming more stable.

### Vaccination Certificates Required for Travel to Other Ports; Vaccination and Certificate Issuance Procedures

It is learned that the Shanghai Municipal Council Health Department has vaccination certificate application procedures. Passengers who wish to leave Shanghai for other ports must submit their citizen certificate or residence certificate, along with a fee of $2.50. After the Health Department administers the vaccination, the certificate will be issued, with a two-inch photo of the person attached. As for the certificates applicable to this port, they are issued free of charge. To date, this vaccination is not mandatory. The Health Department will soon forcibly vaccinate on the streets or door-to-door. Therefore, it is hoped that citizens will go voluntarily as soon as possible.

### Organizational Plan of the Education Colleagues Cooperative

— Chen Guanyu

The article "Organizing the Teachers' Welfare Association" by Mr. Yu, published on March 5th, is deeply sympathized with by people in the education sector. However, public groups find it difficult to handle affairs effectively. Therefore, colleagues believe that it is not enough to organize and launch a "Education Colleagues Cooperative" in accordance with the company organization and raise shares to achieve results.

Our preliminary outline of the company organization is - the total share capital is 2 million yuan, divided into 20,000 shares, each share is 100 yuan, with an official interest of 1%. There are also dividends. For schools, schools with less than 100 students, universities should recognize at least 10 shares, middle schools 5 shares, and elementary schools 3 shares. For every 20 additional students, one additional share will be added. For faculty and staff, each person should recognize at least one share. There are more than 700 large and small schools in Shanghai. At an average of 5 shares per school, more than 350,000 yuan can be obtained. There are about 7,8,000 faculty and staff, and more than 780,000 yuan can be obtained. The sum of the two has exceeded 1 million yuan. It is not difficult to add freely recognized shares to make up 2 million. Introduce shareholders with large shares, who are promoted as directors and enjoy special rights and interests, in order to work extra hard.

The general outline of the company's business - (1) Request permission from the authorities to purchase necessities of life in large quantities from producers or manufacturers, and distribute them to each shareholder at the lowest price. (2) Centrally handle books, stationery, paper, ink, and printing of forms, regulations, and all printed materials. (3) Publish jointly compiled textbooks. (4) Organize interest-free loans for shareholders, and 整借零還 loans. (5) Sell or exchange old books and all old furniture and clothing on consignment. (6) Post joint recruitment advertisements and introduce jobs. (7) Special doctors and pharmacies provide shareholders with cheap or赊欠 medical treatment and medicine. (8) A special public canteen and dormitory are provided for shareholders to prepare meals and lodging cheaply. (9) Collect tuition fees, pay expenses on behalf, and operate interest on behalf. (10) Special public experimental institutes, libraries, and sports fields are provided for shareholders to use. The regulations have now been drafted, and the equipment office is located at No.中中字 in the new market at the intersection of Jing'an Temple Road and Moore Ming Road.

Economic Circle Evaluation

### Controlled Economy and Improved Transportation

The Provisional Regulations on the National Commercial Control Association and the Provisional Regulations on Wartime Materials Movement Restriction have now been promulgated and are being actively implemented. The people's organization, under the supervision of the government, manages and controls the purchase and allocation of materials, the operation of material exchange in various parts of the country, the supply of export materials, the allocation of import materials, and the procurement of military supplies from the standpoint of autonomy. In the future, material control matters will have a sound organization and a complete plan. Moreover, due to the promulgation of the Wartime Materials Movement Restriction Regulations, the previous control methods can be eased, so that under reasonable circumstances, materials in various places can be exchanged smoothly. If we can cooperate from top to bottom and implement it fairly, it will be a great achievement in stabilizing people's livelihoods.

Originally, the circulation of materials, in addition to the necessary restrictions during extraordinary times, should try to avoid the occurrence of local regionalization. This is to seek reasonable circulation of materials from the perspective of the system and the organization of control. However, without the tools of circulation, there is still no effect. Therefore, after having a sound organization, there must also be tools for circulation, and the most important issue is transportation. The current shortage of boats and vehicles is certainly an unavoidable phenomenon, but within the possible range, we must strive for convenient transportation methods, increased transportation efficiency, and reduced transportation costs. This is to allocate appropriate distribution and improve transportation management. So that the system and the tools are convenient for both, and the exchange of materials is naturally smooth.

### The China Central Cigarette Combination's Distribution Method is Fully Determined

In order to uniformly handle the distribution of cigarettes, the China Central Tobacco Allocation Combination has completed the registration of all large and small cigarette retailers in the city, and all preparations have been completed. It has been decided to implement the allocation in the short term. Large retailers who have passed the examination have paid their "confidence deposit" from the 15th, and must complete the payment by the 17th. The "confidence deposit" is divided into Grade A, which is 50,000 yuan, and Grade B, which is 30,000 yuan. The deposit is collected by the Jiaotong Tobacco Industry Bank, and then a signboard of the designated wholesaler is obtained from the combination, specializing in handling the consignment of goods for small retailers. It is heard that large wholesalers have each filled out contracts, stipulating that the method must be complied with, and those who violate it will be investigated in accordance with the law. Strict sanctions have been established for participating in black market cigarette transactions. Regarding small retailers, the investigation and review have been completed, totaling more than 5,000 households, and they have been compiled into grades, completely based on the business conditions of each retailer. In the future, all products from the 無輸軍管理 Central Tobacco Company, the Japanese China Tobacco Company, and the Chinese factories such as Nanyang, Huacheng Fuxin, and Dadong will be centrally allocated by the combination. As for the registration of cigarette wholesalers in the suburbs of Shanghai, it is under review. The allocation in various places outside the China Central area has also been started. Therefore, after the implementation of the allocation, there will be no black market for cigarettes, and the prices sold by each retailer will be the fair prices set by the combination.

### Selling Activity Causes the Sharp Drop in the Federal Reserve Note - Down 14 Points From the Previous Day -

Yesterday, the Federal Reserve Note showed a backlash, falling back. This was mainly due to the huge increase of more than 50 cents in the past four days. Although there was news that it was naturally equivalent to military tickets, there was selling activity, and the 日客胃轉淡. Therefore, the return was also huge. Operators sold it off, starting from around 4 yuan and retreating to as low as 3 yuan and 88 cents. Receipts were 3 yuan and 83 cents, down 14 points from the previous day. The retail sale price was also lowered to 3 yuan and 95 cents. Receipts were only 3 yuan and 75 cents, and the trend was very 軟弱.

The Japanese military ticket still has little change. The inter-industry trading price is 5 yuan, 55 cents, and 35厘. Small money houses and bank retail sales are 5 yuan and 56 cents, and the receipt is 4 and a half cents.

Yesterday morning, the discount rate of the money industry association was still 18 points.

### Abundant Oilseed Raw Materials; Edible Oil Prices Expected to Fall

Rapeseed is the raw material for oil extraction. The annual output of Suzhou, Jiaxing, Pinghu, and other places along the Beijing-Shanghai-Hangzhou railway is very abundant. Therefore, oil mills are lined up in various places. Last year, due to the poor harvest of rapeseed in various places, there was panic about edible oil, and there were no raw materials for oil extraction in various places, which led to soaring oil prices. However, this year, in Suzhou, Jiaxing, and other places, the rapeseed sprouts have grown very quickly due to the warm weather since the arrival of spring. Therefore, it is expected that the rapeseed in various places will definitely have a bumper harvest. After the new goods are listed on the market and the oil mills in various places start work, the edible oil repayment price will definitely fall.

Determine Prices - Coordinate Supply

The Shanghai Charcoal United Association, in order to ensure local self-sufficiency, is currently discussing specific methods with the relevant authorities and has assigned staff to conduct on-site investigations in various parts of China Central, which has been completed.

### Yen Quasi-Exchange Rate

This dispatch from Domei News Agency states that the limit on the exchange of yen from China Central to Japan has been increased from 500 yen to 5,000 yen. This is the result of the stronger relationship between the Japanese military ticket and the savings券 exchange. The Shanghai office of the Japanese Ministry of Finance has notified Japanese banks of this move. The maximum amount of remittances from Japan to China Central will still be 200 yen. Remittances exceeding these two limits must be approved by the relevant authorities.

### Shortage of Paper-Making Raw Materials in This City

The raw materials for paper-making in this city, that is, paper pulp, have always relied on imports from Manchuria. This year, Manchuria has indicated that it cannot supply them, so the source of raw materials has become a major problem. The people in the industry, in order to alleviate the panic, have decided to send a representative to Manchuria to negotiate. At the same time, the hope for Manchuria is very thin, so a special envoy will be sent to Japan, hoping that if Manchuria cannot import, it can still be obtained from Japan.

### Measures for Free Trading of Coarse Grains; According to Military Allocation Group Regulations

Recently, the authorities allowed free trading of coarse grains. The Shanghai Coarse Grain Group Firms Joint Office, which is responsible for the allocation of coarse grains, convened a general meeting, re-elected directors and supervisors, and strengthened the organization and improved the supply and adjustment policies.

### Price Control

— Huang Xuanping

Mr. Huang Guanping of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Goods Control Committee, recently made some comments on the issue of price control. Excerpts of the main points are as follows:

(1) Economic Theory and Finance

It is necessary to re-examine economic and financial issues under the new situation after December 8th of the year before last. Now, let's examine it from the perspective of economics and the current environment.

First, the demand for materials is now strong. However, the supply is mostly subject to control and concealment, a very different situation. It cannot be easily resolved by relying solely on old theories.

Second, old theories have somewhat neglected the benefits of controlling finances. Contemporary economists must be able to control prices through financial expansion or restraint measures.

Third, materials are divided into essential and non-essential. China is more than 90% self-sufficient in essential materials. For non-essential items such as imported goods, the source has been cut off and cannot be restored, so the price has soared indefinitely. However, the prices of essential materials are necessities of life. Under the current special circumstances, the price of non-essential items should not be used as a standard for the price of essential items.

Fourth, China has always been known as a country with abundant resources. The production in Central China is more than enough to maintain the current new legal currency, so the legal currency has its true value. Therefore, it is not difficult to control prices.

(2) Finance and Prices

The current amount of Central Reserve Bank currency circulating in the Shanghai area is estimated at 200,000,000,000 yuan. The old legal currency previously circulating in the city was estimated to be 300,000,000,000 yuan. In other words, the circulation of the new legal currency is only two-thirds of the old legal currency.

If loans are not controlled, unscrupulous merchants often take the opportunity to use their materials to continue mortgaging loans, buy up goods as much as possible, and seek profit, resulting in unwarranted price increases. Therefore, loans should be limited to important industries.

(3) The Function of Price Control

The soundest situation for a social economic institution is the stability of prices. At that time, prices are neither high nor low. During currency inflation, the phenomenon is high prices, abundant profits, booming business, secure jobs, easy credit, and low interest rates, creating a seemingly prosperous atmosphere. However, general wages cannot keep up with prices, and the livelihoods of the wage-earning class are worsening. Although capitalists appear unaffected, their actual gains are ultimately equal to empty bubbles.

During currency deflation, the phenomenon is low prices, meager profits, sluggish business, high unemployment, tight credit, high interest rates, and a decline in all industries.

Since investors rely on commodities as a tool for business competition in order to seek exorbitant profits, price control must be implemented universally.

The composition of prices depends on the supply and demand of materials. When materials circulate, prices will naturally fall. Therefore, the production of goods occupies the most important position in any social economic function. But at this time, the best policy is to suppress prices as soon as possible to maintain people's livelihood.

Controlling prices is the responsibility of the government authorities. Taking more stringent and effective measures to crack down on speculation and hoarding is a matter of urgency.

On March 4th of this year, the Ministry of Finance announced in principle regulations restricting loans. Taking this prompt step was timely. All financial organizations must be ordered to join a general association as members. The association should strictly supervise all activities, which must be subject to jurisdiction. All kinds of lending should be limited to important real industries to be effective.

### The Fight for "Life"

— Hai Lin

The sunlight doesn't reach the corners of the streets.

"Why hasn't the old quartermaster who delivers the food come yet?" The little beggar crouched next to the trash can was thinking. His sunken eyes were forever fixed on the other side of the street.

He thought that there would be at least one more fight to perform today. He couldn't help but turn around to look at the old beggar behind him, his comrade on the hunger line, but their stomachs didn't allow them to be friendly to each other. As soon as the fat man's food basket arrived, everyone would have to take off the mask of humanity and struggle for it.

The fat man staggered over with his burden. Look! The old beggar and the beggars who had come from elsewhere were all there, rubbing their fists, gnashing their teeth…

He also stood up. Where did the strength come from? He seemed to feel a heat boiling in his body. He rushed ahead like a hungry tiger pouncing on its prey to open the lid of the food basket.

"There's nothing left today—" the fat man shouted.

As usual, there were a hundred "I don't believe it's." The hungry group surrounded him.

"Be careful of the pot!" the fat man shouted.

Actually, what's so strange? "You," "me," and "stomach" are all "friends for life and death."

Really! The food basket was empty!

"I told you a long time ago that there wasn't any left. What's the price of "food" now?" the fat man complained as he packed up.

They dispersed! Crestfallen, a group even hungrier than before.

The little beggar looked at his newly torn coat with pity.

Let's sit down again! Disappointed? No! It's waiting, waiting for the fat man's dinner. It's noon now, so there are six more hours?

But the little beggar's stomach really couldn't allow him to wait six long hours. What to do! He stood up again.

There are many food stalls on the street, and many in women's baskets.

So there was one more little thief in society.

### Humility and Sincerity

We should humbly accept people's good intentions and guidance. If we are doing things, we should work with sincerity.

"Humbly accept well-intentioned guidance, and sincerely deal with our work." This is an unbreakable law, or in other words, a necessary condition for success. Therefore, we can only achieve success by "humbly accepting" and "sincerely working."

The relationship between "humbly accepting" and "sincerely working" is very simple, but there are still many people who confuse "humility" and "sincerity." Why? Because they use "humility" in work and "sincerity" in acceptance.

We should use an objective attitude—humility—to accept well-intentioned guidance, and use subjective power—sincerity—to work. This is the attitude we should have when doing things.

### Su Qin and Yan Hui

— Xiao Lin

There is a record in the Records of the Warring States: "Su Qin wanted to sleep while studying, so he used an awl to pierce his thigh, and the blood flowed to his ankles..." Therefore, fathers and brothers often use Su Qin's bitter spirit to teach their children. I hope to emulate him even more.

Actually? Judging from the starting point and goal of studying, Su Qin was just a fool. He didn't understand the true meaning of studying at all. He regarded studying as a painful thing. Therefore, his starting point was not voluntary, and his goal? That's even more absurd. He completely wanted to be promoted and make a fortune, so he stabbed a hole with an awl and crammed some stiff and dead knowledge into it.

Similarly, there is also a record in the Analects: "A basket of rice, a ladle of drink, living in a humble lane, others cannot bear the sorrow, but Hui does not change his happiness." Yan Hui's spirit of being quick to learn and eager to learn is the true attitude to learning. His learning is completely from the heart. He is voluntary, even though he lives in a humble alley, cannot eat enough, and cannot keep warm, Zu still cannot shake his belief in learning in the slightest. No wonder Confucius said he was virtuous and a good disciple.

These are two famous hard-working scholars in history, but because one is voluntary and the other is passive, it is obvious that later generations have different levels of respect for them. On the one hand, they cannot inspire the true meaning of learning, and on the other hand, they tell us that only things that are voluntarily sought from the bottom of our hearts are valuable and meaningful. Otherwise, it's just a standard fool

### Root

Everyone was very nervous, but only Laibodong didn't ask or hear, his head drooped and he was dozing off. Sometimes his body darted forward, almost falling to the ground, so he quickly braced his feet and sat up straighter. Xue Fengchun simply stood up, gave the stool to Yang Zijie to sit on, and he walked quietly onto the kang, quietly and watching the ceiling while smoking.

Huang Chong'an smoked his water pipe more forcefully, and the gurgling sound was indeed unusually loud. Even when blowing away the ashes and putting in the smoke cylinder, he couldn't help but make strange or loud noises that were rarely heard, so that people knew how unhappy he was.

"I won't force you if you don't want to sign a death contract," Yang Zijie said again to mediate, "Then let's do this, let's say it's fifty-six yuan: if the Second Yuan money Huang Lord is unwilling to recognize it, I will pay it out."

"Two more yuan is still not enough..." Genming still didn't let go.

"If you know that Mr. Huang has to spend all the expenses!"

They just argued with each other, and Yu Duzhou picked up his pen and waited, dipping the tip of his pen into the inkstone from time to time, making a leisurely posture. After dipping it, he picked it up and looked at it, then said, "It's especially cold now, I really have to freeze it." After saying that, he put it in his mouth and sucked on it.

Suddenly, a boy of ten years old rushed in. He didn't say a word, he rushed straight to Yu Duzhou's seat, pulled open the drawer in front of Yu Duzhou, raised his feet, stretched his neck, and fumbled inside with both hands. Yu Zhou was still holding the pen at first, and moved his body a little, waiting for him to look for it in the drawer. Later, he couldn't stand the squeezing, so he stood up and waited by the side.

### Optimistic Life

— Cheng Da

I have met many people who seem to be very "optimistic." Some say, "Take it one day at a time." Some say, "Drink today while you have wine." I feel that these two sentences thoroughly reflect the attitude of life generally held by people in the current society.

The people who "take it one day at a time" have already decided on the calculation of "getting by." As long as there is no uncomfortable pain in their hearts today, then they are still "optimistic." If there is not enough rice in the house, there is no oil, or they are blocked on the road, then their psychology will change immediately, from "optimistic" to "pessimistic." But once all the problems are solved, they gradually become "optimistic" again.

As for the people who "drink today while you have wine," they are even more "optimistic." They not only "live it up" but also "think it through," adhering to the purpose of "enjoying the present." So dance halls, theaters, tea rooms, restaurants, gambling halls, brothels... All the places that can provide "enjoyment" are gone. There is a feeling that this is not enough to express "optimism." But "enjoying" requires money, so they search and scrape everywhere. Those with greater abilities climb on top of people, and those with less abilities attach themselves to the rich. The more people "living it up" outside, the more "living it up" and "optimistic" they become.

In fact, a truly optimistic life focuses on the spiritual aspect rather than the material aspect. Don't we all have one or more "hopes"? For example, I hope that my health will be better next year than this year. Or we all hope that rice prices will drop in the near future. All such "hopes" are possible to realize. Before the "hope" is realized, we don't have to worry, don't have to envy "enjoying the present," and don't have to have the negative attitude of "getting by." If we try our best to cherish ourselves, live a regular, non-degenerate, always helpful, and more serious life, then we will have our "hope" ahead of us. Therefore, I think that the lives of "taking it one day at a time" and "drinking today while you have wine" are all "unreliable and easily become pessimistic" false "optimistic lives"; only "hopeful and serious lives" are truly optimistic lives.
