### Vitality and Senility

The ancients had two idioms: "Like the rising sun" and "Reaching the end of the road at dusk." We know that the former describes the radiance and prosperity of the rising sun, which is "vitality." The latter describes the dimness and decline of the setting sun, which is "senility." To be more specific, "vitality" is having firm beliefs, a spirit of actively seeking progress, and the determination to innovate boldly. "Senility" is lacking self-confidence, holding a passive and complacent mentality, and giving up on oneself in every way.

The manifestation of vitality or senility is not only easily discernible in personal attitudes but is also very easily exposed in a nation and a country. If a nation and a country have vitality, their national strength will undoubtedly be strong. This can be verified from the following phenomena:

There must be a close relationship between the government and the people. The government trusts the people, and the people support the government. The government has firm beliefs, a spirit of actively seeking progress, and the determination to innovate boldly. Its measures always stand at the forefront of the people's welfare and faithfully serve the people. With such a vital government, the people will naturally sincerely support and endorse it.

The government always plans for the welfare of the people and the long-term interests of the country. Anything that benefits the country and the people, no matter how big or small, is pursued with all efforts, regardless of difficulties.

Under the leadership of the government, the people abide by laws and regulations, work diligently, and jointly seek the survival of the country, thereby reaching a state of strength and prosperity.

For example, Japan and Germany, whether in terms of the country or the people, both exhibit vigorous vitality. The government plans entirely for the benefit of the people, and the people faithfully accept the government's command, each fulfilling their duties. They move forward in unison towards the path of nation-building.

The same applies to personal life. Those with vitality will undoubtedly have a flourishing and enterprising life, plan and organize their affairs, constantly seek progress, and have a belief in protecting the nation and the country, with rational discernment.

Conversely, if a nation and a country are afflicted with senility, their national strength will undoubtedly decline and fall into chaos. This can also be verified from the following phenomena:

Because the government's measures do not plan for the benefit of the people, or because officials who prioritize private interests occupy important positions in the government. The people hold a hesitant attitude towards the government, and thus, there is a gulf between the two. The government is unwilling to trust the people and cannot give them the opportunity to participate in politics. As a result, the people doubt the government and may even be unable to wholeheartedly support it.

The government's administrative measures lack plans that align with the national conditions. Even if there are plans, they are either lofty and impractical or merely paper plans or verbal plans that are not implemented. Indifference and perfunctoriness result in the inability to guarantee the people's peaceful and prosperous lives, and they will not feel the benefits of having a government, resulting in a very weak concept of the government.

Since the people have no opportunity to participate in politics, their opinions cannot be effectively conveyed. The government is for the government, and the people are for the people. The government has no long-term plans to seek the happiness of the people, and the people are therefore disappointed and dispirited, gradually cultivating selfish and self-serving individualism, and resorting to speculation and opportunism as a means of survival. The more intense this trend becomes, the more depressed the future of the nation and the country will be.

The same applies to the senile individual life. There is no plan for things, and one drifts along, as the saying goes, "Only care about the snow in front of your own door, and not the frost on other people's roofs." They console themselves with the saying "Preserve oneself by being wise." At the same time, they are only interested in profit, engaging in disputes at every turn, and disregard right and wrong. What we have said above is a general explanation of the content and distinction between "vitality" and "senility," as well as their outward manifestations. This is true for nations and countries, and also for individuals.

What is the current state of our Republic of China, its nation, its country, and its individuals? Is it vitality or senility? We hope that the government and the people will all think quietly and deeply reflect. If they feel they belong to the senile, then they must unreservedly and painfully criticize themselves, eradicate senility, and establish vitality.

Regarding the way to eradicate senility and establish vitality, we believe that the government should first actively revitalize itself. If the government is vigorous in everything and full of vitality, there is no need to worry that the people will not be revitalized and lack vitality. If the government has vitality, it must first actively implement several major events, several practical events for the country and the people. Because these major events are related to the national economy and the people's livelihood, if the government does not actively implement them first, the people will still maintain a wait-and-see attitude, passively "waiting for opportunities." How to implement several major events? We can list one or two:

Politics is originally a matter of concern to the general public. In principle, it must be open, and the people should be allowed to participate in providing opinions, so as to gather wisdom and benefit everyone, and ensure that measures are appropriate. The prerequisite for the government to allow the people to participate in politics must first be a genuine sincerity in sharing history with the people; merely having the form will still be in vain. "Country first, party second" should be a belief that the ruling party must have. Like the Chongqing regime's "party first, country second," it will inevitably lead to failure in the end.

Only knowing how to be an official but not knowing how to do things is the main reason for the chaos in national affairs in recent decades. Therefore, thoroughly eradicate bureaucratic politics and establish expert politics and clean government. Expedite the strengthening of the personnel system for examinations and appointments.

To achieve a peaceful movement, one must first actively engage in nation-building work. To cooperate in winning the war, one must first actively engage in nation-building work. Because nation-building is the most fundamental work, when the country has strength, the peace movement can be smoothly achieved, and cooperation in the war will have practical results. First, start with increasing agricultural and industrial production. On the one hand, the competent authorities should earnestly implement production increase plans, and on the other hand, do their utmost to eliminate all obstacles to production increase. Secondly, use all efforts to comprehensively suppress prices, especially eliminating artificial causes.

We sincerely call on the government and the people to revitalize the country as one, and for everyone to have a spirit of vitality. It is undeniable that in recent years, the general public has a misconception that "the situation will definitely change," and that all that is needed is to wait, and opportunities will definitely come. However, let us think, since the Greater East Asia War began one year and nine months ago, how has the situation changed? What good opportunities have been obtained by waiting? If we continue to follow the same path of waiting, perhaps prices will rise further, and life will become more difficult. Our opportunities must be met with a proactive spirit of vitality; they can absolutely not be obtained by passively waiting with a senile attitude. What can be obtained by passively waiting is the pain of higher prices and more difficult life. In reality, "the situation in East Asia has already been established, and there will only be development and no changes." The remaining forces of Britain and the United States will definitely not be revived in East Asia. We can only revitalize ourselves, urge the government, support the government, and cooperate with the friendly nation of Japan to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War, and achieve the true opportunityâ€”"peaceful and prosperous life"!

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the Incident, epidemic prevention work in various localities has been mainly overseen by the Allied-established epidemic prevention committees. Recently, to respect our country's sovereignty, the Allies decided to first return the epidemic prevention [number] preparation offices in Nanjing, Hangzhou, and Wuhu. Next year's epidemic prevention work will be the responsibility of the Department of Health. Adjustments to epidemic prevention institutions in various localities, the training of technical personnel, and the supply of epidemic prevention materials are all under active [number] consideration and planning. Among these, the supply of vaccines is the most important.

Now that the epidemic prevention work is the responsibility of the Department of Health, the source of vaccines must be planned independently. However, during the war, medical supplies are scarce, and even with large sums of money, it is impossible to purchase them. It is necessary to manufacture them ourselves to ensure a regular supply. The Department of Health has decided to utilize the vaccine manufacturing section of the Pasteur Institute in the former concessions to serve as the vaccine manufacturing plant of the Central Epidemic Prevention Office, and engage in vaccine production. At the Executive Yuan meeting on the morning of the 14th, the funds for vaccine manufacturing and materials were approved. The progress of epidemic prevention work in the future is predicted to have good results.

He also demanded the dissolution of the CCP's red government and the reorganization of the CCP's army into the national army, etc. The main points are summarized as follows: I believe that the CCP problem is entirely a political problem, so I believe it should still be resolved by political means. No matter how the CCP slanders the Kuomintang, or by whatever means they stir up disputes, we will deal with them with a generous attitude. And I believe that this policy will surely make the CCP succumb to our policies. If CCP members believe in the Three Principles of the People, strictly abide by laws and order [number] and do not hinder the war, then they will still be treated with the attitude of "no blame for the past" as declared at the previous Tenth Plenary Session. However, they should correct their erroneous thinking, abandon the policy of dividing Chinese territory, change their behavior of insulting the Kuomintang army and hindering [number] the war, and fulfill their declarations issued in 1937 and strive to realize the Three Principles of the People. [number] Stop the insurrectionary red government, in order to unify the national regime. [number] Dissolve the Communist army and reorganize it into the National Revolutionary Army, under the command of the Military Affairs Commission. If they guarantee the CCP's loyalty to the "central government," then we will treat them equally.

### Italian Fascist Government; Rebuilding Movement Soars; Hitler and Mussolini to Meet Soon; Germany Announces Details of Mussolini's Escape

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) It is rumored that Commander Mussolini has already [number] gone to the German [number] to meet with Chancellor Hitler, and will go to the German capital first.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to the Haitong News Agency, it was announced here last night that Mussolini's family has also been rescued by the German army. After escaping danger, Mr. Mussolini met with his family and spoke on the phone with Chancellor Hitler. The emotions of [number] Mr. Mussolini and Mr. Hitler during the call cannot be described in words.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) It is rumored that Mussolini's son, Vittorio, has arrived in Germany.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency dispatch) Regarding Mussolini's rescue, the German Foreign Ministry issued a statement on the evening of the 13th stating that after Commander [number] was captured on July 25, he was transferred to various places, from a small island near Sardinia [number] to the [number] mainland, before being rescued by the German army. The Badoglio regime's surveillance of Mr. Mussolini was extremely strict, and even the location of his whereabouts was very secret. Every two or three days, all means were used to transfer Mr. Mussolini to a barracks on an island or to a warship, and a large number of important troops were mobilized to strictly guard against leaks. However, despite this strict vigilance, the German army finally discovered [number] the final location of the Commander, only three or four days ago. Chancellor Hitler, upon learning of this [number], immediately ordered the [number] Captain of the Guard to overcome all difficulties and rescue Commander Mussolini. Commander Mussolini was only transferred from a small island near Sardinia to the Italian mainland [number] ago, and was detained in a remote mountain area. The surveillance team gradually increased. The German [number] Captain personally led elite German troops and paratroopers and launched a brave raid at dawn on the 12th, bravely breaking into the tiger's den and carrying out a surprise attack, finally rescuing Commander Mussolini. The security team had been ordered to shoot Mr. Mussolini immediately if he was rescued, but this time the German army used lightning-fast tactics, catching the enemy off guard. Mr. Mussolini was rescued without any injuries and flew to a large city on the Italian mainland. After Mr. Mussolini safely arrived at that place, he immediately notified the Chancellor's headquarters by telephone. Then, Mr. Hitler and Mr. Mussolini had their first telephone conversation since the Milan meeting. Looking at this incident, the plot is more bizarre than a novel or biography. Also, Commander Mussolini has met with his family, who had been separated for six weeks and had broken out of imprisonment, but due to mental and physical exhaustion, he fell asleep for several hours after the meeting. The news of Commander Mussolini's rescue spread to Italy, and a "Fascist revival" movement was immediately launched in Italy. Black [number] teams appeared on the streets, and Fascist party flags were flying in various cities. In addition, Fascist party leaders and former cabinet members rescued by the German army also frequently met with Commander Mussolini. Thus, the momentum for rebuilding the Fascist government became even more [number] active. During his imprisonment in recent decades, Commander Mussolini was completely unaware of the recent international situation and the evolution of the world war due to isolation from news. However, it is believed that after listening to the situation in [number] three days and all aspects, Mr. Mussolini will ignite his ambition to rebuild the new government, first selecting talented and patriotic leaders within the Fascist party to organize a cabinet during this extraordinary period, and at the same time will gather the elite divisions of the Italian army to reorganize the Fascist army. According to Dr. Schmidt of the German Foreign Ministry, the movement to establish a Fascist national government due to Mr. Mussolini's comeback has entered a new stage, and a re-examination is necessary. Since Mr. Mussolini [number] will go to the German leader's [number] to meet with Chancellor Hitler, the active situation of Mr. Mussolini organizing a new government, leading the Fascist army, and showing a reorganization of the banner will be clear after the meeting.

Ah Xile, 14th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to Haitong News Agency, it has been learned here that Mussolini was originally going to be exiled to St. Helena Island (St. Helena [number] Is.), as the island has already prepared for the arrival of the new exiled prisoner, but the name is kept secret. According to the most recent exiled prisoner on the island, it was Iranian King Li Cha Khan, who opposed British policies in Iran and was exiled to the island in 1942.

### Ionian Sea, British Naval Activity, Germany Strengthens Defenses in the Balkans

Simultaneously, Allied air forces are concentrating between Brindisi, Otranto, and Bari, preparing to attack the Balkans. However, London military experts believe Germany will defend Greece with all its might, and know that Germany has increased the number of artillery positions in Greece, along the Albanian coast, and on the western shore of the Peloponnese.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities telegraphed: German forces have completely controlled the eastern coast of the Adriatic Sea and have occupied the Pola naval base. The coastline from Mantua to Genoa has also been occupied by German forces. German forces, eliminating Italian resistance, reoccupied Fort Bernal on the night of September 11th.

Italian Army Disarmament Proceeds Smoothly

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - When German forces disarmed the Italian troops stationed in northern Greece, the Italian commander, because of his opposition to Badoglio's rebellious actions, surrendered to the German forces and ensured the smooth execution of German orders. Most of the Italian troops in the Corinth area continued to fight alongside the Germans. On the Peloponnese, the disarmament of Italian troops proceeded without incident. Several Fascist Blackshirt troops and Italian army soldiers declared their continued loyalty to the German-Italian alliance. In Montenegro, German forces continued to advance towards the coast. Many Blackshirt divisions joined German units. German forces captured seven cargo ships that had been scuttled to block the harbor, and the harbor was occupied by German forces. Italian naval vessels and merchant ships in the Port of Piraeus were seized by German forces on September 9th. Sailors from Italian torpedo boats volunteered to join the German forces. Several thousand Italian sailors in Athens and Piraeus have declared their willingness to continue fighting alongside the German forces. German motorized units entered Tirana, the capital of Albania, on the 10th. The people of Tirana lined the streets to welcome them, expressing their willingness to cooperate with the German forces.

### Badoglio Regime Surrenders, Japanese Government Takes Measures, Italian Troops in East Asia Disarmed

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 3:30 PM on the 14th: Because the Italian "Badoglio" government betrayed the alliance and surrendered on September 9th, the Imperial Army and Navy will immediately disarm Italian troops in various parts of East Asia and impound their ships. Italian rights in the occupied territories will be taken over by the Imperial Army and Navy. In other regions, the Allies will cooperate in the takeover. Non-combatant Italians in the occupied territories will be placed under surveillance and protection.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese government considers the surrender of the Badoglio regime to be an act of hostility towards Japan. It issued a statement on the afternoon of the 9th, clarifying the Japanese government's attitude. Meanwhile, the government has decided to take necessary measures quickly, based on established policies, regarding Italians residing in Japan and their assets. It has decided to detain and monitor Italian diplomatic officials stationed in Japan and ordinary Italian expatriates, cutting off their communication with the outside world. Appropriate measures have been taken to stop cargo shipments. In terms of financial relations, foreign exchange transactions related to Italians have also been suspended.

### Anti-Axis Forces in Central Italy Withdraw from Salerno, Bari Occupied by British Forces

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - It is claimed here that British forces are crowding onto various types of ships, withdrawing from the Salerno area and retreating to Policastro harbor, located in the southeastern part of the western coast of Italy. These ships arrived before dawn this morning in Policastro harbor. They are the first ships by which the British army are attempting to retreat southeast of Salerno. Initially, they took a direct route to Sicily, but after being attacked by German aircraft en route, they changed course and sailed south along the rocky coast. Yesterday afternoon, British forces were seen boarding ships in many places in Salerno and the Gulf of Policastro. Southeast of Salerno, the British have a total of two battleships, several cruisers, and fifty to sixty medium and large transport ships, as well as multiple landing craft, engaged in evacuating the remnants of the defeated landing force. North of the Gulf of Policastro, there are five large landing craft and about thirty to forty landing boats. These landing boats are used to transport completely exhausted British heavy troops who have fled from the mountains. This disorganized retreat, occurring shortly after the landing, proves that it has encountered a large-scale defeat.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Reuters, Eisenhower, the Allied commander in Algiers, announced today that the anti-Axis forces have occupied Bari. Bari is located on the Adriatic coast of Italy, about sixty miles northwest of Brindisi, which has already been occupied by the anti-Axis forces.

### Forty-Seven Italian Warships Join Anti-Axis

Stockholm, Sweden, 14th (Central News Agency) - After the unconditional surrender of the Badoglio regime, the total number of Italian warships that were able to escape from Italian ports is not yet known. However, according to currently available information, a total of four battleships, nine cruisers, seventeen destroyers, two aircraft carriers, fourteen submarines, and one smaller warship have fled to anti-Axis bases. According to a United Press report from Larrini, two cruisers, three destroyers, and two aircraft carriers have already arrived at Gibraltar. Algiers Radio also broadcast on September 12th that another fourteen submarines and eight destroyers were en route to Malta, and one smaller ship had arrived in Cyprus. Admiral Cunningham, the Commander-in-Chief of the Anti-Axis Naval Forces in the Mediterranean, announced on September 12th that there were five Italian battleships, not four, anchored in Malta. At the same time, Reuters' naval correspondent said that Italy's elite battleships cannot be used against Japan. These battleships cannot be sent to the East by their original crews, as there is no such obligation under the armistice agreement. Due to technical reasons, they cannot be operated by anti-Axis crews. Moreover, the Italian fleet was built specifically for high-speed operations in the Mediterranean, and its fuel capacity is insufficient for operations in the vast Pacific Ocean. More than half of the 1,500 crew members of the new Italian battleships are highly trained technicians, and the technical equipment of Italian ships is different from that of the British and American navies, so the British and Americans cannot train personnel to operate Italian ships without considerable delay.

### Japanese Envoy to Italy Cables Safety

Tokyo, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Foreign Ministry recently received reports from Ambassador Oshima in Germany and the Japanese Consul General in Vienna, confirming that Ambassador Hidaka to Italy, the embassy staff, and other Japanese expatriates are safe.

It is scheduled to arrive at Mormugao in Portuguese Goa, the exchange point, on October 15th. The American exchange ship, the Gripsholm, carrying "1340" people, set sail on September 3rd and is currently sailing towards Rio de Janeiro.

### Fierce Fighting Continues on Central and Southern Routes of the Eastern Front, German Forces Withdraw from Bryansk

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - Colonel Hammer, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, stated that German forces withdrew from the city of Bryansk last night, after thoroughly destroying all factories and military facilities in the city. Goods and machinery were moved from the city to other locations two weeks ago.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - German military authorities issued the following report on the Eastern Front on the 13th: Since the Soviet offensive began, it has been ten days. Now, in the southern sector, a large-scale offensive has begun with elite troops. This offensive may continue until the rainy, muddy season. German units in various locations have become aware of this Soviet attempt and are preparing countermeasures. No matter how stubbornly the Soviet forces attack, they will be repelled. In the Donets River area, several units have cut off the rear of the Soviet forces that have broken into the German lines, causing them to lose contact one after another and become encircled. Fierce fighting is currently underway in that area. Detailed information is not yet available. The front lines west of Kharkov and near Konotop are also at a stalemate. On the 12th, German forces in the southern sector destroyed 83 Soviet tanks. West of Vyazma, German forces are also fiercely resisting the Soviet forces.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - The correspondent of the German News Agency, Selrius, said: The pressure exerted by the Soviet forces on the central and southern routes of the Eastern Front will remain very strong until the weekend. It is expected that the Soviets will continue to attack until the autumn muddy season begins. However, generally speaking, the situation on the Eastern Front has slightly eased, probably because the German forces are fighting back vigorously and have been able to encircle and cut off the enemy's vanguard. Especially in the area between the Sea of Azov and the middle reaches of the Donets River, as well as west and south of Kharkov, the German armored units have been very successful. The enemy's attacks towards Poltava and Krasnograd have made no progress. The German forces in this blocking line are gradually completing the task of blocking westward, and the scope of the front line is gradually shrinking. The fighting west of Konotop is fluid and mobile, with intertwined front lines, which have yet to be determined. At the same time, the Soviet forces are attacking Bryansk and intensifying pressure west of Kirov on the upper reaches of the Desna River. The situation in the Smolensk region remains unchanged.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - German News Agency reports: On Sunday, Soviet forces achieved some success on the right flank of the German Desna line. Soviet forces, with strong troops and under the cover of heavy artillery fire, crossed the Desna River and established a bridgehead on the west bank of the river. However, it is reported that German units, which initially evaded the fierce Soviet attacks, finally prevented the Soviet forces from expanding their initial success. German reserve troops, which arrived at the breakthrough point in the late afternoon, finally recovered a place that had been taken by the enemy and reduced its bridgehead. Other Soviet attempts to cross the river were thwarted, and the Red Army suffered many casualties.

### Security Restored in Rome

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - The German occupation authorities in Rome announced by broadcast on the night of the 13th that German forces have now assumed responsibility for the defense of major areas of Italy. Because unruly elements resisted German forces, some fighting occurred in the city of Rome. However, security in Rome has now been restored. All weapons held by Italian citizens must be handed over to the authorities. Anyone still holding weapons after September 15th will be sentenced to death. Those who violate other military control regulations will be severely punished by military law.

Enthusiastic Expressions of Support for the Leader

Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a cable from Curacao, when the news of Mussolini's rescue reached Rome, German forces immediately broadcast to all residents of Rome with sound trucks equipped with loudspeakers. The citizens were extremely excited upon hearing the news. The Piazza Venezia, famous for Mussolini's "lion's roar," was soon filled with citizens, and shouts of "Banzai" resounded like thunder. When this news reached Corendolyn and other places, it was almost midnight, but it immediately spread throughout the city. Fascist Italian soldiers also staged temporary parades and demonstrations.

Zurich, 14th (Central News Agency) - It is reported that in various cities in northern Italy, Fascist party rule is gradually being restored. Since the 11th, Blackshirt party members have been staging demonstrations in the streets, despite the imposition of martial law.

Berlin, 14th (Central News Agency) - Italian laborers in Dresden, Leipzig, Munich, Bremen, and other places in Germany held meetings on the 13th and resolved to thoroughly support Commander Mussolini and the new Fascist government.

### Iran Joins the Anti-Axis Camp

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) - United Press reports: U.S. Secretary of State Hull announced that Iran has been formally recognized as joining the anti-Axis camp today.

### Japanese Consulates in Kaifeng and Other Places Upgraded

### Nanjing Allied Officials and Civilians Expand Aviation Commemoration

Nanjing, 14th (Central News Agency) - On the Allied Japanese Aviation Memorial Day, the Nanjing Japan-China National Service Association, the Japanese Army and Navy authorities, the Japanese Embassy, the Consulate General, the Resident Group, the Veterans Association, the Marine Association, and the Mainland New News, etc., to commemorate the great war results of countless army, navy and air force under the new era since the attack on Pearl Harbor, decided to hold an expanded Aviation Memorial Week from the 15th to the 22nd, centering on the 20th.

### Shanghai Rationed Rice Still Urgently Needs Relief, It Is Reported That Some Difficulties Have Been Resolved, City Food Bureau Borrows 30 Million Yuan from Central Reserve Bank

The Ministry of Food's second allocation of 150,000 bags of rice to our city, of which 100,000 bags designated to be allocated from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, could not be shipped as scheduled due to issues with the payment procedures. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, some accidental difficulties have now been resolved. The Rice Grain Joint Venture will send personnel to the dispatch area to transport the rice to Shanghai to meet the needs of the people.

Issues of Transportation Responsibility and Payment Priority

It is found that the Ministry of Food allocated 150,000 bags of rice, belonging to the quota of August, including 100,000 bags from the Su-Song-Chang-Jia area, 30,000 bags from the Nanjing area, and 20,000 bags from the Yangzhou area. Except for the 100,000 bags from Su-Song-Chang-Jia designated to be transported by the Rice Grain Joint Venture, the 50,000 bags from the Yangzhou and Nanjing areas, together with the 11,790 bags of the first batch from the Huzhou area that have not been transported, a total of over 68,000 bags are to be transported separately by the Single United Rice Shell Allocation Association and the Rice Grain Joint Venture.

Shanghai News Agency reporters learned that the Ministry of Food has always adhered to the principle of paying before shipping for the allocation of rice to local areas. The first batch allocated to Shanghai was temporarily permitted to be shipped before payment after Mayor Chen's consultation. As for the second batch of rice, the established principle was followed, but the shipping period was delayed due to the difficulty in raising funds. Now, all kinds of difficulties have been resolved. According to another source, the relevant authorities in the city are giving serious consideration to the requirement of raising funds and paying in full before shipping the rice. Finally, the district authorities borrowed heavily from the bank to facilitate turnover. Therefore, the transportation of the second batch of rice can begin within days.

The Issue of the Existence or Abolition of the Joint Venture, the View of the Grain Control Committee

The issue of the Rice Grain Joint Venture has attracted attention from various parties since the Grain Control Committee began to store rice. However, the nature, powers, and work of the Rice Control Committee after its establishment are not yet fully determined. Therefore, whether the Joint Venture should be managed and retained is awaiting the decision of the Ministry of Food.

The Rice Grain Control Committee held a preliminary meeting on the 11th of this month, the first preparatory meeting on the 12th, and held a discussion meeting and a second preparatory meeting on the 13th. The agenda of the three-day meeting focused on the unified purchase of rice shells in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui. After ten people from both China and Japan participated in the meeting, it was considered that the starting point should be from procurement and transportation. The Chinese authorities must do their utmost to fulfill their responsibilities, and the Allied side should thoroughly assist. According to Shanghai News Agency reporters, the committee has reported the results of the Japan-China meeting to the relevant senior authorities and requested instructions. It will convene another meeting within days to discuss preparatory work.

The Loan Process of the Food Bureau

The City Food Bureau established a huge loan of 30 million yuan with the City Public Liaison and the Central Reserve Bank. Yesterday, a Central News Agency reporter paid a special visit to Zhang Xianzhi, the director of the bureau, to inquire about the purpose and process of the loan. He was told the following: "Our bureau was established in January last year and only received an initial operating fund of 120,000 yuan. There was no rice procurement fund because the rice needed at that time was first allocated by the Grain Management Committee for public sales before repayment. Moreover, because a portion of the private rice in storage could be effectively utilized, a large amount of funds was not required. Later, the method of releasing rice was changed, requiring payment in advance. Our bureau needed to prepare a huge amount of funds to facilitate turnover, so we borrowed from the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The first loan amounted to 8 million yuan, which was approved by the former Director Wu and submitted to the City Government on November 17 last year. In early February of this year, I succeeded as the director of this bureau. Because the amount of rice and the price of rice increased each period, more funds were required. I submitted a request to the City Government and borrowed an additional 6 million yuan on March 1, and another 4 million yuan on May 1. In total, we borrowed 18 million yuan three times, which allowed us to hold public sales on schedule. Until after early August, the demand for rice increased, and the original funds became more difficult to manage. Therefore, the City Government repaid all the previously accumulated 18 million yuan and established a new reserve of 30 million yuan with the Central Reserve Bank on August 19. This is the process of our bureau borrowing from the Central Reserve Bank. Regarding the use of the loan, such as the receipt and payment of funds and the entry and exit accounts of grain, the bank has assigned a special commissioner stationed in the bureau who knows it very well. In addition, various statistical tables are filled out and sent to the bank every ten days for reference. Although there has been a slight delay in the recent public sales, with the assistance of the Central Reserve Bank in borrowing funds, we should be able to handle it comfortably. We have already established separate methods for receiving and paying funds at each public sales point, which will be implemented from the 23rd period onwards, to make turnover more flexible and reduce the amount of frozen funds such as burlap guarantee deposits. We will try to ensure that there are no more delays to meet the expectations of the people."

### Salt Administration Decides on Salt Supply Methods: Water and Land Transportation to Ensure Unimpeded Sources, Sales Still Under Yuhua Company Supervision

The Salt Administration of the Ministry of Finance is deeply concerned about the people's need for edible salt. Recognizing that the supply of goods in Shanghai is currently scarce due to transportation issues, and that some ignorant merchants are taking the opportunity to manipulate and raise market prices without authorization, which harms people's livelihoods, it is necessary to improve the production, transportation, and sales of edible salt. Therefore, a meeting was convened in the Nanjing office, gathering relevant agencies and companies to discuss improvement measures. Those present included Director Ruan, Deputy Director Liu, Secretary, Section Chief Gong, Director Liu of the Jiangsu-Zhejiang-Anhui Salt Tax Bureau, Deputy Director Kato, Director Chen and Section Chief Xue of the Songjiang Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, Deputy Director Waigan of the Haizhou District Salt Affairs Administration Bureau, Directors Yang and Luo of the China Salt Industry Company, Director Morita, Section Chief Ota, Director Dan of the Yuhua Salt Industry Company, Section Chief Chen, and Advisor Ouchi.

Meeting Result: First,

Director Ruan (Deputy Director acting) reported the purpose of the meeting, and then immediately began discussion on: How to improve transportation and ensure unimpeded sources: (Resolution) In the future, in addition to the original ships and sailboats, railway transportation will be implemented, and the tonnage of shipping will be increased. Thus, with both water and land transportation, the source can be unblocked. The China authorities immediately expressed their willingness to take responsibility for handling this matter. Regarding how to improve the salt sales issue: (Resolution) The salt sales issue will still be the responsibility of the Yuhua Company. After the China Company transports the salt, it will quickly distribute it to salt merchants in various districts for widespread sale. The Yuhua Company expressed its willingness to do its utmost to find the quickest way to distribute the salt. Finally, the Director discussed with the various Directors, etc., that they should strive to supervise and guide the local salt affairs and must not be negligent.

Explaining the Current Situation: Moreover, regarding the salt problem in this city, a reporter from the Central News Agency made a special visit yesterday to the person in charge of the Songjiang District Salt Affairs Administration Bureau. According to reports: "The supply of edible salt is scarce due to unimpeded transportation, and illegal private dealers are engaged in illegal transactions, resulting in a black market phenomenon, which is regrettable. The Ministry of Finance is paying close attention to this matter and has convened a meeting of relevant officials and businessmen. Concrete measures have been discussed for the transportation and sales problems. Afterwards, the source can be unblocked, and there will be no shortage of salt in various places." The reporter also asked about the current state of edible salt, and the reply was: "This bureau is in an official position to manage and control, in addition to helping to unblock the source, the passive work that is currently focused on is: Strictly manage retail salt shops, and ban single-person salt vendors from leaving the country. As for the plan for rationing based on population, it is under study, and as soon as a concrete decision is made, it can be submitted to the Ministry of Finance for approval and implementation."

Brief Commentary

### On the Personnel Issues of the Rice and Grain Control Committee

For any organization, whether it be a government agency, a non-governmental organization, or a commercial or industrial association, the success of its endeavors depends entirely on the dedication and focus of its members to drive progress. If the members are unable to devote themselves wholeheartedly, the organization's efforts will inevitably fail. Similarly, individuals who pursue academic research or scientific inquiry must be single-minded and diligently focused to achieve their goals. Therefore, we advocate that personnel within organizations and groups must be employed in dedicated, full-time positions and not permitted to hold concurrent posts.

The Rice and Grain Control Committee, currently in the midst of active preparations, presents a case in point. Regarding personnel matters, we have repeatedly offered our sincere and straightforward opinions. First, positions must be absolutely full-time, with no concurrent appointments allowed. Second, a rigorous selection process should be adopted. Rumors suggest that the committee is inclined towards part-time appointments, with plans to transfer some staff from the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to hold concurrent positions. If these rumors prove true, we believe this is ill-advised. The committee's work is burdensome and challenging, far beyond the capacity of part-time staff. Furthermore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is the sole commercial body in the city, and we can reasonably assume that its range of responsibilities is extensive and complex. This means that existing staff already have heavy workloads, making it objectively impossible for them to take on additional duties. Each person has limited time and energy, and attempting to juggle multiple roles will lead to both tasks suffering. Therefore, we insist that full-time positions be the norm, with only committee members and others who do not handle practical matters being considered for part-time appointments. At the same time, the organizational structure should be streamlined and simplified, avoiding excessive bureaucracy and the pitfalls of a bloated governmental apparatus.

We believe that the current trend of concurrent appointments stems from two primary causes: first, the high cost of living makes it difficult to subsist on a single income, leading people to seek additional employment; and second, an excessive emphasis on personal connections. The notion of "one person's celebration extends to the entire nation" leads to the acceptance of any and all relatives and friends, regardless of their qualifications. However, official duties and personal feelings are two separate matters. Official duties must be guided by principles, not influenced by emotions, and public office should not be used as a tool for private reward. These thoughts on the Rice and Grain Control Committee's personnel issues lead us to these broader observations.

### Maintaining Combat Strength: Germany's Defensive Counter-Offensive

The war has now entered its fifth year. European Axis powers, aware of the precariousness of the final outcome, have adopted a defensive posture. Using Sicily as a base, the Anglo-Americans are pressing into the Mediterranean, taking a direct course toward Italy and Corsica. Italy itself is adopting a posture reminiscent of Cannes, Crete, and Greece. Simultaneously, from the British mainland, they are threatening Western and Northern Europe. On the Eastern Front, the Red Army recaptured Kharkov. After Rylsk, their target is directly aimed at the Dnieper River. This battle line will likely remain static in the coming six weeks during the rainy season, before the start of the winter campaign. Germany is closely defending Western and Southern Europe. On the Eastern Front, Germany has sacrificed land this year to deplete the Red Army's strength. The Red Army's soldiers and war efforts have suffered significant damage. During the winter, the Red Army's offensive will be greatly weakened. On the Eastern Front, the Red Army's primary objective is to weaken the German forces, with reclaiming territory as a secondary goal. As such, the fighting is extremely fierce, and the Red Army's offensive will temporarily halt at the Dnieper River. Beyond the Dnieper River, the German defenses are very strong, and the Soviets will avoid sacrificing more Red Army soldiers. The Soviet Union hopes for an Anglo-American landing in Western Europe. If Germany is forced to withdraw sixty divisions from the Eastern Front, it will be unable to launch an offensive west of the Dnieper. However, judging from the Anglo-American relationship with the Soviet Union, the Anglo-Americans are not opening a second front to assist the Soviet Union. On the contrary, even if a second front emerges this winter, it will likely only happen when the Anglo-Americans perceive that both the Soviet and German forces are weakening.

Germany Adopts a Defensive Strategy

Germany's intention is that, while the Anglo-American air raids and landing operations are small in scale, they cannot be ignored as a significant problem. Therefore, Germany cannot help but adopt a completely defensive posture. The complete shift from an offensive to a defensive posture is entirely a matter of quantity. At the beginning of the war, German forces held overwhelming superiority in both the quality and quantity of soldiers and weapons. However, as the war progressed and American production capacity increased, the balance of power completely shifted. Now, taken together, the Anglo-American forces possess a quantitative advantage over Germany in both soldiers and weapons. To compensate for this quantitative disadvantage, Germany has no choice but to adopt a defensive posture.

The plan is to inflict considerable damage on the enemy through defensive warfare and then, once the balance of power is restored, launch a decisive offensive. An early landing would be a major gamble for the Anglo-Americans. If this operation fails, the balance of power will immediately be restored. But if it succeeds, the war will be decided. In this sense, the current situation is indeed at a decisive stage. The Anglo-Americans hope for a very successful outcome, hence the constant rumors that the European war will end next year. During this period, Germany is focusing on the research and manufacture of new weapons, which is of particular significance. Germany's troop strength and morale show no signs of weakness. Germany fought the Anglo-American forces in Sicily for several weeks with only two or three divisions under unfavorable conditions. The fighting capacity of the German army is truly astonishing. According to Soviet reports, the deployment of German troops is as follows: 211 divisions in the East, 91 divisions in Europe (35 in France, Belgium, and the Netherlands, 8 to 10 in the Balkans and Norway, 20 in Britain, and the remainder as reserves on the Polish and Eastern Fronts). The Anglo-Americans are terrified of the German military presence in Western Europe. Therefore, the attack on Europe is waiting until urban bombings and internal unrest weaken Germany.

During the defensive period, the most dangerous issues for Germany are not the food problems that plagued them in the previous war, which have been resolved, but rather the psychological warfare waged by the enemy through bombing and propaganda.

Europe's Interior Remains Stable

If Germany's defense and the Soviet Union's offensive continue in this manner, there is a risk of communist movements emerging. Moreover, the encroachment on Germany's allied and occupied territories in Europe will become increasingly apparent. With the exception of some neutral countries, the rest of Europe is under German influence. As the decisive period in Europe approaches, the situation becomes clearer. The Anglo-Americans believe that Germany's adoption of a defensive posture is a sign of defeat. This strategy is somewhat effective, but so far there have been no instances of communist exploitation. The unity of Europe's interior remains stable. (Xiang Yi, translated from the Tokyo Mother Daily News, September 2nd)

### Japanese Military Police Authorities' Statement Denies Confiscation of Pedestrians' Gold Jewelry, Current Investigation of Source of Rumors

Central News Agency: Since the 6th of this month, rumors suddenly broke out in Shanghai that the Japanese military police were confiscating metal products such as gold rings and gold jewelry from pedestrians in the area of Nanjing Road, North Sichuan Road Bridge, and Zha Pu Road Bridge. For a time, the rumors spread widely, and the general public was skeptical. The Japanese military police authorities issued a statement on the 14th, absolutely denying these facts and urging that in the future, if such behavior is actually encountered, it should be immediately reported to the military police so that they can assist in arresting the perpetrators. The transcript of the military police authorities' statement is as follows: The Japanese Army and Navy have always worked hard to stabilize people's livelihoods. Recently, rumors have suddenly arisen that the military police are confiscating metal products from women passing by. This is truly regrettable. The Japanese authorities have never implemented any regulations secretly without prior announcement. This will continue to be the case in the future. If you actually encounter confiscation in the future, please immediately notify the nearest military police station. Also, the military police are now strictly investigating the source of these rumors. Temporarily by the Education Bureau

### Retrospect and Prospect of the Food Control Organization

The Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company has decided to dissolve on the 20th of this month, and the Rice and Grain Control Committee will be established. It has already been decided that Mr. Yuan LÃ¼edeng will be responsible. The committee will meet on the 10th. The preparatory committee held a preparatory group meeting on the 11th. The new rice and grain coordination mechanism is gradually becoming a reality. Now that the establishment of the new council is approaching, all parties are deeply concerned about the future of rice and grain control. This article will examine and prospect on this specific problem.

The shortcomings of the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company

In order to unify the purchase and sale of rice and grain, the Food Department specially organized the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company, and established joint promotion companies in the main rice producing areas, which were supervised by the food bureaus of each province and the purchase and sale offices of each region. On the surface, the control mechanism seems to be complete, but because rice merchants do not understand the big picture and only seek company profits, administrative agencies cannot be rectified, and this shortcoming has led to the need to reform and abolish the company.

The Attitudes of the Government and the Chamber of Commerce

The national authorities attach as much importance to the rice and grain problem as they do to the cotton yarn and cotton cloth problem. After several discussions with the Chamber of Commerce, it was decided to establish the Rice and Grain Control Committee to be responsible for promoting everything. The characteristics of the new organization

The characteristics of the new organization

Regarding the characteristics of the newly established rice and grain control mechanism, it is very similar to the professional committees of the Chamber of Commerce at the beginning of the preparation, and the difference is that the professional committee is an internal agency of the Chamber of Commerce, while the rice and grain control committee is an external agency, and in fact it is an independent agency. The professional committee is only organized by merchants of one industry, but the rice and grain control committee is composed of representatives from all walks of life. In order to achieve liaison, it was decided that the Director of the Materials Department of the China Chamber of Commerce would serve as a member of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. In order to facilitate the allocation of funds for purchasing rice and grain, it was also decided that the representative of the Shanghai branch of the China Reserve Bank would also be one of the members of the committee.

Japanese rice merchants also participate

It was found that no Japanese economic figures participated in the directors and supervisors of the Chamber of Commerce, but five Japanese rice industry representatives participated in the members of the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Both China and Japan attach great importance to the food problem and hope to solve it smoothly.

Mr. Yuan's Work

The Joint Venture Company has been criticized by all parties for several months after its establishment and has now decided to dissolve.

All parties have high expectations for the new organization centered on Mr. Yuan LÃ¼edeng. Mr. Yuan himself also said that no matter how the past performance of the Joint Venture Company was, he will definitely strive to adjust and solve the people's livelihood problems in the future, in order to live up to the expectations of the citizens.

### Change Cotton Fields to Other Crops

It is not possible for beans and miscellaneous grains, but it is for cotton. This year, during the planting period for cotton, it rained continuously and the temperature was low. In addition, cotton prices have risen in recent years and cotton production is not as good as food crops. All cotton fields that could be converted to other crops have been converted to beans and their reports, so the cultivated area of cotton fields and the amount of cotton have decreased significantly compared with last year. Because the various winter crops that matured this spring, such as wheat, broad beans, rapeseed, etc., had not seen rain for a long time after being sown last winter, and because the drought resistance of various crops was different and the increase or decrease in cultivated land was different, their production prospects were either increased or decreased compared with last year. Wheat, because of its strong drought resistance, still has good harvests. Jiujia in the north, Hongnan and Zhejiang East are also not bad. It is also said that there was more rain during the peak season, so the results were poor, but in general,

The wheat harvest exceeded last year. The area cultivated with wheat increased in various places, so the total harvest volume may exceed last year. Because there was too much drought this year, the broad bean harvest was not as good as last year, but because the cultivated area also increased, the harvest volume may also be comparable to last year. The rapeseed situation was the worst. It was droughty when it was sown, and it was subjected to wind and rain when it matured. In addition, the cultivated area was reduced, so the harvest volume should not be as good as last year.

### Settlement of Accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival - Industries Pass Peacefully, Overall Finance is Very Stable

Yesterday was the Mid-Autumn Festival for the settlement of accounts for various industries. The banking industry, various money shops, and various industry markets were all closed as usual. Various companies, factories, and shops were very busy handling the settlement of accounts for the Mid-Autumn Festival. Most of the credit accounts that had been released before were able to be recovered before the festival. At the same time, because the Central Reserve Bank, the Silver Money Reserve Association, and the financial industry cooperated effectively, the overall finance was very stable, and the money market was not as tight as in the past. Various industries have passed this Mid-Autumn Festival peacefully. It is also reported that various banks and various industry markets will resume business today, and all documents during the holidays will be processed after the resumption of business.

### Sharp Increase in Agricultural Production in Jiangsu and Zhejiang Provinces This Year - Survey Report by the Economic Research Association

The Chinese Economic Research Association, in order to investigate the general situation of development in Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, entrusted local churches to conduct the survey.

High Rice Prices

Increased Rice Fields It is reported that the area sown with rice in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has generally increased due to the stimulus of high rice prices. As for the weather, there was sufficient rainfall this spring, making planting easier. At this time of high labor costs, farmers have benefited greatly. Generally speaking, the initial growth of rice in various parts of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces this year has been quite good. Only the areas on both sides of the Yangtze River and the eastern part of Zhejiang have been slightly worse due to the slightly cold weather and lack of sunshine, but there is no major problem.

### Xing Zhuang Company Increases Capital; Deadline for Completion

In order to strengthen financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has revised the articles of incorporation for banks, the Savings Bank Law, the Provisional Regulations for Trust Companies, and the regulations for provincial and municipal banks. Financial institutions such as banks, money shops, and trust companies must increase their capital to comply with national laws. It was learned yesterday that the deadline for completing the capital increase of various money shops is before the 31st of December this year. Those that exceed the deadline will be ordered to suspend operations. Furthermore, the business operations of all financial institutions are strictly limited to those stipulated by law. Those who deviate will be subject to penalties by the Financial Affairs Inspection Office.

### Handicraft Weaving Industry Pleads for Relief

The Water City Cloth Factory Trade Association has more than 280 members in its handicraft weaving group. Since the unified purchase of yarn and cloth, about ninety percent of the looms have stopped, cutting off their livelihoods. The association has sent a letter to the Cotton Products United Association and the National Commercial Control General Association seeking relief. The New Control Association has replied, stating that it approved letter No. 151 from the Cotton Products United Association, which stated that the handicraft weaving group of the factory trade association mostly has meager capital, and the handwoven cloth must be sold daily to make a living. Now, due to the unified control of yarn and cloth, they cannot move or operate, which affects the livelihoods of the weaving machine households, and requests consideration for relief. The association has verified that the situation described is true and proper. It will wait until the government's yarn and cloth allocation plan is approved and promulgated before the association applies for early relief for review and handling. It is now heard that handwoven cloth is not subject to unified control, and the business scope meets the standards stipulated by the authorities. Yesterday, the association again sent a list of factory addresses to the Commercial Control Association, stating their difficult situation and requesting consideration for the households, investigating the actual situation, and lifting the control of this part of the handicraft cloth industry as soon as possible to maintain production and seek relief.

### Economic Bureau Convenes Talks with Industry and Commerce

Xu Tianshen, Director of the Municipal Economic Bureau, convened talks with the responsible persons of various industrial and commercial trade associations at the Municipal Government Auditorium to understand the recent situation of the associations. More than 120 representatives from various associations attended. Director Xu gave a speech, urging the representatives to persuade their fellow traders to join the associations to strengthen their organization and assist the government in implementing wartime economic policies. The representatives expressed their opinions, and the talks lasted for more than an hour before adjourning.

Beijing Correspondence

### Plague in the Old Capital

A Pandemic Atmosphere Pervades

August has passed, and September has arrived. Everyone is waiting for the long-awaited civil defense exercise in all of North China. On the morning of September 1st, there were still traces of household surveys in preparation, and instructions were given on the matters that should be traveled. However, on September 2nd, the Beijing Central Radio Station suddenly issued an order from the Beijing Defense Command stating, "The civil defense exercise in the Beijing area, previously scheduled to be implemented for five days from September 4th to 8th, has been decided to strengthen the prevention of plague. The civil defense exercise in Fengtai and the Beijing area is temporarily postponed." As a result, the atmosphere of preventing plague replaced the atmosphere of civil defense and pervaded all of Beijing.

The Origin of the Plague

The plague rarely occurs in Beijing. This year, Beijing experienced a prolonged drought, followed by continuous rain. Two weeks ago, the temperature indoors was still above 100 degrees. Recently, it has rained continuously for several days, and the weather has suddenly turned cold. Now, it is necessary to wear a sweater in the morning and evening. Due to the sudden change in climate, the plague has also followed. The first case was discovered on the 26th of last month. The patient was a resident of Xiangyuan. Later, it spread to the city. In Guang'anmen, Chongwenmen, Dongdan, Chaoyangmen, Xibianmen, and Dawaili Mao Hutong, there were more than a dozen cases of illness and death. Therefore, the Beijing authorities paid special attention to this. Since the 31st of last month, some important city gates, such as Xizhimen and Chaoyangmen, have only been opened halfway. Although citizens can enter and exit, there are Japanese military police, inspectors, and security personnel checking pedestrians. Even farmers bringing vegetables to the market must have their vegetables washed with disinfectant water before entering the city. As a result, the price of vegetables has risen daily. In addition, small grain merchants from the countryside who came to the city with provisions due to the previous ban on disinfectant food entering the city also found it difficult to enter the city. Therefore, the price of grain has also risen as high as vegetables. On the other hand, the streets in the city where the plague was discovered have also been cut off from traffic. The number of patients and deaths has increased again in the past two days. Yesterday, Liutiao Hutong in Dongsi Pailou was also closed to traffic due to the plague outbreak. Until today, most of the city gates are still closed.

Preventive Measures

As for preventive measures, in addition to temporarily canceling the civil defense exercise, the Beijing Defense Command and other relevant agencies also convened a plague prevention meeting at the North [unclear character] Defense Command at 3:00 PM on the 2nd of this month. Representatives from the North China Political Affairs Commission, the Municipal Committee Social Bureau, the Health Bureau, the Police Bureau, the Japanese Embassy, and the North China Transportation Residents [unclear character] attended. According to the newspapers, the purpose of this meeting was to "decide to expand the plague prevention work in order to seek the safety of all citizens of Kyoto." Another meeting was held at [unclear character] at 3:00 PM on the 3rd. Today's report stated that yesterday's report said: "Currently, the Japanese side has formed a plague prevention team centered on the Consulate General and residents, and has taken proper measures. The Peian Transport Company is also vigorously carrying out plague prevention at various stations in Beijing, etc., and has achieved significant results. At the same time, under the strong guidance of the Beijing Municipal Government and the [unclear character] Police Bureau, we have mobilized the Chinese Physicians Association and the Peking University Medical College to form 100 injection teams, which will carry out quarantine in the outer five districts within five days and have already begun their activities. In addition, the issue of disposing of those who have fallen ill has also been resolved. For the time being, there will be no examination by the court, and the Health Bureau will be responsible for handling it. All regions have decided to conduct household inspections, and all hutongs have also decided to be ordered to clean up. In addition, it has been decided to urge the beggar shelters to actively accommodate the city's mobile laborers and implement centralized quarantine. Those who are confirmed to have the plague will be immediately isolated. Currently, the Medical, Police, Social, and Health Bureaus are working together to carry out this work." (September 4th) With such active plague prevention, it is expected that it will soon achieve great results. However, for the Beijing citizens who have been struggling against hunger since spring, this time they must not only resist hunger but also resist the plague. (August 4th)

National Forum

### Should Teachers Exchange Pens for Guard Posts?

One

The mission of education and youth does not need to be defined in theory as important. Without time or space, [unclear character] cannot ignore its unique position. For example, when friendly nations dealt with the concession not long ago, they once solemnly declared that they would do their best to protect education and that education and youth workers could rest assured.

However, the Shanghai First District Baojia Office (or perhaps it is not the intention of the highest Baojia authority) still issued a notice requiring teachers to take turns on guard duty, which is truly perplexing.

The work of the self-defense corps is to watch out for each other, while the mission of teachers is to cultivate talents. The guard duty of the self-defense corps only lasts for a few hours, while the duties of teachers are lifelong. Today, when we are singing loudly about respecting teachers and providing relief to teachers, it is a strange thing to order teachers to take turns on guard duty. Now, all Yin Shi is imitating Eastern products. I wonder if Japanese schools have regulations to suspend classes for a certain number of hours every ten days so that teachers can be on guard duty. I sincerely hope that the Baojia authorities will sympathize with the teachers. (Peng Ruogu)

Two

Since the implementation of Baojia in this city, incidents of theft and intimidation have decreased day by day, which shows that the Baojia system is well-intentioned. The authorities and all staff members have worked hard to promote it, and residents should all remember it deeply and praise it unanimously.

Among the residents, those who are most grateful to Baojia are teachers. In the past two years, the Baojia authorities have repeatedly stated in their official documents that teachers are allowed to be exempt from service in the civil police corps. They believe that teachers have arduous work, meager salaries, difficult lives, and important responsibilities. The Baojia authorities have insight into the hidden situation and have specially exempted them from guard duty. Their virtue is truly abundant. Therefore, teachers are all moved to tears, and students and parents alike praise them endlessly. "Teachers are exempt from service." The Baojia's kindness is the most excellent and abundant. However, the Lian Bao chiefs do not understand this intention and often do not allow exemption from service, rejecting applications, so that the authorities' virtue cannot flow downward, and the lower situation cannot reach upward. I wonder what their intention is. (Jiyuan)

Social Services

### Gathering of Elders During the Mid-Autumn Festival to Preach the Way of Health and Longevity

Yesterday afternoon, during the Mid-Autumn Festival, the Social Service Department of this newspaper specially held an exhibition at the Ningbo Fellow Association on the fourth floor to hold a forum for the elderly and promote the holy way of respecting the elderly and good works. More than 30 people attended, including Shen Tianxin, Zhu Mouxian, Zhu Juefo, and Li Jian. First, Director Huang introduced the elders to each other and stated that his colleagues care about providing for the elderly, helping the elderly, providing comfort for the elderly, and respecting the elderly, and that they had specially invited elders from all walks of life to gather in one room on this auspicious day to encourage each other. Preventing people from helping to give and accumulate good fortune is beneficial to descendants, and assisting the lonely, weak, old, sick, and poor, wishing you all happiness, longevity, health, and peace.

Next, Dr. Ding Fulao, a medical expert, spoke about the needs of the average person, which can be divided into eight categories. 1. Good health, 2. Long life, 3. Sufficient food and drink, 4. Comfortable sleep, 5. Financial satisfaction, 6. Fulfilling sexual desires, 7. Peaceful children, 8. Being respected by others. Wang Angsun, a health expert, spoke about the ancients who practiced guidance and abstinence from grains and lived a long life, which is only one in a hundred, but those who are spiritually complete and physically healthy, and have been blessed by nature, must first have a way to cure diseases, be good at the art of nourishing the body, think less to nourish the heart, reduce sexual desire to nourish the kidneys, avoid anger to nourish the liver, eat lightly to nourish the body, save words to nourish the spirit, read more to nourish the courage, and follow the seasons to nourish the vitality. The human body occasionally suffers from the erosion of wind, cold, heat, and humidity, but it only needs sufficient energy and a complete spirit. If one can live a life without worries, then the spirit will be free from stagnation, and the body will naturally be healthy. Therefore, not worrying is the secret to curing diseases and prolonging life. Next, Sun Xiangzhong, an educator, spoke about today being the Mid-Autumn Festival, "The moon is exceptionally bright on Mid-Autumn Festival," which symbolizes our elders being clear, bright, and noble, just like the bright moon on Mid-Autumn Festival. Today, young and old gather together, which can be said to be three generations in the same party. Relying on raising children to prevent old age is unreliable. Filial piety is certainly necessary, and parental love is also natural. If children are unfilial, everyone will criticize them. If parents are not compassionate, many people will ignore it. This is not very appropriate with Confucius [unclear character]. Therefore, the elderly should advocate morality and culture for society and lead the group to peace and prosperity. Next, Zhao Ximing, Chen Chunhua, Shen Simin, and others all advocated rectifying the three cardinal guides, clarifying the five human relations, and practicing the eight virtues. They also visited Fang Wen, who wielded his pen to greet guests, and sighed at his talent. After tea and photography, they adjourned and went to the park to enjoy the moon.

### Hospitals Offer Assistance to Patients

Youzhu Hospital claims: At present, everything is extremely expensive, and the salaried class is the most miserable, especially the education sector. From now on, if friends in the cultural field are ill and wish to come here for treatment, please have your company sign a certificate. During the prescribed hours, 10-12am and 4-6pm, all will be examined.

The Foguang Rest Home at 123 Mas Road has specially invited lung disease expert Dr. Ma Wenwo to provide free diagnosis and treatment from 11am to 3pm every day and issue examination reports. The number of patients is limited to ten per day, and registration is required every other day.

The Shanghai Anti-Tuberculosis Association has written to say: The general medicines in the letter of September 8 will be supplied by the hospital, and the cost of the medicines will be paid from donations. If the funds are insufficient, donations will be continued. The patient referral form should be signed by you and stamped with the round seal of the Social Service Department, etc. Our association will act accordingly and has notified Director Ouyang Zhong and Deputy Director and Medical Director Zhang Chenmei to take note and handle it. The hospital's clinic hours are from 9am to 12pm, and it is closed on Sundays.

### Pudong Fellow Association Provides Diagnosis and Medicine

The Pudong Fellow Association's Traditional Chinese Medicine Clinic will be further improved from this month: House calls are free of charge (registration fee is also waived). Each person will be issued a medicine voucher worth five yuan. Prescriptions from designated pharmacies will not only enjoy special discounts, but the medicine vouchers will also be fully accepted. The medicines are all packaged in bulk, which is exactly the same as those sold in stores. All poor and sick people, regardless of their origin, can go for diagnosis. The clinic is located in the Traditional Chinese Medicine Sanatorium at 78 Luzon Road.

### Sino-French Vocational School Enrollment

The Sino-French Advanced Industrial Vocational School (the old site of the Sino-French Institute of Technology at the intersection of Route Lafayette and Route Albert), is jointly run by the Sino-French authorities based on foreign exchange documents. It is divided into three departments: Mechanical Engineering, Electrical Engineering, and Civil Engineering. It utilizes the original equipment of the Sino-French Institute of Technology and focuses on practical training. It has now been approved by the Ministry of Education to start enrollment. The tuition and miscellaneous fees are only 200 yuan. Apply quickly.
