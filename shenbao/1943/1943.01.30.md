### Call for Medical Assistance Funds for Elementary School Teachers

The great contributions of elementary school teachers to the nation and society are universally acknowledged. Therefore, in Japan and Germany, the respect and courtesy shown to elementary school teachers far exceed that given to other sectors. In any situation, there are special privileges to respect and treat elementary school teachers preferentially. Since ancient times, our country has respected Confucianism and revered teachers. This tradition remains strong. However, when we examine the actual situation, we cannot help but feel a sense of regret. In society today, especially in Shanghai, on the one hand, a small number of people are happily celebrating the good fortune brought to them by the extraordinary times of the past few years. With rising prices and the success of all kinds of speculation, they are leading lives of extravagant spending. On the other hand, there is a large group of people who are silently working. They do not speculate, nor are they good at "dancing with long sleeves." Although some praise them as "pure and admirable" and as "models for all ages," others see them as "ninth-rate Confucians and tenth-rate beggars," typical impoverished "schoolteachers." Most of them "content with poverty and delight in their work," holding the ambition that "wealth and honor acquired through unrighteousness are like floating clouds to me." They only know to bury themselves in hard work, cultivating talents for the nation and the people. To be honest, the bright future of China and the peaceful happiness of society depend not on others, but on the teachers of this eraâ€”from elementary and middle school teachers to university and college professors. They are pioneers who clear the way through adversity, sages and heroes who continue what is discontinued and preserve what is dying.

However, these pioneers and heroes who are "models for the people," while they deserve the glorious titles bestowed upon them by society and the nation, what kind of lives do they actually lead? We see university professors of integrity and honesty forced to sell their beloved collections of books to make a living. We see some university professors and middle school teachers, in order to supplement their income, not only selling their clothes but also squeezing into the ranks of street vendors, engaging in businesses that are seen as lowly and subject to whipping and scolding. As for the miserable lives of elementary school teachers, it is even more imaginable. For the teachers themselves, perhaps they see such miserable lives as a refinement of the times, perhaps they can calmly accept it and be content with poverty. However, from the standpoint of the nation and society, it is a great loss to have such admirable and respectable pioneers sacrifice a lot of time running around for food and clothing, unable to devote enough time to self-cultivation and contribute to the nation. Especially in such miserable lives, which teacher is made of iron? We see most teachers looking pale and undernourished. Any person with a conscience, deducing the future of Chinese culture and education from this phenomenon, cannot help but feel chilled to the bone?

This newspaper is launching a medical assistance fund campaign for elementary school teachers, precisely in view of the above chilling phenomenon, and seeking to fulfill a bit of our responsibility as the media in this difficult era. We know very well that this phenomenon is prevalent in the entire education sector of the country, not limited to elementary school teachers but extending to middle schools and universities. Eliminating this chilling phenomenon cannot be achieved by medical assistance funds alone, but must depend on the overall national plan. However, we do not want to say more ineffective empty words, because we in the media not only want to call for action but also want to practice what we preach. We assess our own abilities and start with what we can do effectively. The first step is to start with medical assistance funds for elementary schools, hoping to further arouse the attention and cooperation of society and the authorities, and promote the movement to improve the lives of teachers and professors at all levels in middle schools and universities. We do not want this matter to be handled only by this newspaper. We sincerely hope that everyone from the government down to the people can focus on the long-term future of the nation and the people and pay attention to improving the lives of teachers.

The medical assistance fund for elementary school teachers launched by this newspaper has received enthusiastic support from public-spirited hospitals and leaders from all walks of life. The Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund Committee has been established a few days ago, and Mr. Zhang Yipeng, Mr. Ding Fubao, and Mr. Wang Yijing have been elected to preside over it. Please ask Mr. Zhang Yipeng to oversee the entire endeavor. Initially, the financial target is 200,000 national currency, and the trial period is six months. If it is successful, it will be promoted further. Now, while conducting fundraising, we will first specially contract five public hospitals, divided into five districts: East, South, West, North, and Central, to first provide outpatient services and treatment for the most urgent symptoms. Now what we want to appeal to all sectors of society is: first, we hope that leaders from all sectors of society will recognize the great significance of medical assistance funds for elementary school teachers and come forward to support it purely in the spirit of sympathy and mutual assistance. We hope that the wealthy from all walks of life will not hesitate to spend a lot of money and specifically contribute to the medical expenses of teachers. We hope that advanced gentlemen in the Chinese and Western medicine fields will automatically open "Teacher Appreciation Specials" that are specifically for teachers, and give teachers special preferential treatment in medical fees.

Second, what we want to point out to all sectors of society in particular is that medical assistance funds are an expression of social respect for teachers, which is definitely different from the meaning of ordinary charitable relief. When we generously donate to this movement, or work hard for this movement, or offer free medical consultations for this movement, preferential treatment and drug donations, all of this is different from ordinary charitable donations and only has negative significance. On the one hand, this can show one's own virtue of respecting teachers, and does not allow one to be conceited about relief. On the other hand, this is precisely assisting the great cause of the nation and the people. We can get unparalleled comfort in spirit, and do not need to ask for any thanks from the beneficiaries. You should know that the main recipients of this assistance are not the teachers, but our thousands of children, but the national welfare of us in ten or one hundred years.

Third, what we want to say to the teachers is that the reason why we launched the medical assistance fund is the same as the scholarship fund, which has a positive meaning and is entirely out of respect and sympathy for the teachers. We understand very well that in the current difficult times, teachers who are working silently all have the great aspiration, determination, and perseverance to grit their teeth and endure the pain and concentrate on cultivating talents for the nation and the people. Since you regard wealth and honor acquired through unrighteousness as floating clouds, you will definitely not disdain any pity and assistance from people in society. However, we absolutely have no need to refuse medical assistance funds from our compatriots out of respect and sympathy for teachers. On the contrary, only by gladly accepting the sympathy and assistance of people in society can we fully express that the dignity of teachers has won the support of all sectors, and can we fully promote this traditional virtue of China.

Finally, we more ardently hope that the government and social leaders will have a comprehensive method for the difficulties of teachers' lives. We need to know that if all those who are truly working for the country are exhausted and living in precariousness, while those who seek private interests or even harm the country are spending money like water; if society rewards seeking private interests but does not reward faithful service, then how much edifying effect will all the preaching-style lessons have on young people? This is really a serious educational problem that must be resolved quickly and properly, and the social aspect should start with what it can do. We will regard whether the medical assistance fund movement for elementary school teachers receives enthusiastic support as a measure of the people's hearts in our country.

The government's current tax increase still leaves some leeway. I am confident that even if the government does not increase direct taxes, it will not hinder the execution of the war in the slightest.

### Administrative Heads of Burma and the Philippines Issued Statements Yesterday; Responding to Prime Minister Tojo's Speech in the Diet; Deeply Inspired by the Promise of Glorious Independence

Burma

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - Dr. Ba Maw, the administrative head of Burma, issued a historic statement this afternoon, responding to Prime Minister Tojo's speech in the Diet and expressing deep gratitude on behalf of the Burmese people to Japan for cooperating with Burma's long-desired independence. The main points of the statement are as follows: We are deeply grateful to Prime Minister Tojo for declaring on behalf of the Japanese government that Japan will recognize the current Burmese government and build an independent Burmese state in its jurisdiction at the latest within this year. For a hundred years, British imperialism has not only destroyed Burmese history, life, thought, and tradition, but also deprived the Burmese people of all their rights. The unarmed Burmese people have used all means to resist British armed oppression under British oppression. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, we firmly believed that we would achieve independence and recognized Japan as our liberator. We then began to take action and cooperate with Japan to drive the British army out of Burma. At present, we have obtained Japan's assistance and will achieve independence. This relationship between Japan and Burma and Japan's righteous act of liberating us will be recorded forever in Burmese history. Today, the Burmese people are beginning to feel the joy of being liberated. Burma for the Burmese is by no means empty talk. From now on, we will further cooperate with Japan to jointly complete this war. History will prove the extent of the efforts of the Burmese people seeking liberation. Having received this grace, we should fight with firm confidence for the construction of the whole of Asia and its destiny. The Burmese people are not an ungrateful nation in terms of habit or religion. We vow to repay Japan for its kindness with all concrete facts for fighting to complete the Greater East Asia War, and cooperate to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Rangoon, 29th (Central News Agency) - President Bai of the Burmese Overseas Chinese Federation expressed his feelings about Prime Minister Tojo's speech on Burmese state building as follows: The Burmese people are deeply grateful for Prime Minister Tojo's declaration on Burmese state building, which is the only way to realize the ideal of "Burmese people building Burma." We are increasingly clear about Japan's war for the liberation of Asia. We must support Chairman Zhu to the end. The joy of the Burmese people this time is also the joy of us Asians. Therefore, we cannot express our heartfelt gratitude for Japan's kindness.

Rangoon, 28th (Domei News Agency) - President Lai Shate of the Burmese Indian Independence League told the press today that Prime Minister Tojo's speech at the 81st session of the Diet today not only gave direct encouragement to Indians engaged in independence work abroad, but also had a significant spiritual impact on patriots in India. The Prime Minister's speech will undoubtedly strengthen the anti-British movement in India. The Prime Minister's promise that Japan will recognize Burma's independence within the year will surely be fulfilled. This is completely different from Britain's disrespect for its promises. Although Burma's territory is smaller than India, Burma has abundant natural resources and will surely become a strong and independent country in the short term. This year is not only an important period for building the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but also the year of Burma's revival and the year of India's salvation.

Philippines

Manila, 29th (Domei News Agency) - Chairman Vargas of the Philippine Administrative Commission issued a statement to the press at Malacanang this afternoon, and also broadcast it on the radio, expressing heartfelt gratitude for Prime Minister Tojo's speech in the Diet yesterday and the promise made last year to grant the Philippines glorious independence. The statement stated: Prime Minister Tojo reiterated in his speech to the Diet on January 28 that the solemn declaration to grant the Philippines independence in the shortest possible period is an unchanging policy of the Japanese Empire. The Philippine people are deeply grateful for this and will always remember it with gratitude. This is another concrete example of Japan's noble and sincere purpose towards the Philippines. If the Filipinos actively cooperate in building a new Philippines as a member of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, then Japan will fulfill its promise of independence. The Filipinos should all be deeply convinced of this.

Thailand

Bangkok, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Thai government and people have expressed extreme welcome for Prime Minister Tojo's speech in the Diet revealing Japan's determination to complete the war and its confidence. In particular, Prime Minister Tojo's statement that "Thailand is an allied country, and I would like to express my respect to the Thai people who are moving towards the common goal of building Greater East Asia" has made the Thai people feel happy and admire him deeply.

Shonan

Shonan, 29th (Domei News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo's promise to recognize Burma's independence by the end of this year has been welcomed by the natives of Malaya, Sumatra, Java, and Borneo, who believe that this shows that the Japanese government holds a fair and benevolent policy towards the peoples of East Asia in the southern regions. Officials and people in Shonan have expressed their deep gratitude for the Prime Minister's speech, saying that the Prime Minister's words have clarified Japan's policy towards the people in the southern regions.

German and Australian Official Circles Attach Great Importance

Berlin, 29th (Domei News Agency) - Officials here have expressed extreme welcome for the speeches made by Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Tani Masayuki in the Diet yesterday, considering them a new clear proof of the will of the Three-Power Alliance and the East Asian peoples to win. The Japanese people and army will surely be able to win, which can be seen from this. The officials here attach particular importance to Prime Minister Tojo's reiteration of his promise, stating that Japan intends to restore the independence of the countries within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Japan's repeated demonstration of its sincerity has also been praised here. In addition, the unity of the Three-Power Alliance and the divisions shown by the Allied camp in Casablanca are therefore more obvious.

Argentina Capital City, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Australian government attaches great importance to the Diet speeches of Japanese Prime Minister Tojo and Foreign Minister Tani. According to a broadcast by Australian Radio on the 28th, (1) The British government also attaches great importance to Prime Minister Tojo's confident tone and the recognition of Burma's independence. (2) The anti-Axis forces' current difficulties in the Pacific Ocean were not pointed out by Prime Minister, which we are well aware of. The Australian Prime Minister has repeatedly mentioned it in his speeches.

### Close-Range Artillery Battles Unfold in Stalingrad; Battlefield Enshrouded in Smoke, Shells Raining Down; German Troops Tenaciously Defending Original Positions

German Supreme Headquarters, 29th (Havas) - Today's German military report stated that German and allied forces bravely fought on all fronts in Eastern Europe yesterday, repelling invading large-scale Soviet forces. All actions are being implemented according to plan. The isolated forces in the city of Stalingrad continue to resist despite the large number of enemy troops. Soviet attacks on the southern section of the defense line were fierce. Large-scale Soviet forces attempting to break through western Caucasus were defeated by German-Romanian allied forces yesterday. Soviet forces in the Kupen area and the mountainous area of the Manych area were blocked and made no progress. German armored vehicles counterattacked, defeating Soviet cavalry and infantry. German reinforcements arriving in the middle of the Don River basin forced the Soviet forces to retreat east. In the Voronezh area, elite Soviet troops launched a surprise attack on our army's western flank yesterday, but were repelled and suffered heavy losses. A major battle northwest of Voronezh is in progress. Soviet troops south of Lake Ladoga suffered heavy losses and achieved nothing.

Stockholm, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to front-line news from the German side received here, German troops in the Stalingrad area are still tenaciously defending their positions and have completely stopped the offensive of a large number of Soviet troops. To date, the German positions remain as stable as ever. The Soviet army has been reinforcing with newly formed units for days and urgently mobilizing artillery units to engage in close-range artillery battles with German troops holding positions in the city. The battlefield is shrouded in smoke, artillery fire fills the sky, and the battle situation is quite fierce.

Berlin, 29th (Havas) - German forces previously fighting west of Voronezh have completely withdrawn from there in accordance with the "elastic defense" plan, without being surrounded or broken through by Soviet forces. This front has now become a new center of major battles, so the Soviet army will not reduce its pressure in order to advance towards Kursk in the northwest and the Donets Basin and Rostov in the south. The movement of enemy troops in the lower reaches of the Don River and from the Don River to the Mecheka area is extremely slow. However, the Soviet army is intensifying its pressure in the plain area south of the Mecheka in an attempt to reach the main railway between Kupensk and Rostov, but it is still being blocked by German counterattacks. The German forces in the Caucasus are avoiding contact with enemy forces, and the action is currently proceeding according to plan. The German rearguard is effectively providing strong resistance to the enemy. The Soviet army on the Stalingrad front is still devoting all its efforts to breaking through the resistance of the German Sixth Army. The Soviet army has received a large number of infantry reinforcements and a large number of heavy artillery, so shells are raining down on the German-occupied area of the city, but the German army is still tenaciously resisting. Since the end of November, the Soviet offensive southeast of Lake Ilmen has completely failed. The enemy army suffered heavy casualties, and 515 of its 700 tanks were destroyed. Despite such sacrifices, the enemy army still gained nothing.

Berlin, 29th (Havas) - Military figures here stated that the British propaganda regarding the Battle of Stalingrad as the largest encirclement battle in history has clearly forgotten the great victories of the German army on the Eastern Front in 1941 and 1942. In September 1941, the German army annihilated five Soviet armies in the area of Tenip and Tasna, capturing 665,000 people. In the Battle of Kursk in May 1942, three Soviet armies were annihilated, and 169,198 people were captured.

Helsinki, 28th (Havas) - The General Staff announced today that infantry was extremely active on the East Karelia front yesterday. A unit of another Red Army crossed the frozen lake in an attempt to sneak into the Finnish line, but was annihilated. There was not much activity on the northern front. The air force was also inactive due to bad weather.

Paris, 29th (Havas) - Another batch of French volunteers left for the Eastern Front to fight. German and French officials went to see them off when they departed from Marseille.

### Major Battle Brewing in Southern Tunisia; American Troops Moving Towards the Gulf of Gabes; Fighting on the Coast of Tripoli

Berlin, 29th (Havas) - An Italian army outpost clashed with an American army reconnaissance team near the southwestern Tunisian-Algerian border. This American army belongs to the American Fifth Army and is responsible for the fighting on the right flank of the British First Army. Initially, the British and American armies advanced northeast at the same time. However, in the last few days, the American Fifth Army separated from the main army and changed its course to advance towards the Gulf of Gabes in the southeast. However, its movement has not yet been completed. Its purpose seems to be to meet up with the British Eighth Army of Montgomery. However, the terrain there is dangerous and there are no modern transportation facilities, so this attempt is difficult to realize. Reconnaissance activities on the northern and central routes of the Tunisian front are very tense. The enemy has concentrated artillery in Mejez el Bab and El Aroussa, so the British First Army may launch an offensive. Although the German army achieved great success on the central Tunisian front last week, its only purpose was to reconnoiter enemy intelligence and clear occupied territory, so it cannot be called a "German offensive."

Stockholm, 28th (Havas) - According to news from both Axis and British-American sides, reconnaissance units were very active in North Africa yesterday. Encounters occurred between the two sides on the coast of Tripolitania. The Allied Forces Command clearly wants to redeploy in southern Tunisia, with Gafsa as the concentration point. A major battle may occur in the area of Marelth, but fierce fighting has also occurred near Bou Arada and the Medjez el Bab district. Axis air force attacked the port of Algiers. Several ships were hit. The Allied transportation line was also bombed. Many trucks were destroyed.

Stockholm, 28th (Havas) - Cairo officials issued a communique today stating that General Rommel's troops are still on the coast of Tripoli in Libya, blocking General Montgomery's British troops. British reconnaissance teams contacted enemy troops in the Sabratha area. British aircraft bombed railway traffic in southern Italy last night.

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Washington, U.S. Secretary of War Stimson met with a group of reporters on the 28th and released statistics on U.S. military casualties on the Tunisian front, including 211 killed in action, 533 wounded, and 515 missing, totaling 1,259.

The Formation of Japanese Naval Aircraft

### Japanese Aircraft Attack American Ships in the Western Aleutian Islands; Port Moresby Airport Heavily Damaged

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) - According to dispatches from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis forces command stated on the 28th that when the Japanese air force attacked Port Moresby on the 27th, the airport there was heavily damaged.

Lisbon, 28th (Domei News Agency) - The U.S. Navy Department disclosed in a communique this morning that Japanese aircraft attacked American ships west of the American military positions in the Aleutian Islands. Details of the attack have not been announced.

### Ten Years of National Socialist Party Rule in Germany: Hitler to Deliver Declaration

Berlin, 29th (DNB) â€“ To celebrate the tenth anniversary of the National Socialist Party's rule in Germany, the Greater German Radio Station here will broadcast the following program tomorrow: at 10:00 AM, the leader of the German Youth, Axmann, will address the German youth; at 11:00 AM, General GÃ¶ring will address the German defense forces; and at 4:00 PM, during a mass rally, Propaganda Minister Goebbels will deliver a speech, after which the declaration of the German leader, Hitler, will be read.

Nanjing, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ Today (30th) is the tenth anniversary of German leader Hitler's rule. Foreign Minister Chu of the National Government sent a telegram of congratulations.

### Six Australian Parliamentarians to Visit London

Saigon, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“ According to a Melbourne dispatch yesterday, six members of the Australian Parliament will visit London in the near future as members of the Empire Parliamentary Association. This move is likely to delay Australia's general election this year until after August, as these individuals will not be able to return to Australia until August. Leaders of all Australian parties have guaranteed that elections will be held only after their return. It is noted that London had invited Australian parliamentarians to visit as early as the end of 1941, but the outbreak of the Pacific War postponed the visit until now.

Lisbon, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ According to a Canberra dispatch, the leader of the Australian United Party, Mr. Banda, recently returned from a trip to Britain and the United States. On the 28th, he delivered a speech in the Lower House, stating that British and American intellectuals have no understanding of Australia's current crisis and the importance of Australia's strategic position. Therefore, the Australian Prime Minister and cabinet members should visit Britain and the United States at least once every three months to meet with key figures and maintain personal contact. It is crucial to provide detailed explanations during these meetings to dispel their misconceptions.

### Germany Issues Order to Implement Forced Labor

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“ The German Director-General of Manpower, Sauckel, issued a decree yesterday stating that all men between the ages of 16 and 65 must perform forced labor, and all women between the ages of 17 and 45 must perform defense-related work. This measure has now been instructed to be implemented by the German Labor Bureau, ordering it to investigate which defense jobs urgently require manpower and to supplement them accordingly. Exemptions from service include those who already work more than 48 hours a week, agricultural and industrial workers, civil servants, those responsible for supporting families of six, students in state-run schools (male and female), foreigners, mothers with one school-age child or two children under the age of fourteen, and pregnant women. The purpose of this measure is to concentrate national manpower in order to achieve final victory as soon as possible.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“ The German public is not surprised by the implementation of the forced labor system, as Propaganda Minister Dr. Goebbels and Economic Minister Dr. Funk have both strongly emphasized the need to intensify defense work. With fierce fighting on the Eastern Front, Germany is determined to strive for final victory, with women replacing enlisted men. Family life will not be destroyed by women's forced labor. The new decree does not restrict private life. The public should understand that the survival of the nation is above all else; victory can bring everything, and defeat will lose everything. Increased labor can also increase warfare.

### South African Prime Minister's Speech Opposed in Parliament

Lisbon, 28th (Havas News Agency) â€“ According to a dispatch from Cape Town, South African Prime Minister General Smuts delivered a speech in Parliament today, stating that the past three years have been a difficult struggle, with sacrifices unprecedented in scale. He also requested that South African troops be sent overseas to fight. Opposition leader Dr. Malan opposed this, demanding that South African troops immediately cease participation in the war and return home. Parliament has decided to postpone discussion.

### British Prime Minister to Report on Casablanca Conference; German Political Circles Show No Interest; All Sectors in Turkey Are Exceptionally Tense

Stockholm, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“

British Foreign Secretary Eden announced last night that Prime Minister Churchill will report to the House of Commons on the proceedings of the Casablanca Conference. Several members of Parliament had requested an early debate on the submarine threat, but Eden refused.

Stockholm, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“ According to a London dispatch, the British public is not interested in the Casablanca Conference. British newspapers are no longer writing articles discussing it. The general tone of the press is that the attempt to unite all political parties in North Africa has failed.

Berlin, 29th (Haitong News Agency) â€“ German political circles have lost interest in the Casablanca Conference. A spokesman for the German Foreign Ministry stated that there is no need to speculate about the Allied offensive plans for this year, as such promises have been seen many times before. The Axis powers must only prepare everything to cope with any eventuality. When asked whether the Soviet government had issued an official statement on the Casablanca Conference, he replied that he currently had no knowledge. The new promises made by Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union must be viewed in light of future developments. However, the British newspapers do not show excitement about the results of the Casablanca Conference.

Istanbul, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ Turkish political circles feel extremely uneasy about the results of the Casablanca talks, fearing that British and American pressure on Turkey will become more severe as a result, or that some form of coercion will be used to force Turkey to abandon its neutrality. Recently, British, American, and Soviet diplomats stationed in Turkey have become active, using the situations in North Africa and the Eastern Front to incite the Turkish government, seeking to have Turkey declare war on the Axis powers after Iraq. Therefore, it can be seen that the British and American attempts are about to enter the final stage. All sectors in Turkey are therefore exceptionally tense.

British and American Political Circles Express Dissatisfaction

Bern, 28th (Havas News Agency) â€“ According to news from Washington and London, British and American political figures have expressed dissatisfaction with the results of the Casablanca Conference. Roosevelt and Churchill will deliver speeches to their respective parliaments to address external criticisms. The reason is that people in London and Washington are questioning why only British and American representatives participated in the meeting of Allied leaders. Moreover, the personal meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill was not necessary to discuss purely military issues. However, the official communique stated that both sides only considered various military strategies, which is difficult to believe. The Labour Party's newspaper, the Daily Herald, also stated, "The current war has lasted three and a half years, but after this Casablanca Conference, we are still in the dark about the Allied war aims." In short, the declaration issued after the meeting of the two can be regarded as another Atlantic Charter, only stating principles and rarely producing practical results. Some members of the US Senate and House of Representatives criticized President Roosevelt for convening a meeting of Allied leaders in Washington, D.C., instead of personally going to French North Africa. As for the results of this conference in unifying the divided factions in France, observers are not entirely satisfied. Judging from the fact that the two chose the port of Casablanca as the meeting place, it can be seen that the situation in North Africa is a very important issue in the negotiations of the Allied leaders. However, General Giraud and General de Gaulle did not reach concrete results after their meeting. Other British newspapers reported that the entire war situation is currently shrouded in submarine warfare. What new measures will the Allies take to ensure that Britain is out of danger? It is hoped that public opinion will be informed to appease the public.

US Congress Unwilling to Grant Authorization

Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) â€“ According to a Washington broadcast, the dramatic meeting between US President Roosevelt and British Prime Minister Churchill in Casablanca seems to be reversing Roosevelt's domestic decline. According to a report by a Politico correspondent, President Roosevelt, due to this historic meeting, will celebrate his 61st birthday this Saturday with a consolidation of his position unseen in ten years. Looking ahead to the 1944 election year, Republican members of the House and Senate already deeply recognize the strength of his forces. In the coming weeks, Democratic members will certainly vigorously promote the unity achieved in Casablanca. This kind of support is essential for President Roosevelt to pass military budget and increased war powers requests through Congress, because Congress, even if it has not made any criticism of the government's more important diplomatic and internal affairs, will never

### Japanese Naval AttachÃ©s in Europe Hold Meeting in Rome Yesterday Morning to Discuss the Development of the War in Europe and the Far East

Rome, 28th (Allied News Agency) â€“ Japanese military and naval attachÃ©s stationed in various European countries met here this morning to discuss the development of the war in Europe and the Far East. Attendees included the military attachÃ©s stationed in Germany, Spain, Romania, Portugal, Hungary, Finland, France, Sweden, and Turkey, including three generals. The Japanese Embassy in Rome is scheduled to host a banquet for these military attachÃ©s tomorrow. Easily grant the president supreme power over military expenditures and military affairs. In this way, President Roosevelt has skillfully demonstrated his ability to deal with current and future problems.

Madrid, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ Since the news of the Casablanca Conference was transmitted, the impressions of all sectors in Spain seem to be quite profound. Spanish political circles stated their views on the 28th, believing that Spain's neutrality will face a major threat depending on how the future spring war situation unfolds. They also believe that the British and American decision to hold a meeting near Spanish Morocco is a provocative action containing a threat to Spain. Therefore, all parties have expressed dissatisfaction with the irregular actions of Britain and the United States. Furthermore, Spanish newspapers only published the content of the British and American statements about the meeting in secondary positions and did not write articles to comment on it.

### Roosevelt Meets Brazilian President En Route to United States

Lisbon, 29th (Allied News Agency) â€“ According to a Washington dispatch, President Roosevelt made a brief stop in the American-controlled Liberian republic en route from North Africa to the United States.

Buenos Aires, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ According to reports, US President Roosevelt and his entourage, after the Casablanca talks, took two four-engine military transport planes and flew across the Atlantic to Brazil. However, the flight schedule and arrival time in the Brazilian capital are unknown. According to a dispatch from the Brazilian capital, Roosevelt has arrived here en route to his home country and is reportedly holding talks with Brazilian President Vargas.

### Guangdong People's Demonstration Rally Supporting War; Commissioner Chen Bijun's Admonition

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ Commissioner Chen Bijun's original admonition in the Guangzhou people's demonstration rally supporting the war and destroying Britain and the United States is as follows: What I want to say to everyone now is what the people in various places feel about participating in the war, and what we should do after participating in the war. Regarding the people's sentiments in various places about participating in the war, it can be divided into four types: The first type of people truly understand the general trend of the world and are working hard to place the country where justice lies; the second type of people are indifferent. They feel that our people's livelihood is currently declining, and we are heavily constrained. The so-called participation in the war is nothing more than a nation uniting hundreds of millions of Asians to fight together before they can survive in this era. The second type of people are indifferent, so they do not believe in anything. At the same time, they do not understand the true intentions of friendly nations, nor do they know the strength of their own country. Participating in the war is just being a cheerleader for friendly nations, and it is a cheerleader that is irrelevant to their own well-being. It is like a battle on the stage, just for the audience to smile, with no meaning. They do not believe in anything and are indifferent to everything. They do not know that our participation in the war requires all people, regardless of age or wisdom, whether in or out of office, from all walks of life, to be prepared to mobilize at any time. After participating in the war, everything in the country and the people's lives will change. Impoverished people, because the country needs their labor more, and needs them to increase the production of the earth, their lives will definitely be better than they are now. The third type of people are even more ridiculous, thinking that our participation in the war was initiated by friendly nations. Hasn't the Greater East Asia War been independently supported by friendly Japan until now? Isn't the glorious victory continuing? Is it necessary to say that friendly nations need our manpower assistance? We must know that even if we are now training soldiers, can the quality of the soldiers be compared with others? Moreover, the help of an unwilling person is a burden. From the perspective of friendly nations, they can ask, why do we need such a burden? However, we must know that if we work hard, we are also a good helper. We have resources and military supplies, such as iron, coal, salt, aluminum, tungsten, cotton, lead, etc., all of which have the largest reserves. As long as we have the determination to coexist and prosper with friendly nations, friendly nations will definitely help us develop them. Friendly nations have good intentions towards us, such as abolishing unequal treaties, etc. Although there are still many things that have not been done, I firmly believe that as long as we work hard, we will definitely be able to do them in the near future. We should not ask how friendly nations treat us. We must first ask ourselves whether we have done our best. The fourth type of people say that we are participating for the sake of peace because we do not approve of war, and now we are throwing ourselves into the whirlpool of war. Isn't this a contradiction? I feel very heartbroken when I hear this kind of talk. Our peace is just a distinction between believing in Japan and resisting Japan, not closing the door. Now the whole world, the whole of East Asia, and the whole of China are in chaos, but individuals can live and work in peace. Is there any reason for this? We must know that what follows peace is anti-communism and nation-building, not just surviving. Today we are participating in the war to ensure our position in East Asia and to ensure the independent survival of China. They are related and not opposed.

Japanese Submarine Majestically Capable of Destroying Enemy Ships Instantly

### The Significance of Total War Participation; Minister Lin Xuan's Speech at the Guangdong People's Congress

Guangzhou, 28th (Central News Agency) â€“ At 2:00 PM on the 27th, Minister of Propaganda Lin delivered a speech entitled "The Significance of Total War Participation" at the Guangdong people's demonstration rally supporting the war and destroying Britain and the United States. The key points are excerpted below: (1) On the 9th of this month, the National Government issued a declaration of war, and the people of Guangdong held a congress on the same day, supporting it passionately. On the 21st, another demonstration was held, and this is the third time. (2) Since Chiang Kai-shek shared power with the Communist Party and lost Guangdong, many compatriots have been displaced. When the National Government was still in one capital, everyone knew that we were still a country and that we still had a leader leading us to do the work of saving China and protecting East Asia. We also got to see the national flag with the blue sky, white sun, and red earth. When the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty was signed and the Three-Power Joint Declaration was issued, everyone was relieved in their anxiety. However, some people still said, "Can the treaty be realized? Can there be further progress?" For example, Article 7, which stipulates the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, was thought to be impossible to achieve. Today, although full peace has not been achieved, this fact has been achieved in practice. The Chinese revolution has been around for decades, with countless sacrifices, and has not been realized. Today, thanks to the leadership of friendly Japan and the succession of friendly Italy, it can be realized. This is another consolation we have received in the midst of difficult struggles. (3) In this world turmoil, two major camps have been formed. One is the line of aggression, and the other is the line of human coexistence. There is absolutely no room for neutrality in between. (4) China's freedom can only be won by the power of the Chinese nation itself. One aspect is the line of Britain and the United States: if Britain and the United States die, China will die first; if Britain and the United States live, China may not live. The other aspect is that if the Axis lives, we live together, and if they die, we die together. Which path should we take? There is no need to hesitate. (5) As for why we are participating in the war when we are already at peace, the purpose of peace is in Sino-Japanese cooperation, in defending East Asia, and in revitalizing China. Only by realizing peace can we participate in the war with all our strength. Peace is a revolutionary action, and peace also requires sacrifice and bloodshed. Sacrificing oneself to save China and protect East Asia is the true meaning of the peace movement. (6) Furthermore, why are we participating in the war at this time? What impact will China's participation in the war have on the war? What power will we use to participate in the war? We must know that this war is a total war and a long-term war. In the early stages of the war, the emphasis was on military struggles. Now it has reached the struggle of total forces. In the struggle of total forces, China's participation in the war is telling our enemies that hundreds of millions of Eastern nations are united, and 450 million Chinese compatriots will live and die with friendly nations. This kind of unity, first of all, increases the spiritual power to win, and secondly, the spiritual power is used to increase the labor power to win and the material power to win. (7) In summary, first, we answer why we want to participate in the war. There is no second way to survive except to participate in the war. Second, we answer why we are participating in the war at this time and what we are using to participate in the war. Today, when we look back on our previous situation, it can be said that we have made progress step by step in the midst of extreme hardship. This progress is not gained in vain. First, it is the leadership of the leader, second, it is the assistance of friendly nations, and third, it is the effort of everyone. Today, we are like crossing a final reef in a rapid current. If we cannot pass this final reef, we will only perish together. If we pass it, it will be the open road to China's revitalization and East Asia's coexistence. At this time, we have no room for hesitation. After the meeting, everyone will hold the flags of China and Japan to demonstrate. Brothers are willing to follow the leadership of the leader with the greatest enthusiasm, work together, push the bamboo raft, rush past this final reef, and complete the great mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia.

Interview with Chinese and Japanese Journalists

Guangzhou, 29th (Central News Agency) â€“ Minister of Propaganda Lin received the Japanese press corps at the Provincial Propaganda Office at 3:00 PM on the 28th, stating the National Government's resolution on Sino-Japanese relations and Sino-Japanese cooperation to complete the war after the Nine-Power Government's participation in the war, and hoping for the cooperation of the Japanese press circles. The meeting lasted about an hour and a half. At 4:00 PM, he received reporters from various newspapers and news agencies in the city, as well as propaganda workers from various counties, and answered the questions raised by each newspaper in detail until 5:30 PM, when the reporters from each newspaper said goodbye and left.

### Maximizing the Supply of Salt, Ceasing Zonal Rationing, Approving Salt Stores' Requests in Full, Restricting Arbitrary Transportation and Strictly Prohibiting Resale

Originally, the supply of salt in the two concessions was intended to prevent the buying and selling of illicit salt. It was planned to adopt a zonal rationing method based on the population within each Lianbao (joint guarantee) area, with each person receiving one jin (approximately 500 grams) per month. For example, if there were 5,000 residents in a Lianbao, the total amount of salt obtained by all wholesale salt stores in that area would not exceed 5,000 jin per month. After this method was revealed, residents misunderstood that a head-counting distribution would be implemented, and the quantity would be greatly restricted, so they rushed to pre-purchase in large quantities, causing an abnormal phenomenon in the salt market. The salt management authorities, clearly aware of this, and also considering that the city's salt reserves were abundant, and new supplies could be continuously transported to Shanghai, cancelled the zonal rationing method and provided salt as much as possible to various wholesale salt stores, sauce and pickle workshops, and restaurants for sale or direct consumption, only examining their application quantities beforehand.

Supplying the Requested Amount in Full

The supply of salt within the two concessions is mainly managed by the Yu Mao Official Salt Firm. All salt stores holding licenses issued by the Songjiang Salt Bureau can apply to the firm monthly for the amount of salt they need. After review, a delivery order will be issued, and the goods can be picked up at the designated location upon presentation of the order. Those without a license issued by the Songjiang Salt Bureau but holding a salt purchase certificate issued by the firm can also enjoy the same rights, but must quickly apply to the Songjiang Salt Bureau for a license to complete the formalities. As for the amount requested, it can be determined based on the monthly sales volume. After review by the Yu Mao Official Salt Firm, it will be supplied in full to maintain market demand. The price is limited to one yuan and three jiao (cents) in Central Reserve Bank notes per market jin (approximately 500 grams), and must not exceed this.

Restricting Transportation and Strictly Prohibiting Resale

When applying for salt at salt stores or sauce and pickle workshops, the freight route slip issued during the previous application must be presented and verified, and the slip must be returned to obtain the route slip for the current application. The so-called route slip specifies the route along which the salt is to be transported from the warehouse to the point of sale. Its purpose is twofold: first, to provide proof of the source of the salt if questioned by police officers during transportation; and second, to prohibit the official salt obtained in this way from being transported to other places for resale and profit. In other words, the supplied salt is only allowed to be transported along the designated route to the salt store's location for sale, and must not be transported beyond the route to other places, nor may it be transported out of the salt store to other places for resale. It can be seen that the salt obtained by the salt store is only for supplying retailers and direct consumers. If there is any transportation to other places, and the anti-smuggling team discovers that the transportation is not following the designated route, the salt will be confiscated.

### Japanese Spokesperson Discusses Britain and the United States, Revoking Extraterritorial Rights

Tong Meng News Agency, Shanghai: Lieutenant Matsuda, the deputy spokesperson of the Japanese Army, stated yesterday while hosting news reporters that the Chongqing government was completely unprepared for the sudden revocation of extraterritorial rights in China by Britain and the United States. They were at a loss and hastily organized and trained officials to cope. The Chongqing side is deeply concerned that the Nanjing government's participation in the war, as well as Japan's abolition of extraterritorial rights in China and the return of concessions, will affect the psychology of the Chinese masses. Therefore, they are avoiding criticizing this issue, but are extensively publicizing the signing of new treaties with Britain and the United States. However, many Americans in various areas of Chongqing do not trust Chongqing and condemn the US government's move to abolish extraterritorial rights in China. Chongqing is making various preparations to cope with the abolition of extraterritorial rights by Britain and the United States, such as establishing a Judicial Officer Training Institute and setting up training classes in various universities to increase judicial personnel.

### 25th Period of Rationed Food, White Rice Two Sheng (Approximately 2 Liters) Sold for Five Yuan, Sales Suspended on February 5th, 6th, and 8th

At that time, the rice store with the registration number marked on the coupon will issue two sheng of white rice per Rice Purchase Certificate coupon, priced at five yuan, and one jin twelve liang (approximately 875 grams) of flour per Flour Certificate coupon, priced at three yuan and eight jiao five fen (cents).

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange to Resume Next Month

The Shanghai Cotton Yarn and Cloth Exchange has been suspended for more than two months since it was banned due to black market activities and strict crackdown by the authorities. According to sources from within the Exchange speaking to reporters, the industry association has obtained approval from the authorities to resume trading on the fifth day of the Lunar New Year, which is February 9th in the Gregorian calendar. However, the industry must comply with price limits and conduct spot transactions, and must not engage in illegal trading. If there are black market transactions, the authorities will still decide to prohibit trading. The industry association convened a board of supervisors meeting on the 27th of last month to decide to notify the industry to comply and maintain business.

### Authorities in the Two Concessions to Take Three Days of Spring Holiday, Police Department to Remain Open as Usual

Also, the French Concession Municipal Council will, as usual, take three days of holiday. However, the police departments of both authorities will remain open as usual and will step up security to prevent petty thieves and treacherous villains from taking the opportunity to be active and to maintain local security.

### Spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy Talks About Japan's New Policy Towards China, Will Uphold the Firm Resolve to Vigorously Implement the New Policy

Tong Meng News Agency, Shanghai: According to the Japanese-language "Continental New Report" published in Shanghai last night, Hirota, the spokesperson of the Japanese Embassy who recently returned to Shanghai from Japan, stated to the press on Thursday that the Japanese government is determined to carry out the Greater East Asia War until final victory. Whether government officials, company employees, or the entire people, all are sacrificing everything for the war. Now that the Nanjing government has joined the war, the Japanese government has changed its policy towards China and has the firm resolve to vigorously implement its new policy.

### Reflections After Reading "The Way to Preserve Wealth"

â€” Zhongqi

Also Recording the Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association

Recently, after reading Mr. Nie Yuntai's "The Way to Preserve Wealth" in this newspaper every morning, I always have indescribable feelings. I feel that this article on the way to preserve wealth is a powerful proof of "Heaven's way rewards the good and punishes the wicked." According to Mr. Yuntai, he is the son of Nie Zhongcheng Zhongfang, (Nie Zhongcheng Public School in Shanghai is a school commemorating Zhongfang) the grandson of Zeng Wenzheng, and his family has been a prominent clan in Xiangzhong for generations, with a reputation for integrity. Mr. Nie has read all books and traveled to various countries in the East and West, so he has an extremely solid foundation in both Chinese studies and science, and can integrate them, making him a great Confucian scholar of modern times. Since childhood, he was taught by his mother, was inherently kind, and did not seek fame and fortune. Although his family was not wealthy, he enjoyed doing good deeds and was tireless throughout his life. It is heard that he is recently ill, but he still writes in bed, raising tens of thousands of yuan in relief funds for various charitable organizations every month to help those in urgent need. It is said that there are still some educational groups in Shanghai that rely on Mr. Nie to make a living. This is sufficient proof that the families who accumulate good deeds mentioned in "The Way to Preserve Wealth" should have more than enough blessings. I think that there is no lack of enthusiastic people in Shanghai who are dedicated to good deeds. After reading this newspaper's "The Way to Preserve Wealth," there must be many who are moved in their hearts and want to create blessings for their children and grandchildren. However, philanthropists who want to generously donate and participate in good deeds may inevitably have the sigh of knocking on the door and not being very relieved. According to my usual observations, there are many charitable groups in Shanghai that meet the conditions, but the "Shanghai Poor and Sick Relief Association" is particularly reliable. This association is organized by celebrities from all walks of life and leaders of various industry associations in Shanghai, and has various specialized committees to be responsible for various supervisory uses, reviewing accounts, and guiding relief and other important work. The members of the association not only fulfill their obligations, but also all fundraising and travel expenses are paid out of their own pockets, without spending a penny from the association. As for the association's internal affairs, it is particularly commendable. For example, in this distribution of winter clothing, although the number is only five or six thousand sets, the distribution investigation is very serious, which can be seen. I saw in the association's declaration and articles of association that it does not directly organize various relief undertakings, and all donations received are used to subsidize various charitable organizations. After detailed investigation and review, the number of necessary relief is determined. Dozens of groups, such as the Buddhist Congee Kitchen, the Fuyou Orphanage, the Christian Nursery Work School, and the Ximen Women and Children's Hospital, have all received subsidies from the association to maintain their operations. It is now heard that the association's donations have been almost completely distributed, and the number of relief homes, shelters, and educational institutions that need subsidies is very large. According to statistics, there are no less than hundreds of thousands of poor, sick, and refugees waiting for relief from various charitable organizations. I deeply hope that charitable men and women from all walks of life will be moved by compassion and actively donate. (Editor's note: The association is indeed serious in its operations. The address is Room 402, Continental Building, Jiujiang Road, telephone number 14884. More than a dozen banks, including Jin Cheng and Continental, have agreed to collect donations on behalf of the association.)

### Overview of the Shanghai Municipal Council's Price Control Office's Work in Enforcing Price Limits, Investigating Shops Over 55,000 Times Throughout the Year, All Fines Fully Allocated to Relief Undertakings

According to information released by the Shanghai Municipal Council's Intelligence Office, the Council previously established an Investigation and Price Control Enforcement Section under the Price Control Office to effectively enforce price limits. Since its establishment, it has made unremitting efforts in investigating shops and enforcing price limits, which has been praised by all walks of life. In the past year, it has investigated shops more than 55,000 times. 8,255 shops have been notified to come to the Council for questioning, of which 2,142 have been found to have violated regulations and have been submitted to the Executive Committee for deliberation and punishment. The Council has decided to allocate all fine income separately and fully allocate it to relief undertakings within the concession.

Divided into Investigation and Enforcement Groups

The above-mentioned Investigation and Price Control Enforcement Section is currently divided into two parts: one is the Investigation Group, which is responsible for investigating and reporting violations; the other is the Price Control Enforcement Group, which reviews all violation cases reported by the Investigation Group and other departments of the Council, and summons violators to the Council for questioning.

Investigation Work Carried Out by Teams

The Investigation Group has a large number of young male and female investigators who are highly educated, many of whom are familiar with commercial knowledge. The work of each investigator is specially trained and directly supervised by Mr. Inagaki Noboru, the director of the Price Control Office. The investigators are further divided into several teams. The task of the first team is to investigate black market transactions and speculative trading. The second team investigates violations of price limits. The third team is responsible for collecting price information for the authorities' reference. The group also conducts special investigations into whether merchants comply with the Council's rice, flour, and other rationing regulations, whether the prescribed inventory is registered in accordance with regulations, and whether food licenses should be issued. Investigators from each team are often transferred from Team A to Team B, so no investigator belongs to a certain team for a long time. In addition to maintaining close cooperation with the Council's Police Department and the French Concession's General Affairs Office, the Investigation Group also contacts the Woolen Fabric Expert Committee and the Cotton Yarn Expert Committee to listen to the committees' opinions on the prices of woolen fabrics and cotton yarn. Citizens who discover violations often report them to the Investigation Group, which dispatches personnel to seriously investigate citizen reports separately. The cooperation of citizens has been of great help to the work of the group. (To be continued)

### Central China and South China to Hold Conference on Exchange of Goods, Starting on February 1st in Shanghai

Since the establishment of the Shanghai-Hong Kong trade agreement, the commerce between Central China and South China has gradually flourished with Hong Kong as an intermediary. It has been learned that the authorities have decided to convene a conference on the exchange of goods between Central China and South China in the short term to stabilize people's livelihood. It is heard that the conference period has been set from February 1st to 3rd, and the venue will be in Shanghai. Relevant authorities from both the Chinese and Japanese sides will attend. It is heard that South China needs goods from Central China, such as peanuts, cotton yarn, and cotton cloth, while the materials needed by Central China are still under consideration and decision.

### Large Batch of Soybeans and Sesame Seeds Have Been Delivered, Oil Mills Undertake to Press

In order to make up for the lack of edible oil in Shanghai, a large batch of soybeans and sesame seeds has been transported from other ports, and 12 oil mills set up by the Central China Oil Industry are manufacturing soybean oil and sesame oil. It is said that once this batch of edible oil is successfully manufactured, the oil shortage in Shanghai is expected to disappear.

### Shanghai Municipal Council Education Director Talks About Policy Guidelines, Plans to Increase Cultural Subjects

Mr. Ueno, the newly appointed Director of Education of the Shanghai Municipal Council, recently talked to a reporter from the "Times" about his policy guidelines, saying that he intends to improve the standards of the various schools for Chinese and foreigners established by the Council. The method of improvement is to include several cultural subjects in the curriculum, so that not only the educational effectiveness of the schools can be improved, but also they can become models for other schools in Shanghai. The so-called cultural subjects include science and literature, which will be taught in a more practical way. The new textbooks for the Council's schools will be printed soon, and efforts will be made to realize the improvement plan. At the same time, contact will be made with Chinese education leaders to promote the implementation of this plan. Mr. Ueno graduated from the Shanghai Tongwen Academy in 1914. It is said that he hopes that Shanghai will eventually become one of the leaders in Eastern education. In 1914, there was only one Japanese school in Shanghai, the Tongwen Academy, but now there are many. Now that he has been appointed as Director of Education, one of his dreams has been realized. In the future, he will do his best to cultivate the education movement and harmonize it with the concept of co-prosperity. As for the students' health problems, it is planned to ask the Municipal Council to launch an athletic meet between the Municipal Council's schools and the Japanese schools in the autumn of each year. This will not only enhance the students' physical fitness, but also give Japanese, Chinese, and foreign students the opportunity to exchange meetings and promote contacts. He also hopes to see the exchange of friendly visits between teachers and students of the Municipal Council's schools and the Japanese schools to enhance feelings and learn from each other. However, there is no use in talking too much about these things. It is better to take responsibility and seek better results.

### During the Police Winter Prevention Period, No Leave is Allowed, Those Who Deliberately Violate the Rules Will Have Their Citizen Certificates Revoked

The General Joint Guarantee of each Baojia (security unit) area in the Public Concession, considering that the current end of the old lunar year is an important period for winter prevention, has issued a notice to its members that no leave or substitutes are allowed. If there is any deliberate violation, the citizen certificate will be revoked. Do not neglect this matter and cause inconvenience.

### The Central Reserve Bank Regulates Finance, Accepts Mortgage Refinancing Business, and the Loan Interest Rate is Lower than General Lending

February 4th of this year is the deadline for various industries and businesses in Shanghai to handle the final accounting. Handling the collection and disbursement of accounts has been quite busy in recent days. Because the demand for funds in the market is very high, the money market has become tight. After the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank assisted in short-term lending among peers, the money market has become slightly looser. However, in order to prevent the circulation of currency, the bank stipulates that the lending period should not exceed three days, and the due date should not be extended. The restrictions are strict, so the number of peers applying for lending to the bank has not reached the ideal level of crowding. However, the general mortgage refinancing business is extremely busy. Banking peers are transferring their clients' collateral to the Central Reserve Bank for financing. It is heard that the average loan interest rate is 1.3% per month, which is much lower than the general lending interest rate of 2.5% per month in the market, so the market is more stable.

### Cotton Control Association Establishes Supervisory Body

In order to increase cotton production and prevent cotton and cotton products from flowing into the inland provinces, the Central China Cotton Control Association has decided to establish several supervisors within the association. Their tasks are as follows: (1) to review the reasons for the poor performance of purchases in various places and study the countermeasures to be taken; (2) to design how cotton transportation can be flexible; (3) to supervise the distribution of cotton that has been purchased (that is, to supervise the quantity distributed to textile factories near the purchase place and the quantity transported to Shanghai); (4) to investigate the quantity of cotton in storage; (5) to strengthen the connection between the purchase organizations in various places and the Control Association.

### Western Union Football Group A League, St. Francis to Play Portuguese Merchants Today

In the Western Union football league, there are four matches today. In the first round of Group A, St. Francis will play the Portuguese Chamber of Commerce at 3:30 pm at Jiaozhou Park. According to the Group A record, the Portuguese merchants have drawn with Lianyi and Donghua one after another, and lost to the navy by only one goal, showing their strength. However, the St. team has suffered at the hands of Donghua, so their points are less than half of the Portuguese merchants. However, the two teams met in the preliminary round of the Scott Cup, and the St. team won 3-1. In the quarter-finals, they eliminated Lianyi, and in the final against Donghua, they were able to defeat Donghua with the help of the weather and retain the Scott Cup championship. Their luck is extremely good, so who will win today is unpredictable. The Western Union Association has announced that the second round of Group A tomorrow, the match between Lianyi and the Italian Navy, will be postponed.

### Unprecedented Enthusiasm for Donating to Support Education; Total Reaches 210,000; Young Women's Christian Association (YWCA) Assists in Raising 10,000 Yuan; Success Still Relies on Continued Donations

Fourth Annual Shen Xin Readers' Scholarship: Half a month ago, we appealed to all sectors of society, and we are grateful for the recognition and generous contributions from enthusiastic individuals in all fields. Although the total cost of scholarships has not yet been fully met, the achievement of surpassing previous donation records within this short period, especially as the Lunar New Year approaches, deeply impresses us with the enthusiasm of all sectors in supporting education and encourages the sincerity of our colleagues. Our newspaper has been advocating for underprivileged students for days, partly due to the actual need and partly due to the weight of our responsibilities and the urgency of expectations. We sincerely hope that if any outstanding students are limited by the scholarship funds and cannot obtain assistance, our colleagues would feel deeply guilty and restless. All of these sentiments are always appreciated by readers from all walks of life. Now that the collected funds have exceeded 200,000 yuan, we are confident that completing this task requires the continued donations from all sectors of society.

YWCA Raises 10,000 Yuan for Scholarships

The Scholarship Committee follows strict examination procedures. The selection process has always been overseen by the YWCA, whose service to society is commendable. Yesterday, we received a letter from the YWCA, stating that they have entrusted us with 10,000 yuan from the Gong Mu Jun Scholarship to be transferred to forty students with outstanding academic performance. This not only makes up for part of the scholarship fund deficit but also provides an opportunity for forty more underprivileged students to attend school, for which we are immensely grateful. The original letter states: "Last summer, Mr. Gong Mu Jun and others enthusiastically supported underprivileged students to continue their studies and donated a large sum of money to our association to establish a scholarship for underprivileged students. During the last semester, our association used the funds to assist eighty-seven students in continuing their studies. This term, we have received another 10,000 yuan in scholarship funds from Mr. Gong Mu Jun. However, considering that your newspaper is already organizing the 'Readers' Scholarship' and that the donations received are insufficient for distribution, we believe that both efforts aim to help students, and there is no need to proceed separately and waste energy. Therefore, we are writing to propose that we select forty students with excellent academic performance from the students who are taking the exam for your newspaper, including ten students each from the senior year of elementary school, the third year of junior high school, the third year of senior high school, and the fourth year of university/vocational school (regardless of gender). Our association will be responsible for subsidizing their tuition fees. The examination and all necessary procedures will also be handled by our staff. This is a joint effort to promote the continuation of education for underprivileged students, and we hope you will agree. Sincerely, Shanghai YWCA, January 29th."

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The scholarship funds received yesterday include: 3,000 yuan from all employees of the Da Dong Tobacco Company, 2,500 yuan from Gong Ji, 1,340 yuan from Yi Ji, 1,000 yuan from Tao Tai Bao, 750 yuan from Mr. and Mrs. Wang Chen (New China Company bonus), 500 yuan from Qi Jun, Yong Sheng Xiang colleagues' banquet funds, Ding Wang Shi Xiang Ting, Anna, and Zhuang Yao Sheng, 300 yuan from Tang Mansion (recruited by Li Shou Lu), 200 yuan each from Ye Ying Shen Xiu Bookstore and "A Useless Person," 115 yuan from Tian Hua Fei Yu Bai, 100 yuan each from Ni Zheng Huan, Anonymous, Feng Li Shi, Lin Jing Fan Huai De Tang, Xu Yun Xuan, Xu Yun Fang, Xu Yun E, Cai Ji Nong You, and Su Hong Ze, 60 yuan from Yu De Tai Cao Mi (one lost item), 55 yuan from the Guidance Division of the Telephone Company Service Department, 50 yuan each from Li Shou Lu and Qing Ji Shen Er Peng, 40 yuan from Yu Dan Yun, 32 yuan from Li Wei Shi, 30 yuan each from Ji Ji, Xu Dun Geng, and Tan Yin Zhi, 23 yuan from Chen Ming Chang and Yuan Li (royalties), 20 yuan each from Li Hu, Li Sui Qian, Yu Zhao Bin, Lin Shun Shui Zhang Bing Chen, and Tao Zu Xing, 13 yuan from Han (royalties), 10 yuan each from Wang Jun, Lin Ke Ming, Lin Dai Yan, Liu Ji, Chen Jia Ze, and Yu Xue Ting, 5 yuan from Hu Ruo Liu (royalties), totaling 13,886 yuan in reserve certificates. Adding the previous balance of 200,144 yuan and 0.02 fen, the current balance is 215,130 yuan and 0.02 fen.

University Applicants: Submit Transcripts Quickly

Because the university students applying for Group A scholarships received their school transcripts late, many were unable to submit them along with their application forms. The Scholarship Office is now reviewing the transcripts of all students. We urge all students who have not yet submitted their transcripts to do so as quickly as possible, within three days, for review. All other students, from universities, middle schools, and elementary schools, who have any changes in school or tuition fees should also submit their documents immediately to the office for verification. (Please indicate the group, grade, and registration number in the letter.)

Increased Number of Free Spots Offered by Responding Schools

Yesterday, our newspaper received letters from various schools regarding the donation of free spots: (1) Hu Guang Elementary School stated, "In order to support underprivileged students, our school has free and half-fee spots available. We now have two free spots and six half-fee spots (totaling eight). Please select students from your newspaper to fill them." (2) San Yu Middle and Elementary School stated, "Your organization has been providing scholarships for underprivileged students for many years, and we deeply admire your efforts. However, due to limited funding, many talented students must be left out. To maximize the impact, our school has decided to offer fifteen free spots (three each for grades 1-3 of senior high school and two each for grades 1-3 of junior high school, with full tuition waivers). Please recommend students to us." (3) Ming Ben Elementary School stated, "Your newspaper is dedicated to serving society and is passionate about protecting and assisting out-of-school children. To support your newspaper, our school has added three half-fee spots to each grade." (4) Hong Kou Jing Hua Elementary School stated, "Our school's free spots for this semester are already full, but in order to support the spirit of human mutual assistance and cultivate outstanding citizens of the future, the school board has decided to add fifteen free spots for the fall semester of fifth grade."

Different Paths, Same Goal: Enthusiastic Support for Education

Yesterday, we received donation letters from various sectors of society, showing kindness and generosity. (1) All employees of Da Dong Tobacco Company stated, "We have read in your newspaper that the fourth annual Readers' Scholarship is being held to benefit underprivileged children and alleviate their pain of being out of school. We are deeply moved. Our company employees have donated 3,000 yuan in new currency to do our part." (2) Mr. Zhuang Yao Sheng stated, "In these difficult times of hardship and hunger, it is said that 'compassion is in everyone's heart.' Therefore, I have cut back on the expenses for the New Year's banquet and donating 1,000 yuan to the Chinese Teachers' Association for porridge distribution and 1,000 yuan to your newspaper and the Xin Kai Bao for scholarships, to express my humble concern." (3) "A Useless Person" stated, "I lost the opportunity to study in my youth and am naturally dull. I have been a merchant for thirty years. My mother believes in Buddhism and is kind-hearted, and my family has been deeply influenced. Today, prices are high, and it is difficult to make ends meet. Fortunately, the heavens have shown mercy, and my family of fifteen has been free from illness for a long time. We have not eaten meat for 143 and a half days this year. Despite the lack of nutrition, my mother is healthier than before. In this chaotic world, it is truly a blessing to be able to enjoy family harmony and get through the year. Last night, my mother and I were talking about family matters, and she couldn't bear to have big meat and big fish for the New Year. She approved my request to reduce the cost of the New Year's Eve dinner by 200 yuan and donate it to the scholarship fund. There are many rich people in Shanghai. If they could follow our example and donate a small amount, the total would be considerable, and future social talents would not have the regret of missing out on education." (4) Mr. Yu De Tai stated, "Yesterday, I was passing by the entrance of the Great World and found a dozen handkerchiefs. After waiting for forty minutes, no one came to claim them. So, I sold the handkerchiefs to my colleagues for 30 yuan in reserve certificates. I feel guilty about receiving this money, so I am donating it all to the scholarship fund to benefit those who lost them. In addition, my colleagues and I who bought the handkerchiefs have each added 10 yuan, for a total of 60 yuan. Please accept it."

### Chinese Stocks Soar Before Spring Festival Market Closure

Yesterday's Chinese stock market saw a tumultuous day ahead of the Spring Festival closure, marked by initial gains, followed by a dip, and a subsequent rise.

However, the price later stabilized at 9.12 yuan for an extended period before selling pressure drove it down to 7 yuan, ultimately closing at 7.78 yuan, highlighting the market's uncertainty. Other bond series also declined, with Series A falling from several yuan to 5.89 yuan, Series B to 5.56 yuan, Series D from over 5 yuan to around 3 yuan, and Series E from over 6 yuan to 4.56 yuan, indicating an overall trend of price fluctuations.

Industry insiders believe that the market will continue to tighten in the spring.

### Cigarettes Prices Drop Across the Board

The cigarette market continued its downward trend due to the end of the old lunar year, with both buyers and sellers adopting a wait-and-see attitude. Prices were difficult to raise.

### Two Doggerel Poems

â€” Zhang Yipeng

Since cars are scarce,
I labor on my feet each day.
Saving money,
Is like taking tonic, they say.

I am not a car-owning class. Previously, I relied entirely on trams for transportation. Recently, they have become increasingly crowded, and boarding is difficult. So, I have decided to walk instead. In the past two or three months, I have not only saved on transportation expenses but also improved my health compared to previous years. There is no need to buy winter tonics. It is truly a great fortune in misfortune. Some say that it is difficult to be on time for appointments, but if you budget your time and leave early, what difficulty is there?

On the 31st, I was invited to give a lecture at the Grand Bright Theater. This is an opportunity for fashionable people to show off. But I am old and decrepit. How could I still be a lecturing woman getting off the car? Friendship is hard to refuse, so I had to take the stage with my old face.

### The Division Between Life's Joy and Sorrow

â€” Feng Ligen

I remember reading these words in a book somewhere: "Life is like drinking two cups of wine, one bitter and one sweet, and it is up to you to choose which to drink first. Either sweet first and then bitter, or bitter first and then sweet." (The general meaning is like this.)

I feel that these words can be given to the general youth in today's society, because when we close our eyes and think about it: the world's wealth, poverty, depravity, and advancement are all within these two cups of wine, but the order of bitterness is different.

The pain in today's career, you bear it with your mind and energy, and come up with methods to solve your current difficulties; that is the fruit of future career success. The germination of a seed, this is a small amount of strength, but it must draw out its sprouts from the soil. If there is a large stone pressing on it, it will also grow out of the cracks in the stone. Such a small seed still knows to fight in difficulty, then we, as humans who are the spirit of all things, should be more aware: living in bitterness is a necessary path in life. Just taking student days as an example, if you are willing to bury your head in studying hard, those who work hard, after leaving school in the future, will definitely not be unemployed or run into trouble, which is that they first drank bitter wine, and after the bitterness, sweetness will come. On the other hand, if you are a friend who muddles through your days in school, when you come into society, you will run into walls and the danger of unemployment; unless you are wealthy, or have a powerful "backstage boss."

How many sages and heroes in ancient and modern times, in their youth, were in difficult circumstances and continued to struggle, went through many obstacles, shed a lot of blood and sweat, and some almost lost their lives, but they did not feel discouraged at all, and they never gave up, working hard, working hard, and developing their careers with renewed efforts. This is the symbol of drinking bitter wine. You eat a little more bitterness, and you will have a little more happiness in the future. This is also the fact of "you reap what you sow" for youths! When you encounter disappointment, do not lament. On the journey of your career, there are definitely buried stumbling blocks and weeds, and even thorny bushes, to prevent your progress, but we should not give in no matter what, and should overcome it step by step. It is like a bottle of bitter wine, drinking it mouthful by mouthful, gradually drinking the bitter wine, it will be the arrival of your success. If we don't want to be in pain when we are old and gray-haired, then we can only finish this bitter wine.

### Research and Equipment

â€” Qiji

Some people think that work must have complete equipment in order to produce excellent results. I, on the other hand, am rudimentary and simple, and will never have any achievements. The so-called, "If you want to do a good job, you must first sharpen your tools." For example, if you ask a chemist who specializes in research at a pharmaceutical factory why he can't research any new drugs, nine times out of ten he will blame the simplicity of his laboratory equipment, saying that something is not fully equipped, which has made it difficult for him to work everywhere and cannot follow his wishes to do all kinds of experiments. Under these circumstances, there is no way to talk about invention.

In fact, this kind of argument is right and wrong. Why? Because we know that whether work can produce good results, part of it, of course, inevitably depends on the perfection of the equipment, but most of it still depends on the intelligence and efforts of the person doing the work. A dull researcher, even if he spends all day in the most magnificent laboratory, will not have the slightest contribution to his colleagues. On the contrary, a quick-witted student, lying in a poor and remote place, relying on nothing more than a few burning tubes and a few raw materials, is incomparable to the researcher in that laboratory, but he may invent something. History is full of such examples: Watt invented the steam engine, relying entirely on an old teapot; Franklin discovered electricity by flying a kite; Edison's inventions often occurred in a shack in a backyard when he was young. If they all had to wait until the equipment was sufficient before they were willing to start working, then the things invented in the world would at least be halved. Whether we can now use electric lights instead of kerosene lamps, and whether we can take magnificent ships instead of wooden boats in waterways, I am afraid that these are all unknowns!

### Two Poems After Reading Nie Yuntai's "Preserving Wealth Methods"

â€” Lingnan Yishi

Two Poems After Reading Lingnan Yishi Now you can cultivate virtue, and in the future you can not seek it. No family enjoys three generations, the world has a hundred years of hatred. Knowing enough, poverty is still happy, greed is more rich and worried. If the flowers in front of the wind speak, what is the worry of the birds after the rain? Annoyance is not increase or decrease, war is what I seek. The eyes are full of great fullness, and the strength is exhausted in the land. Indulging in desires is chaotic, Qingxin nature is good flow. Keeping the truth is the way to release evil, and avoiding the demon's ditch. All things are in circulation, and my life returns again and again. Today is truly brilliant and prosperous, and in the past it was still withering. Waste wood becomes coal? Black mud accompanies magnolia; fish fresh water plants grow, old horses smoke and dust turn. How can a hundred changes be easy, and it is difficult to choose all good things. Compatriots and things are numerous, and the human body is complex. Evolution divides work, and survival is a shared meal; diligence can make up for small feet, and benevolence and righteousness can transcend the ordinary.

### Reading "The Twenty-Four Filial Exemplars" (3) â€“ To My Daughter

â€” Hua

"The gentleman said: Ying Kao Shu is purely filial, he loves his mother and extends his love to Duke Zhuang." This gentleman is too honest. Ying Kao Shu's words had a political effect and he didn't necessarily really want to bring meat to his mother. Later, he may have been discovered by someone and temporarily pushed it onto the old lady, just like Li Gui met Li Kui and wanted to kill him, so he said: "There is an eighty-year-old mother in my familyâ€¦" Like. But his actions are not surprising. There is no record of anything Lao Laizi did. Some people say he was a filial son, but there is no record in the biographies of filial sons. The story of Cao E River is the same as the story of Xu Wenchang, it is everywhere, but the names are different in each place. Probably wherever there is a deep water county cliff and a bit of danger, there is always such a legend. I have personally visited no fewer than a dozen filial sons' pools and filial sons' cliffs. "Historical sites" and the like are created by various methods. People who care about ethics say they are filial sons and filial daughters; people who maintain morality say "Waiting-for-Husband Rock" and "Exposing-Sinew Temple"; those who yearn for beautiful women and talented men say "Rouge Well" and "Little Qing's Tomb"; and modern Zhu Jia Guo Jie and others are also creating a "Tomb of Song Righteous Man Wu Song" by West Lake. Mencius said: "It is better to have no book than to completely believe in a book." The story of Cao E can also be understood in this way. Confucius said: "How filial is Min Ziqian! People do not question the words of his parents and siblings." This is just saying that his family said about him, and others did not doubt it anymore, and did not say how to be filial. "Every time a son is cold, the mother and three sons are alone" is also a creation of later generations. Zilu carrying rice is approachable, but in the story, it does not occupy an important position. The rest, such as tasting feces, cutting the thigh, and burying the child, make people think of Mr. Lin Yutang's words: "The Chinese mind is not healthy at all." The people who made up the stories are as despicable as King Zhou and Ji of the novel, and the likes of Zhang Xianzhong in official history. Burying the child to get gold eyes, beating the tiger to save the father, crying bamboo to grow bamboo shoots, and lying on ice to get carp, etc., are simply myths and ghost stories, and are not worth laughing at in the eyes of modern people with advanced science.

### Tragic Scene on the Street

â€” Tianming Zuo

### The Limit of Patience

â€” Qiu Lang

As the saying goes, "A small impatience ruins great plans." Therefore, only those who can endure are worthy of being called great men. In the past, Han Xin endured the humiliation of crawling between someone's legs, and Zhang Liang had the act of retrieving a shoe for an old man. Both were able to endure at the moment and achieve lasting merit for posterity. Their demonstration to later generations is clear. Living in this world, we encounter unsatisfactory things in eight or nine out of ten instances. Only by dealing with them with patience can we find contentment and happiness, and find peace through endurance. Furthermore, if fathers and sons can endure, kindness and filial piety will arise; if husbands and wives can endure, the family will prosper; if brothers can endure, friendship and love will be strong; if friends can endure, affection and loyalty will be firm. As the saying goes, "Enduring a moment's anger avoids a thousand days of trouble." Therefore, the meaning of patience is truly great. Patience is a good remedy for life. As mentioned above, in this era of chaos and separation, enduring hunger and cold is not surprising. There are countless things that must be endured. However, endurance should also have its limits and meanings. If one allows saliva to dry on one's face and offers the other cheek after being slapped on the left, their level of endurance is truly superior! However, it is not appropriate to always endure humiliation and seek temporary peace, behaving like a coward. It should be said that endurance is indeed endurance, but it must have the conditions of perseverance and self-striving. Then, enduring humiliation and bearing disgrace today is the prelude to striving for accomplishment in the future, and only then can it be said to be valuable endurance.

Then there was the argument with Ralston. The funny thing was, Chips had never really liked him. He was efficient, ruthless, ambitious, but somehow not very likeable. He had certainly raised the status of Brookfield, making it a good school, for the first time with a slightly long waiting list for entry. Ralston was a flexible wire, a good electrical transmitter, but you had to be wary of him.

Chips had never bothered to be wary of him; he didn't like the man, but he was happy to serve him and was also loyal. Or it could be said, he served Brookfield. He knew Ralston didn't like him either; but if that was the case, it didn't seem to matter much. He felt he was old enough and qualified enough to protect himself from the misfortune that befell some other teachers whom Ralston didn't like.

Then in 1908, just as he had turned sixty, Ralston politely, but with an air of sadness, suddenly came. "Mr. Chipping, have you ever thought about resigning?" Chips stared at him in the book-filled study, stunned by the question, not understanding why Ralston was asking him that. He finally said, "Noâ€”erâ€”I can't say thatâ€”erâ€”however, erâ€”I have thought about this a lot."

"Well, Mr. Chipping, this is the opinion you should consider. The school board will certainly agree to give you a considerable pension."

Chips couldn't help but be furious. "Butâ€”erâ€”I don't want toâ€”resign. I don'tâ€”erâ€”need to consider this matter." "But I thought you should consider it." "Butâ€”erâ€”I already knowâ€”whyâ€”I should consider it!"

"In that case, things will be a little, a little difficult."

"Difficult? Whyâ€”difficult?" (To be continued)

### Requesting Support from All Sectors: Medical Aid Fund for Primary School Teachers

The progress of the medical aid fund for primary school teachers, initiated by this newspaper, was briefly outlined in yesterday's column. We sincerely hope that all sectors will enthusiastically support this initiative so that we may soon see its success. Regarding the fundraising, the goal is 200,000 yuan. Mr. Xu Guanqun has already generously donated 10,000 yuan worth of medicine from the Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory, and the staff of this newspaper has contributed 5,000 yuan from the savings of the Spring Festival banquet. We eagerly await the generous assistance of enthusiastic people from all walks of life. In addition, how to formulate implementation measures to achieve rationality and thoroughness, although pending the discussion and decision of the committee, we still invite all sectors to provide valuable opinions and pool wisdom.

Now, in order to start drafting the measures, we need relevant survey data. We request that the administration of each primary school, in conjunction with the faculty and staff, provide the following reports as completely as possible and send them directly to this column:

(1) The number of faculty and staff in each primary school, including their names, ages, places of origin, genders, monthly salaries, and number of family members, as well as the total monthly expenses for the entire family or individual.

(2) The health status of the last semester (such as the proportion of sick leave taken by each person per semester, the types of diseases suffered, the amount of medical expenses paid, and how these expenses were raised, etc.).

Yesterday, we received a letter from Dr. Wang Juerong, Director of Internal Medicine at the Nanshi Relief Hospital, expressing enthusiastic support and a willingness to ask the hospital to establish half-price or free medical services. He also sent a bottle of Western medicine, which is deeply appreciated. In addition, the Cishu Health Association on the fourth floor of the Cishu Building on Nanjing Road sent ten free group membership cards. The original letter stated, "In response to the medical aid fund campaign for primary school teachers initiated by your newspaper, we are pleased to offer ten free, non-registered group membership cards. Any primary school teacher in this city who is certified by your office and holds this membership card may enjoy the same free or reduced-fee benefits as our members when visiting the outpatient department of our association, in order to reduce the medical burden on teachers and express our association's mission to serve the community and protect the health of the public. Enclosed are ten membership cards for your review. Sincerely, Hu Qipeng, MD, General Director."

(Editor's Note) Besides gratefully receiving and filing them, the staff would like to express our sincere gratitude in advance.

### Anti-Anglo-American Association Scholarship Registration Deadline Tomorrow

In recent days, there has been rain and snow, and the temperature has dropped sharply, but students from various schools continue to flock to the association to apply for registration. The application forms are about to run out, and the deadline is 4:00 PM tomorrow. Therefore, those who have not yet registered are urged to go to register as soon as possible to avoid missing the opportunity. It is said that each student who registers is personally questioned by Mr. Zhang Yipeng, the person in charge of the association, and the conversation is secretly noted on the registration form as a reference after the examination. During the conversation, close attention is paid to the speech, demeanor, and family situation of the young students, which shows Mr. Zhang's meticulous dedication to fostering young people. The date and location of the examination will be announced in the newspapers soon. Students who have registered are advised to pay attention to the announcements.
