### On the Work of Special Agents

The application of "special agent work" to politics is a relatively recent development of the past twenty-odd years. During periods of political change or transition, it is a powerful element in helping to achieve success, because those advocating political change often have less power than conservatives, who frequently use their deeply rooted political, military, and police organizations to suppress the other side. At the same time, the ranks of the reformists are generally more complex, so special agent work becomes necessary. It bravely acts as the vanguard of the reformist forces, engaging in astute and firm struggles with the opposition, weakening the effectiveness of all their activities to facilitate the advancement of their own forces. Therefore, the main task of special agent work is to promote the realization of the proposed changes. Once the proposals are realized and the regime is established, its task is to ensure political stability, preventing and exposing the opposition's sabotage activities in all aspects, so that the regime becomes increasingly consolidated and the reform policies can be smoothly implemented, that is, to put politics on the right track day by day. When the revolutionary regime has been consolidated, politics is on track, and the activities of the opposition have been curbed, special agent work will gradually come to an end with the end of the military period, and its duties will be transferred to the regular police authorities of the government.

Since the task of special agent work is as described above, it must strictly adhere to the following principles:

First, the relationship between the special agent organization and politics is that it exists to promote political proposals and safeguard political security, so it must be subject to political control and government control, and it must never control politics or the government. If special agent personnel need to participate in government administrative work, then they must first relinquish their original positions.

Second, because the duty of special agent work is to promote the realization of proposals and safeguard political security in order to wage war against saboteurs, they cannot simultaneously participate in the practical work of military, political, economic, and other departments. Otherwise, it will inevitably affect their detached status, weaken their original tasks, and lead to adverse consequences.

Third, the expenses of special agent work must be borne directly by the government, and it must never raise funds on its own, becoming a disguised independent organization detached from the government, forming a force equal to the government.

Fourth, special agent agencies bear more arduous tasks than ordinary political agencies, so they must have a strict organization and iron-like discipline. What should be absolutely observed in particular is:

The unity of the special agent agency's organization, with a unified organization itself, must never be divided into factions internally, opposing and restraining each other.

All activities of special agent agencies and personnel should strictly maintain secrecy, and cannot be like general political agencies, lacking combativeness and vigilance.

Special agent personnel must possess outstanding political morality; otherwise, their drawbacks will inevitably be a hundred times more serious than the lack of political morality of ordinary political workers.

In addition to the above principles, what cannot be ignored is that the object of special agent work is those who oppose their own proposals, so it should be against the enemy. When politics gradually gets on track, special agent work must prepare to gradually transfer tasks to regular political and police agencies.

What has been said above is a general explanation of the nature and tasks of "special agent work," observed from modern common sense, and can also be said to be an explanation of the principles of "special agent work."

The existence of special agent organizations in our country is a matter of only the past ten years. However, whether for the Chongqing side or the Communist side, the merits and demerits of all special agent work have been clearly manifested in the "reputation" of the broad masses! Ambitious and promising young people have been sacrificed under the misuse of special agents on both sides! The consumption of the nation's vitality is, of course, unbearable to speak of, and the decline of political morality, the collapse of social customs, the decline of national psychology, the confusion of right and wrong, and the blurring of black and white, even if Chongqing tries to defend the special agent system, it will ultimately fail to cover up the ears and eyes of the masses.

The initiator of the special agent system, the Russian Communist Party, after the establishment and consolidation of the Soviet regime, because it discovered the abuses caused by the special agent system in the revolutionary process, had to gradually adopt contraction measures. Now, the Soviet special agent agency has been replaced by regular troops and people's self-defense organizations. The Chongqing special agent system has reached the point of being domineering and outrageous, and public opinion is full of complaints. However, due to the weakness of the regime itself, it has failed to gradually transfer tasks and is still continuing to rely on the unsuitable special agent system to maintain its regime. However, its future will inevitably be led to its demise by the burden of the special agent system.

The Nanjing National Government, in its early days, opposed dragging out the war and resolutely cooperated with friendly Japan to lay the foundation for the cause of peace and co-prosperity in East Asia, which was a reformist proposal. Therefore, it needed genuine special agent work to promote the realization of the proposal and safeguard the initial political security. The achievements of the National Government's special agent work in eliminating opposition activities and consolidating politics in the peace zone in recent years have their own established evaluation. However, weighing the mission, principles, and limits of the aforementioned special agent work, we believe that there is still room for discussion. Especially under the new domestic and international situation, it is also necessary to further study and discuss whether special agent work should be further strengthened in the future.

From the perspective of the internal and external situation, due to Japan's victory in the Greater East Asia War, the security of the Greater East Asia region has been guaranteed, and a political foundation has been laid through the efforts of the Chinese government. Therefore, the special agent work, which was originally intended to promote the realization of the peace movement proposal and safeguard the political security of the National Government, has reached the stage of gradually transferring tasks to regular police agencies.

After the special agent work is gradually transferred to the police agencies, the government should properly plan for the resettlement of the special agent personnel. The special agent work system should be gradually lifted due to the change of environment, but among the special agent personnel, there are many who are astute and brave. How to use their talents appropriately, or reassign them to work after appropriate training, so that the personnel do not have suitable work to do due to the change of the special agent system, is also the government's responsibility.

Finally, we solemnly declare that the position of this newspaper has always been on the side of the people, taking an objective attitude, with sincere and careful intentions, discussing matters on their own merits, and not involving any personal matters. It is rare to occasionally involve individuals related to the matter in question. We always believe that only matters related to the national economy, people's livelihood, and the welfare of the masses have the value and necessity of discussion.

### German Forces in Salerno Area Launch Strong Counter-Offensive; British and American Landing Forces Routed

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to combined news from the German military authorities, the battle situation in Salerno is as follows: Since the 8th, the US Fifth Army under the command of Lieutenant General Clark, with forces including the 36th and 45th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Tank Division, began operations on the sea off Naples. The US military's move was to conclude an armistice agreement with the Badoglio regime and attempt to land in the Bay of Naples in order to cooperate with the Italian army in encircling and annihilating the German army in southern Italy. After the German Air Force became aware of the US military's intentions on the evening of the 8th, it launched a concentrated bombing attack on the anti-Axis transport fleet at dawn on the 9th, inflicting a major blow on the US military. Because the US military under the command of Lieutenant General Clark had three divisions, as well as the British Tenth Army composed of the 1st, 4th, 15th, and 76th Infantry Divisions and the 1st Tank Army Division, the strength was too great. Therefore, the Italian-German Commander-in-Chief Kesselring ordered his troops not to defend the entire coastline, but to defend the high ground east and north of Salerno Bay. Since September, the anti-Axis forces have successively landed in Salerno Bay, deploying fortresses, and the total number of tanks and infantry that have landed has reached about seven divisions. After that, they expanded their forces north and west from the city of Salerno. The US military attacked the southern highlands of Eboli, attempting to break through the German defenses and attack Potenza. In response, the German side, with the Göring Panzer Division as the center, relied on mountain positions to resist. On the 11th and 12th, because the US military's offensive was fierce, the flanks of the German positions were repeatedly threatened. At dawn on September 13th, the US military launched a final general offensive again. However, because the loss of troops and materials gradually increased, by noon on the 13th, the US military's combat power had greatly declined. Moreover, due to the fierce bombing of the German bomber squadron, the US military's maritime reinforcements were also extremely difficult. The German army took this opportunity to immediately turn from defense to offense and launched a fierce attack. The combat operations of the tank corps and mechanized units were particularly courageous, charging into the US military positions from the mountain areas to the broad front, causing them to fall into disarray. Finally, the US military's heavy artillery positions were also occupied by the German army. The US military attempted to retreat to the coastal area and escape by boat, but suffered extremely heavy losses due to the bombing of the German Air Force. Everywhere on the roads to the coastal area were weapons abandoned by the US military. The German army continued to pursue the US military. On the night of the 13th, it carried out a roundabout operation with mechanized units, capturing approximately 10,000 US soldiers. In the fighting on the northern end of the Salerno fortress, the British army was responsible for taking the lead. The British army, with powerful tanks and mechanized infantry units, advanced to Millettli in the west, and then turned north to reach Nocera. There, it turned to mechanized warfare again, attempting to capture the Naples area. Based on accurate judgment, the German Command believed that the German army should launch a strong counter-offensive from both sides and force the British army to the coastal area near Diecietri. British reinforcements landed on the western end of the Sorrento Peninsula, attempting to attack the Amalfi area from the coast, but encountered fierce resistance from the German army, causing the mechanized units that had once approached Diecietri to be unable to advance. The British army also launched a strong tank offensive from Salerno to the north, but was also surrounded by the German army near Salerno, inflicting great damage. As a result of the collapse of the US military's front, the German army in that area was able to participate in the battle against the British army. Therefore, the anti-Axis landing operation at the head of Salerno Bay has reached the brink of complete collapse.

### Mussolini Meets with Hitler in Germany to Discuss Forming New Fascist Government

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) – It is reported that Mussolini arrived at the Führer's headquarters on the 13th and met with Hitler. The two sides had a deeply emotional conversation, which was of great political significance.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to observations from well-informed sources, when Mussolini issues a declaration establishing a new government, he will take the denial of the Italian puppet regime and the abandonment of the unconditional surrender agreement to the anti-Axis countries as the policy of the declaration.

### German War Report

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German military headquarters' war report today stated that yesterday the German army launched a fierce attack on the anti-Axis forces that landed in Salerno and Eboli, achieving a great victory. One enemy unit was surrounded, and another was annihilated. The number of war trophies and prisoners captured by the German side is currently increasing rapidly. The enemy forces that were tricked into retreating to Eboli are currently fighting with their backs to the shore, using their warships to provide covering fire. German aircraft are constantly attacking their landing ships.

### Balkan Peninsula: German Position Consolidated; Italian Army Commander-in-Chief Rossi Captured

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German authorities announced on the night of the 14th that German paratroopers had captured General Rossi, the Italian Commander-in-Chief in the Balkans, and his Chief of Staff, Albertini, in the area of Tirana.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The "Börsen-Zeitung," in its article "The Balkan Region Has Reached Stability," stated that the German army has secured the Balkan Peninsula and eliminated all possible dangers that might have arisen after Italy's surrender. Although a few Italian generals and senior officers supported Badoglio's betrayal, the majority of the Italian army refused to fight the German army. All attempts by Italian commanders to sabotage German army steps and launch resistance were eradicated in their infancy. The Albanian troops, commanded by their own officers, also fully joined the German army. Several fascist Blackshirt divisions also expressed their intention to fight on the German side. The disarmament of the Italian army in Croatia proceeded without conflict, and the forest troops of Cettigne also surrendered completely. On the other hand, the Italian Sixth Division at Rijeka accepted German conditions after a short period of resistance. The ports along the Dalmatian coast have all fallen into the hands of the German army. In Split, the local resistance has been eliminated by German aircraft. In Montenegro, all airfields and mountainous areas have been occupied by the German army.

### Fascist Party Renamed; Mussolini Reassumes Leadership

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – A German news agency reports: Mussolini has formally resumed his position as leader of the Italian Fascist Party today and immediately issued five orders, formally announcing his resumption of power to the nation. He appointed Pavolini as interim secretary of the Fascist National Party, which will henceforth be renamed the "Republican Fascist Party." All military, political, and academic personnel who were dismissed due to the rebellion must immediately be reinstated, with their rights restored. The party organs will assist the German army fighting in Italy and must provide spiritual and material assistance. The attitude of all party members must be re-examined after this political upheaval, and the shameless and traitorous will be severely punished without leniency. All militia organizations will be restored to enhance national defense.

### Ciano: Whereabouts Unknown

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a German news agency dispatch from Rome: After being rescued, Mussolini met with his family in a certain major city. It is rumored that the rescued members of Mussolini's family also include Mrs. Ciano, née Edda, and Ciano's four young children. However, Ciano's own whereabouts remain unknown. The German news agency also reported that a Reuters dispatch from London claiming that Ciano had gone to Rome to participate in the new Fascist regime is completely unfounded. It is not yet known whether Rome is still the capital of the new government, and Ciano was not among the Fascist leaders rescued by the German army. Although it is still unclear whether Ciano fled to Sicily with Badoglio, judging from Ciano's attitude during the Fascist Grand Council meeting, Ciano will definitely not hold an important position in the Fascist Party again. Furthermore, regarding news of the Italian King and Badoglio, the Rome radio station broadcast on the night of the 8th that after Italy surrendered to Britain and the United States, the Italian King escaped from Rome by car, reaching the headquarters of the Italian army division near Lake Albano outside the city. Before the arrival of the German army, he fled to Palermo in a twin-engine military aircraft. According to various reports, Badoglio may have arrived in North Africa.

### Italian Peace Delegation Disguised as Beggars; Lisbon as Contact Point

Stockholm, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch, a Swedish newspaper reprinted a report from the London Daily Express stating that the representatives sent by the Badoglio government to Lisbon to negotiate peace were disguised as beggars. Ostensibly, they sought to exchange Italian expatriates in South America with Chilean expatriates in Europe, but their real mission was to discuss the terms of Italy's surrender. The representatives arrived in Lisbon by train instead of by plane and stayed in the cheapest hotels. For the first few days, they did not contact the British Ambassador to Portugal, Campbell. When they needed to use a telephone, they used the hotel's public phone, indicating their extreme poverty. Only when they were sure that no one was paying attention did they contact the British Embassy.

### Japanese Embassy Staff Arrive in Venice; Establish Temporary Office

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – After the Badoglio regime in Italy surrendered to Britain and the United States, the staff of the Japanese Embassy in Italy, led by Ambassador Hidaka, and a group of Japanese reporters, departed from Rome on the 9th. Under German protection, they arrived in Venice on the 11th. The embassy has established a temporary office there. After the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini decides on the organization and location of the new Fascist government, the temporary office will be moved to the location of the new government. Furthermore, Japanese military attachés from the army and navy have also established temporary offices in key areas of Italy.

### Manchukuo Foreign Minister's Broadcast Commemorative Speech: Jointly Building a New Order

Xinjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Xinjing Radio broadcast a commemorative speech. Its main points are as follows: Eleven years have passed since the founding of Manchukuo. Manchukuo's rapid development is unprecedented in world history. Our friendly nation, Japan, now possesses all resources and ensures an absolute and invincible victory. The Japanese soldiers have thoroughly crushed the enemy's counterattacks everywhere, which is truly comforting to us. We must also strengthen the unity of all countries and ethnic groups in East Asia, uphold the belief in certain victory, and carry out the war to thoroughly defeat Britain and the United States, so that they may collapse. Manchukuo is the axis for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere in the spiritual aspect and the supply base for accomplishing the Greater East Asia War in the material aspect. The mission is extremely important. Therefore, we hope that our entire nation will recognize this point, and jointly cooperate to advance towards establishing the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and building a new world order.

### Fierce Defensive Battles on the Extensive Eastern Front; German Army Occasionally Exploiting Counterattack Opportunities

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – The German Führer Headquarters announced at noon on the 14th: In the street fighting in Novorossiysk, the Soviet army attempted to attack German vehicles, but was completely defeated. On the battle line from Krymsk to Krasnoarmeysk, the Soviet army launched attacks with infantry and tank units, but failed completely due to the fierce German attacks.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) – A Reuters military correspondent reported last night: Fierce defensive battles are being waged on the extensive front from the Sea of Azov to Moscow to the Smolensk highway. The war is now becoming a war of attrition, as the German High Command is adopting a more flexible defensive strategy on a larger scale than before, but is still taking advantage of opportunities to launch effective counterattacks. In the current war, it is impossible to give an accurate description of the current situation, but the Soviet Union still failed to break through any part of the front line on Sunday. At the same time, the German army's withdrawal from Bryansk was to abandon a position that was easy to counterattack to the east, and the defensive battles in Bryansk had tied down too many German troops. However, the Soviet command was still unable to achieve its original plan of encircling the majority of the German army.

For domestic trade, the Commercial Control Association will handle it according to the region and stipulate the ratios for each merchant and its resale. The distribution agency will deliver the goods to designated merchants in each region for resale. For cotton yarn and cloth transported to the interior, the Commercial Control Association will stipulate the merchants and the resale ratios. The distribution agency will deliver the goods to designated merchants for transport to the interior. For general civilian needs in Shanghai, the distribution agency will also deliver the goods to wholesale cloth merchants for redistribution according to the above-mentioned method of stipulating the ratios for approved merchants. The wholesale cloth merchants mentioned above must distribute the goods to retail cloth merchants within the Shanghai area. The distribution quantity for retail cloth merchants will be determined based on the actual sales figures of retail sales in the first half of 1942 and 1943. The regulations to ensure control are as follows: 1. Prohibition of mutual sales among the same industry. 2. Prohibition of mutual sales between various regions in the interior and within the same region. Distribution is prohibited to those other than cooperative members.

Citizens, with their receipts for three to four house tax payments and the resident certificate of the same household, could purchase four ounces of oil per person at a price of 9.70 yuan at designated oil shops. The household oil for other districts is also being processed for delivery. Once completed, it will be sold separately. The quantity and price are exactly the same as in the Eighth District.

Please submit it to the Executive Yuan for approval and promulgation for implementation.

### Household Rice: Sales Slips Issued Yesterday

Datong News Agency: The 47th period of household rice in the 1st and 8th districts could not be supplied because the Rice Grain Joint Venture had not yet moved the 150,000 bags of rice allocated by the Food Department for the second batch of food rice in August.

### Shanghai Citizens' Civil Defense Knowledge

Central News Agency Dispatch: In order to complete the civil defense lineup in this city, the Shanghai Japanese Army Air Defense Headquarters, with the efforts and cooperation of 5 million citizens, has conducted several air defense exercises since last year, with the aim of increasing citizens' awareness of air defense. As the air battles in the Greater East Asia War have recently become more intense, it is even more important for Shanghai citizens to cooperate in civil defense. The 20th of this month is Japan's Fourth Aviation Memorial Day. The Shanghai Army and Navy Air Defense Headquarters have specially selected to publish "Shanghai Citizens' Civil Defense Song," written by Komeyama Shiun and translated by Xu Chuanlin, to encourage citizens to recite it and stimulate concern for air defense. Furthermore, in view of the recent actions of the US and Chongqing air forces, the Air Defense Headquarters has given special instructions on several points of civil defense knowledge. It is hoped that citizens will pay attention to them at all times.

Civil Defense Knowledge

A. When a warning or alarm is issued: Immediately inform all family members. If it is at night, strictly implement light control. Fill water buckets with clean water. Prevent vibration.

B. When an air raid alarm is issued: The elderly, young, and sick should be concentrated in shelters. If staying indoors, gather in a safe place that is not close to the outside. All vehicles, etc., should be parked in places that do not obstruct traffic. The general public should return quickly and carry out their tasks.

C. When incendiary bombs are dropped: Immediately go to the station and notify nearby places to work hard on firefighting. Cover the places where incendiary bombs are dropped with soaked straw mats, quilts, and soil, and water them. Incendiary bombs are less dangerous, so wear gloves and cover your mouth to avoid inhaling smoke.

D. When a fire occurs: Immediately notify the fire brigade. Use the fire-fighting water. If the house is burning and the family air defense team cannot extinguish it, water the front of the house to prevent the fire from spreading.

E. When bombs are dropped: As soon as you hear an explosion, immediately cover your eyes and ears and crouch on the ground. Do not go outside or stand near glass windows. If there is an unexploded bomb, immediately notify the police.

### Tricycle Fare Increase Not Approved

The Shanghai Tricycle Industry Association repeatedly submitted a request to the former Public Works Department in mid-July, requesting a price increase. After the concession was taken over, it was handled by the First District Office. It is reported that the District Office believes that increasing the price of public vehicles will affect general prices. In order to handle it carefully, it ordered the relevant departments to investigate and report, and held several meetings to discuss it. Such events must go through the necessary procedures before they can be implemented. However, the Tricycle Association published an advertisement in the newspapers on the 14th of this month, arbitrarily increasing the fare, which is illegal. The authorities have issued a serious warning about this. Unless approved by the competent authority, the newly set fare should be considered illegal.

### Shen Bao Scholarship: Expanding Quotas, Deadline for Application, To Fulfill the Wishes of Donors from All Walks of Life and Greatly Foster Talent

The fifth round of this newspaper's reader scholarships, since the announcement of the approved list for each group at the end of last month, and during the period for handling various closing procedures, this newspaper has repeatedly received letters from readers and donors, stating that those engaged in education and cultural undertakings have meager monthly incomes and feel particularly burdened by the cost of their children's education. It seems appropriate to provide a special explanation so that children in the education and cultural sectors can continue to apply for scholarships. In order to respect the opinions of readers and donors, this newspaper has decided to accept this suggestion. At the same time, it will further support letters from impoverished students who, due to illness or returning to their hometowns, have delayed their applications, with sincere words and an eager need for assistance. This was discussed at yesterday's scholarship meeting, and it was resolved to respect the opinions of applicants and donors and adopt the principle of expanding applications and increasing the number of scholarships to greatly assist students. The following are the procedures for applying for scholarships:

Supplementary Scholarship Application Procedures

A. From elementary school to university, students of all levels who are applying for supplementary scholarships must have a letter from their principal certifying their impoverished family background and excellent academic performance.

B. Above 80 points in the major subjects of the previous semester, with a total average of 75 points or above.

C. From tomorrow (the 17th) to the 24th, application procedures must be completed within one week. Applications will not be accepted after the deadline.

D. Those currently working in the education or cultural sectors may apply for educational expenses for their children in accordance with the scholarship regulations.

The above supplementary scholarship application procedures are limited to those from impoverished families with excellent academic performance who are in urgent need of assistance to avoid dropping out of school. Those who have already received scholarships from this newspaper or elsewhere will not be considered.

Baizhi Scholarships Aid Impoverished Students

The Baizhi Scholarship Committee, organized by doctors of traditional Chinese medicine, allocates a portion of their after-hours income to provide scholarships for impoverished university students, funding school-stipulated tuition and miscellaneous fees. For national universities with low tuition fees, 600 yuan is provided for books. This semester, there are 20 freshman scholarships available, entrusted to this newspaper for selection and recommendation for funding by the committee. This newspaper has followed the committee's simple guidelines, selected the best candidates, and submitted the list in a previous report. In addition to the 14,900 yuan approved by this newspaper, an additional 820 yuan was provided to cover the required tuition and miscellaneous fees, totaling 15,720 yuan. Yesterday, the full amount was received from the committee. On behalf of the students receiving assistance, we express our gratitude. If the selected students maintain excellent academic performance, the committee will continue to provide funding until they graduate from university. If they transfer schools or receive other assistance, new candidates will be selected to fill their places.

Famous Calligraphers and Painters Hold Charity Sale to Aid Education

Five famous Shanghai calligraphers and painters, Sun Zhimin, Qian Shoutie, Ruogua Monk, Tang Zhen, and Ma Gongyu, previously accepted the invitation of Chen Zhizhen, owner of the Shanghai Book Hall on Zhejiang Road, to collaborate on a charity sale of calligraphy and paintings to aid education. The four painters jointly painted plum blossoms, orchids, bamboo, and chrysanthemums, each showcasing their strengths. It is difficult to compare their beauty. With the addition of Sun Taishi's (Sun Zhimin) timely work, the value has increased. Half a day's proceeds were donated to this newspaper's scholarship fund. The funds have been received, and we thank them on behalf of the impoverished students.

Scholarships Received Yesterday

The list of scholarship titles received yesterday is as follows: Baizhi Scholarship Committee, 15,720 yuan; Shanghai Painting Hall (charity sale of calligraphy and paintings by famous artists), 5,050 yuan; Xin Shenchu, 100 yuan. Total received: 20,870 yuan in reserve certificates. Remaining balance: 1,999,525 yuan.

### Ting Yun Lou Scholarship - Acknowledging Gratitude

Mr. Shao Daren, factory director of Huayang Dyeing and Weaving Factory and manager of Ruihe Brick and Tile Factory, also known as the owner of Ting Yun Lou, aware of the sudden increase in tuition fees at various schools this semester and the inability of impoverished students to attend, was deeply concerned. This summer, he invited over a hundred famous calligraphers and painters to hold a charity exhibition of fan paintings at the Daxin Painting Hall to donate to the Shen Bao and Xin Bao scholarship funds. The opening three days were a complete success, raising a total of 402,760 yuan, verified by representatives sent by the newspapers. However, due to the difficulty of collecting a small amount of funds, Mr. Shao temporarily advanced the funds. Yesterday, 200,1380 yuan and a Central Asia Bank promissory note dated September 21 were allocated to this newspaper. Mr. Shao's enthusiasm for education and dedication to public service is a model for society, and we express our deepest gratitude to Mr. Shao and all those who participated in the charity exhibition on behalf of the impoverished students.

Comments from the Economic Sector

### The Crux of Wartime People's Livelihood Issues

With the outbreak of war, belligerent nations have focused on solving people's livelihood issues. To achieve the goal of victory in the war, it is necessary to guarantee the lives of the people and ensure that no one suffers from hunger. This is, of course, also hoped for in China.

The most significant aspects of the current livelihood issues in China are food and commodity prices. If the food distribution is smooth and prices stabilize, then half of the livelihood issues can be solved. People's livelihood issues are broad and comprehensive, including the implementation of general social policies, but the focus is on food and commodity prices. If these policies are successful, the wartime system in the country will be strong; if they fail, they will cause adverse situations. China has been at war for eight months. What progress has been made in food and commodity prices during this process? What contributions have been made to the advancement of the wartime system? These are questions that the National Government should deeply consider and reflect upon.

Since the spring of this year, the National Government's food policy has been implemented through the Rice and Grain Joint Venture, but the results in the past six months have been unsatisfactory, with numerous弊端. As a result, it was decided to abolish it and form the Rice and Grain Control Committee. Poor food distribution can hinder wartime food policies, which should be reflected upon. Changing the agency is necessary, and we understand the inevitable reasons for this. However, this institutional change happened to occur during the transition period, causing some damage to the livelihood issues, which is regrettable. The failure of the Joint Venture was not due to its institutional issues but to the enthusiasm and sense of responsibility of the police personnel. Therefore, in changing the agency, personnel must also be changed. If the previous state remains, there is absolutely no hope of success. Those involved in the Rice Control Committee should deeply consider this.

Regarding commodity prices, the National Government's intentions are not proactive enough. Initially, we thought that with the activities of the Economic Control Committee, these problems could be solved. However, our expectations were not realized. After the transfer of economic control matters to the National Government, commodity prices continued to rise wildly. This is undeniable. It would be excessive to place all the responsibility on the National Government. However, if the National Government had shown active enthusiasm from the beginning, the situation would not be as serious as it is today.

In short, the significance of wartime people's livelihood issues is extremely important and significant. If they are successfully resolved, it can boost public opinion domestically and unleash combat power externally. The focus of China's wartime livelihood issues is food and commodity prices. How they are resolved can determine the progress or regression of the wartime system. If food and commodity price problems are seen as purely economic problems without understanding their importance during wartime, it is disloyal to the construction of China's wartime system. Therefore, we boldly call for the attention of the National Government and Chinese economists. (Qi Qing: Abridged translation from the Continental Daily News, September 15)

### Material Exchange Between Central and North China Planned, Implementation Pending Approval from Authorities

Material resources between Central and North China have generally maintained a balanced state. Goods transported from Central China to the north are mainly rice and silk, while goods transported from North China to the south are mainly coarse grains and other local products. Since the incident, due to inconvenient transportation and various other reasons, material exchanges between the two regions have not been fully realized, with generally more goods being transported north than south. The National Commercial Control Association believes that this situation has a significant impact on the economic development of the two regions. In order to facilitate the smooth flow of materials between the two regions, it previously began to formulate a plan for material exchange between the two regions. A reporter from the Commercial Daily learned from relevant sources yesterday that this plan has been carefully studied and formulated by experts and relevant personnel for several months and has now been largely completed. Once approved by the authorities, it can be implemented. It is understood that the plan contains a comprehensive plan for the exchange of materials to ensure that the materials in both regions can be utilized as much as possible and maintain a balanced state.

Business Summary

Government Bonds: Yesterday's prices rose sharply at one point, but after entering the market, they retreated with decorative gold, and the bond market was also weak. The two types followed the gold price to rise at one point, but in the end, they were slightly higher than the long-term price. The form of Type E was also good. Type A, which was the leader, has now retreated to the ranks of Type C, probably because it is not far from the total liquidation period. Types B and D have not been opened.

Call Loan Interest: The Shanghai Money Industry Association's call loan interest rate was slightly lowered by one point to 1.9% due to the Mid-Autumn Festival, market stability, and available silver.

Rice and Grain: Both land and water routes have arrivals, but retail transactions are light. Small households have little intention of buying, and the market is also good at this time when the weather is warm and new goods from various places are coming to the market. Therefore, the price of new japonica rice has fallen sharply, and white yuan has also fallen into the customs. There is some buying and price stability for soybeans and red beans.

Daily Necessities: Due to previous rumors that household rations would be implemented, the prices of soap and matches, etc., fell frequently. However, recently, as there is no sign that the rationing news will be implemented, the market conditions of soap and matches have turned from weak to strong. At the same time, the recent distribution price of the Five Continents Factory solid soap has been raised, so the soap market, which was troubled by the lower reaches, has become stable. The price of matches is also in a state of fluctuation. As for the foreign candles, due to the scarcity of goods, the asking price is rising all the way.

Membership Certificates of Various Industry Associations Must Be Affixed with Stamp Duty in Accordance with the Law, 4 Yuan Per Certificate in National Currency

The Shanghai City Chamber of Commerce previously sent a letter to the Clothing Industry Association, stating that the membership certificates issued were not affixed with stamp duty, resulting in punishment.

Shen Bao Letter to the Business Community

### Shen Bao Letter to the Business Community

To the Business Community: Shanghai's industrial and commercial undertakings have always been prosperous. In the past, there were specialized publications such as credit directories for convenient reference. In recent years, there have been many new creations and changes, but there is still a lack of detailed investigation and systematic records. Moreover, due to the high cost of paper and labor, few new editions have been published, making inspection and reference inconvenient. This newspaper, in view of this, plans to start compiling a book called "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory", collecting extensively and investigating accurately. It has repeatedly received assistance from industry associations and people from all walks of life, who have provided information or introduced investigations. However, this newspaper's goal of compiling the book is to facilitate the business community's reference, so the investigation and records must be detailed and accurate. Therefore, it is announced again, requesting all factories, workshops, companies, and firms in the city (regardless of the size of the capital or the scope of business, all industrial and commercial enterprises are welcome) to provide accurate survey data. The content of the data is mainly based on the following items: Name, Address, Telephone, Telegraph, Post Office Box, etc., Date of Establishment, Organization (Company, Partnership, Sole Proprietorship, etc.), Type of Business, Names of Important Officers such as Chairman, Director, Supervisor, Manager, Deputy Manager, Factory Director, Director, etc., Shop Owner, Shareholders, etc. Please indicate each item in detail and send it directly to this newspaper's "Industrial and Commercial Directory Data Department" so that it can be included in the compilation. From this newspaper's point of view, the goal of being detailed and accurate can be achieved. From the industrial and commercial point of view, it can not only indirectly promote business but also gain recognition from all walks of life. It is deeply believed that people from all walks of life will understand and be happy to assist. The compilation and printing will be done soon, so please fill out and send it as soon as possible.

### The Soviet Union Launches a Political Offensive in West Asia and North Africa, Inciting Anti-British Movement in Egypt

The Soviet Union's demand for a second front against Britain and the United States, specifically in four parts of Europe, can be seen as a warning against the pro-Soviet forces fostered by Britain and the United States in the Balkans. The Soviet Union's distrust of Britain and the United States not only restrains the advance of British and American forces in the Balkans but also launches a political offensive against the British and American forces entrenched in West Asia and North Africa.

The Problem of the Arab League

In West Asia, the most concerned issue is the Arab League issue planned by Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha. Due to Britain's secret machinations, it used the Pan-Arabism advocated by the countries of West Asia to win them over to its own camp. Therefore, this issue is often raised among the countries of West Asia. In the spring of this year, British puppet Egyptian Prime Minister Nahas Pasha and others actively held talks, but the outcome was a failure. Taking advantage of the opportunity that the Mediterranean war situation was favorable to the anti-Axis forces, Britain and the United States revived the issue together.

From the first day of this month, under the chairmanship of Nahas Pasha, representatives from West Asian countries were gathered to hold a meeting in Alexandria for two days. Regarding this meeting, according to the announcement of the Egyptian government, the meeting ended in an extremely friendly atmosphere. It can be seen that no concrete results have yet been obtained this time.

During the last war, Britain gave the Arab nation a little favor, and in this war, it wants to use the same method to manipulate them. The Axis's clear war aims and the Soviet Union's propaganda work have greatly helped to prevent them from falling into the British and American plans.

Since the dissolution of the Third International, the Soviet Union's propaganda with a strong nationalistic color has aroused considerable empathy in Western European countries. Recently, incidents of conflict between British and American troops stationed in Iraq, Syria, Palestine, and other places and local residents have been heard, which is enough to explain the lack of fear among the peoples of the four Asian countries.

The Rise of Egyptian Nationalism

The Soviet Union's political offensive in North Africa has recently become more active, especially the political offensive against Egypt, which is regarded by Britain and the United States as the most important stronghold in West Asia and North Africa. Soviet Deputy Foreign Minister Dovsky, who briefly stayed in Cairo on his way to visit Britain, will exchange ambassadors with the Egyptian government. It is also reported that the building for the Soviet embassy has been decided. The opposition party in the Egyptian political arena, which opposes the current Nahas Pasha, is carrying out a major unity movement, and the Soviet Union's manipulation behind it is quite active, making Britain and the United States very embarrassed.

Nahas, as the leader of the Nationalist Party, representing Egyptian nationalism, once stood up and fought against British forces. Since taking power after the current war, he has gradually been won over by British forces, and many people in the Wafd Party have left because of this. The party has now completely lost its former appearance. A group led by former Finance Minister Makram Ebeid left the party this spring, and recently, most of the fighters since the founding of the Nationalist Party, such as Basiour, have also left. These people and radical nationalists are forming an anti-government force, and its future will become a major obstacle to the British and American war effort.

The Activity of the Communist Party in North Africa

The Soviet Union is also actively working with the French Liberation Committee of Algiers. After the committee was established, it sent more than 60 commercial representatives to Algiers, rapidly engaging in economic cooperation with the committee, which aroused the suspicion of Britain and the United States. When Britain and the United States recently recognized the committee, their recognition was conditional. In contrast, the Soviet Union recognized it unconditionally and immediately appointed Bogomolov, the Soviet representative to the committee, who was stationed in London.

On the other hand, the French Council for National Defense has always maintained a very friendly attitude towards the Soviet Union, even treating the Communist Party in French North Africa with considerable leniency. As a result, the communist movement in French North Africa has also seen a rise. To the point where some British and Americans say that Tegor's followers are communists. In short, the above-mentioned attitude of the French Liberation Committee clearly shows that its support for Britain and the United States has been shaken, and its trust in the Soviet Union is very obvious. Although Britain and the United States clearly see the Soviet Union's anti-British political intentions, they are afraid that the common war with the Soviet Union will break down, so they have to acquiesce on the surface. However, the most recent British and American propaganda work on the Iberian Peninsula has used this political offensive by the Soviet Union to promote the threat of red forces and carry out the strategy of drawing Spain and Portugal together.

### Difficulties in Organizing a Teachers' Cooperative

— Qi Mo

The suggestion to organize a teachers' consumer cooperative, after being raised in this newspaper, immediately received a positive response from the education sector itself and people from all walks of life. As a member of the teaching profession myself, I am naturally pleased with this situation. However, I feel that there are often very difficult problems to be solved in order to organize a teachers' consumer cooperative.

Obtaining goods is the most important issue for a cooperative. Otherwise, even with sufficient funds and a perfect organization, the result would still be like a plane without gasoline, completely useless. Moreover, the so-called goods here do not refer to those least practical things, but to necessities such as light oil, kerosene, salt, and the like; nor do they refer to things with prices similar to those on the black market, but to allocated goods at lower prices. Because, as everyone understands, the reason teachers need a cooperative is entirely in the hope of obtaining the necessities to maintain a family's minimum standard of living at a relatively low price. They have no surplus to buy secondary supplies, nor the strength to buy from the black market at high prices.

Whoever can solve the above problem satisfactorily can truly organize a good cooperative; otherwise, it is just "in name only."

Now look at the example of the Shanghai Municipal Consumer Cooperative. We must admit that, at least until now, it has been a failure. Because in the two rounds of allocated goods issued by the cooperative, there was no rice, cooking oil, matches, cigarettes, and other materials most urgently needed by the lower and middle classes. What about coal? Although it was on the first round allocation list, it was impossible to buy, and the second round also failed to fully resolve it. The price of soap in the second round of allocations was actually slightly higher than on the market. Most of the other allocated goods, such as quilts, undershirts, irons, toothbrushes, mung beans, etc., are not things that everyone needs to replenish regularly. Even if needed, they can be obtained from outside at a similar cost. Moreover, the allocation time is not fixed. For example, although the food association had one catty of cooking oil at a very cheap price in the second round, it is not known when the next allocation will be. Therefore, it cannot truly solve the public's panic. These facts prove that the municipal consumer cooperative can only act as a decoration for citizens. Perhaps it can only solve one or two percent of the living problems of impoverished citizens.

However, the teachers' consumer cooperative that is now expected should never be a facade decoration for teachers, but should provide a comprehensive and practical solution. It should enable teachers to eat a little more cheap rice, enable teachers to make the most indispensable clothes... If it can only regularly allocate quilts, mung beans, and the like, then it is useless.

Therefore, the establishment of a teachers' consumer cooperative must first obtain the support of the goods allocation authorities to ensure the allocation of necessities before proceeding with hope. Of course, judging from the current situation, this is also very difficult, because:

First, there is a shortage of materials. For example, for rice, the allocation of household rice has recently been frequently reduced or delayed, and there will definitely not be any surplus rice to supply to teachers. Also, where will the oil come from to give?

Second, the current policy of allocating goods is clearly to concentrate efforts on per capita allocation and to reduce the allocation of special sectors as much as possible. For example, for rice, stop the allocation to factories and restaurants and try to increase household rice; for flour, stop the allocation to sliced noodle and pancake shops and increase household flour. Under this policy, it is very difficult for teachers to obtain the allocation of necessities.

My opinion is not to disappoint the educational community or people from all walks of life who advocate organizing consumer cooperatives. It is just to point out the actual difficulties, hoping that everyone will first work hard to solve these difficulties.

### Ding Fu, an Elder, Talks About Simple Health and Longevity Methods at the Senior Citizen Forum

After holding a tea party for the elderly during the Mid-Autumn Festival, they visited the Eight District Park together. They felt that the moon on this year's Mid-Autumn Festival night was so lovely and round, and so bright and pure, rejoicing in the reunion of the bright moon in the sky to symbolize the reunion of people in the world in the future. The bright moon is still the same, but the mountains and rivers need to be rebuilt. The unity of the one billion people is as bright as the moon. Ding Fu, a seventy-year-old man who joined the tour, spoke about his experiences with healthy longevity methods during the celebration.

It is advisable to adhere to the system of eight hours of work, eight hours of rest, and eight hours of sleep. In other words, daily life, work, and diet should all have fixed times. All meats should not be eaten. Eat more vegetables, fruits, and beans. (You can reduce eating rice. I have not eaten rice for a long time, and my physical strength and spirit have become more robust.) Do not drink tea or coffee, drink more boiled water. Do not drink water while eating, chew slowly and swallow slowly. Do not smoke any kind of cigarettes, do not drink any kind of wine, do not eat any kind of spicy food, do not eat salty food, the lighter the better. The windows of the office and bedroom should be opened as much as possible to allow air to circulate day and night. Practice deep breathing exercises every day. Keep bowel movements smooth. From the age of twenty to forty, you should learn Sun Tangshi's gymnastics. After forty, walking is the best exercise. Excessive sexual desire can weaken brain power, cause indigestion, weaken muscles, and make organs brittle. Those who are sick have difficulty recovering, and those who are not sick will age quickly. Therefore, it is always appropriate to control desire. The skin should be bathed often, and clothes should be changed often to develop a habit of cleanliness. Maintain a peaceful state of mind all day long, and the spirit should not be melancholic, angry, or excited. Embrace a generous and tolerant attitude in everything. Wealthy houses and family members, although they appear extremely solemn, cannot last. Only the soul is forever undiminished. Knowing this, you can look beyond everything. Meditate quietly once each morning and evening, focusing your mind on the "xuan guan" (a point between the eyebrows). You should adhere to a religion for life. (Be vigilant)
