### The Contradictory Phenomena of Wartime Life: A Contrast Between Factories and Dance Halls

Wartime life, especially in a global war during its decisive phase, demands that the entire nation's strength be concentrated and dedicated to the country. The so-called main content of wartime life, on the one hand, requires that people of all strata endure inconveniences and hardships as much as possible, reduce their standard of living as much as possible, in order to conserve manpower and materials, contribute to the country, and strive for victory in the war. On the other hand, it requires the people to concentrate all their minds and labor on production, demanding that every minute of time and every ounce of strength achieve considerable results to aid in the victory of the war. The state implements general mobilization and various control plans, and the people all encourage themselves with the so-called "patriotism and public service" and "total participation in the war," all for this purpose. Every modern military strategist firmly states that the final deciding force in the current war lies not only in the fighting at the front, but even more in the concentration of all forces in the rear in the war machine, which is the thoroughness of the people's wartime life. The nation whose people's wartime life is most thorough can stand in an invincible position and strive for victory in the decisive battle. Ask which of the countries currently in a superior position in the war is not due to the seriousness and tension of the lives of the people in the rear, saving on waste, and increasing production?

Since the National Government entered the war, Shanghai has been a wartime city, and every citizen should have the responsibilities and obligations of war, and every citizen should practice wartime life. However, what we actually see is completely different. We do not see any wartime scenes or wartime spirit; perhaps it is the complete opposite. The most obvious example is dancing. There is morning dancing, noon dancing, afternoon tea dancing, and evening night dancing. Clear singing and graceful dancing often do not stop until late at night, and there are even all-night sessions, with morning dances starting up immediately afterward. This kind of non-waste of a minute of time and spirit can be said to be extreme. If dancing were a productive endeavor rather than a consumptive and wasteful activity, then we believe that Shanghai would not have to worry about a shortage of supplies or fluctuating prices, and the effect of the nation's participation in the war would be even more significant. What is lamentable is not production, but dancing, but dancing that consumes resources, wastes energy, and numbs people's minds!

Conversely, let us look at the factories engaged in production. In the past, there were day shifts and night shifts. In wartime, all countries have abolished the morning and afternoon system and adopted a continuous work system, working day and night, engaging in production, not letting the enemy catch up even for a minute or a second. But today in Shanghai, with a very few exceptions, night shifts have long been suspended, and day shifts are also sometimes on and sometimes off, opening every other day, opening every three days, and even long-term shutdowns are everywhere. How shall we explain this absolutely contradictory phenomenon of wartime life? However, such contradictory phenomena are probably not limited to the contrast between dance halls and factories!

We have specifically cited the two matters of factories and dance halls to make a comparison, to illustrate that the lives of some of the people at present not only have no meaning of wartime life, but are simply running in the opposite direction, more unreasonable than peacetime life. Because in peacetime, it is already necessary to pay attention to increasing production and developing industry, so peacetime factories have already implemented a system of continuous day and night shifts. Then, in wartime, it is even more necessary to strengthen production efficiency. Logically, there should be more work shifts than in peacetime, or at least maintain the work shifts of peacetime. However, the current reality is that the number of work shifts is specifically reduced. Although we also understand the environmental factors such as the limitations of electricity and the lack of raw materials. However, we must ask: In the economic principles of a nation at war, is it ultimately to increase production or to reduce production? If it is said that increasing production is "a matter of course," and is clearly stipulated in the outline of wartime economic policy, then why not think of ways to eliminate the so-called environmental factors? The industrial world is not without people with foresight,

In short, we always believe that supporting production and promoting increased production is the primary point of practicing wartime life. If factors hindering production are discovered, no matter how difficult they may be, they must be resolutely eliminated. For example, in the case of electricity restrictions, it is necessary to negotiate for the supply of coal. (Here, attention should be paid to the comparison between the electricity consumption of dining and entertainment venues and the electricity consumption of factories.) If the lack of raw materials is due to agricultural producers, then it is necessary to promote planting; if it is due to transportation delays, then it is necessary to negotiate for dredging. (Here, attention must also be paid to whether factories and other hoarders are hoarding raw materials.) If one side shouts about how to increase production, while the other side watches the causes hindering production and waits for it to improve naturally, that will never be realized. We sincerely hope that the government will pay close attention to the causes hindering production and adjust the contradictory phenomena that are inconsistent with wartime life. At the same time, factories engaged in production should also unite, establish close contact with the government, and work together to solve the causes hindering production. As the saying goes, "Things are done by people." The industrial world is not without people with foresight, whether it is for the sake of developing their own business, for the sake of revitalizing the national industry, for the sake of increasing production, enriching wartime materials, stabilizing people's livelihoods, or striving for victory in the war, they should all take the initiative to rise up, advise the government, and cooperate with the government, in order to achieve the goal of increasing production.

### The Russo-Japanese War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago, Re-copied from Old Newspapers (2)

Introduction

We recognize that defending the Pacific in the future will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and that the intrusion of British and American aggressive forces will no longer be tolerated. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval power. Our friendly neighbor, Japan, has established its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it defeated the many with the few, showing its first signs of prowess. In this Great East Asia War, it has further demonstrated its invincible power. At present, the entire defense of the Pacific is solely shouldered by the navy of our friendly neighbor, and we are deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden even slightly. Therefore, how we will learn from the navy of our friendly neighbor as a model, establish a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is truly a goal that our countrymen should strive to catch up with urgently. In order to increase the naval knowledge and interest of our countrymen, this newspaper has specially excerpted from its records of the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, to be re-copied, from the 20th to the 30th, for a period of ten days, and we hope that readers will pay attention.

### A Discussion of How the Russo-Japanese War Relates to the Overall Situation in Asia

(Published in this newspaper, No. 11080, the ninth day of the first month of Guangxu 30th year, Western calendar February 24, 1904, Wednesday)

What is the relationship between the rise and fall of the Russo-Japanese War? Since the beginning of the world, for tens of thousands of years, Asia has been located in the Eastern Hemisphere, surrounded by the sea in the southeast and limited by the desert in the northwest, closing itself off and never interacting with other continents. Since Europeans invented the manufacture of wheeled boats and wheeled vehicles, they have made the vast ocean seem like a grain of rice, and viewed thousands of miles as if they were in their own courtyard. Thus, the five continents have become connected, opening up a strange situation unprecedented in ancient times. The monarchs of various countries know each other, and the interactions between countries have become frequent. A peaceful situation cannot be constantly relied upon, and the beginnings of war cannot be avoided by chance. Therefore, alliances are established to protect them, and public laws are set up to define them, so that they do not turn jade and silk into weapons of war, and so that countries and people are not trampled upon. However, once interactions are established, it is easy for disputes to arise. Small disputes are of course no matter, but in the last hundred years, the various countries of Europe and America, such as the Russo-French War, the Franco-German War, the Anglo-French War, and the wars in North and South America, have all been plagued by continuous battles that have lasted for several years, wasting tens of millions in military expenditure and injuring hundreds of millions of people. Only after the numbers of victory and defeat have been determined do they each return to good terms and seek out alliances again. However, these are all matters that have taken place in Europe and America, and have not involved Asia. The only war that has taken place in Asian territory is the Russo-Turkish War, which is somewhat noteworthy. The rest, such as the wars between Britain, France, Japan, and China, have been short-lived, immediately returning to amicable relations after seeing each other in military attire. Although it is said that there are events on the borders, it is not enough to call it war. Only the current Russo-Japanese War, although Russia is located in Western Europe, has gained momentum to sweep across Asia since the construction of the Siberian Railway. Although Japan is an island nation in East Asia, it has also had the ambition to dominate Asia since it defeated China, refurbished its armor, purchased ships and warships, and made long voyages. Since two heroes cannot stand side by side, the outbreak of war was long expected. This time, it has indeed started a war over the three eastern provinces of China and Korea, fighting once at [missing text] and again at Lushun. According to Japanese newspaper reports, victories have been reported one after another, while Russia has suffered many losses. However, news of military affairs is constantly changing. If the Russians are defeated and return, the ambitious and heroic Russian Emperor will not be willing to give in easily because of occasional setbacks. According to the reports, the Russian Emperor is mobilizing 500,000 troops, who will rush to Liaodong by rail. Within a month, they can be deployed, and their persistent spirit is enough to intimidate people. Although Japan's terrain is not as deep and solid as Russia's, and its spirit is not as deep and heroic as Russia's, its monarch and subjects are united, advancing bravely without looking back, and its intelligence is exceptionally clever. Its reconnaissance is thorough everywhere, taking risks and surprising people. These are its strengths. Even if it suffers setbacks in the future, it will continue to fight, and its vigor will never diminish slightly. At the beginning of this war, it is said that the deer chases in the Central Plains, but no one knows who will die. From a superficial point of view, the division of victory and defeat between Japan and Russia is related to the safety of Asia. In the past, when the Russian fleet wanted to exit the Black Sea, it was blocked by various countries, so it changed its course to the east. The reason why various countries do not allow it to exit the Black Sea is not only to fear it, but also to fear it. Now that it has extended its power to East Asia, if it returns in triumph one day, not only will the three eastern provinces of China be under Russian control, but even Korea will be annexed into Russian territory. At this point, Japan's defenses will be completely dismantled, and the isolated island of East Sea will be in danger. And China, which is being choked and throttled, is even more irrelevant.

Navy Minister Shimada Explains His Determination

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) Japanese Navy Minister Shimada gave a statement at 5:00 PM on the 21st regarding the heroic death of Fleet Admiral Yamamoto, stating in essence: "Since the battle of Hawaii and the Malayan seas, which shocked the world, our Navy has been conducting large-scale operations throughout the Pacific and Indian Oceans, defeating resistance in various places and achieving brilliant victories. It has been only a year and a half since then, and the foundation for inevitable victory has been laid, thanks to the grace of His Majesty the Emperor. At the same time, the Combined Fleet and the Army have closely assisted each other, implementing thorough operations and fleet leadership, and fully exerting their strength. Marshal Yamamoto's special actions can be recorded in history and will be immortal. Since the beginning of the war, Marshal Yamamoto has personally commanded operations on the front lines, achieving great victories. Now, unfortunately, he has heroically sacrificed himself on the front lines. The bad news has shocked and moved the whole country, and the will to kill the enemy has been further strengthened. The current war situation is becoming more and more important and is the time to determine the rise and fall of our country. Marshal Yamamoto's sacrifice is undoubtedly a great regret, but our Navy has not been shaken in the slightest by this. Under His Majesty's grace, with ever-increasing morale, we will consolidate our determination to kill the enemy and continue to fight to put His Majesty at ease."

Minister Lin Xuan's Statement

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) On the afternoon of the 21st, Minister of Propaganda Lin, speaking to reporters in strong terms about the news of the heroic death of Admiral Yamamoto, said: "Admiral Yamamoto, with his most heroic spirit, most flexible strategy, and most tenacious spirit, repeatedly established special achievements and laid the foundation for victory in the Great East Asia War. All East Asians sincerely admire him. This time, he personally went to the front lines and died heroically, which is enough to make people respect him after mourning. This is truly a model of the spirit of the friendly navy. Admiral Yamamoto's blood will forever be the cornerstone for consolidating the Great Wall of East Asia. After Admiral Yamamoto's death, Admiral Koga took over, and the front line is becoming stronger and more active, which is enough to show that the decisive stage of the Great East Asia War has an absolute chance of success. The United States is now disagreeing with Britain and the Soviet Union on the issue of the second front. The light and heavy priorities between Britain and the Soviet Union are different, and the United States is deeply worried about the South Pacific. This kind of dispute exposes the differences in dreams and plans among the so-called anti-Axis countries. On the one hand, it is enough to prove that the United States is in danger and cannot spare any effort to relieve Britain and the Soviet Union, and on the other hand, it admits that it can no longer support the South Pacific war situation alone."

Navy Minister Ren Mourns Admiral Yamamoto

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) Navy Minister Admiral Ren Yuandao issued a brief statement as follows: "Since the outbreak of the Great East Asia War, the friendly navy has created great results with a conviction of death, which is the glory of the East Asian nations. This time, Admiral Yamamoto died in battle to defend East Asia, and we express our infinite respect for him. Admiral Yamamoto has become the god of the East Asian navy. We admire his great achievements and should complete his unfinished ambition and strive to complete the war. During the admiral's lifetime, I had the opportunity to admire his many decisions, and his great demeanor is still deeply imprinted in my mind. As for the successor, Admiral Koga, I was even closer to him when he was the Commander of the Chinese Navy. The admiral is a genius with strategic talent. From now on, he will annihilate the British and American navies, making the Pacific Ocean a solid fortress that can be easily won."

### "Remembering Marshal Yamamoto" Radio Broadcast by Director Yano, Overcome with Emotion

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - Following the news of the heroic death of Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Japanese Combined Fleet, the entire nation of Japan mourned. Major General Hideo Yano, Director of the Naval Press Department of the Imperial Headquarters, broadcast on Tokyo Radio Station at 7:30 PM on the 21st, a program titled "Remembering Marshal Yamamoto," which lasted for fifteen minutes. During the broadcast, Major General Yano was overcome with emotion, his sorrow deeply moving. The gist of his speech was: "Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, Marshal Yamamoto, has heroically died on the front lines of the South Pacific. In addition to my profound condolences, I am deeply moved when recalling Marshal Yamamoto's illustrious military achievements and his heroic spirit. After graduating from the Naval Academy in the 37th year of Meiji, Marshal Yamamoto served in the military for forty years. During this time, as a naval ensign, he participated in the Battle of the Sea of Japan, sustaining serious injuries and establishing his initial meritorious service. Subsequently, he participated in World War I and several decisive battles, establishing brilliant military achievements. Later, as commander of an aviation squadron, he enlightened the importance of the naval air force and devoted himself to its construction. At the same time, as a plenipotentiary committee member and representative, he attended the Washington Naval Disarmament Conference, consistently advocating for our country's positions. After returning to Japan, he assumed the important post of Director of the Naval Aviation Headquarters, establishing our country's present-day naval aviation. He then became a naval commander, navigating the complexities of international affairs, diligently working for national affairs. In the 14th year of Showa, he was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, participating in the Sino-Japanese War, demonstrating the spirit and strength of land-sea cooperation, forcing the Chongqing government to retreat inland. At the same time, he devoted himself to strengthening our forces and establishing sure-win strategies to cope with the Greater East Asia War. I still remember on December 8, Showa 16, when our country declared war on Britain and the United States, our navy immediately annihilated the main force of the British and American Pacific Fleets, instantly reducing their naval power. Since then, with lightning speed, we have attacked and defeated stubborn enemies everywhere, destroying the enemy's self-proclaimed encirclement, and conducting large-scale operations in the Indian Ocean, the South Pacific, and the East Pacific. We also dispatched a part of the navy to attack the west coast of the American mainland and various places in Australia and South Africa, reaping glorious victories. Although only a year and a half has passed since the start of the war, our country has already built solid strongholds around us, established an absolutely superior strategy, and laid the foundation for final victory. These rare and great achievements are due to the Combined Fleet's meticulous operations and effective command. The accomplishments of its supreme commander, Marshal Yamamoto, are worthy of being recorded in history and will be forever immortalized. This time, His Majesty the Emperor, to commend his special merits, personally visited Marshal Yamamoto's residence and bestowed upon him the title of Marshal and posthumously awarded him the First Class Order of the Golden Kite, truly the highest honor for a warrior. Since August of last year, Marshal Yamamoto has repeatedly personally commanded operations on the front lines where the fighting was fiercest, demonstrating an extraordinary fighting spirit. At the same time, all officers and soldiers were deeply moved, vowing to fight to the death to kill the enemy. When Marshal Yamamoto heroically died, that area was engaged in fierce air battles day and night. Marshal Yamamoto personally went to the front lines of this fierce battle to guide the overall operation and engage the enemy, and finally died heroically in the plane. His heroic and valiant spirit is sufficient to be an eternal model for all officers and soldiers of the Japanese Navy. I firmly believe that this will be a driving force to destroy the United States and Britain. From before the start of the war until the early stages of the war, I served as the captain of the Combined Fleet flagship, and thus had the opportunity to serve Marshal Yamamoto day and night. The personality of Marshal Yamamoto, deeply imprinted in my mind, can be described as both resolute and steady, and magnanimous and broad-minded. In his strong physique and dignified demeanor, he also possessed the warmth of a benevolent father and the breadth of mind of the sea. He truly deserved to be a perfect leader, inspiring awe and respect. Especially as the Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, shouldering the heavy responsibility of our country's rise and fall, his state of mind before and after receiving the Emperor's edict to destroy the United States and Britain was beyond anyone's comprehension. At that time, Marshal Yamamoto's attitude was calm and unhurried, and his composure inspired the officers and soldiers of the Combined Fleet with boundless trust and inspiration. When Commander Yamamoto gathered the commanding officers of the Combined Fleet at the start of the war, he said: 'I hope that you will share life and death with me.' I still remember Commander Yamamoto's words, which were as firm as a rock and as divine as a god. I will never forget them for the rest of my life. When the war situation became increasingly serious, and we received the shocking news of Marshal's death, all officers and soldiers were deeply saddened. However, the Imperial Navy not only stands firm and unwavering, but will also follow Marshal's heroic spirit, united in hatred of the enemy, and advance towards the destruction of the United States and Britain. I firmly believe that the people of our nation will inherit Marshal's heroic and lofty spirit, and that this will happen in the days to come."

Hankou, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from the front lines on the 21st, the Japanese army's annihilation battle against five divisions of the Chongqing army in the area west of Gong'an concluded on the 18th after achieving great results. The main force of the Chongqing (Tenth Army Group) has been completely annihilated, and the remnants of the (Eighty-Seventh Army) are still wandering in the area north of Wenshui Street. This glorious victory was obtained through the skillful three-dimensional operations of the Japanese upper echelons and air force, as well as the valiant struggle of the Japanese soldiers. In particular, the success of the Japanese army's mechanized warfare in the mountainous areas is a hallmark of this operation. After the Japanese army began its operations at midnight on the 12th, it took only three days for the southern and northern forces to make contact north of Xiqi, a speed that stunned the Chongqing army. Although the commander of the Eighty-Seventh Army, Gao Zhuodong, and the commander of the Ninety-Fourth Army, Mou Tingfang, ordered their subordinates to defend to the death, they themselves fled in plain clothes. Thus, in less than twenty days since the start of the annihilation battle on the shores of Dongting Lake, the Japanese army has annihilated the main force of the Chongqing (Sixth War Zone)'s Nineteenth and Tenth Army Groups, totaling nine divisions with 90,000 soldiers, in the mountains and fields of Jiangnan, and has now secured the first-line positions stretching 200 kilometers along Anxiang, Nanxian, and Zhijiang.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - A certain person here stated: The spokesman for the Chongqing Military Affairs Commission previously made a distorted explanation on the 28th night regarding the participation of Generals Pang Bingxun and Sun Dianying in the peace movement, in an attempt to cover up the facts. However, the truth of the matter will be proven by the facts themselves. Furthermore, Pang, having recognized the situation in East Asia and believing that peace is the only way to revive China, resolutely participated in the peace movement. This situation will further shatter Chongqing's malicious propaganda. Furthermore, regarding the matter of 70,000 soldiers defecting, the truth or falsehood of the matter can be clearly understood.

### United States Rescinds Immigration Act for Chongqing

Nanjing, 21st (Central News Agency) - Since its defeat in the Pacific, the United States has been chanting the slogan of counter-offensive, in order to ease the domestic atmosphere. Thus, it is doing its best to use Chongqing's Chiang to contain Japan, and has recently taken so-called measures such as abolishing extraterritoriality for Chongqing as bait. A few days ago, it also proposed to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act in a meeting. This move is merely a habitual trick to appease Chongqing's Chiang. We are well aware of the various despicable and vicious methods used by the British and Americans against people of color in the past, which are clearly visible to all and cannot be concealed. Even the oppression and bullying of overseas Chinese in the United States is hair-raising to speak of. Therefore, when the people of our country hear of the so-called abolition of the immigration law by the United States this time, they can all see through its treachery and will not be deceived by its tricks. On the contrary, they will recognize its consistent cunning methods, which will only see its efforts be in vain.

Tokyo, 21st (Central News Agency) - It has recently been reported that American congressmen have proposed to abolish the Chinese Exclusion Act in Congress. Overseas Chinese in Japan, upon hearing this, will hold a four-day All-Japan Overseas Chinese Conference in Kobe starting from the 16th, and will appeal to overseas Chinese in the United States and compatriots in Chongqing not to be confused by Anglo-American schemes, and to awaken to the concept of shared destiny and mutual survival between China and Japan, and the revitalization of East Asia.

### Italian Aircraft Attack Enemy Convoy off the Coast of Algeria; Berlin Announced Battle Results in North Africa Last Night; Over 300,000 Casualties for Anti-Axis Forces

Rome, 21st (Central News Agency) - The Italian Military Headquarters announced yesterday afternoon: The Italian Air Force has attacked enemy convoys off the coast of Algeria for several days. On the 19th, it sank two medium-sized ships with torpedoes and seriously damaged a 10,000-ton ship. In addition, Axis aircraft also raided the three military ports of Aranci, Jijel, and Skikda, achieving considerable results.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news received here last night, anti-Axis authorities in Tunisia have arrested more than 1,000 people. Algiers Radio announced: Anti-Axis authorities are still searching for "traitors, Axis collaborators, and enemy personnel."

Berlin, 21st (Central News Agency) - It was announced here last night: The Axis forces' valiant resistance in Tunisia for half a year resulted in the loss of over 370,000 British and American invaders, including 25 generals. Although the anti-Axis forces in Tunisia were greatly superior in manpower and material resources, they were still captured by the German army, including 120,000 people and 18 generals. The anti-Axis fatalities exceeded 50,000, including 7 generals. The anti-Axis wounded totaled approximately 200,000. In the non-warfare phase in Africa, 7,337 anti-Axis tanks were lost to the German army. During the course of the war, the actual strength of the German army in North Africa could not be announced. In fact, six months ago, the German army landed in Tunisia with only 238 paratroopers and infantrymen to establish a safe bridgehead in preparation for the subsequent arrival of the German army. At that time, the French army's attitude was ambiguous, and the anti-Axis tank forces were also approaching. The success of this great undertaking was due to the German army's capture of large quantities of military supplies from the anti-Axis forces. For example, in El Guettar, seven German tanks captured 2,000 anti-Axis motorcycles and captured 2,000 people. The German army relied on these vehicles and the fuel captured at the same time to advance. As for Marshal Rommel's attack on El Alamein in the summer of 1942, it was so fierce because the Axis forces had captured almost all of the British Eighth Army's vehicles, as well as enough fuel for three months, as well as large artillery and heavy weapons. During the two and a half years of fighting in North Africa, the German army supplemented 80% of its transport vehicles, 40% of its weapons and ammunition, 50% of its tanks, and 30% of its fuel with spoils captured from the anti-Axis forces.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatches received here today indicate that diplomatic figures in Washington all believe that Stalin will attend the next meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill to discuss global strategy. If President Roosevelt has no guarantee regarding efforts to invite Stalin to attend, Churchill would not dare to repeatedly express this wish in his speech in the United States, because the failure of such a meeting would only cause trouble for all parties involved.

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Ottawa, Canadian Defense Minister Ralston, accompanied by three officers, departed from Ottawa for Washington to participate in the Washington conference.

### Stalin Received Davies the Night Before Last

Ankara, 21st (Central News Agency) - Moscow Radio announced: Stalin received President Roosevelt's special envoy, Davies, in the Kremlin last night. Soviet Foreign Minister Molotov and US Ambassador General Standley were also present.

Moscow, 21st (Central News Agency) - US Presidential Envoy Davies visited Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov on the 20th and held talks. When he met with reporters beforehand, he said: I was sent here only as an envoy, so I am completely unaware of the contents of President Roosevelt's personal letter to Chairman Stalin. It is expected that he will return to Washington after receiving Chairman Stalin's reply.

Geneva, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a German news agency citing London news, Soviet Ambassador to the United States Litvinov arrived in Tehran on Thursday and is heading to Moscow.

### Japanese Aircraft Bomb Port Moresby; US Navy Admits Bases on Two Islands Were Bombed; Japanese Air Force Has Advantage in Southwest Pacific

Buenos Aires, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the anti-Axis headquarters in the Southwest Pacific announced on the 21st that Japanese air forces heavily bombed Port Moresby on the night of the 20th.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: Yesterday's US Navy bulletin admitted that Japanese aircraft bombed US military bases on the islands of Guadalcanal and Russell again on the evening of May 18.

Lisbon, 21st (Central News Agency) - According to news from Washington, Colonel Smith, Chief of Staff of the US Fifth Air Force and Commander of the New Guinea Air Force, stated: The Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific has a two-to-one advantage compared to the anti-Axis Air Force in that area. The Japanese Air Force in New Britain has also doubled in the past five months.

### Soviet Union Concentrates Heavy Troops South of Moscow

Berlin, 20th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Eastern Front by German News Agency military correspondent Colonel Hammer, the Soviet Union is continuing to concentrate heavy troops south of Moscow. It is reported that in the area of Kursk, the Soviet Union is working hard to concentrate infantry and tank divisions. In addition, artillery units are also being concentrated. It seems that the Soviet Union has completed its preparations for the summer offensive, because the German army is pressing very hard on the Orel front, which will endanger Moscow, so the Soviet army will soon implement a counter-offensive plan.

### Differences in Tactical Thinking Between Japanese and British Navies (2)

— Masanori Ito

(6) The So-Called "Annihilation" by Japanese Admirals

Japanese admirals not only want to start battles early, but also, based on the demands of the operational plan, which is the foundation of tactics, they mainly decide to implement deployments with the aim of first cutting off the enemy's retreat. However, sometimes they will rapidly deploy to the southwest, and continue south, encircling the enemy from the rear in a combat formation. Therefore, a right-flank deployment at 5:55 is best, and a right-flank deployment at 6:07 (when the position and direction of the German main force can be slightly discerned) is decisive. At 5:55, the enemy ships had not yet been seen, and there was a lot of sea haze, so the admiral who was worried about torpedo attacks would have felt some hesitation. However, if the goal is to annihilate the enemy, there should be absolutely no hesitation.

Please look at Marshal Togo of the Japanese Sea! Please look at Chief of Staff Kato! What strategy did Admiral Togo use to face the sea battle? As most readers know, it was "annihilation." The United States Navy also likes this word, and uses the word "Annihilation" to define the tactical objective. But they only know how to talk about it on paper. Marshal Togo actually demonstrated this word in the Sea of Japan. The problem comes down to what to pay the price of "annihilation" with.

Marshal Togo was prepared to sacrifice most of our fleet to achieve this. This is the most important determination for a general facing a decisive battle. The word "wisdom and courage" can be said to exist to describe the attitude of a general in this situation. The wisdom to defeat the enemy also requires many excellent staff officers, but the tactic of "being able to sacrifice most of our fleet" is a decision that only the general can make alone. The commander is solely responsible for all losses. So he commands the entire army on the premise of judging how much sacrifice is acceptable.

Commander-in-Chief Togo Heihachiro, although he did not explicitly state the number of battleships to be sacrificed from the six capital ships, or the number of pre-dreadnought battleships (armored cruisers) from the six, it was certain that he would resolutely complete the goal of "annihilation," even if it meant a great sacrifice.

(Note) Regarding this matter, when the author met with Prime Minister Kato Tomosaburo (Chief of Staff during the Battle of Tsushima) who was recuperating in Yugawara in May 1923, I personally heard him explain that the two right-angle turns, which were the central tactics of that naval battle, were the naval battle strategy understood between Togo and Kato.

(7) No Risk, No Victory

Simple victory was not in Admiral Togo's eyes. He only had "annihilation." In the famous first naval battle report drafted by staff officer Akiyama Saneyuki (submitted to the Imperial General Headquarters, presented just before the naval battle), there is the sentence "The Combined Fleet will immediately sortie to annihilate it." This "annihilation" became the slogan in the headquarters of the flagship Mikasa, so Akiyama did not exaggerate much, but just recorded it. At that time, the word "extermination" was hardly used. "Annihilation" was being used in the same sense as a thorough and great victory, representing the great undertaking of a complete victory in a rare decisive battle. The sentence "To annihilate" was what aroused the martial spirit of 60 million citizens.

However, in order to annihilate, one's own side would also be sunk considerably. But if one worries about this, one cannot annihilate. One can only achieve a simple victory. If that is the case, then one can draw the conclusion that the Battle of Tsushima was a failure. — This was within Admiral Togo's expectations. To completely destroy the enemy fleet without losing one's own fleet is an extremely dangerous tactical idea, and will inevitably lead to losing the war. Sacrificing half of oneself to kill all of the enemy is the essence of a decisive battle, a tactical theory already established on the table. Implementing this tactic is limited to famous generals. If one sacrifices half of oneself and cannot defeat the enemy, it is a defeat. Believing in victory, believing in the tactics of victory, measuring the battle results and deploying troops to the battlefield is the virtue of a famous general. There is bound to be a certain degree of risk, and there will be considerable damage. Without the courage to take risks for victory and to accept damage for the overall situation, one cannot conduct a great decisive battle. Therefore, Admiral Togo was able to fight a decisive battle in the Sea of Japan, while Jellicoe could not fight a decisive battle in the Battle of Jutland.

Regarding the point of sacrifice, ordinary soldiers, let alone those who are ignorant of war, find it difficult to grasp the correct concept. When defeating the enemy, they immediately worry about their own losses. This is fine, but desires gradually increase, hoping to defeat the enemy without any losses, and soon this becomes what Schelieffen called the "cherished concept," mistaking victory as the norm. In this way, one can never achieve a great victory. This must be guarded against.

(8) Admiral Togo's Two Right-Angle Turns

Even if he suffered extremely great sacrifices, Admiral Togo's goal was to not let a single enemy ship escape. The few small warships that slipped through were due to unavoidable circumstances, but all of the excellent ship types below the capital ships had to be sunk. Admiral Togo went to the battlefield with such strategic objectives and determination. What had to be sunk was not the number of enemy ships, but all of the enemy ships. Jellicoe was different. His strategic objective was to drive the German fleet back to German ports. In other words, Jellicoe's first goal was to suppress the North Sea activities by blockading the German fleet, and the second goal was to inflict damage during engagements. His tactical thinking will be mentioned later, but the aforementioned objectives are completely opposite to Admiral Togo's goal of not letting a single enemy ship escape.

Therefore, Jellicoe's combat deployment prioritized safety as an absolute condition, trying not to be hit by a single German shell or torpedo. At 6:15 PM, this right-flank deployment (1) also involved engaging early, and (2) was a method of cutting off the enemy's retreat; however, Jellicoe deployed to the left, avoiding immediate contact with the enemy, and adopting a tactic of gradually pressing in from a distance, further delaying the time of engagement.

(Note) Beatty, Thomas, and Vice Admiral Burney of the right wing squadron, all expected a right-flank deployment before this moment.

Admiral Togo's famous two right-angle turns were exactly opposite to Jellicoe's on the diagonal. This is the natural result of the difference between the strategic objectives and tactical thinking mentioned above. However, this point alone is not enough to explain the deployment of the Japanese admiral. Even the simplest explanation requires the line, "A great determination to prepare one's own state of decisive battle while allowing the enemy to fire freely." This is what allowed the fleet sailing southwest to completely turn to the northeast in front of the enemy at 8,000 meters, to present a parallel battle formation. Our battleships, led by the flagship Mikasa, turned around a circle following the same course, with the axis of rotation only being a point. If the enemy concentrated fire on this point, they would have gained a certain advantage in hitting. On the contrary, the enemy did not fire when we turned, so the disadvantage is very clear.

As expected, the Mikasa and the ships following it were hit by several shells early on. But Admiral Togo, who had embraced this determination from the beginning, did not care. The reason for adopting this posture was to resolutely implement a diagonal parallel engagement, suppressing the bows of the enemy ships, in the decisive battle to annihilate the enemy's main force. Taking a little attack at the beginning was not a problem at all for the purpose of annihilation. Such a danger was considered a matter of course. From this, one can understand the vast difference with Jellicoe's deployment. (Xiao: Translated from the May issue of Chuo Koron... to be continued)

### Concerning Relief for the North China Famine: All Sectors Initiate Donation Drives; Warm-Hearted People of Shanghai, Concerned for the Plight of Famine Victims, Entrust Their Family-Held Bronze and Stone Inscriptions, Books, and Paintings to This Newspaper for Charitable Sale

Since news broke of the severity of the North China famine, people from all walks of life in this city have shown extraordinary concern, voluntarily offering assistance with great enthusiasm, and donating funds in large numbers in recent days. It is also heard that various trades in this city are currently initiating drives within their respective sectors to provide relief to North China refugees. Now, the culinary trade has begun soliciting donations in order to collect funds and entrust them to the Shanghai Office for North China Famine Relief. If trade associations can follow suit, raising a substantial sum should not be difficult.

Charitable Sale of Stone Classics

This newspaper received a letter yesterday from the master of the Stone Ink Building, which reads: "Respected Editor, calamities are bound to follow in the wake of war. The current disastrous famine in North China serves as proof. The words of the ancients have indeed been verified. I am but a salaried man. I came to Shanghai to escape conflict in the year of Wu Yin (1938), and have been unemployed for six years. I deeply regret my inability to donate due to my precarious existence. Having spent fifty years studying bronze and stone inscriptions, I have amassed tens of thousands of rubbings. Though half were lost in the aftermath of the incident (the war), rare editions and old Song and Ming rubbings still account for a tenth. These fleeting possessions, coupled with my declining years, make preservation difficult in these troubled times. It would be better to select items for charitable sale, using the proceeds to aid in famine relief, setting a precedent for collectors across the land. I am first selecting a complete set of the Ming-era rubbings of the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, totaling thirteen cases with over one hundred and twenty individually mounted rubbings, all complete and without damage. (If calculated at the current mounting price, including the rubbings themselves, it would cost no less than 30,000 silver dollars. The purchaser will certainly not lose out.) It was formerly in the collection of Mr. Fei Qi'ao. In the early Republic, he acquired it from Chun Ming for 2,000 yuan. The world places great value on Song-era printed books, but the Stone Classics were carved in the Tang Dynasty, far earlier than the Song Dynasty. They are the most reliable source for textual research. Therefore, in his postscript to the bronze and stone inscriptions in the Baoshu Pavilion, Mr. Zhu Zhuting (Zhu Yizun) highly praises the Kai Cheng Stone Classics, considering them far superior to the Jiaoben edition. This indicates the value of this edition. I now propose to entrust it to your esteemed publication with a reserve price of 5,000 silver dollars. All proceeds will be used for famine relief. If you agree, please send someone to my humble abode at No. 136, Lane 608, Yuyuan Road to retrieve it. After this edition is sold, I plan to select one or two other rare editions for continued charitable sale, contributing a small stream to the flood of aid. From Chen Boheng, Master of the Stone Ink Building." Furthermore, Mr. Pu Qiting has submitted a Han jade belt hook, and Mr. Rong Baiyun has submitted two large calligraphy scrolls by famous individuals, entrusting them for charitable sale, with all proceeds to benefit North China drought relief.

The aforementioned items for charitable sale, such as the Ming-era rubbings of the Tang Kai Cheng Stone Classics, are all exceptionally rare and valuable. If you wish to purchase them, this newspaper will gladly liaise with the owners on your behalf.

Donation of Flour for Relief

On the 19th, Minister Ding of the Ministry of Social Welfare, together with Mayor Chen, hosted prominent figures from the industrial and commercial sectors of this city to solicit opinions on fundraising. Representatives specially dispatched by the North China Association in Beijing and Shanghai appealed for assistance and planned to establish the Shanghai Office for North China Emergency Relief. Yesterday, Mr. Cai Runsen, through fundraising in the names of the Pude Charity Society and Lande Xuan, donated a truckload of No. 4 flour, totaling 680 bags, which has been gratefully acknowledged in a special letter from the Shanghai Office.

### Donations Received by This Newspaper Yesterday

### New Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, Arrived in Shanghai Yesterday; Will Exchange Views with Chinese and Foreign Authorities and Inspect the Embassy Office

Since assuming his post, the Japanese Ambassador to China, Tani Masayuki, has been extremely busy with diplomatic formalities. In order to exchange views with Chinese and foreign authorities in Shanghai and inspect the work of the Shanghai Japanese Embassy office, he arrived in Shanghai by train at 2:00 PM yesterday, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi, Secretary Shimizu, Secretary Terajima, Trustee Obata, and many others. Tani is expected to stay in Shanghai for three or four days before returning to Beijing.

Courtesies after Arrival in Shanghai

After arriving in Shanghai, Ambassador Tani, accompanied by Minister Horiuchi and Secretary Shimizu, visited Admiral Yoshida, Commander of the Japanese Fleet in China, at 3:30 PM. Additionally, Councilor Ota, an aide to the ambassador, visited the Special Mayor of Shanghai, the Japanese Naval Attaché Office, the Minister of the Army, the Head of the Military Police, the Commander of the Special Naval Landing Force, and other parties on behalf of the ambassador. The ambassador received a return visit from Admiral Yoshida at his residence at 4:50 PM. At 7:00 PM, he attended a banquet hosted by Admiral Yoshida at the Naval Attaché's residence.

Remarks to Reporters

Ambassador Tani also met with reporters at his residence in the Broadway Mansions at 4:00 PM to express his sentiments upon assuming office. Regarding the forceful promotion of policies toward China and other current issues, he stated: "What I felt after arriving in Nanjing was that I was also in Nanjing five years ago, in the spring of the 27th year of the Republic (1938). At that time, it was not long after the fall of Nanjing, and there were few residents, and machine gun emplacements remained in various places. However, this time, in Nanjing, the former machine gun emplacements have been replaced by bronze statues of Mr. Sun Yat-sen. The bloody atmosphere of the past has been completely eliminated, and a peaceful atmosphere prevails. In particular, third countries and even hostile forces that alienated China and Japan have recently been completely eradicated. Because the Empire is implementing a new policy toward China, the mutual trust and understanding between China and Japan is deepening, which is extremely gratifying. Deepening the trust and understanding between China and Japan is the key to future policy toward China, and Japan will make every effort to promote it. Before my previous visit to Shanghai, the power of Britain and the United States was still very strong, and the Greater East Asia War had not yet broken out. Britain and the United States often thought of protecting their own interests and obstructing Japan's operations. During this period, I tried to smooth over friction with the rights of third countries. After this process, the people of China and Japan finally discovered the true path to cooperation and moved forward together in the right direction. The new policy toward China is not another new policy, but a policy that eliminates illegal forces and builds on true righteousness. Since the Opium War of 1842, Britain and the United States have obtained concessions and other rights as bases for aggression in East Asia. In order to eliminate these British and American forces, Japan must take measures to preserve East Asia, and first abolish extraterritoriality, return concessions, and implement other policies necessary to strengthen the new China. This is the natural result of implementing the spirit of national founding in which all nations are in their proper place. Therefore, this new policy may rather be called a restoration policy or a true policy. China and Japan should thoroughly understand this fact and eliminate enemy propaganda, needless to say. During the Greater East Asia War, the Empire achieved brilliant victories, and the north and south of East Asia have now completed an impregnable line of defense. The current war is not only a military war, but must be waged with the total strength of all countries and nations in order to achieve final victory. The National Government is also making every effort to complete this goal and cooperate with Japan to complete the war. The important measures currently being taken by the governments of China and Japan are to strengthen the political power of the National Government, revitalize the Chinese economy, and stabilize the people's livelihood. This is merely a concrete plan based on the spirit of promoting the policy toward China. We will continue to strongly promote the policy toward China and fully review all aspects of the situation necessary to make every effort to promote the new policy."

### Commemorating Navy Day: Begins Yesterday; Central News Agency to Hold China-Japan Naval Symposium Today

The 27th of this month is the Japanese Navy Memorial Day. Various Chinese and Japanese public organizations in this city are celebrating this occasion by holding a grand series of commemorative activities for ten consecutive days, starting yesterday. Yesterday, eye-catching celebratory slogans and pictures were displayed in front of all movie theaters and company shops throughout the city, attracting the attention of passersby. The Shanghai branch of the Central News Agency will hold a China-Japan Naval Cooperation Symposium at the Cathay Hotel at 2:00 PM today. Colonel Kamada, Head of the Press Department of the Japanese Naval Fleet, Jiang Xiyuan, President of the Central Naval Academy, Huang Xun, Director of the Seamen Training Institute, and Tang Baohuang, Captain of the Haixing warship, have been invited to attend. It is expected that they will deliver great speeches and contribute to China-Japan naval cooperation.

### 36th Period Household Rice Ration: Available for Purchase Starting Today

The 665 designated rice shops in the International Settlement and the French Concession, as well as the rice distribution centers of each bureau, will simultaneously begin distributing the 36th period household rice ration today (the 22nd). Citizens with the 36th period coupon can purchase 1.5 sheng of white or brown rice and 0.5 sheng of broken rice for 6 yuan. Additionally, with the 36th period flour coupon, one jin of No. 2 flour can be purchased for 4.9 yuan. The rice ration period ends on the 30th; coupons will be invalid after this date.

First Phase of Coarse Grain Distribution in Western Shanghai

The first phase of coarse grain distribution of four packages in the first and second wards of Western Shanghai has been arranged by the district public sales office and will be distributed simultaneously by the 55 public sales outlets in the district starting yesterday. Each person can purchase one jin of broad beans with the district's eighth household flour coupon, priced at 1.9 yuan.

### Third Period Household Sugar: To Be Sold Within the Month; Prices Have Been Adjusted

After the sugar merchant cooperative began implementing sugar distribution by household, the third period of household sugar was originally scheduled to be distributed by Category A retailers with sugar coupons starting May 11. However, due to adjustments in sugar prices, the implementation was postponed. It is now understood that the sugar price adjustment is being reviewed by the military distribution authorities. After approval, they will consult with the Public Works Bureau and the Food Administration Bureau before issuing a public announcement and officially implementing the distribution. It is likely that this will be realized within the month. The cooperative has instructed all Category A retailers to properly store their existing sugar and not to sell it without authorization. Retailers will be fully responsible for any shortages.

### Oil Shops Skimp on Weight: Users Report and Sue

The Longtai Oil Shop at No. 291 Beishan West Road was found to be skimping on weight when selling household oil last Friday. Users Mr. Hu Sun, Mr. Zhu Kaiyong, and Mr. Lu Rongsheng discovered the discrepancy and reported it to the Huisi Police Station. Detective Wu Guang investigated and found that when the complainants went to buy oil, they had brought their own market scales. Mr. Hu Sun bought 13 jin and 8 liang of oil and was shorted 13.5 liang. Mr. Zhu Kaiyong bought 7 jin of oil and was shorted 8.5 liang. Mr. Lu Rongsheng bought 2 jin of oil and was shorted 2 liang. The shop assistant, Pu Amao from Nanxun, was arrested and sent to the First Special Court for questioning and detention. At the continued questioning yesterday morning, the police representative charged him with fraud, stating that because the price of cooking oil is high and the rationed quantity is insufficient, the accused skimped on weight, which is heinous and should be severely punished according to the law. Furthermore, the accused confessed at the police station that the shortage was on the orders of the shop owner, Wang Jimin, and the bookkeeper. Therefore, the police should detain Wang and the bookkeeper for questioning. The prosecutor requested a postponement, and Judge Peng ordered Pu Amao to be remanded in custody and rescheduled the hearing.

### China Merchants Steam Navigation Company: Adds New Routes on the Lower Yangtze River; Ten Purchased Riverboats Have Been Incorporated into Schedules

Since the restrictions on the transportation of goods have been eased, the transportation work of various shipping companies in this city has been busier than before. In order to meet this demand, the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company has not only added ships but also opened many new routes.

A Total of Ten Ships Added

Regarding the addition of ships, the company has recently purchased a total of ten ships, most of which were previously leased. They have now been incorporated into the schedules. Among them is one ship that was recently manufactured by the company, but it is currently under repair because it uses coal. It is estimated that these newly added ships will increase shipping capacity by thousands of tons. Some will be used to transport iron ore, while others will join transportation in the Zhenjiang-Wuhan area.

New Routes Opened in Wuhan and Zhenjiang

The new routes opened are as follows: (1) Hankou to Jinkou Town, (2) Hankou to Xintankou, (3) Hankou to Jiujiang, (4) Hankou to Xindi, (5) Jiujiang to Poyang Lake route in Nanchang (with ports of call at Hukou, Xingzi, Wucheng, Changyi Street, and Qiaoshe). The routes under planning are Zhenjiang to Yaojiaqiao, Zhenjiang to Xiaohekou, and Port to Xiaohe Town. Once this route is implemented, the connecting line to Jiangyin, Changzhou, and Wuxi will be shortened by thirty li.

### Family of Zhang Jinhai: Files Ancillary Civil Suit; Seeks Damages Totalling 510,000 Yuan

In the case of Zhang Jinhai's tragic death, the Second Special Court held a hearing on the morning of the day before yesterday. Because the investigative procedures of the Judicial Advisory Office and the police had not been completed, a request was made to postpone the hearing for ten days. Only witnesses Zhang Yuebo and Peng Shuanglong were questioned, and it was ordered that the hearing be rescheduled for the 31st. It is understood that the family of Zhang Jinhai, whose deceased was 19 years old this year, and was the heir of two lineages, died tragically. The damage claim portion of the ancillary civil suit is calculated up to the age of 60. A petition has been filed with the court requesting that defendants Li Xiuying, Shi Yuan, Zhu Songcheng, Zhu Shu, Zhou Ruiting, and Li Hongda jointly compensate 460,000 yuan in national currency, plus 50,000 yuan for funeral expenses, totaling 510,000 yuan.

### Municipal Authorities Focus on the Future of Citizens' Lives: Limit the Current Prices of Goods; Changes Require Permission

Recently, citizens have been anxious about their livelihoods. The municipal authorities have noticed this and recently taken the following measures: (1) The Municipal Bureau of Economic Affairs plans to restore the organization of the Price Appraisal Committee to specialize in evaluation work. However, before the committee is established, the selling prices at the end of last month will be taken as the maximum standard for various prices, except for those that have already been approved. If a business needs to raise prices due to legitimate reasons, it must first obtain approval from the Bureau of Economic Affairs; otherwise, it will be considered private price gouging. (2) The Municipal Chamber of Commerce has recently notified the various industry associations to instruct their member stores to abide by the price limits set by the Standing Bureau and not to deliberately violate them. All stores must adhere to the principle of considering both people's livelihood and business conditions and engage in legitimate business within the extent permitted by the authorities.

### Private Primary and Secondary Schools in This City Must All Register According to Law: Ministry of Education Directs Implementation

The Municipal Bureau of Education previously inquired with the Ministry regarding two issues: whether all private church schools in the settlements, which often delay registration procedures, should be allowed to maintain their current status or must register; and whether the registration certificates for private primary and secondary schools issued by the former Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Education before the National Government returned to the capital after the incident (the war) should be recognized. It is now understood that the Ministry of Education has issued separate instructions as follows:

Church Schools Should Register

(1) The report has been noted. The registration of private schools is the basis for private schools to obtain establishment and is a legally prescribed procedure. The fact that private church schools in the city have delayed registration procedures not only causes the establishment of schools to lose its basis but also clearly violates educational laws and regulations. It is extremely ignorant of the facts. They should still be clearly informed and ordered to abide by the amended Private School Regulations and complete the registration procedures within the time limit in order to ensure supervision and respect laws. Please comply accordingly.

Certificates Before Return to Capital Are Invalid

(2) The report has been noted. All private primary and secondary schools in the two settlements of the city after the incident (the war) and before the National Government returned to the capital have not applied for registration with the Ministry of Education of the then Reorganized National Government and the Municipal Bureau of Education. They should be ordered to fulfill the registration procedures. Please be informed.

It is heard that the Bureau of Education will instruct the city's primary and secondary schools to comply and earnestly rectify the registration procedures after receiving the order.

### Preparatory Meeting of Citizens' Consumer Cooperative to be Held Today

The Citizens' Consumer Cooperative was initiated by Wen Lanting, Yuan Lvdeng, and others. In view of the soaring prices of all goods in recent years, with no end in sight, everyone feels the hardship of a difficult life. The purpose is (1) to quickly exchange daily necessities so that members can enjoy the right to fair prices, not be affected by black market manipulation, and have a stable life; (2) to seek close cooperation between producers and consumers and to reduce the exploitation of middlemen and eliminate hoarding, so as to suppress and stabilize prices. This matter is of great importance, so it has been agreed to involve various industry associations to ensure that the association's affairs are conducted in a beneficial manner. The association is scheduled to hold a preparatory meeting in the auditorium of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce this afternoon (the 22nd). Representatives from various associations must attend to discuss the progress of the association's affairs.

Short Comment

### Personnel for Urgent Relief of North China Disaster Victims

Regarding the urgent relief work in North China, we consistently feel that all matters should be handled with absolute swiftness. This is because the disaster victims suffering from hunger are in a state of agonizing torment every moment. If our relief goods can arrive even a moment sooner, it will reduce their suffering by that moment. It is even highly probable that rescuing the majority of disaster victims on the verge of death can be achieved by expediting the process by mere moments.

Therefore, we urge the rapid establishment of an urgent relief organization with centralized authority. This organization should grasp unified power and be capable of agile function. The selection of its leaders must be based on integrity and probity, recognized and trusted by society. Time is pressing, and further delays are simply unacceptable. We hope that the Government and relevant authorities will swiftly lead the establishment and carefully select suitable personnel.

We have already stated that the majority of citizens in Shanghai possess compassion and sympathy for the disaster victims in North China. Therefore, the prospect of raising donations is very promising. This is sufficiently demonstrated by the fact that our newspaper received donations of 100,000 yuan and countless letters of sympathy within five days. However, with donations in hand, how can we ensure that every cent donated by the donors benefits the disaster victims fully? How can we live up to the enthusiasm of the donors and, at the same time, the hope of the disaster victims? Therefore, we advocate that the selection of personnel for distributing relief should be particularly focused on integrity. Representatives selected from the Shanghai North China Disaster Relief Organization will distribute relief on the ground. I recall that a respected scholar in a certain disaster relief association once said: "The task of distributing relief should be entrusted to 'poor scholars' because they possess the integrity of the poor, the morality of the poor, the experience of the poor, and, even more so, the bookish eccentricity of those who do not love gold and silver and do not give preferential treatment." These are the ideal talents for distributing relief in our view. It is a point worth raising first.

Beijing Correspondence

### The Problem of Rice Consumption in Beijing

— A Student

During the tenth-anniversary celebration of the Sino-German Society on May 4th, Director-General Wang Yintai once said, "Nowadays, even basic necessities like clothing, food, and shelter have become a problem." The fact that clothing, food, and shelter have become major challenges for Beijing is an undeniable reality, and the fact that the Director-General openly stated it indicates its severity.

Beijing, as an ancient city, may be considered one of the three most beautiful cities in the world, along with Rome and Paris, from an artistic and architectural perspective. However, its glory is built on artificial embellishments rather than natural development. It is a city situated in a semi-desert plain. Since the existence of humans, the so-called "Peking Man," 200,000 years ago, the vitality of the land has long been depleted, and economic resources are, in reality, quite limited. In normal times, its prosperity is entirely supported by forces from all corners of the world. However, these are no longer normal times.

Beijing's grain supply has always been reliant on other regions. In the past, the Grand Canal brought rice from Jiangnan to the subjects under the Emperor's feet. Since the opening of maritime transport, Australian flour, and white rice from Annam, Siam, and Burma have been poured into the city in unknown quantities every year. Even after the July 7th Incident, the continued existence of maritime transport prevented it from suffering too greatly. However, since December of the year before last, this ancient city has been stranded in a desert, completely isolated from the outside world. Consequently, the grain problem has become more and more severe day by day. Furthermore, due to the machinations of hoarders, even upper-class families are starting to worry.

At the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, rice was less than 100 yuan per bag, and even at the end of last year, it was only around 200 yuan. However, everything skyrocketed after the Lunar New Year. Now, it is over 550 yuan per bag. Even the most inferior coarse grains, which contain ingredients such as peanut shell powder, tree bark powder, and bean cake powder previously used to feed pigs, are priced at 1.7 or 1.8 yuan per jin. An individual needs at least two jin of grain per day, which amounts to 3 or 4 yuan for grain alone, not including other expenses. If they have family responsibilities, the difficulties are even more unimaginable. However, the economic strength of the general population has not only not increased but has decreased. Because there are cutbacks everywhere, and in the situation where it is impossible to find jobs, they have no other choice but to accept low salaries and endure hunger. As a result, they can only attempt to economize on living expenses. The primary method of economizing is reducing the number of servants. On average, where they could previously afford seven servants, they now only employ one. But how can they cope with only one? Now, they are taking on multiple tasks themselves and also have to change from three meals to two meals, or even just eat the coarsest grains to make thin gruel. Those who could never afford servants in the past now have no choice but to entrust their lives to death. We can see many news stories about men of letters and scholars starving to death in the newspapers. However, while men of letters and scholars have obituaries in the newspapers, ordinary people who starve to death only receive the averted noses of passersby. Last year, a famous professor once righteously declared, "Whether good or bad, there's always a way to get by. It's impossible for anyone to starve to death in this world. I've never heard of anyone starving to death!" Now, facts speak louder than eloquence, and not long ago, I heard this same famous professor sigh dejectedly, "What to do? Are we going to starve to death?"

The North China Common Bureau has indeed made great efforts to find a solution to this serious grain problem. The Emergency Price Countermeasures Committee of last year, the Material and Price Handling Committee of this year, and the Price Cooperation Committee were also established due to the objective environmental needs. News of the punishment of unscrupulous merchants can often be seen in the newspapers. However, the consciences of the unscrupulous merchants are black, their wills are iron, and they do not have the slightest fear as a result. In February of this year, because hoarders spread rumors that the currency systems of the North and South would soon merge, gold prices soared temporarily, rising from 540 yuan per tael to 900 yuan in a single day, and then to over 1,600 yuan within two weeks. Moreover, this was just the listed price; in reality, it was impossible to buy at that price. The price of gold on the black market exceeded the 2,000 yuan mark. Later, Director-General Wang issued a declaration stabilizing the price of the joint currency, bringing it back down to around 1,000 yuan for the listed price. However, Director-General Wang's "Southern Rice Transported North" statement issued from Nanjing did not cause grain prices to fall. The authorities are indeed constantly making efforts to address the grain problem. The two porridge kitchens established by the Ministry of Internal Affairs in the eastern and western cities have saved many lives. Distributing seven or eight jin of grain per person at a low price each month, although not a major solution, is at least a small supplement for the citizens. The import of Manchurian and Mongolian mixed grains and the northbound transport of wheat from Su, Huai, Yu, and northern areas are all under negotiation. In addition, the North China Material and Price Committee announced on May 5th that merchants should report their grain reserves, "advising merchants with grain reserves exceeding half a year's consumption for their households to promptly report the types and quantities of their reserves so that relevant authorities can purchase their surplus at appropriate prices for fair distribution." Furthermore, the newspapers also contain articles every day advising merchants to sell their grain. However, it is hard to say how effective these articles will be. In recent days, the newspapers have added the words "Again Drops" to the headline "Grain Prices Fall" every day. However, when you take the newspaper with the headline "Grain Prices Fall Again" to a grain store and ask, rice is still 3.2 yuan per jin, and millet is 2.4 yuan per jin. What is most noteworthy is that the price of the grain allocated each time is higher than the previous time. The price of flour was 8 jiao per jin last time, but this time it has increased to 1.2 yuan. However, the efforts of the authorities have at least stabilized grain prices and prevented them from soaring again. From the time Director-General Wang went to Nanjing to negotiate the northern transport of southern rice to the present, the fluctuation in grain prices has been limited. This must be considered a success for the Common Bureau.

It is said that millet in Zhangjiakou is only worth 3 mao per jin, and rice from Jiangnan is worth 700 storage certificates per bag. If the obstacles to maritime transport have cut off the foreign grain supply to the ancient city, modern transportation lines can transport rice from Jiangnan to Beijing within 48 hours, saving the 2.5 million dying citizens. However, Cheng Shijun, Director of the Highway Bureau of the Construction General Office, who was sent to Nanjing by Director-General Wang to discuss the grain problem in North China, arrived in Nanjing on April 21st. As soon as he got off the train, he felt unwell and was taken to the Central Hospital for treatment. On April 27th, his condition worsened, and he passed away (see the April 30th *Shibao*). Could this be an omen for the future of the Beijing grain problem? (May 16th)

### Education and Nurturing

— Yu Huairui

Chinese people's concepts of children have always focused on nurturing while neglecting education. In other words, they only seek quantity and disregard quality. Therefore, they consider it the supreme happiness and glory to have a house full of children and grandchildren while they are alive, and to have a long list of names printed on the obituary after their death. Thus, for thousands of years, "five generations under one roof" has been universally recognized as the most "honorable" thing. As for the children's future achievements in scholarship and career, their ability to serve society and the community, or even whether they have the qualifications to be a "person," all these questions are simply ignored. Although the Chinese people often proudly boast about their "large population," they are often inferior to other countries with smaller populations in everything. Neglecting education while nurturing children is the biggest reason for this. Therefore, our concept of children should value quality over quantity, and education over nurturing. Mr. Lu Xun said, "China needs parents of people, not parents of children." These words are truly incisive.

In recent years, due to the import of progressive ideas and the advocacy of those engaged in children's education in the country, many parents have gradually begun to pay attention to the issue of education. This is a welcome phenomenon. However, there is still a need to explore the methods of education.

In China, the position of parents has always been considered inviolable and dignified, so it is very

This is a wrong approach. You need to know that a child is a tender bud. It is certainly not a good idea to let him grow and perish on his own like weeds. But putting it indoors, tying it up with ropes and wires, only fertilizing it, and hoping that it will grow according to the form you like, will definitely make it lifeless, and may even die halfway. Because buds have their own personality, and they not only need fertilization, but also sunlight and rain! Therefore, experienced gardeners never force buds to grow according to a certain form, except for giving them the necessary sunlight and rain. They only let it develop freely according to the bud's personality. They understand that the gardener's responsibility is only to remove things that hinder the bud's growth, such as weeds. Only in this way can the buds be lush and prosperous, blooming and bearing fruit. Therefore, if parents hope that their children will achieve something in the future, they should remove the traditional coat of parents, use love as sunlight, and a patient and persuasive attitude as rain, to be a gardener who supports and cultivates this tender bud!

### A Record of Applying for a Job at the Bank of Communications

— Failed

I took a university diploma and hurried to the destination to register. A kind of inexplicable fantasy immediately crept into my mind, "If I get accepted, then I must make good use of my first month's salary to make a new dress; no, buy a new pair of leather shoes; oh! I should send it to Mom."

"Who introduced you? High school or university?" The clerk asked.

"Who introduced me!" I suddenly dodged. I thought I didn't have anyone to introduce me. I just had a friend call me and tell me that the Bank of Communications was recruiting probationary staff members, and the qualification was a university degree, and told me I might as well try it.

"Here, you are not allowed to register without an introduction."

I hurriedly used the telephone to inquire about the friend who told me the news, it was thanks to his kindness that he came up with a way for me to pull a "introducer", so I proudly walked into the "Probationary Staff Registration Office again."

"Who introduced you, high school or university?" The clerk still asked in a bland manner.

"I was introduced by ×××, university graduate" Then I presented my university diploma, which I thought was satisfactory, and exchanged it for a list, I carefully filled it out one by one, and after seeing that there were no mistakes, I boldly handed it in, it seems that there is no registration fee, I felt relieved, I thought "After all, it is a big bank, it doesn't even charge for these paper expenses."

"Still missing three photos."

That's terrible, where can I get three photos, even if I go to take them, it's probably too late, but, I can't do it without photos, there's no choice, I had to run to the photo studio and ask him to take three expedited photos, "Passport photos are the fastest" So I got three photos that seemed like myself and handed them in, probably because the photos were too bad, the clerk looked at me carefully for two minutes, finally he gave me a "physical examination form", one of which was "The doctor's physical examination fee of seven yuan and five jiao is to be borne by the applicant."

"Seven yuan and five jiao" I looked at these four words, and reached into my pocket, luckily, I had two five-yuan bills and four single-yuan bills in my pocket, that was enough, I hid it from my family and went to check my body, waited in the doctor's office for a half hour, fortunately they called my name, I walked into the "examination room", and saw a "probationary member" taking off his clothes to check his lungs, the nurse told me to weigh myself, "So light, only one hundred and two pounds," "That's wrong, that's wrong! I weighed myself in Wing On Company and had one hundred and ten pounds." "I wanted to make my weight appear heavier, but the nurse still only agreed to write the record of one hundred and two pounds on the card. I started to take off my shirt, I was really scared, first because the weather was still cold, I really couldn't stand it; second, it was really ugly to take it off and be as thin as a rib, but, I still had to take it off anyway, from the doctor's facial expression, it seemed that he was not very satisfied with my body, he asked me if I coughed? Have you been sick? My answer was nothing, I argued that my body was very good.

Three days later, I received a notice allowing me to take the exam, I was so happy, so I prepared my lessons according to the exam schedule, I read economics and thought about commercial arithmetic, I read accounting and thought about Chinese, I was really anxious, I finally waited until three in the afternoon, a Chang car sent me to the entrance of Tatung University, I slowly walked in, it was still twenty minutes away from one thirty, the examination room seemed to be "full", I looked around, old and young were different; there were spirited ones; there were passable ones; there were those talking in English; there were also those taking advantage of the last minute. The first exam, foreign language, seemed easy, correction, self-recommendation letter, translation, composition and other questions, the second exam, commercial arithmetic, had several questions on big algebra and trigonometric topics, I studied commerce, things I had never encountered in four years, I didn't expect to meet them today, they looked easy, but I couldn't do them successfully, it was really ridiculous, the next day, I cheered up and took the exam again, Chinese two questions: one was composition and one was official document, I didn't know whether they were good or bad, then came economics and accounting, maybe it was because I studied this subject, it seemed easier than others.

How many university students will be accepted in a classroom? I started to doubt, sure enough, a "test character No. not listed page" notice finally appeared in front of my eyes, I dejectedly went to collect that university diploma that I thought was precious, I walked along, and reached into my pocket, the central storage certificates in my pocket were obviously much less, ah! "Trying to steal a chicken but losing the rice used as bait."

### Anecdotes of the Japanese Navy

— Oshita Utarō

(3) Progress of Airplanes

On the parade ground in Yoyogi, hordes of people gathered to watch the excitement.

On this day, December 14th, Meiji 43 (1910), Captain Hino piloted a Grade Plateau-style airplane in the Japanese sky.

The engine adjustments had already taken up most of the day, from morning until 10:00 a.m. It slowly began to slide on the grass. A gust of crosswind blew and the airplane tumbled over, the wingtip supports breaking. Thus, they spent five more hours repairing it, and at 3:00 p.m. they began to slide again. The spectators roared. European electric. The airplane went faster than a car, but only on the ground. The spectators said:

"The airplane from the legends seems even faster!"

"Indeed, a very good thing, isn't it? Even cars probably can't compare!"

Amid the spectators' various discussions, the sliding gradually went smoothly. The aircraft finally lifted off the ground and ascended (though only one meter high). After flying like that for 30 meters, a thunderous cheer erupted and lasted for a long time. But the airplane was again hit by a crosswind, fell to the ground, and the supports broke again. Later, it was said that it was repaired again, ascended to a height of ten meters, and flew for about 60 meters. The next year, there was great progress. Captain Tokugawa piloted a Plélia airplane back and forth between Tokorozawa and Kawagoe, taking 32 minutes and 45 seconds to fly across a distance of 39.3 kilometers. The next day, he flew once more from the same place, but this time he did not return to Tokorozawa. He crashed in a mulberry field near Kawagoe. Four years later, in Taisho 5 (1916), the Naval Air Corps appeared. Subsequent progress was much faster than before. There were no more airplanes that could be blown over by crosswinds. It could even make transoceanic bombings in the vast open sky. The struts would no longer break. With the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the airplanes of the Imperial Army and Navy flew back and forth in the vast Pacific Ocean as if it were an everyday occurrence. In the future, perhaps there will be progress to the point where one can go anywhere at will. If airplanes with a carrying capacity of 2,000 tons and a range of 9,000 miles can be successfully manufactured, one can seize control of the Pacific Ocean simply by using airplanes. At that time, airplanes will of course no longer need runways and will even be able to stop and moor anywhere in the air at will.

According to American propaganda, stratospheric flight is currently under research, and there are plans to use very good large aircraft, carrying smaller aircraft to come and bomb Japan, which is steadily progressing. Also, according to newspaper reports, Germany is manufacturing airplanes to cross the Atlantic and bomb New York and Washington.

However, we are not afraid. We will protect Japan. We should follow the Navy's slogan in air defense training: "Train as if in real combat, and treat real combat as training." If incendiary bombs fall, we will treat these incendiary bombs as enemy soldiers landing on our own soil. These enemy soldiers are violent slaves wielding flamethrowers and hand grenades. And we, on our honored Japanese soil, will not allow enemy soldiers to stay for even a moment. On the front lines, our fathers, brothers, and sons are bleeding, stepping over corpses, and fighting to the death against the same brutal enemies. And in the rear, the Japanese people also have the same fighting will.

A certain Navy lieutenant commander said:

"We only think about defeating the enemy on the battlefield. We leave everything in the rear to you all."

That's right, there's no need to be an alarmist. Just fulfill your responsibilities in the rear and that will be enough. (Translated by the Wing from the *Western Asahi Shimbun*)

### Night Watch Jottings

— This Person

Three days ago, I received a notice to stand guard as a member of the Self-Defense Corps. After briefly considering it, I decided to go on guard duty myself. Some people said that based on your position, you can apply for an exemption, but I don't intend to try to obtain this convenience at present. As for why I resolutely went on guard duty this time, to put it nicely, in the city of Shanghai under the wartime system, standing guard as a member of the Self-Defense Corps is a duty that every citizen should fulfill; but in reality, I am merely going on guard duty with a sense of trying it out.

The day for guard duty arrived. The time was from 6:00 p.m. to 9:00 p.m. I ate dinner early and reported to the Lianbao Office on time. My left arm had to be fitted with a dust- and stain-covered Self-Defense Corps armband, my left shoulder was diagonally slung with a grass-green cloth band with a police whistle hanging on it and a bundle of hemp rope tied to the lower end, and my right hand was holding a short stick commonly used by street patrolmen. Dressed like this, I strode towards the assigned Post No. 22.

The guard post was actually a wooden cage with a volume of three feet square inside. It was fitted with glass windows all around so that you could see in all directions. When I pulled open the door and stepped into the cage, I found that the floor was full of sunflower seed shells and cigarette butts. This suggests that the cage life of several pioneers was quite leisurely and comfortable. Originally there was a thin board inside to sit on, but unexpectedly the board had been stolen, so I had to stand straight and look out. The predecessors were careless, and the successors suffered, and I couldn't help but feel a hint of resentment.

Across the road stands a ×× Palace, all the facade walls newly painted with a layer of vermilion paint: less than a few feet to the left, there is a majestic ×× Palace, the facade walls are also newly decorated, this is a large piece of golden paint. These two Taoist palaces have renovated their facades, shining brightly together, but the purpose is to attract business. This posture of grabbing business is the same as the ordinary shops that hang large bargain flags, which are as vulgar. Look, a large "Tao" character is clearly installed on the gate of the ×× Palace, which clearly shows that they have a great way to make money. At this time, I remembered that I had never seen monks or Taoists on guard duty in the Self-Defense Corps, which was a bit puzzling. Maybe monks and Taoists have belonged to people outside the world since ancient times, and now they should be different from ordinary citizens in complying with the wartime system?

When several rickshaws carrying a young couple side by side drove by, I saw an old beggar with tattered clothes running after the people in the car, begging for alms, really chasing the car desperately. This posture of making a living is really not surprising, think about it, at a time when prices are rising endlessly, who is not desperately struggling on the hunger line? Therefore, if it is said that the life of a beggar is pitiful, then how can the life of our ordinary people not be pitiful! The difference between them is only fifty steps and a hundred steps. If it is said that the life of a beggar is despicable, let's not talk about people in other classes. Just take the officials that everyone envies as an example, then please read Zong Chen's "Letter to Liu Yizhang," and you will know that the life of officials is also begging for things by running around and prostrating. This has been the case since ancient times, and it is even more so now!

Who said that three hours would slip by easily like a wisp of smoke? I stood straight, standing, and finally felt twinges of soreness in my legs! Fortunately, I used to be a teacher for a few years, and I always stood in the classroom for three or four hours every day, so these legs can be said to have been quite trained; at the same time, I originally had a spirit of trying it out this time, and I was quite able to endure all kinds of discomforts. Therefore, I finally spent three hours in the cage by gritting my teeth. At nine o'clock, I couldn't wait to jump out of the guard post to cancel my duty, just like a caged bird flying out of the cage into the sky. At this time, my body and mind were full of the pleasure of freedom!

### Bonsai Exhibition

— Tangdi

Bored on a long day, I drove to the YMCA on Eight Immortals Bridge to view the bonsai exhibition. The venue was located in the library on the second floor; there were hundreds of bonsai, large and small. The pots were no more than a foot wide, yet they contained picturesque landscapes with staggered pavilions and uniquely creative designs. Chen Meiqing's pines and cypresses, for example, retained their natural beauty. Kong Zhiqing's "Misty Rain," "Immortals Celebrating Longevity," and "Ancient Cypress Reaching the Sky" were meticulously painted. How could one achieve this without the skill of an experienced craftsman? There was also a "Mountain Dwelling Picture" that resembled the style of Tang Yin. Shou Juan was known for his expertise in cultivating ancient trees, and his submissions this time were indeed masterpieces. Zhuo Duo's bonsai made from waste paper surprisingly had a vibrant charm, unique to the entire venue. Peng Juzhou's "Withered Wood Mandarin Ducks" had old branches coiling out from the stone crevices; "Elixir Attaining the Ninth Heaven" featured a single branch extending diagonally from a pottery gourd, displaying ingenious creativity. Several grotesque rocks by Huang Jingwan and Zi Shuyu were either lying down or standing like swords, with various imposing shapes. "A Corner of Guilin" and "Layered Peaks Soaring Green" showcased majestic mountains, rarely seen in post-war Shanghai. As for the Xu brothers, Zihua and Ziling, known for their rocks and stones, their submissions this time, such as "Jiang Village Enjoying Summer" and "Night Tour of Red Cliff," were not only structurally novel but also carefully considered color harmony, making people feel refreshed and delighted. The largest piece in the entire venue was "Blessed Land," with a two-foot-tall ancient cypress emerging gracefully from the stone crevices, undoubtedly the result of long-term effort. In the mountain cave, an old Taoist sat quietly with a whisk, making viewers feel a desire to escape the mundane world. In short, the quality and quantity of the exhibits this time were more advanced than the previous one, living up to the YMCA's aim of promoting refined entertainment. It is said that from today, the YMCA will not charge admission for the three-day exhibition, and the proceeds from the sale of flowers and scenery will be used to provide loans to small farmers and aid drought relief in North China.

### Brief Remarks

— Qi

Don't often engage in empty talk; first, you must study whether you can do something.

Don't often ask others to do things that you cannot do yourself.

Don't often make sarcastic remarks; too much sarcasm will affect your physical health.

Don't be too selfish; if others were as selfish as you, it would be unimaginable.

Don't often exaggerate your abilities; truly capable people don't boast about themselves.

Don't attack people behind their backs; know that this behavior is despicable.

Don't be too jealous of others; it will cause inner anxiety. (With Gratitude)

### Simple Treatment for Severe Colds

— Huang Jimei

Dr. Ding Huikang recently gave a lecture on the treatment of severe colds at the Baojia Youth Department. The method is extremely simple. It is said that those suffering from severe colds only need to completely open the south-facing window when sleeping at night, while all east, west, and north-facing windows must be closed. Sleeping like this until dawn will immediately cure the severe cold. Even if the cough is severe the night before, it will be completely eradicated by morning. The more severe the cold, the more effective the treatment, and Mr. Ding guarantees and takes responsibility for it. When we heard Mr. Ding's treatment for severe colds, we couldn't help but burst into laughter, thinking that no member would believe such a treatment. However, unfortunately, three days after listening to Mr. Ding's treatment, I actually caught a severe cold. At this time, I wanted to try the treatment that Mr. Ding told us about. But on the second day, the severe cold not only didn't get better but became even worse. I decided to experiment with Mr. Ding's treatment to see if it was effective. I made up my mind and followed Mr. Ding's method as soon as evening came. Surprisingly, when I woke up at dawn, the severe cold I had was indeed completely cured. This simple and effective method is worth recommending.

### Pay Attention to Public Park Lawns

— Xu Wancheng

Recently, due to grass planting, walking on the lawns in various parks has been prohibited. Signs have been posted saying "Do Not Walk on the Lawn," and ropes have been used to block them off. Chinese people generally do not pay attention to public morality. Even with thick ropes and signs saying "Do Not Walk on the Lawn," there are still people who violate the "park rules." When Chinese police try to dissuade them, they often refuse to listen, leading to foreigners slapping them. It is heartbreaking to hear about. I hope that tourists will be more respectful in the future.

### All Sectors Aid Teacher Zhou

After this newspaper published an article yesterday about an elementary school teacher coughing up blood and seeking help, enthusiastic people from all walks of life have sent letters expressing sympathy and donating medical expenses, including: (1) Mr. Chen Chongyuan, the abdominal fruit manufacturer from the Tongzhou Food Company, donated 500 yuan. (Mr. Chen recently organized a small teaching, production, sales, economic, and credit cooperative to benefit small teaching staff.) (2) A reader of Shenbao sent a membership card for the Kangjian Insurance Clinic, hosted by medical doctor Zhou Shouxiang, providing free treatment for one year. (3) 257 yuan from teachers and students of the Far East Elementary School. (4) 200 yuan from students of grades four and six of the Mibo First Elementary School. (5) 100 yuan from an anonymous person at the Yeda Bank. (6) 50 yuan from Mr. Mingyin. (7) 20 yuan from Mr. Ma Junjing. (8) 10 yuan each from anonymous people from the Anren Hermitage, totaling 1,147 yuan. All of these will be transferred to Mr. Zhou, and we express our gratitude on his behalf. In addition, the Shanghai Civilian Lung Disease Hospital on Hongqiao Road sent a letter offering to admit Mr. Zhou, waiving all medical expenses and only charging for meals. We also express our gratitude.

Also, Mr. Qiao Tianqing sent 100 yuan yesterday to help Mr. Yingqi, which has been forwarded immediately. Thank you.

Seeking Remittances My relative, Mr. Feng, is currently in Ganzhou and urgently needs remittances for assistance. If there are any Shanghai banks or shops that can remit to that area, please send a letter to the Social Services section of Shenbao. Thank you very much, Huang Jiesun.

Medical Lecture On the 23rd (Sunday) at 2 PM, Dr. Liang Junqing, a medical doctor who studied in Germany, will give a lecture at Jing'an Temple on general knowledge of vaccinations. Citizens are welcome to attend.

### How to Adjust the Organization of the Business Control Association

The organization of the lower-level institutions of the Business Control Association, namely the major commodity trade associations and federations of trade associations, is progressing vigorously. Among the 50 trade associations, 10 associations, including the Cotton Association, have been established. On the 18th, the Municipal Government announced the initiators designated by the Industry Department for 16 trade associations. It is heard that the authorities will continue to appoint initiators in the future. Therefore, the overall adjustment of the organization of the Business Control Association is becoming more important and is of concern to all parties. To strengthen the Business Control Association, the following points should be noted:

(1) Emphasize the Second Phase of Organization Work Because the new economic policy needs to be implemented quickly, the organizational structure of the Business Control Association is being organized from top to bottom (i.e., from the board of directors and supervisors to the federation, and from the federation to the trade association). However, after this work is completed, the second step should be to strengthen the organization from the bottom up. The Business Control Association is not a government-controlled organization but should have the nature of a self-governing organization. Therefore, the structure must be readjusted to ensure that the upper-level institutions fully absorb the intentions of the lower-level trade associations.

(2) The Relationship Between the Business Control Association and the Industry and Food Departments The Business Control Association is naturally subject to the guidance and supervision of the competent government departments, the Industry Department and the Food Department. However, the current reorganization of the trade associations, from top to bottom, with designated initiators, is directly guided by the two departments, and the Business Control Association itself is hardly involved. To strengthen control in the future, many parties advocate that the reorganization of the federations and trade associations should be implemented based on the creativity and responsibility of the Business Control Association itself. First, the National Government should select the board of directors and supervisors from the financial circles in the concession, and then the lower-level trade associations should re-elect them in an autonomous manner. In particular, the directors and supervisors of the lower-level federations and trade associations must be re-elected purely by the trade associations.

(3) Adjust the Relationship Between the Industry and Food Departments in Guiding the Business Control Association According to the nature of the major commodities, the Business Control Association is guided by the Industry Department and the Food Department respectively. Among the major commodities, some, such as oil, have the dual properties of food and industrial raw materials. There are many such commodities, which can easily cause friction between the trade associations under the Food Department and the Industry Department. It is hoped that this can be rationally adjusted.

(4) The Relationship Between the Industry Department and the Shanghai Municipal Economic Bureau Most of the work of designating the initiators of the federations of trade associations is handled by the Industry Department itself. The registration of the associations and other matters are handled by the Municipal Economic Bureau, which maintains contact with the Materials Control Bureau of the Public Works Department to handle the reorganization of the associations. This transitional method of dual supervision should be corrected quickly and unified under the supervision of the Municipal Economic Bureau.

(5) The Relationship Between the Trade Associations and the Federations of Trade Associations The lower-level institutions of the Business Control Association and their joint organizations, which are organized from top to bottom, should be re-established from the bottom up. This is the opinion of various powerful trade associations.

(6) The Relationship Between the Business Control Association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce The Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which has a long history, has become a commercial forum and even a commercial social organization. It does not conflict with the Business Control Association in terms of parallel and dual guidance. However, the future focus of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce's work must be clearly defined, and its practical activities must be guided.

In short, the establishment of the organization of the Business Control Association is not yet complete. To establish a truly autonomous organization that can unleash the power of national capital based on autonomy and creativity, further efforts are still needed in the future.

### Under the Jurisdiction of the Food Department Six Trade Associations Established

Yesterday (the 21st) at 4 PM, Tang Shoumin, Chairman of the National Business Control Association, and Wen Lanting, Supervisor, held a tea party on the eighth floor of the Jinmen Hotel to welcome the establishment of the six trade associations under the jurisdiction of the Food Department. They also invited Gu Baoheng, Minister of Food, and the directors, section chiefs, and bureau chiefs of the department to attend. Chairman Tang first delivered an opening speech,

mainly saying that the six trade associations under the jurisdiction of the Food Department and the six trade associations in the Shanghai region were able to exert their utmost efforts in the shortest possible time to make it a reality, thanks to the effective supervision of Minister Gu and his subordinate officials. He expressed his gratitude. He then said that the six industries are deeply and closely related to the future of the people's food, and we should promote the spirit of control to seek the stability of the people's food. Finally, he said that if any of the industries believes that the current control laws and regulations are not suitable for commercial conditions, as long as they do not violate the meaning of control, they can state the reasons and make suggestions to the government. He also hoped that the federations of trade associations would pay attention to advising members of the trade associations not to engage in speculative hoarding, which would cause public criticism.

Minister Gu's Speech

He was extremely pleased with the sincere cooperation of the industry leaders in the past two months, which achieved satisfactory results. He also explained the changes in the control mechanism and hoped that the industry would understand the government's intentions. He said that the trade associations and federations of trade associations that have been established should not be mistaken as interest groups of Xutong. They should strive to benefit the country, the nation, and the future of the lumber industry, based on the spirit of national economy, government, and self-reliance of merchants, and fulfill the mission of the Greater East Asia War.

Director Ji of the Food Department's Shanghai Office

First explained the establishment of the various trade associations and federations of trade associations, and elaborated on the different responsibilities and tasks of people's organizations today and in the past. His interpretation of legal meaning was exquisite. Subsequently, representatives of the six industries stood up one after another to express their love and willingness to work together to complete this arduous mission.

### Japanese Side Establishes Central China Soap Control Association

The soap control mechanism was originally planned to be a joint Chinese-Japanese organization. However, due to various reasons, the original plan was changed, and both the Chinese and Japanese sides established control mechanisms separately, both directly under the jurisdiction of the Business Control Association.

The Japanese soap industry, in accordance with the instructions of the embassy authorities on May 6, disbanded the past soap-related associations and decided to prepare for the establishment of the Central China Soap Control Association (Chinese name: Central China Soap Control Association). The eight major firms, including Japan Oil and Fat First Industrial Pharmaceutical, Maeda Yoko, Shanghai Oil and Fat Industry, Mitsui Yoko, Mitsubishi Corporation, Daimaru Yoko, and Idemitsu Kosan, were appointed as organizers and have already prepared. The inaugural meeting was held at the Japanese Club at 2 PM on the 19th. At this point, the lower-level institutions of the soap sector within the Business Control Association have been established.

At the inaugural meeting, after the Commercial and Industrial Section Chief of the Embassy Office, Mr. Tokunaga (representative), performed the full salute, the chairman was elected, the preparatory process was reported, the articles of association were reviewed, and the directors and supervisors were elected. Then the chairman delivered a speech, and Mr. Tokunaga, Commercial and Industrial Section Chief (representative), gave instructions, with many words of encouragement.

The association is organized by soap manufacturers and powerful soap distributors with business departments or offices in Central China. The internal organization is divided into production and distribution departments. Under the guidance and supervision of the Embassy Office, the association will adjust the supply of soap, plan and implement production and distribution, find ways to purchase raw materials, and set prices. The president, vice president, directors, and supervisors of the association are as follows:

President: Yoshitaka Mochida of Japan Oil and Fat, Vice President: Mitsubishi Corporation, Accounting Director: Daimaru Yoko, Directors: First Industrial Pharmaceutical, Maeda Yoko, Shanghai Oil and Fat, Mitsui Yoko, Idemitsu Kosan, Supervisors: Rongtai Yoko, Kyuko Yoko. It is believed that although the Chinese soap industry mechanism has not been realized at the same time, it is believed that it will also be established soon. (Yunpeng: Translated from the Mainland News, May 21)

### Hua Stock Trend

Yesterday, most Hua stocks fell in a soft market. This was because they were controlled by tight money and new and old investors were temporarily watching and waiting in a falling market. Trading was not active, but the new shares of Great China Match stood out, rising under continued demand. Nanyang Tobacco Company's trading was sparse and prices were offered. The department store industry was the weakest. Wing On, Sincere, and China Products Company all saw small squeezes. Wing On Textile Mill's selling pressure did not subside, and Mayar was also weak. In the pharmaceutical industry, Sino-French Pharmacy was flat, and New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory fell slightly. Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric Company both softened. In the cultural industry, China Book Company was flat, while Commercial Press and World Book Company fell slightly. Jiu'an Industrial and New Yick Land saw little change. New shares of Tongyi Trust and Jingfu Socks and Shirts Factory were firm under demand.

### Brief Notes

Baokang Chemical Pharmaceutical Factory Co., Ltd. was initiated by Wu Yunqi, Jiang Yushan, and others, and the preparation has been going on for a year. The capital has been fully paid up. The inaugural meeting is scheduled to be held at the Fulai Hotel on Guangxi Road at 2 PM on the 22nd of this month. The office is located at No. 4, Lane 129, South Chengdu Road.

The Sanhang Economic Weekly, jointly organized by Dakang Silk Industry and Shanghai Industrial Federation, is known as a popular reading material in the economic circles of this city. The 18th issue of Volume 2 will be published today, coinciding with the special issue of Shanghai Industrial Bank. In addition to the existing economic review, finance, industry and commerce, and commodity sections, it also publishes a brief history of the Shanghai Industrial Bank's development and a very detailed description of the current general banking industry. Subscribers can contact No. 112, Xiaobo Road.

### National Federations of Trade Associations Renamed Regional Federations of Trade Associations

The Ministry of Food has guided the establishment and distribution of emblems for the national federations of trade associations for six major commodities: wheat flour, miscellaneous grains, edible oil, sugar, livestock products, and eggs, and they have begun operations. However, the words "national" seem inappropriate because the organization includes three provinces and two special municipalities. Therefore, it has been decided to rename them "Regional Federations of Trade Associations." The order has been formally issued to the various regional trade associations to comply.
