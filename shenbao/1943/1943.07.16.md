### Securities Exchange Resumption Issues

The role of the securities market is to enable capital holders to find proper investment avenues and choose their desired investment targets, while those seeking capital can quickly raise the funds they need. Therefore, securities play a particularly important role in promoting enterprise development. Economist Yang Yinpu, in his book "On Chinese Exchanges," discussed the role of the securities market in promoting enterprise development, saying:

"If stocks cannot circulate in the market, raising capital will be difficult, and the organization of joint-stock companies will not be fully developed. Investors and merchants value the ability of capital to circulate, and are unwilling to purchase illiquid stocks with liquid funds. With the establishment of stock exchanges, stocks have a mechanism for circulation, and stock companies can develop accordingly. Furthermore, with the existence of markets for trading securities, the issuance of bonds becomes easier to circulate, making it easier to raise capital for enterprises, and promoting enterprise development."

If we compare the development of joint-stock companies in advanced industrialized countries with Yang's words, we realize that if any country wants to develop large-scale modern industries, it must first start with establishing a capital market—a securities market. Otherwise, large amounts of capital cannot be raised, and the only option is to utilize foreign capital. Yang's words focus only on industry, which is too narrow. In fact, there are many precedents for agricultural development and municipal construction relying on the assistance of securities markets. For example, long-term agricultural loans in Germany, which are substantial and have greatly benefited agricultural development, are due to the fact that agricultural bonds issued by agricultural financial institutions can circulate in the securities market. Our country's agriculture and industry are both extremely backward. Expanding and developing them depends on the ability to circulate large amounts of capital. Without quickly restoring the investment market, we feel it is impossible to raise funds. To curb speculation and guide idle capital into productive avenues, we must rely on the investment market. Therefore, we feel an urgent need for the resumption of the Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange.

The Chinese Merchants Securities Exchange was established in 1920 and was suspended only after the Sino-Japanese Incident. Recently, it was ordered by the Ministry of Finance to prepare for resumption. In the past, securities trading was limited to the buying and selling of government bonds, so its contribution to the industrial sector was minimal. In the future, to meet the needs of the times, it should take increasing the circulation of various production securities as its greatest responsibility after resumption. As for how to prevent speculation, stabilize prices, and strictly review listed securities, all of these are related to the stability of social finance. The exchange should pay special attention to research at the beginning of its resumption. The greatest purpose of restoring the securities market is to bring securities trading onto the right track, to assist the development of the national economy and the prosperity of industry. Therefore, the exchange's future work should always be guided by this principle.

The exchange system differs between Britain and the United States and the mainland. Britain and the United States adopt a laissez-faire approach, while the mainland adopts an interventionist approach. Our country has always adopted the mainland system. In this era of social and economic instability, people's minds are largely inclined towards speculation. It may be impossible to completely prevent securities trading from becoming a target of speculation. We can only hope that the government will be more stringent in its supervision, such as prohibiting futures trading, restricting banks from using stocks as collateral for loans, and levying a small securities transaction tax. These are all remedial measures to prevent excessive speculation.

What the Exchange's Board of Directors should earnestly implement is that listed stocks must undergo strict scrutiny, absolutely without any emotional involvement or being controlled by any force. It should also strictly stipulate qualification standards, so that those performing the review have no difficulty in complying and no room for compromise. What should be particularly emphasized is that all listed securities must be for projects related to the wartime national economy. Otherwise, no matter how sound their credit, how long their history, or how perfect their management, they should not be allowed to be listed, so that social capital can be fully utilized for wartime economic needs.

Recently, stock prices have repeatedly risen, which is indeed affected by the rise in prices, but there is also a strong suspicion that stock firms can manipulate prices by buying and selling on their own account. After the exchange resumes operations, whether the brokers' own buying and selling will be absolutely prohibited, restricted, or allowed freely should be studied and decided before the exchange resumes operations.

Finally, there is a suggestion for the exchange. In the past, the ten Japanese securities exchanges were merged and reorganized by the Japanese government to suit the needs of the times. All its measures strive to suit the spirit of the times, and it is worthwhile to refer to them for reference.

Translation and Commentary

### Subtle US-Soviet Relations

In a special communiqué on June 22, the anniversary of the German-Soviet war, the Soviet authorities demanded that Britain and the United States immediately open a second front.

Stalin did not use euphemistic language, but directly and frankly提出the request to launch a second front. Britain and the United States themselves also know that with the imminent arrival of the decisive moment in the world war, they can no longer use that set of abstract reveries. Now they must show how to get Soviet approval. Stanley, the US ambassador to the Soviet Union, who previously criticized the Soviet Union for "ingratitude" and caused problems, recently uttered flattering words about the Soviet Union:

"The friendly relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union are now reaching their peak. This situation must be maintained in the future."

On the one hand, Roosevelt is currently asking the US Senate to remove anti-Soviet elements from the US diplomatic ranks. He is requesting the dismissal of Loy Henderson, the head of the State Department's Soviet Affairs Division, on the grounds that he has caused suspicion between the US and the Soviet Union. Washington newspapers praised Roosevelt for "using an extremely sincere attitude to seek closer US-Soviet understanding." Roosevelt's measures and Stanley's statement are all in the spirit of flattery and perfunctory treatment of the Soviet Union. Other than that, as for truly preparing or considering how to open a second front, it has not been considered at all, only taking a wait-and-see attitude and watching the Soviet Union's struggle. It is said that Henderson's departure from the State Department to take up the post of the new ambassador to Iraq is because he is particularly seriously concerned about the Soviet Union's attitude towards West Asia and the situation in the Caucasus. From this, we can see the shrewd attempt of the United States to combine flattery and surveillance. When the Eastern Front is delicate, US-Soviet relations still strongly feel a state of entanglement. (Wing: Translated from the June 29th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: In order to seize Munda on New Georgia Island, the Japanese army's forward base, the enemy army displayed its ambition to advance its base forward and landed on Rentebua Island on June 30th. At the same time, it made its units land on Rice Bay on the northwest coast of New Georgia Island and on the southeast coast, showing a situation of capturing Munda. Since then, fierce battles have been launched in the sea, land, and air forces day and night in that area. The enemy forces advancing to Rubiana Island, three kilometers south of Munda, also echoed the enemy forces on the northwest, east, and west coasts of New Georgia Island, attempting to land from the eastern side of Munda. Starting at 8:00 AM on the 14th, they released a large smokescreen and began landing at 9:00 AM. The enemy used a total of 70 landing boats, half of which carried soldiers and the other half were full of military supplies. The Japanese coastal garrison immediately approached these enemy forces, and immediately launched a counterattack, bombarding them fiercely.

### Japanese Central Cooperation Council: Second Day of Meeting; Four Committees Separately Discuss Important Cases; Prime Minister Explains Establishing a Decisive Battle Life

Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency: When Japanese Prime Minister Tojo attended the fourth committee of the Central Cooperation Council on the 15th, after requesting to speak, he stood up to explain the lives of the Japanese people, and solemnly stated that in addition to ensuring their own lives, the Japanese people must always keep in mind the need to ensure the lives of one billion people in Greater East Asia.

However, in order to achieve the purpose of the Greater East Asia War, in other words, in order to enable the countries and peoples within the Greater East Asia region to obtain their respective positions, it is necessary to further ensure the lives of thirty billion people living in this Greater East Asia region. We hope that you will understand this point. When operating this daily life, Japan itself is naturally a very large object, but on the one hand, it must always regard one billion people as the object.

### Colonel Kurihara Succeeds: Japanese Navy Press Section Chief; Hiraide Transferred to Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau

Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: The Japanese Navy Ministry announced on the 15th: Colonel Hideo Hiraide, Chief of the Naval Press Section of the Japanese General Headquarters, succeeded as Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau. The vacancy of the Chief of the Press Section was filled by Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara. According to reports, Colonel Hiraide returned to Japan from Italy in July 1940 and immediately served as the Director of the Press Department of the General Headquarters. For three years, he was active on the front line of the press battle and made great contributions. Recently, due to poor health and having served for a long time, he was replaced by Colonel Kurihara. Colonel Kurihara learned about the current state of the war at the decisive stage in the military in the past, and his appointment as Chief of the Press Section is the most suitable person. In the future, Colonel Kurihara will launch a decisive battle in the propaganda war against Britain and the United States. Colonel Kurihara graduated from the Naval Academy in November 1929. He served as the deputy artillery chief of the Haruna warship. In November 1935, he was promoted to lieutenant colonel. In December 1936, he served as a member of the Military Affairs Bureau. In November 1937, he became a member of the Naval Press Department of the General Headquarters. After being promoted to colonel in 1939, he successively served as the staff officer of the Shanghai area base team. In December of the same year, he served as a staff officer of the Sasebo Naval Base. In November 1940, he entered the Military Affairs Bureau, and later served as the Chief of the Military Affairs Bureau until now.

Colonel Kurihara Expresses His Aspirations

Tokyo, 15th, Central News Agency dispatch: Colonel Etsuzo Kurihara, who succeeded Colonel Honde as Chief of the Naval Press Department, met with a group of reporters from the Navy Ministry on the 15th and explained his aspirations for his new position. The gist of it was: I am deeply aware of the importance of the mission of the press in the decisive battle, and I feel a great responsibility. I am a layman when it comes to press propaganda work. Colonel Hiraide made great contributions during his tenure, and I cannot but do my best to succeed him. The current war situation is precisely the decisive battle situation, and the enemy's counterattack operations are now becoming more and more intense. However, I believe that making the most of the nation's overall strength is the most urgent task today. Therefore, the one hundred million Japanese people hope and are determined to do their best to contribute to the war. The people across the country are fighting as production soldiers, so it is especially important to remember this determination, which is directly related to the Solomon Islands. Regarding the ideological war, contributing all existing forces to the country and fully exerting its power is the driving force for victory. It is also necessary to improve the "paper is weak" hit rate, so that every bullet hits its mark, and I hope that we can recognize the target to be fired at and make every shot count.

### New China's Economic Construction Policy: Minister Chen Junhui's Remarks to Japanese Reporters

(Q) What is the new China's construction policy after the establishment of the Ministry of Construction of the National Government, especially the three-year economic construction plan and its progress?

(A) The Ministry of Construction was established in February of this year and has only been in existence for a few months. The ministry merged the original Ministry of Transportation and the Water Conservancy Commission, and its undertakings are also inherited from previous work. Since the three-year economic construction plan was passed, it has focused on the plan and made every effort to actively carry out construction. The focus is on the water conservancy problem of farmland.

(Q) What is the economic trend in China after the implementation of the new policies? That is, (A) What is the situation after the restriction on the movement of materials and the actual situation of material circulation? (B) What is the current situation of the national commercial control federation's autonomous control?

All of these are controlled under the new organization of the National Commercial Control Federation. Its lower-level organizations include the board of directors and trade associations, and its activities have also been greatly promoted. The mechanism for making the movement of materials smooth has gradually been completed. In particular, the purchasing of materials is carried out by the joint committee, trade associations, and localities maintaining close relations. Although it cannot be said to be sufficient, the main institutions have been completed by the end of June.

(Q) What is the future activity method of the National Economic Commission?

(A) The commission was reorganized in February of this year. In addition to officials and civilians, it also brought together many influential figures from the private financial and business circles. Although the commission is not an executive body, it is the highest deliberative body of the government. Now it has also established a research institute to unify the original government and private investigation agencies and provide data for the National Economic Commission for deliberation.

(Q) What is the status of the East Taihu development project in the three-year plan?

(A) The development of East Taihu started with the technical guidance of Japan. In an area of approximately 1.6 million hectares of farmland, 700,000 dan of rice can be harvested. In addition, development projects are being carried out along the Yangzi River delta area.

The purpose of this visit to Japan is to inspect the general situation of wartime construction in Japan and to hold talks with influential people in the government and the public. I hope that the National Government and China will continue to receive maximum assistance. China will work with Japan to move towards the completion and victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Axis Forces in Sicily Prepare for General Counter-Offensive; British Paratroopers Annihilated in Catania; American Forces Suffer Setbacks Around Gela

Zurich, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Axis forces in Sicily have completed preparations for a counter-offensive, and the military situation on the island seems to be approaching a decisive turning point. It is reported that fierce fighting is currently taking place east of Gela. The elite Goering Division is attacking the American Seventh Army, and British and Canadian allied forces are engaged in fierce fighting with German and Italian troops near Floridia. Military analysts in London believe that the Axis forces will launch a counter-offensive from the north against the British Eighth Army. It is reported that Anglo-American aerial reconnaissance has discovered numerous Axis armored columns moving from Paterno towards Catania. The plain of Catania is considered the most ideal battlefield for tank warfare. At the same time, according to news from Berlin: Even before the general counter-offensive by the Axis forces, Anglo-American forces will be forced to remain on the defensive, as they need to await sufficient reinforcements and supplies. Currently, the land battles in Sicily involve American forces attempting to expand their established bridgehead, while German and Italian advance units are strengthening their resistance, preventing Anglo-American landing forces from breaking through to the mountainous interior of the island. The headquarters of the anti-Axis forces in North Africa announced: The most intense fighting on the island is currently concentrated around Gela, where American forces have suffered significant setbacks. According to the latest news: Axis armored forces have launched a fierce attack on the right flank of the anti-Axis forces, targeting the British Eighth Army in Catania and the American forces in Licata on its right flank. From the current observations, it can be concluded that it will be difficult for the two anti-Axis forces to continue to advance, as the Axis armored forces are now in a favorable position to repel the advancing units.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - On Tuesday night, a group of British paratroopers, about a company in strength, landed on the Catania plain and were annihilated by German forces. The British had planned a surprise attack, but unexpectedly, the landing site was where the German forces were deployed. Within an hour of the start of the British paratroop landing, most were either killed or captured.

Southeast Coast, Battle Rages

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - Reuters military correspondent reports: The fighting in southeastern Sicily has developed into a large-scale battle, as Anglo-American forces, having received a steady stream of reinforcements, have resumed their attempts to invade the interior. The Anglo-American air forces have been very effective in assisting the operations in the aforementioned battles. At the same time, the Axis forces are putting up very strong resistance, unwilling to give up an inch of ground easily, causing very heavy losses to the Anglo-American forces. Yesterday, an Italian communiqué announced that the Anglo-American forces have opened up roads to the southeastern mountainous areas of Sicily and the Catania plain. This can be considered the largest territorial gain for the anti-Axis forces at the extreme point in southeastern Sicily. From the defenders' point of view, this area has always been considered vulnerable. Based on the current situation, it appears that the British Eighth Army and the American Seventh Army have established contact in the area. It should be noted that the anti-Axis forces have been striving for this kind of linkup since the initial days of the battle. The main pressure of the Axis offensive is now concentrated in the area north and northwest of Augusta. The tank units of the Hermann Goering Division in that area are intensifying their pressure towards Catania with the assistance of the Luftwaffe. Catania, the second largest city in Sicily, is clearly the target of the British advance. If the Anglo-American forces can complete their operational plan to occupy the entire east coast of the island up to Messina, it would be tantamount to severing all communication between the island and the great traitor of Italy. However, it can be asserted that the Axis command has already made proper preparations for the necessary resistance measures.

Italian Military Releases Details of Fierce Fighting

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The Italian military authorities announced at 1:00 PM on the 15th: On the Sicilian front, from the Gulf of Licata in the west to the Gulf of Augusta in the east, and in the mountainous areas on the east coast and the Catania plain, anti-Axis forces appear to have landed reinforcements since the 12th, unfolding fierce fighting along the entire 150-kilometer front. Although the connection between the eastern and western flanks of the anti-Axis forces has not yet been successful, the German authorities recently acknowledged that the British Eighth Army and the American Seventh Army have successfully linked up in southeastern Sicily near Ragusa and Modica. Moreover, with the support of reinforcements, the anti-Axis forces centered on the ports of Licata and Gela appear to have advanced slightly to the east and north. Currently, the primary objective of the anti-Axis war is to occupy the Catania plain, and they appear to be attempting to gradually advance from Augusta under the cover of naval gunfire from the fleet on the east coast.

Heavy Losses for British and American Ships

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - On Tuesday afternoon, Axis air forces sank four anti-Axis landing ships full of troops and military supplies, two large transport ships carrying ammunition, and one supply ship of over 3,000 tons. In addition, one cruiser and three cargo ships, totaling 14,000 tons, were severely damaged. Between July 10th and 13th, the German air force sank or destroyed a total of 34 anti-Axis ships, totaling approximately 160,000 tons. Many of the damaged ships are too badly damaged to be repaired. In addition, one British battleship, three cruisers, and one destroyer were also directly hit by bombs.

### Southern Italian Cities Declared War Zones

Rome, 15th (Central News Agency) - Officials announced today that the province of Campagna in southern Italy and its capital, Naples, and the province of Lucania and its capital, Potenza, have been declared war zones.

### New Polish Cabinet Formed

Lisbon, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency, London reports that after General Sikorski died in a plane crash in Gibraltar, Mikolajczyk has succeeded as Prime Minister of the Polish government-in-exile. General Kukiel will serve as Minister of Defense, replacing General Sosnkowski, who was originally slated for the position. Jan Szyroki, the Polish Minister to Egypt, has been appointed Foreign Minister. Well-informed sources in London say that the British government opposed Sosnkowski's appointment as Minister of Defense because his attitude is not conducive to resolving the dispute between Poland and the Soviet Union.

### Vichy France Severs Diplomatic Relations with Chongqing

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to information from Chongqing, French Ambassador to Chongqing, Penquer, and all the staff of the embassy have been ordered by their government to leave Chongqing. Because the Vichy government, adapting to the new situation in East Asia, recently implemented the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights to the National Government, Chongqing has repeatedly protested to Vichy and moved its diplomatic mission to Vichy to Lisbon. In fact, diplomatic relations between Chongqing and Vichy have already been severed.

### Eastern Front Quiet

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas News Agency: For several days, the fighting on the Eastern Front has been quiet, except in the areas of Orel and Belgorod.

Berlin, 15th (Central News Agency) - The German High Command announced on the 14th that Soviet forces in the Belgorod area have suffered heavy losses. In addition, Soviet forces launched fierce attacks east and north of Orel with reinforcements, and German forces counterattacked with reserve troops. In the past few days, Soviet forces have lost more than 200 tanks in that area. Powerful units of the German Air Force have participated in the fighting on the Eastern Front, destroying numerous Soviet tanks and shooting down 212 Soviet aircraft.

### Japanese Consul-General in Hankou Discusses the Return of the Shanghai Concession

Hankou, 15th (Central News Agency) - Regarding the return of the Shanghai International Settlement, a reporter from the Wuhan Central Branch recently interviewed Mr. Takatsu, the Japanese Consul-General in Hankou, to inquire about his views. He stated that less than a month after the signing of the Sino-Japanese treaty, the International Settlement will be returned on August 1st, which is a memorable page in the recovery of Chinese sovereignty. The Shanghai International Settlement was the origin of American and British aggression against China, so its return was extremely difficult. Now, due to China's participation in the war and active promotion of war policies, China has been able to realize its century-old dream. The return of the International Settlement will enable the National Government to fully exert its governance, which will have a significant impact on politics, economy, and culture. From this, the strengthening and revival of the National Government can be seen.

Guests included Mr. Shimazu, representative of the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Mihara, head of the Training Section of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and Mr. Nishimura, representative of the commander of the Okochi Unit of the North China Army. Wang Kemin, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Committee and Chairman of the New People's Society, Zhang Zhongzhi, Director of Political Affairs, Yu Xijie, Deputy Chairman of the New People's Society, and directors of the local Support the New Asia Movement offices, attended, numbering about 100. After a formal ceremony, the meeting began with Mr. Shanxi, Vice President of the Development Company, as chairman. Mr. Mihara, Head of the Training Section of the Beijing Embassy, explained the guiding principles of the North China Support the New Asia Movement and the regulations of the North China Support the New Asia Movement Headquarters, which were unanimously approved. President Kanzawa then appointed the staff and explained the budget, which was put to a vote, and the agenda was concluded. Subsequently, President Kanzawa, Mr. Shimazu, representative of the Minister of Greater East Asia, Mr. Nishimura, representative of the Commander Okochi, and Chairman Wang Kemin delivered speeches and congratulations. A congratulatory telegram from Prime Minister Tojo, the President of the Imperial Rule Assistance Association, was read. Finally, Vice President Shanxi delivered a speech. After about two hours, this deeply meaningful inauguration meeting concluded, and the North China Support the New Asia Movement Headquarters, the core of the 400,000 Japanese in North China, and the supreme guidance body for cooperation between officials and civilians, officially began its work. After the inauguration meeting, after a short break, a joint meeting of the headquarters staff, local Support the New Asia Movement officers, and office directors was held to exchange views on the Support the New Asia Movement. The meeting adjourned after 6 PM. The main points of President Kanzawa's speech at the inauguration meeting are as follows:

In response to the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement that began in Japan in Showa 15 (1940), the Japanese in North China also launched a Support the New Asia Movement. However, until now, there has been no consistent and organic organization. Not only that, they have neglected the fact that they live among the Chinese and Chinese people, and they do not think about having common goals and ideals with China. Therefore, in response to this shift in Japan's policy towards China, we want to further develop the industrialization movement. Needless to say, Japan's noble founding spirit of Hakkō ichiu is also the common ideal of building a new order in Greater East Asia. This common and highest goal is the New Asia ideal, and its realization is the substance of the New Asia Movement. Especially in North China, which has a very close relationship with Japan, the Japanese here must work together towards the common ideal goals of China and Japan to demonstrate a model area for the new order in Greater East Asia. North China is the cultivation base where the New Asia Movement should first be realized. The reason why we are now forming a strong, unified organization with the cooperation of government and people to actively carry out the Support the New Asia Movement lies in this. It is hoped that the 400,000 Japanese residents in North China, through this strong organization, will maintain a stable mind, internally support the Imperial Rule Assistance Movement in Japan, and externally cooperate with the New Asia Movement in China, practice Japan's noble and far-reaching founding spirit, and cooperate in the development of North China.

### Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno from the Japanese Publishing Industry Arrive in Shanghai - Our Newspaper Hosted a Tea Party Yesterday - More Than Twenty Representatives from Various Newspapers Attended, Creating a Very Enthusiastic Atmosphere

Mr. Ken Yamada, Managing Director of the major Japanese publishing company Greater East Asia Publishing Co., and Mr. Takashi Ueno, Director of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute, came to Shanghai together on [date] to research the cultural publishing industries in various parts of Greater East Asia and to establish a foundation for cultural publishing within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. They plan to visit relevant organizations and groups in the city and exchange views with cultural figures in the water city. Therefore, our newspaper initiated a reception yesterday at 5:00 PM at the Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association hall in the Xingya Building to introduce Mr. Yamada and Mr. Ueno to members of the press in the city. In addition to the two gentlemen, Mr. Hiroshi Hata, Director of the China Cultural Economics Research Institute, and more than twenty representatives from the Press Association and various newspapers also attended. The atmosphere was lively and enthusiastic.

President Chen's Impromptu Speech

First, President Chen of our newspaper gave an impromptu speech, stating that he was very pleased to introduce Mr. Yamada of the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and Mr. Ueno of the Greater East Asia Publishing Culture Research Institute to colleagues in Shanghai's cultural circles on the occasion of their visit to Shanghai. He was also grateful for the presence of Mr. Hiroshi Hata, a senior figure in the cultural circles of a friendly nation. The Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute are dedicated to researching the cultural publishing industry in Greater East Asia, so their relationship with China is extremely close. We are eager to learn from them and to engage in sincere discussions and research to truly achieve the goal of Sino-Japanese cultural exchange.

Mr. Ueno Introduces Publishing

Next, Mr. Ueno introduced Japan's publishing industry, saying: There are about 3,000 kinds of publications in Japan, of which about 1,000 are government publications and 1,000 to 2,000 are privately operated, but only 400 to 500 of them have a good reputation. Therefore, it is felt that there is not enough strength to promote cultural education and other work in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. For this reason, the major figures in Japan's cultural publishing industry have formed the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute to promote cultural publishing in Greater East Asia and lay a new foundation for it. Cultural construction in Greater East Asia is most important in mainland China, so we have decided to re-study Chinese culture, but this is still a preliminary stage, and we hope that everyone will give us guidance and cooperation. In the past, Japan has done a lot of research on Chinese cultural publishing and economic issues, but without special achievements. The biggest reason is that it focused too much on form and lacked practicality, and its understanding of China's real situation was too shallow, so there were few satisfactory results. In the future, we hope to be able to match our words with our actions to complete our mission of cultural research.

Mr. Yamada Expresses His Views

Mr. Yamada then expressed his views, saying: I am really an "outsider" to your country's news industry and rarely study it. However, what we know is that the Shanghai press and publishing industries bear a very important mission, and we are sure that you will be able to accomplish it through your efforts. As for our views on Japanese publications, as Mr. Ueno said, although there are many publications, how many of them can become famous? The reason why it is not easy to improve is probably because they are not practical. We should study where the crux of the problem lies and improve it, and at the same time, we hope that you will give us as much criticism as possible, and we are very willing to accept it.

Holding Cordial Discussions and Dispersing Happily

Then, the cordial discussions began. Mr. Yamada, Mr. Hata, and others provided practical answers to the opinions raised by Mr. Weng Yongqing, Mr. Cheng Zhongquan, and others. It was said that Japan has indeed implemented newspaper mergers, but magazine mergers are also gradually being implemented. However, because famous magazines sold in China still maintain their original status, many Chinese people cannot understand this matter. In fact, most Japanese magazines have already been merged. Regarding Japanese newspapers' coverage of news about China, the amount is a little less than that of Chinese newspapers' coverage of news about Japan. According to Mr. Hata, because the Greater East Asia War is approaching the decisive stage, all newspapers are focusing on war news, and because of limited space, this phenomenon may occur. However, in the past, the coverage of Chinese news in various newspapers was no less than that in Chinese newspapers. According to Mr. Hata, students in Japanese schools and villages are already learning Chinese and Chinese, and are abandoning British and American English, so they will definitely make more contributions to Sino-Japanese culture in the future. According to the Greater East Asia Publishing Co. and the Publishing Culture Research Institute, which were established this spring, it is purely a non-governmental organization engaged in the research of cultural publishing. In addition to publishing various war pictorials to introduce the real situation of Japan to the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and various parts of Southeast Asia, it will also prepare to publish Chinese, Burmese, and Southeast Asian books, and will focus entirely on literary and academic works. When necessary, it will decide to translate famous Chinese and Japanese books and introduce them to the people of the two countries, and invite Chinese people to write articles to realize Sino-Japanese cultural exchange. It is said that the company's headquarters is in Tokyo, and in order to strengthen its work in the future, it may set up a branch in Shanghai. Finally, Ren Yunpeng of the Press Association introduced the general situation and current status of the Shanghai Press Association to the two gentlemen in detail, and the gathering ended happily at about 7:00 PM.

### Japanese Economic Mission Returns to Shanghai from Inspection in Beijing - Revitalization Company Hosts a Banquet for Cordial Discussions

On the evening of the same day at 7:00 PM, the China Central Revitalization Company held a dinner party at the International Hotel to host the delegation and discuss economic issues, and the gathering ended happily at about 9:00 PM. In addition, the Cotton Industry Professional Committee of the National Commercial Control Association and the China Central Cotton Improvement Association held a welcome meeting for Mr. Gengo Kotera at the Cathay Hotel at 4:00 PM on the afternoon after the delegation arrived in Shanghai to discuss countermeasures for increasing cotton production in China Central.

### Citizens' Welfare Association Holds Board Meeting

### Various Circles Sponsor Shen Bao's Education Assistance Program and Hope to Stabilize Teachers' Lives - Education Authorities Are Planning to Increase Salaries

Since our newspaper launched the education assistance program, we have been gratified by the enthusiastic support from all walks of life, who have joined us in this good cause. The letters received yesterday are recorded below: Mr. Zhu Minghe generously donated 1,000 yuan and expressed his opinion that the current teachers are unable to make ends meet due to insufficient income, and many have changed careers or taken on part-time jobs, resulting in a reduction in school courses, which greatly affects students' education. He hopes that our newspaper will establish a teacher assistance fund in addition to the education assistance fund to stabilize teachers' lives so that they no longer have to seek ways to support themselves, and he hopes that people from all walks of life will respond enthusiastically. It is reported that the education authorities have held meetings and decided to find ways to increase teachers' salaries and discuss preferential treatment measures. Mr. Pei Zhengyong not only donated 500 yuan himself, but also raised 1,000 yuan from Pudong Bank. Mr. Pan Jiyan allocated 500 yuan from his salary to donate, and said that he will continue to donate as much as he can in the future.

Education Assistance Funds Received Yesterday

The following is a list of the education assistance funds received by our newspaper yesterday: Master of Bao Shantang, 2,240 yuan; Anonymous (donating funds on the occasion of his respected father Zhou Shaoji's 70th birthday), Xia Yitong, Pu Zhongyao, 2,000 yuan each; Wang Kuancheng, Xu Zhaolin, Pudong Bank, Zhu Minghe, Jiang Yi, 1,000 yuan each; Li Feihou, Shen Guoneng, Wen Youzhang, Zheng Zirong, Pei Zhengyong, Wen Jiyan, Pei Deyao, Mei Qing, 500 yuan each; Anonymous (receipt number 3517), 306.40 yuan; Wang Juru, Liu Yaofu, Zhong Mingxiang, Wang Honglai, 200 yuan each; Chen Zuzhi, Qi Qiyuan, Lu Baoshan, 150 yuan each; Fan Jia, Leng Ying, Zhou Bofang, Zhou Xiaoyuan, Fang Manjin (sending full moon congratulatory gifts to Miss Quan Xiangchu), Yang Yingshi, 100 yuan each; Wang Dezhong, 25 yuan.

### In the Voice of Unified Promotion of Charity - A Visit to the Poverty and Disease Relief Association (II) - Why Not Run Your Own Business?

Why only focus on supporting established charities and not run your own charitable business? This is a very interesting but very important question. The person in charge of the association pointed out: This question also contains two questions: First, why are there so many charitable organizations, but in fact Shanghai is still full of sufferers awaiting relief? Second, should we start from scratch and create a large-scale charity to run all charitable undertakings? The founders of the association have carefully studied these two questions. Their conclusion is that: First, the reason why existing charitable organizations cannot fully protect Shanghai's suffering compatriots is mainly due to the unfavorable objective environment, which naturally involves political, economic, and cultural factors, which will not be discussed for the time being. The secondary reason is due to the subjective shortcomings of the charitable organizations, namely (1) insufficient funding, (2) improper planning, and (3) ineffective management. Objective reasons require efforts from other parties, and we can remedy and improve subjective reasons. The Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association's focus on supporting established charitable organizations to promote charitable undertakings is based on this first reason. Second, why not run your own charitable business? Indeed, general psychology seems to suggest that running your own business may result in better fundraising results. However, will it be effective for charitable undertakings? This is a very big question: Because (1) in terms of material facilities, the houses, real estate, and internal equipment of the existing charitable organizations in Shanghai are so large that their assets are simply inestimable. Even with a large portion of the entire annual budget of the organizations, it is probably impossible to do it - for example, the foundations of the Xujiahui and Yangjingbang Saint Mary's Cathedral, the Tushanwan Orphanage, and the Puyutang were gradually accumulated over decades or even centuries, and it is definitely not something that a few people can prepare in a short period of time. (2) In terms of talent, the more than 330 charitable organizations in Shanghai each have their own specialized talent according to their respective business departments, from the heads of the various associations who have been painstakingly operating for decades, to the practical workers who work hard, are selfless, and sacrifice their service for decades, the philanthropy of Catholicism and Christianity, the compassion of Buddhism, and the respect for the elderly and the young in Confucianism, this spirit and the various service morals and skills of supporting the elderly, disabled, and educating orphans and poor children cannot be trained in any school. (3) In terms of the cause, each charity has achieved considerable results over decades or even centuries, and has long been praised by various parties at home and abroad, which is also something that any newly established organization cannot easily accomplish. The Shanghai Poverty and Disease Relief Association's focus on guiding established organizations rather than running its own business is based on this second reason.

### Rice and Grain Continue to Arrive in Shanghai - The Next Ration May Be the Same as the Original Quantity

Although the authorities have repeatedly emphasized that there is no shortage of food for the people in the city, and the Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company also plans to find ways to transport rice from other places to Shanghai for relief, the people's concern about this issue has not diminished at all. This matter is of great importance to the people's livelihood and should not be ignored for a moment. Yesterday, a reporter from Shanghai News Agency asked informed sources about this issue. According to them, the authorities, feeling the people's high expectations for food, will clear up all parties' anxieties within the most appropriate period of time and make the food on which the livelihoods of 5 million people depend transparent, so that the source of rice and grain will not be cut off, and the phenomenon of temporary reduction of household rations can also be eliminated. The authorities know that in order to achieve this goal, first, it is necessary to promote the convenience of transportation, so that the grain in the producing areas can be transported to Shanghai for sale without delay; second, it is necessary to improve the purchase method, especially the purchase price, which should take into account the interests of farmers and set the most reasonable price standard according to their production costs, so that farmers will be willing to sell rice. In any case, at the time when the right to allocate food rice is transferred to the Chinese side, various unforeseen difficulties are inevitable, but for the sake of the people's livelihood, the people should do their best to prevent the black market for food rice, and the authorities and the agencies in charge of purchasing, transporting, and selling food rice should bear the responsibility of guaranteeing the people's livelihood in order to achieve true stability.

Joint Venture Company Rice Already Available

(Central News Agency, Shanghai) All sectors are extremely concerned about the food rice issue in the city. The Shanghai District Rice and Grain Joint Venture Company has explored 200,000 dan of white rice from the Su, Yang, and Hu areas, which has been arriving in Shanghai continuously since the 10th. In the future, it can be imported to Shanghai in large quantities and the ration from the next period can be restored to the original quantity.

### North China Disaster Relief Association Discusses Purchase of Relief Grain

The Shanghai All-Circles North China Disaster Relief Association held its fifth standing board meeting at the City General Chamber of Commerce yesterday (15th) afternoon at 4:00 PM. All directors attended and reported that as of now, a total of 6,121,274.60 yuan in donations, 1,000 yuan in silver notes, and 1 yuan in military notes have been received, and more than 50,000 yuan has not yet been sent to the association. Then, the board discussed the purchase of grain. Fu Qiangeng reported that the current miscellaneous grains in Shanghai, such as soybeans, corn, sorghum, dried sweet potatoes, bran flour, etc., still need to be purchased from the producing areas. It was decided to ask Mr. Fu to purchase them as soon as possible, and to ask the government to assist in the transportation. Representatives from the Hebei Native Place Association reported on the progress of the fundraising. At the same time, the distribution and allocation issues were also discussed in detail before the meeting adjourned.

### Consumer Cooperative Postpones Establishment Meeting - Changed to the 21st

Now, due to insufficient preparation and the internal arrangements not yet in place, it has been decided to postpone it to 2:00 PM on the 21st of this month at the auditorium of the City General Chamber of Commerce.

### Huatong Cup Charity Football Match - Lianyi to Play against Saint Portuguese Tomorrow - 6:30 PM at Xuhui High School

The forwards are a collection of talents. Gaines's leg injury has healed and he has decided to take the lead again and try his sniping skills. On the right, there is the good-at-darting Fu En and the fierce Karolie Qu. On the right, there is the resourceful Su Ruo and the rising star Brada.

Economic Commentary

### Further Discussion on Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks

On June 22, this column "Centralized Trading of Chinese Stocks" stated that under the current environment, the resumption of the stock exchange will be an inevitable fact. As for its purpose, it was explained in three points; at that time, some people doubted whether the stock exchange could resume business at this time, but they did not know that it was precisely because of this time that it was necessary for the stock exchange to resume business. Now the facts tell us that the stock exchange has decided to hold a shareholders' meeting on the 24th of this month and is scheduled to resume business in mid-August.

Why did the stock exchange resume business at this time? Eliminating the independent business behavior of stockbrokers, promoting the smooth turnover of the stock business, and guiding social idle funds into the production sector of national capital are all reasons, but the most important reason is that the Shanghai economy after the recovery of the concessions must be adjusted and unified, and no more chaotic economic behavior is allowed. In terms of institutions and personnel, a thorough adjustment and unification must be carried out, just as the Dalu News reported on July 3: "Shanghai is the economic heartland of China, and everything is of great importance; after the recovery of the concessions, we hope that special and prudent consideration and adjustment will be given to the candidates and institutions responsible for practical work." Indeed, it must be so. Only then can all economic behavior be unified to achieve a truly perfect state. Since the business behavior of stockbrokers uses the resumption of the stock exchange as its medium for adjustment and unification, other aspects of economic behavior, especially hoarding behavior, rely more on the establishment of "appropriate agencies" and the strengthening of their organizations.

### Eleven Banks and Brokers Have Increased Capital According to Law This Month

It is learned that, in addition to the 13 banks that have increased capital separately before, more than 40 are in the process of increasing capital.

### This Year's China Central Cotton Procurement Is Good

This year's cotton procurement will be completed after tens of thousands of dan of cotton arrive in Shanghai by the end of this month. Since the procurement authorities began purchasing in accordance with the China Central Cotton Control Order last November, the total amount obtained by the end of this month will be equal to that obtained last year. Cotton procurement is the first step in the procurement of essential agricultural materials. It is not easy to have such results. (July 15, Dalu News)

Since the beginning of active preparation, internal personnel matters have also been carefully assessed. The branch rules have been drafted by Li Dingan and four others, referring to the association's organizational regulations. Once a preparatory office is found, it will officially begin operations.

### Chinese Stock Trends

Yesterday, Chinese stocks advanced rapidly first and then retreated sharply, with unpredictable movements and a trend similar to that of gold prices. Initially, they inherited the confusing upward momentum from the noon close of the previous day, but were then suppressed by those who sold at high prices. The confidence of people in all directions has been shaken, and the industry feels that the one-sided rise in stock prices is too great and is planning to curb it, and the volume of transactions has decreased. Nanyang Tobacco Company had a crazy change, and the result of the initial moment of the morning was the largest squeeze. After the Great China Match was taken out of the customs, it has been re-entered. The upward momentum of the Beishui Electric and Huashang Electric has slowed down. The department store Yong'an Company has also seen a similar decline. The rise of Xinxin and Guohuo companies is also strong. Nei Yi and Jing Lun, Jing Fu are both leaping. The textile industry has also risen in many ways. Yong'an Textile has also risen slowly. The Great China Weaving of small denomination has suddenly been bought by a certain household and suddenly raised. Guoxin Dyeing and Weaving. The new printing and dyeing has not yet stopped rising. In the cultural industry, the World Book Company has the largest squeeze, and the rise of Commercial Press and Zhonghua is relatively small. Xinyi of the new pharmaceutical industry is also rising differently, and Zhongfa and Xinya are also squeezing strongly. The China Clock Factory is in sight of a major checkpoint, and Gongxin Electric has transactions.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: This morning, the gold and silver shops in the city, particularly the Shoushi Gold branch of Daxin, offered gold ornaments at the limited price with the same handling fee, but there were virtually no transactions. There was also a market with no sales outside the shops, and prices were chaotic. Initially, there was a gradual increase, approaching a significant level, but later, it exceeded the levels outside the Customs. By noon, it returned to the previous level. The price of silver also rose compared to yesterday.

Call Loan Interest: The call loan interest rate announced by the Bankers' Association remained unchanged at 24%.

Government Bonds: Yesterday, government bonds strengthened again. People seemed to be making a last-ditch effort, with some industry practitioners having no other options. Therefore, they were still following the ups and downs of various commodities. The initial asking price for Class C bonds was high, but then it dropped. Later, due to some short covering, the price rose again, and by noon, the price was better than the previous day. The other classes, such as A, B, D, and E, also showed signs of strengthening.

Cotton Yarn: The market remained quiet, with only the "20 count Shuangma Bank single yarn" actively traded. The asking price from Sichuan continued to rise, and it was about to break through another major level.

Cotton Cloth: The market was still stagnant, but due to strong actual sales from customers, the willingness to buy was high, causing prices to fluctuate wildly. The initial asking price for Longtou fine cloth was still within the Customs, but by noon, it had surged far beyond, setting a new record. Sijunzi drill was also significantly higher than yesterday. Taohua Nushilin, White Cat floral cloth, Sanyang drill, and others were all consistently higher than yesterday.

Northern Goods: Recently, sales have been strong and exchange rates have soared. Sellers were firm in their intentions, and the market trend was consistently upward. Among them, the price of wood ear fungus rose sharply, surpassing several major levels. Other goods also saw price increases of 40-50%.

The local Bankers' Association will hold a general meeting of all members on the 24th of this month in accordance with the regulations of the Industrial and Commercial Associations Act. They will reorganize into a director-supervisor system and elect directors and supervisors to promote association affairs and rectify industry regulations.

The local rubber tire companies believe that unified organization is essential. Therefore, Li Dizhu, Shen Kunquan, Cao Deming, and others have initiated the organization of a trade association as a member of the Rubber Industry Federation. They submitted a request for approval to the Reorganization Committee of Industrial and Commercial Associations of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce last month. The Municipal Economic Bureau received an order from the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, stating that the association's organization was not inconsistent with the Provisional Regulations of Industrial and Commercial Associations, and approved its establishment. Li Dizhu was appointed as the convener to actively prepare.

The local lard industry association, after being approved by the Food Bureau, began preparations immediately. Now, everything is ready.

### Seize Today

— Hu Ruoliu

"Do today's work today" is a truly wise saying. Because among many days, "today" is a great day. Many inventors, thinkers, and explorers... have contributed their great work to "today."

However, "tomorrow" is not great. Why? Because those who think about "tomorrow" often neglect "today." Therefore, "tomorrow" will never be completed.

I remember when I was young, I read a poem about tomorrow, in which a few lines said:

"Tomorrow and tomorrow, how many tomorrows there are! I live waiting for tomorrow, and everything is delayed." It can be seen that the word "tomorrow" delays people's futures.

We must recognize that "today" is great, "today" is real. Only "today" exists. "Tomorrow" is just a tempting thing, because "tomorrow" is empty and cannot be grasped. Therefore, waiting for "tomorrow" will never end, and there will never be a day of success. Only by grasping reality and adhering to the principle of "doing one day's work in one day," can we move forward, which is what successful people should do.

### Returning from Japan (I)

— Sheng Yudu

(The author traveled to Japan last month for half a month. I will briefly describe my observations during this short period for readers' reference.)

Life in a Nanjing Hotel

I arrived in Tokyo on the first day at 6:00 PM and was unable to get dinner. Because starting from 5:00 PM, dinner is served. However, the supply of restaurants is limited, and customers line up starting at 4:00 PM. Service stops after that. That day, I only ate the biscuits I had brought with me and couldn't get a meal. Each person's meal costs at most one yuan for breakfast, two and a half yuan for lunch, and five yuan for dinner. The food selection is not arbitrary. There are strict restrictions on time, money, and food types. I usually like fruit, but during my stay at the hotel, only half an apple was provided for breakfast. At first, I found it quite boring, but after a few days, I got used to it and found it delicious. I realized that this supply was only available in hotels. Elsewhere, it was not possible to obtain it. Those who have not experienced it firsthand cannot know the taste.

Successful Price Controls

Price controls have been quite successful. Except for the price of rice, which has increased slightly, other prices are not much different from when I studied in Japan one and a half years ago. Taxis still cost 60 sen per ride, and ice cream and black tea are still only 10 sen per cup. Haircuts still cost 1.5 to 2.5 yuan. Streetcar fares increased from 7 sen to 10 sen starting in April of this year. This success is the result of careful planning and diligent administration by the authorities, but the spirit of national cooperation is the most important factor that cannot be ignored. As for clothing, a universal point rationing system is adopted. Each person receives 100 points per year. Clothing, leather shoes, ties, hats, socks, shirts, etc., must be purchased with points. Once the 100 points are used up, no more can be purchased. When I was in Tokyo, I budgeted 20 yuan per day for expenses, but in reality, sometimes this amount was not needed.

Making the Most of Land and Talent

Government offices and gardens, which used to grow flowers and trees, are now open for planting vegetables and crops to supplement the food shortage. Although the output is insufficient, it is truly fulfilling the meaning of making the most of the land. If there is a one-point production capacity, it will increase one point of practical use. This spirit is truly worthy of emulation. The copper buttons on the uniforms of students across the country and the bronze statues originally donated are all subject to government requisition. This is how they utilize materials. They discovered that many of the American air force personnel on Brahman Island were students. When the news spread, university students across the country were excited and volunteered to join the air force training program. This is how patriotic their citizens are.

### To Night Travelers

— Rong Ge

Night travelers in the dark night,

Let's muster our courage and grope forward!

Don't be afraid of the looming shadows,

Don't be afraid of the screeching owls,

Don't be afraid of the terror of walking in the dark.

Let's use our strong faith

To overcome all difficulties!

Night travelers in the dark night,

Let's muster our courage and grope forward!

Don't sigh that the stars are gone,

The light of faith, ah,

Will always guide us forward!

Night travelers in the silent night!

Let's muster our courage and grope forward!

Don't be discouraged

Don't be pessimistic

Isn't dawn coming after the long night?

Look!

The dark night is almost over,

And the light is beckoning us ahead.

### Chicken

— Shen Shen

Tao Kun's wife was staring blankly at the dim light, lost in thought. She was a simple farm woman who didn't know much about the ways of the world. She couldn't understand why her husband had been detained for a chicken, and she didn't understand why the people in gray uniforms said there were guns in her house. She also didn't understand why they took her daughter Xiubao's betrothal silver chain and other items. They even took the only field deed she had to pawn. Poor, simple mind, how could she understand this complicated scene? Suddenly, the barking of the little dog broke her confused thoughts. Could it be that Ah Kun had returned? She strained her ears to listen. After a while, the footsteps got closer. She pushed open the half-closed wooden door. Sure enough, it was her husband who had come in. He Kun's wife immediately stood up, a happy smile on her face, and said:

"You're back! I've been waiting for you until I'm exhausted! Did the people in gray uniforms bring back Xiubao's silver chain? Do you know that our field deed was taken by Mayor Li to pawn for money?" Ah Kun's wife was truly a typical farm woman, simple and innocent, just not understanding complicated worldly affairs, still asking such questions.

"What? The field deed was taken away? That's going to kill me!" Ah Kun suddenly looked gloomy, opened his eyes, glared at his wife, staring at her for a long time, then looked down, a few tears dripping down, extraordinarily painful.

"Go to sleep! It's already midnight. You promised the Shen family in Hebei to dig a ditch tomorrow, right?" Ah Kun's wife urged her husband to rest. After a while, Ah Kun returned to the bedroom and his wife fell asleep, but she kept replaying the scene just now in her mind, how could she fall asleep? She listened to her wife and daughter Xiubao, who were both snoring soundly.

The fish-belly white light of the east gradually became transparent, and the rising sun slowly rose. Ah Kun had not slept well, his head was dizzy. He got up, grabbed a stool, and sat on the ground outside the door. In the slightly dark morning, the air was exceptionally fresh. On the sidewalk on the south bank, a few scattered people were hurrying to the market in town. (12)

### Dr. Feng Initiates Free Clinic

Dr. Cheng Zu came to Yang yesterday and said: "I have been studying various diseases related to opium addicts and smoking for more than ten years, from the initial stage of the disease to the final stage of opium leakage, etc. I have a little experience. Now, in order to assist your newspaper's charity for education, I will provide free consultations every morning, without charging any fees. However, those who are cured will voluntarily donate some money for your newspaper's scholarship fund. Patients not only receive practical treatment but also do not waste consultation fees. I will also do my part. Recently, whooping cough has become prevalent among children. This disease is not caused by external influences, but by prolonged dampness. If left untreated, the dampness will penetrate inward and turn into phlegm over time, blocking the lung meridian. The desire to expel the phlegm causes coughing. It is also trapped by dampness. This coughing and choking continues almost non-stop. In severe cases, the body may be hunched over, and vomiting may occur. Prolonged coughing damages the lung vessels, leading to hemoptysis. If further delayed, many complications will arise. The clinic is located at No. 37, Galaxy Lane, Huwei Road, French Concession (no house number on the door)."

### Elementary School Teachers' Training Course Begins Officially Yesterday

The summer training course for elementary school teachers, organized by this newspaper, began registration and course selection on the 9th of this month. Currently, the number of students in each subject is over one hundred, with particularly high participation in the Elementary School Teaching Materials and Methods course. Yesterday at 5:00 PM, the course officially began with "Education and Child Psychology" and "Elementary School Discipline Problems." The director of this newspaper, Mr. Huang, personally attended to give a speech encouraging the elementary school teachers to work hard to cultivate virtue and improve their skills, laying the foundation for revitalizing education after the recovery of the concession. The classroom is located at Shanghai Girls' High School, a pleasant location with fresh air and proximity to relatives and friends. It is truly a good place to study academic subjects. We are also grateful for the sincere treatment and convenience provided by Principal Wu and the teachers.

### Chaoshan Disaster Relief Association Plans Charity Exhibition of Calligraphy and Painting
