### Wartime Production and Small and Medium Industries

The goal of wartime industrial production is to increase supplies, adapt to the needs of the war effort, and simultaneously satisfy the essential needs of the people, in order to stabilize the rear of the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory in the war.

The method of increasing wartime production must be adapted to the actual economic situation of the country. This newspaper has repeatedly commented on this matter. Some people advocate adopting a focus on key industries, emphasizing the production of large enterprises. This view is naturally correct in a certain sense. If large-scale factories and mines can take the opportunity to develop, it can lead China's backward industries onto the path of modernization, which is very important. However, considering the current war situation and the most pressing needs of the general public, it is actually insufficient to rely solely on state-owned industries and mines, a portion of relatively large private industries, or large-scale Japanese industries and mining in China. For the urgent needs of the Chinese and Japanese governments and people during the war, efforts must be made to operate and promote the production of small and medium-sized industries.

Because China is a country dominated by small and medium-sized assets, it is also a country dominated by small and medium-sized industrial production, with small-scale commodity production accounting for a very large proportion. For more than a hundred years, under the impact of British and American businesses, these small-scale commodity economies have been riddled with holes. However, they are still struggling in extremely difficult circumstances. Since the Sino-Japanese War, because the source of British and American goods has been cut off and the output of new industries in various places is insufficient, small handicrafts and rural small industries that are on the verge of dying have a small opportunity for development. This type of small production is decentralized, spontaneously reviving without planning. However, when planned and combined, they make a great contribution to the overall national economy. Taking cotton yarn as an example, the production of hand-cranked machines can supplement the production of large factories. Taking steel as an example, the gray cast iron smelted by local methods can be used as the main raw material for large-scale industrial steelmaking. And these hand-cranked machines and earthen furnaces for local iron smelting are sparsely distributed in small cities and small villages. However, it is a pity that neither the Chinese nor the Japanese authorities have paid attention to their importance to the national economy in the past few years, and they have not intentionally supported them, allowing them to develop or decline on their own.

In order to increase supplies, we must pay attention to the production of small and medium-sized industries in the future. First, we must do our best to provide financial assistance to small and medium-sized industrial producers. However, we must pay attention to avoiding the so-called "defects of industrial loans" of the Chongqing regime, because only a part of the larger enterprises can obtain industrial loans in Chongqing, and small and medium-sized industries cannot enjoy them. Because to obtain a loan, there must be fixed assets as collateral or as a standard for borrowing. But what can a craftsman mortgage? They have no material credit, and they are not qualified in terms of personnel. Therefore, if we copy Chongqing's industrial loan methods, the financial difficulties of small and medium-sized industries cannot be solved. How can we achieve development and production? It is best to form the dispersed small and medium-sized industries and craftsmen into a collective, and the bank will use this collective organization as the target of loans. This small and medium-sized industrial collective can also strive for production and construction under the leadership of the government and in the form of its own autonomy.

Secondly, there is the issue of raw materials. Generally speaking, the raw materials for small and medium-sized industries are all local products, which was not a problem in the first place. However, due to difficulties in transportation and other reasons, the raw materials for small and medium-sized industries are in extreme shortage. For example, if they cannot buy cotton yarn, small and medium-sized textile industries will have to stop work. Also, even if raw materials can be purchased, these raw materials pass through many checkpoints, and the cost is huge, which is enough to reduce the courage of small and medium-sized industrial producers to engage in production. Therefore, unless we do not want to develop production, otherwise, the methods that restrict the production of small and medium-sized industries—especially in terms of personnel—must be thoroughly changed.

In addition, on the one hand, it is necessary to reduce the burden on small and medium-sized industrialists, eliminate some unnecessary taxes and fees, improve their production morale, and enhance their production capacity. On the other hand, it is also necessary to guide them according to the situation, improve the production technology of small and medium-sized industries, improve their production efficiency, and continuously innovate the design of products to reach the level of standardization. Most importantly, it lies in giving small and medium-sized industrial production the opportunity to develop freely, on the one hand, removing all unreasonable artificial obstacles, and on the other hand, providing practical assistance in various aspects. If we treat them with the methods used to deal with monopoly capital, it will be like using a sledgehammer to crack a nut. In fact, this sledgehammer is not suitable.

In short, to develop wartime industrial production, we must revitalize the production of small and medium-sized industries. To revitalize the production of small and medium-sized industries, we must provide convenience in finance, strive to reduce taxes and fees, study and improve technology, and ensure that they can obtain cheap raw materials. In particular, we must give them the opportunity to develop freely, and vigorously promote cooperative undertakings in various places. What needs to be emphasized in particular is that in order to consolidate the wartime national economy and to supplement the material needs of the Greater East Asia War, the production of small and medium-sized industries and the production of various industrial and mining industries must be viewed from the perspective of how to develop them. The ancients said, "If the people are well-off, with whom will the ruler be lacking?" This famous saying can also be applied to the issue of developing wartime industries today. Of course, today we cannot forget to tighten the money supply and strictly prohibit hoarding when talking about increasing production, otherwise all efforts will inevitably be affected.

Nanjing, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Xiao Shuxuan, President of the Military Council, told Haitong News Agency reporter Trentel yesterday that the current task of the Chinese New Army, which began to be reorganized in October of last year, is to protect the rear of the Japanese army. After this task is completed, China will further participate in actual battles, but there is no precise plan to announce at present, because the military negotiations between China and Japan have not yet concluded. China has unlimited manpower, which is not only a source of troops, but can also be mobilized for industrial development. When Xiao was asked whether China's coast had been strengthened to defend against possible attacks, he replied yes, and said that the recent addition of several warships should be regarded as having strengthened the defense of China's coast and estuaries.

### Between the Caucasus and the Don River, German Counterpressure Continues to Increase; Unprecedented Fierce Fighting in Stalingrad; Gaps in German Lines Have Been Successfully Filled

German Headquarters, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Today's German war report stated that the Soviet offensive on the Eastern Front yesterday was still unsuccessful, with heavy losses in manpower and materials. A total of 87 tanks were destroyed. The Soviet army on the southern route of the Eastern Front was annihilated by about one division, and more than a thousand were captured by the German army. Since December 6 of last year, the German army has destroyed a total of 511 Soviet tanks in the Great Don River Bend. Enemy troops attacked the Don River Hungarian army positions and were severely damaged and repulsed. There were only local battles on the middle route. The Soviet army's attack southeast of Lake Ilmen was also unsuccessful, with 24 tanks lost. Traffic on the Murmansk route continued to be bombed by German aircraft.

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) Military personnel said that the fierce fighting between the Caucasus and the Don River has not yet ended, and the counterpressure exerted by the German army on the enemy is continuing to increase. The Soviet offensive launched on Stalingrad on Sunday was the most fierce ever seen there. The Soviet army had no less than 16 divisions, including 6 tank brigades. Under the fierce attack, only one place in the German line was broken through, but it was immediately filled by the German army. The enemy suffered extremely heavy losses. The Soviet offensive between the Volga River and the Don River continued without progress. The German army continued to occupy several villages downstream of the Don River. In northern Caucasus, the Soviet army once窜into the rear of the German army, but was immediately driven back by the German mechanized troops.

Berne, Switzerland, 12th (Havas) Berlin Radio Station issued a message this morning stating that after German reinforcements arrived in the besieged city of Rzhev, the strength of the German garrison in that area has been enhanced. The Soviet side claimed that the Red Army continued to advance in northern Caucasus and recovered several strongholds. The Red Army is advancing downstream of the Don River, and the German army is resisting fiercely. The Red Army also recovered several strongholds in Zinovievski. Southwest of Rzhev, the Red Army and the German army fought fiercely. According to Berlin news, fierce fighting is currently underway in the Don River Basin, the Caucasus, Stalingrad, and the Don River Bend. The Red Army's winter offensive this year has suffered heavy losses in soldiers and materials, which is no different from previous years. From the 1st to the 10th of this month, the Red Army lost 624 tanks and a large number of aircraft. The Red Army launched an offensive in Stalingrad, and the intensity was unprecedented. After a period of time, 60 tanks were lost. The Red Army used 6 infantry divisions and 6 tank brigades in the offensive. Although several places in the German line were broken through, the gaps were filled after a counterattack. The Red Army suffered heavy losses, the entire army collapsed, and fled in panic. Between the Don River and the Volga River, the Red Army launched repeated offensives with the help of tanks, but was repulsed by the German army. The German army continued to advance and occupied several positions. On the Don River Bend, the German army made progress. The surrounded Red Army broke a gap in the German line, but this army is now in danger of being annihilated.

Berlin, 12th (Haitong News Agency) According to the latest information from the front line, the German army continued to win in the final stage of the major offensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front. In the first ten days of January, German ground forces destroyed 624 Soviet tanks, which shows the intensity of the fighting. Most of the destroyed tanks were made in the Soviet Union, and the number of tanks made in Britain and the United States was very small. The center of the fierce fighting is still in the Caucasus and Don River regions. On Sunday, the Soviet army launched an offensive with the assistance of tanks, but was repulsed in all places. As a result of the German infantry and tank columns launching counterattacks in many places, they must have gained some territory and annihilated several Soviet teams. The German side believes that the German army has defended well in the war on the central route of the Eastern Front. The Soviet army continues to attack the Rzhev base with large forces, but the German defense line has not been shaken so far. There are also fierce battles southeast of Lake Ilmen. German infantry and tank columns have destroyed 450 enemy armored vehicles in that area in the past six weeks. The Soviet army's reserve strength after the offensive at various points is quite strong, but the Soviet army often uses its old tactics, that is, launching an offensive with elite troops and leaving the more secondary troops as reserves.

### Tunisian Heavy Rains Turn Plains into Swamps; Only Fighting in the Foothills of the Atlas Mountains; Military Operations Elsewhere Obstructed

Haitong News Agency from the German Headquarters, 12th: This afternoon, the German war report stated that German and Italian aircraft were extremely active on the Libyan front. In Tunisia, enemy troops launched local attacks on our outposts, and fighting is still ongoing. Enemy artillery positions and concentrated trucks in northern Tunisia were bombed by our aircraft, and five enemy aircraft were shot down.

Havas News Agency from Berne, 11th: Heavy rains have continued on the Tunisian front today, and the plains have turned into swamps, like ponds, making it difficult for mechanized units to move. Except for fierce fighting in the foothills of the Atlas Mountains, where both armies continue fighting despite the muddy roads, military operations in other areas have been obstructed. Currently, the Axis forces' positions extend from Cape Negro west of Bizerte, passing 15 miles west of Mateur, and west of Medjez el Bab, crossing the Medjerda River, then circling westward to reach Bou Arada, and then turning south to reach the Hammamet area. Important coastal ports such as Bizerte, Sousse, and Sfax, as well as the fertile land of the Medjerda River valley, are mostly under the control of the Axis forces. This area is economically crucial, not only suitable for animal husbandry but also rich in fruit trees. In the vicinity of Tunis alone, there are one million olive trees.

Haitong News Agency from Lisbon, 12th: According to the New York Affairs Weekly, the Allies have not yet decided on a strategy. Senior military authorities are likely discussing this issue, and a decision may be made within a few months. The United States will not take large-scale action before a strategic decision is made. The army and navy do not want to establish a separate air force to avoid handing over army and navy aircraft.

Haitong News Agency from Berlin, 12th: Responsible parties also stated that German and British aircraft engaged in aerial combat on the Tunisian border on Sunday afternoon. German aircraft shot down one British fighter and one bomber each. German aircraft attacked the machinery depot of a train station in southern Tunisia, achieving significant results.

Haitong News Agency from Berlin, 12th: On Sunday, German aircraft launched a surprise attack on British motorcades and tank convoys near Sedes on the Libyan front, destroying many British vehicles. British aircraft intercepted the attack, and two were shot down by German aircraft.

### Sweden's New Parliament Holds Its First Session; The King Reaffirms His Determination to Maintain Neutrality

Haitong News Agency from Stockholm, 12th: Today, King Gustaf of Sweden addressed the first session of the 1943 Parliament, stating that Sweden is determined to maintain neutrality. Although the international situation is becoming increasingly dangerous, Sweden's position remains unchanged. Sweden maintains friendly relations with foreign countries, but as long as the war continues, Sweden will continue to defend against all crises. Therefore, in recent months, necessary military measures have continued to be taken. It is hoped that the Swedish people will be cautious in their words and deeds and not give outsiders any doubt about Sweden's determination to maintain neutrality. Only by uniting can the nation's security be guaranteed.

Haitong News Agency from Stockholm, 12th: During the first session of the new parliament today, Swedish Prime Minister Hansson declared to Social Democratic Party members that people from all walks of life in Sweden do not seem enthusiastic about the National Unity Association. However, this can still be considered an important part of Swiss political life during the New Year. People should consider post-war issues, but at present, maintaining Sweden's security is most important.

### The British Empire Will Eventually Become a Thing of the Past

### Roosevelt Submits Budget Message to Congress; Military Spending Will Increase Sharply Next Year; Manpower Mobilization Will Become More Difficult

Allied News Agency from Lisbon, 12th: According to news from Washington, President Roosevelt yesterday submitted a budget proposal for the next fiscal year to Congress, with total expenditures reaching ten billion US dollars, of which 1.6 billion dollars must be raised through increased taxes and savings. As Americans must make sacrifices in all aspects, President Roosevelt, after explaining the war expenses in detail, spoke about the manpower mobilization situation, saying that the U.S. manpower mobilization has now entered a more difficult stage. Most of the manpower needed next year will be taken from secondary jobs and those who have not yet been employed. As for the food problem, due to the needs of the U.S. and Allied forces, certain foods will inevitably be in short supply. The variety on the American menu must be further reduced, and the average per capita consumption of ordinary people will be limited to 500 yuan per year, which is about 25% less than in 1941.

One Hundred Billion Yuan for War

Central News Agency from Buenos Aires, 12th: According to a dispatch from Washington, President Roosevelt attended a joint session of the House and Senate at 1:00 PM on the 11th, submitting a budget message for the fiscal year 1943-1944, roughly as follows: (1) The budget proposal for 1943 represents the maximum scale of war effort, so the total expenditure is 109 billion US dollars, of which 100 billion US dollars is specifically for war purposes. As for the treasury's income, it is expected to increase by 16 billion US dollars through increased taxes or forced savings. Since the Pearl Harbor attack, the United States' monthly war expenses have reached 2 billion US dollars. Recently, it has exceeded 6 billion US dollars per month, so in the new fiscal year, it will reach 8 billion US dollars per month. (2) In order to carry out combat operations and in view of the reduction in unemployment, expenditures on relief efforts and other public works will be reduced. (3) In 1943, the military and munitions production sectors must mobilize another 6 million people. The government has put forward various opinions regarding the prices of agricultural products, so it is requested that the House and Senate remain united and form a national group.

U.S. Will Issue Large Amounts of Government Bonds

Central News Agency from Buenos Aires, 12th: According to a dispatch from Washington, President Roosevelt submitted to the House and Senate on the 11th that the total U.S. budget for the fiscal year 1943-1944 is 109 billion US dollars, of which 100 billion US dollars is for military expenditures. Compared with the total budget of President Roosevelt's budget message last year requesting the fiscal year 1943-1944, it is clear that military expenditures have increased sharply. This is an unprecedentedly large budget in American history. It is also estimated that the budget for the next fiscal year will be borne by the American people at 140 billion US dollars, accounting for 75% of the total, with an average burden of 819 US dollars per citizen. Therefore, the lives of the American people will be under even greater pressure. Roosevelt also explained that he would increase revenue by 16 billion US dollars through increased taxes and forced savings, but this would inevitably lead to a large increase in government bonds. The current total amount of U.S. government bonds is 113 billion US dollars, and it is expected that it will exceed 200 billion US dollars by the end of 1943. Although Roosevelt avoided explaining the use of military expenditures, informed sources speculate that the army's budget is about 62 billion US dollars and the navy's budget is about 22 billion US dollars.

Observations of Japanese Diplomatic Circles

Central News Agency from Tokyo, 12th: Regarding President Roosevelt's budget message to Congress on the 11th, people here generally do not pay much attention to it, thinking that any large budget proposal is not surprising. Their determination to defeat Britain and the United States has not been shaken by this. Diplomatic circles here made the following observations on Roosevelt's message: The amount of Roosevelt's budget this time is quite large, reaching three-quarters of the entire national income of the United States. We believe that there are many contradictions in it. Roosevelt boasted in the message about the increase in U.S. military production while warning of future difficulties in material and human resources. This proves that the unique method he adopted is to bluff. He also emphasized the meaning of the national war, which is a clear attempt by the U.S. government to further lower the living standards of its citizens. There are many people in the U.S. Congress who oppose Roosevelt's dictatorship. They also believe that many expenses in this huge budget should be thoroughly reviewed, which is a very interesting issue. He also explained that as a result of the implementation of this huge budget in the United States, government bonds will exceed 200 billion US dollars in 1944. They believe that this trend will inevitably bring about a crisis of inflation in the American economy. He repeatedly emphasized price controls in the message, ignoring the opposition of rural congressmen, which is quite puzzling. In previous messages, Roosevelt repeatedly emphasized the necessity of offense to the American people. Now, he emphasizes the necessity of increasing taxes. However, I wonder how the American people will bear the heavy pressure under this wartime situation. This is what we should pay attention to.

### Britain, America, and Chongqing Sign Agreements Separately, Renouncing Concessions and Extraterritorial Rights

Allied News Agency from Berne, 12th: Britain and the United States also signed agreements with the Chongqing government yesterday, renouncing concessions and extraterritorial rights in China. The British-Chongqing treaty was signed in Chongqing by Song Ziwen, Foreign Minister of the Chongqing government, and Sir Horace James Seymour, the British Ambassador. The British Dominions signed agreements with the Chongqing authorities separately. The U.S.-Chongqing treaty was signed in Washington with the same content, stipulating that friendly, commercial, and navigation treaties will be negotiated within six months after the end of the war. It also declared the abandonment of the right to station troops in several places and establish a consular guard in Beijing granted by the Boxer Protocol, as well as the abandonment of the Shanghai International Settlement and the Amoy Kulangsu International Settlement.

Japan's Return of Concessions Makes Britain and America Deeply Uneasy

Central News Agency from Tokyo, 12th: According to a dispatch from the Allied News Agency's correspondent in Berne, Britain and the United States feel deeply uneasy about the signing of agreements between the Chinese and Japanese governments for the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights. Therefore, on the 11th, they also announced the conclusion of an agreement with Chongqing to abolish extraterritorial rights. However, in reality, their forces have been completely driven out of the Greater East Asia region, so there is no object to abolish. The party with which they signed the agreement, Chongqing, is only a local government located in a remote border area. The so-called agreements of the British and American governments are actually of no value. Although the British government still insists that this agreement has considerable significance and that British-Chongqing relations have been redeveloped on an equal footing, the new agreement makes no mention of the return of concessions and Hong Kong. It is only a legalistic argument. Therefore, it is not difficult to infer from this that the British government is unwilling to treat Chongqing equally.

### Japanese Hospital Ship Anchored in Yangon Harbor Bombed

Central News Agency from Syonan, 12th: Three enemy aircraft bombed a Japanese hospital ship anchored in Yangon Harbor on the afternoon of the 4th of this month. At that time, the weather was extremely clear, and the ship was painted white in accordance with international law and had correct markings. Even from a long distance, it could be identified as a hospital ship. The aircraft dared to deliberately drop bombs on it. This kind of behavior violates international law and is intolerable by heaven. It is the same as the enemy submarine's illegal attack on a Japanese hospital ship in the South China Sea last January. This proves the true face of the United Kingdom and the United States, which advocate humanitarianism. Unimpeded navigation, no passenger deaths.

### The Difficulties of Guilin Manufacturers: Insufficient Raw Materials, Financial Difficulties, Delayed Transportation, and Labor Shortage

Five years ago, that area was still a barren plain, but now, after the cultivation, tilling, and irrigation by thousands of workers, magnificent new shoots have sprouted from the gravel, and a new industrial zone is growing. The establishment of these hundreds of large and small mechanical iron factories has directly and indirectly contributed a lot of strength. They have a history of struggle in this arduous process. Today, they are aware of the current darkness and are facing some difficulties. These hardships are all serious practical problems.

Arduous Process

They all came from the coastal areas, each willing to move around to preserve their assets and develop industry, either relocating machinery for thousands of miles or starting anew here. They were firm in their beliefs and always able to stand on the production line and engage in development. Just looking at their achievements in recent years shames those wavering capitalists or merchants who hoard goods for speculation. Their energy is focused on researching and experimenting with various industrial substitutes. For example, Mr. Shen Yijia's research on internal combustion problems has discovered that anthracite can replace gasoline, bituminous coal can be used to make calcium carbide, and bituminous coal can be refined to make gasoline, solving many fuel supply problems. The manufacture of anthracite gas engines and the power engines manufactured by the China Power Engine Manufacturing Factory have also solved part of the power problem. Other examples include the改造 of machines, such as various factories engaging in the conversion of cars to charcoal engines and alcohol vehicles, which has also solved some transportation difficulties. Furthermore, the Junwu Machine Factory has designed and改造 agricultural tools, such as rice threshers, corn shellers, centrifuges (i.e., sugar making machines), sugarcane presses, Yang-style plows, cultivators, flour mills, vine cutters, and wooden water pumps. These are mostly made using a few raw materials and simple machinery, which has increased the work efficiency of agricultural production. These contributions are not small.

Although they suffer from the difficulty of obtaining raw materials, they are not discouraged by this. They try to collect raw materials, utilize waste materials, and use them sparingly. They say: "For example, if copper is the most scarce, then we will not stick to the old rules of the past that it must be copper. Within the possible range, we can reduce the use of copper and replace it with better iron. Although this method shortens the life of the machine, if a copper machine can be used for ten years, while an iron machine can only be used for five years, the lifespan is only half as long. However, we only need to use these machines for five years, because after five years, copper and iron production and various situations will change. At that time, we will use all-copper to制造 again."

Many things show that the monopolistic concept of "competitors are enemies" that factories used to want to overwhelm other people's production has made progress and changed. This can be seen in their work of mutual cooperation and mutual adjustment and borrowing of raw materials. They deeply feel that individual strength is weak today, and problems cannot be solved without collective strength. There are still many difficulties that need to be solved in front of them, but they are beyond their ability to overcome.

Steel Problem

Steel is the main raw material for industry, and the hundreds of factories are currently frowning and planning how to obtain these raw materials. They are just worried. According to what they know, steel production is so scarce, and the steelmaking and ironmaking industry has not yet achieved large-scale results, but maintaining the status quo is not a problem.

Although the ×× Steel Plant has a monthly production of more than 100 tons, the factories along the Xiang-Gui line need more than 300 tons per month, and private factories cannot expect to share the benefits. Therefore, many factories are trying to find their own ways. The China Power Engine Manufacturing Factory is currently engaged in self-sufficiency in raw materials. Mr. Tang Zhongping, the factory director, said: "Currently, we still need to plan for what we can do ourselves. Hoping often disappoints people. Now there is a bad phenomenon, that is, on the one hand, factories urgently need steel, but on the other hand, no one cherishes these raw materials. The phenomenon of waste and abandonment can often be seen. Many public things would rather be abandoned on the road than be taken and used by those who need them."

The steel needed by civilian factories in Guilin can originally be purchased freely from the Hunan ×× Steel Plant, but there are three difficulties: (1) The full price must be paid in advance when ordering; (2) There must be a gap of more than six months between the time of ordering and the time of delivery; (3) Transportation is difficult. These three difficulties not only make it difficult for small private factories, but also make well-funded manufacturers feel helpless. Taking the first and second difficulties as an example, the current price must be paid in full when ordering, and the goods will not be delivered until half a year after the money is paid. Needless to say, factories with a shortage of capital, even those with considerable capital, may not be able to do it, not to mention the biggest difficulty - transportation, which is even more difficult to solve! Therefore, going to Hunan to purchase raw materials can almost be said to be a dead end.

Urgent Need for Power

The problem of power supply is as important to them as the need for raw materials, and at the same time, they cannot get any help as with raw materials. The power required by the factories in the ×× industrial zone is mostly supplied by the Xiang-Gui Railway Power Plant, and the larger factories generate their own electricity. Everyone feels that it is not enough and considers it a rather serious problem.

The Guangxi Power Plant, which is responsible for supplying electricity, naturally also has its own difficulties in meeting the demand, but it is said that the power plant still has two diesel engines equipped with charcoal stoves that have not been started. In addition, the Xiang-Gui Railway Bureau has added a new power plant, the purpose of which is to supply power to a number of factories. The plant has not yet generated electricity, and the amount requested by people who want to pre-order electricity has already exceeded the amount that the click can supply by more than double. This shows the urgent need for power in Guilin's factories. In the future, how to limit the waste of electricity use in Guilin, how to rationally allocate it to various factories that need power, and how to strengthen power equipment are all the expectations of general civilian factories and also the problems that the power plant authorities should pay close attention to.

Financial Difficulties

The working capital of private factories is gradually becoming sluggish, precisely because of the difficulty of purchasing raw materials and the difficulty of transportation, the impact of rising prices, etc. A factory owner who often has 300,000 yuan of working capital said with great emotion: "Before the war, we opened a factory in Wuxi, and 30,000 to 40,000 yuan of working capital was enough to turn around. Now it is too different. At present, it is often not easy to have 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in cash as turnover. For example, if you want to go to Hunan to order a batch of goods, let's not say much, buy more than ten tons of iron, on average, you have to pay more than 100,000 yuan in advance. Coal also costs 4,000 to 5,000 yuan per ton, and buying 40 to 50 tons at a time costs more than 200,000 yuan. The 300,000 to 400,000 yuan in cash can only be used to pre-order one payment for goods. It is not easy to turn around for other uses. And it takes half a year to order once before it can be obtained, and then it can be exchanged for cash after engaging in production." A factory with 300,000 yuan of working capital has such difficulties, and it is even more conceivable for others. Applying for a loan from a bank? First, it is not easy to get it; second, banks are not interested in developing industry at all.

Transportation Workers

In addition to the difficulty in finding vehicles, there are also difficulties in the inspections at checkpoints. According to Mr. Shen Yijia: In addition to the need for steel in his factory, because he also has to engage in centralized research and experimentation, he needs some chemical drugs, and these are mostly foreign goods. Sometimes he has to buy them elsewhere. However, after buying the goods and finding a car, it is still empty, because on the way, the inspection checkpoints along the way either say that materials are flowing back or that industrial raw materials are being transported "outward", and the inspection and detention are even more difficult.

Secondly, there is a shortage of technicians. Although the number of skilled workers has increased a lot after the war, the scope of industrial production has also increased and expanded, and new factories are being added everywhere, needing workers. And a worker needs at least four or five years of work experience to be considered skilled. The rate of increase in new factories is faster than the supply of workers, which has become a phenomenon of many factories and few workers. Those new factories that cannot find workers will find them from old factories. Everyone bids against each other in the open and snatches in the dark, causing those workers to waver often. This unstable life makes it impossible to improve the efficiency of workers, which invisibly affects the reduction of production.

There were originally many Hong Kong and Kowloon　national technicians, but not many participated in the work of private factories. Some of them left because the factory equipment here was incomplete, life was hard, and wages were low, and they could not settle down. (Sent on December 15, 1942)

### Increasing Number of Corpses on the Frozen Roads due to Cold Weather, Winter Relief Scope Urgently Needs to be Expanded, Municipal Government Prepares 2 Million Yuan for Relief, Relief Committee Distributes 3,000 Sets of Winter Clothing

For the 31st Winter Relief in Shanghai Special Municipality, the Municipal Government authorities decided to expand the event, with a planned relief fund of 2 million yuan. The Municipal Government allocated 500,000 yuan, and the remaining 1.5 million yuan needs to be raised from all walks of life in Shanghai. However, the amount is very large and needs to be raised from various sources. Ling Xianwen, Director of the Municipal Social Affairs Bureau, told the Central News Agency reporter yesterday that the draft preparation plan has been formulated, and the fundraising methods are divided into three categories: (1) Group donations, with various trade associations in the city donating separately; (2) Individual donations, with the Shanghai Special Municipality 31st Annual Winter Relief Fundraising Committee organized by the Municipal Government issuing letters to solicit donations from well-known philanthropists in society;

Charitable Fundraising

(3) Holding charitable competitions to raise funds: (A) Horse Racing Grand Champagne, entrusted to the Horse Racing General Association to organize. The Grand Champagne competition will be held on the 30th of this month. Ten percent of the fees collected will be used for the Horse Racing Hall's expenses, 80% will be used as prize money, and the remaining amount will be divided into three parts for the 工部局 charitable donations, friendly countries' charitable organization expenses, and winter relief; (B) A charitable football match will be held on the 17th of this month, inviting the Chinese and Western Leagues to compete at Jiaozhou Park; (C) Peking Opera charitable performances will be held for three days from the 25th to the 27th of this month, taking turns on the Tianchan Stage, the Grand Stage, and the Renewal Stage, inviting famous performers from all over Shanghai to perform voluntary plays. Tickets are divided into several types: 100 yuan, 50 yuan, 20 yuan, 15 yuan, and 10 yuan. All income, except for expenses, will be used for winter relief funds; (D) Fundraising through broadcasting, inviting famous artists from all over Shanghai in Shenqu Opera, Cantonese Opera, Yue Opera, and comedy. The radio station and time are still under negotiation; (E) Fundraising through storytelling, inviting storytellers and commentators from all over Shanghai to perform together, and using the ticket income to supplement the relief funds. However, the time and venue are also under negotiation.

Distributing Relief Clothing

Currently, winter relief work in Shanghai is booming. Under this freezing weather, the Shanghai Branch of the Central Relief Committee's expenses for this winter relief are set at 450,000 yuan. In addition to subsidizing groups and self-run porridge factories and shelters, it has now also decided to start clothing relief.

Distribution Date and Location

On the 15th, 16th, and 17th of this month, from 9:00 am to 12:00 pm, the branch will distribute cotton clothing at 1361 Xinzha Road. Staff will be sent in advance to carry clothing tickets and distribute them to homeless beggars on the roads, ordering them to go to the branch on time to receive the clothing. When issuing tickets, pay special attention to beggars with thin and tattered clothes, record their names, genders, ages, origins, and whether they have addresses. When they come to receive the clothing on time, the supervisors will carefully verify and distribute it. If there is anything suspicious, it will be deducted. It is reported that the branch will distribute about 3,000 sets of clothing this time. In view of the dense population of urban poor, the distribution is concentrated, so that a part of the extremely poor who call for being frozen to death on the streets can have clothes and feel the　gratitude, and a letter is sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to send personnel to supervise the distribution at the branch at that time.

Three Routes for Distributing Tickets, Authorities Supervise Distribution

The detailed clothing distribution methods are as follows: (1) Distribution method: distribute tickets in advance and receive clothing within a time limit; (2) Ticket distribution routes: divided into three routes. The first route starts from Xiaoshadu Road to Robison Road, turns onto Putuo Road, passes through McGonagall Road, and folds into Wuding Road. The second route starts from Xinzha Road, turns onto Hart Road, folds into Hager Road to Hongqiao, then turns to Xujiahui and returns from Fuli Road via Albert Road. The third route starts from Nicheng Bridge, passes through Yu Qiaqing Road, the Great World, to Nanyang Bridge, and then to Huanghe Road; (3) Each route has one staff member and one worker; (4) A letter is sent to the Shanghai Special Municipal Government to send personnel to supervise the distribution at the meeting at that time, and a letter is sent to the Jing'an Temple Police Station to send arresters to maintain order on a daily basis during the clothing distribution period.

Countless Frozen Corpses, Too Horrible to Bear

Yesterday (the 11th), the weather in the city was extremely cold, with temperatures below freezing, which was rare in recent years. The piercing wind and freezing water caused the poor who were stranded and sleeping on the streets to freeze to death everywhere, which was truly unbearable to see. According to inquiries made by the Central News Agency reporter to various corpse collection charities, the Tongren Fuyuan Hall collected 13 large corpses and 15 children's corpses in the South City. The French Concession branch collected 24 large corpses and more than 20 small corpses. A hundred people died in one night of piercing wind, which is truly a tragic situation in the world. According to the person in charge of Tongren Fuyuan Hall, "The rumor that the corpses were wrapped in straw nests due to the depletion of wooden boards for transporting corpses is unfounded. The current stock of wooden boards is still sufficient, but it is true that two nameless corpses are placed in one coffin. At the same time, the funds of various charities are currently in short supply, and it is hoped that all sectors of society will contribute and help each other."

### Warehouse Industry Will Increase Warehouse Rent, Goods Expiring in the Future Must Be Cleared Out, Fees Will Be Doubled for Extension

The city's various warehouses, storage facilities, and cold storage facilities, after an agreement with the industry investigation agency the other day (the 11th), decided to increase storage fees, and also give a considerable increase to the porter's carrying fees. At the same time, it was also decided that goods that have expired must be cleared out on schedule. If an extension is required, the fees will be doubled.

### Authorities Reconsidering Flour Exchange for Wheat Products

After the Noodles Industry and Cookie, Noodle and Fried Dough Stick Industry Associations submitted five opinions to the 工部局 authorities, requesting a change in the method of exchanging flour for wheat products, a senior official of the 工部局 has already investigated and expressed that he will submit it to the 工部局's board meeting on Thursday for discussion. According to the two industries, since the two industry associations notified members to implement the method of exchanging flour for wheat products, the business of various wheat product stores has plummeted. If this continues, the future of the two industries will be unimaginable. Therefore, the Noodles Industry sent Wang Fuxin and others as representatives to the flour stock again yesterday to make requests, asking for normal allocations.

### After the Implementation of the New Grain Control Measures, Household Rice Will Be Increased Again, Ensuring that It Meets the Quantity Needed by Each Person

In order to regulate the people's food and coordinate the distribution of grain, the authorities implemented new control measures. Starting from the 13th, it was announced that the transportation of major food grains without official permission is strictly prohibited, and hoarding and black market transactions will be cracked down on. Violators will be severely punished. Yesterday, it was learned from the rice industry that after the authorities adopted the new control measures, they have negotiated a cooperative method for regulating the food of Shanghai residents. In addition to being responsible for dredging the source, a sufficient allocation will be given to meet legitimate needs. Regarding the quantity of grain allocated per capita in this period, it was decided to increase it to 2.5 to 3 liters, and flour will continue to be allocated. The contracted rice shops in the 界内 have been approved to receive purchase orders from the Grain Office on the 14th, pay and pick up the goods. The actual allocation quantity will be clear at that time.

French Concession Adopts the Same Steps

The French Concession authorities urge the public to pay attention to the announcement issued by the Japanese Army and Navy authorities on January 12 regarding the prohibition of secret transactions of major food grains. Now the French authorities are fully cooperating with the Japanese authorities and have decided to take various effective measures to prevent the secret transactions of these food grains and ensure the fairness of their distribution. The authorities firmly believe that in the current situation, they will be able to obtain the full cooperation of the public to facilitate the　implementation of various measures taken in the future and achieve the goal of distributing the people's food in the best possible condition. Those who do not respect the various measures announced thereafter will be severely punished.

### Nanhui District Commissioner Replaced by City Government Appointee, Zhang Baotang Resigns, Li Bingyi Succeeds

Zhang Baotang, Commissioner of the Nanhui Special District Office, has submitted his resignation due to illness and has been approved. The vacancy has been filled by Li Bingyi, appointed by the Municipal Government, to handle the handover in the short term.

### The Newspaper's Fourth Scholarship Program Receives Encouragement from All Sectors, The Society's Expectations are High, and Colleagues Dare Not Fail

Applications for the fourth Shen Bao Reader Scholarship will begin on the 15th. After the news was announced, the newspaper received letters from readers yesterday, offering much encouragement, and Mr. Yin and Chuneng Middle School donated free places. Details of each situation are recorded as follows.

Unnamed Elderly

The unnamed elderly person is enthusiastic about helping students. He donated a large amount of money when the newspaper's reader scholarship was founded, and has continued to donate and raise funds in successive sessions, amounting to more than 10,000 yuan. Yesterday, the Dehua Primary School sent a letter stating that the school had recently been instructed by the unnamed elderly person to set up two free places and four half-fee places, and asked the newspaper's reader scholarship association to introduce outstanding students from poor families to the school. The elderly person once wrote to the newspaper,　"I am nearly sixty years old and entering my twilight years. I run a small business and my ability is weak.　I am willing to do my best and make a small contribution." His sincerity and enthusiasm are worthy of admiration.

Chuneng Middle School

Yesterday, Chuneng Middle School, a private school in Shanghai located at 770 Lane, Niuzhuang Road, sent a letter saying, "Your newspaper's scholarship program benefits poor students and is deeply admired. Our school is willing to donate three high school and three junior high school places, waiving tuition and miscellaneous fees, to express our support." The school will hold a new student exam on the 24th. The school's consideration for poor students and its willingness to help students is worthy of admiration.

Guidance from Educational Pioneers in the Previous Scholarship

When the previous scholarship was held, it was during the oppressive heat of summer. The newspaper's colleagues served under the guidance of various sectors and the scholarship committee, which was their duty. The committee members, such as Mr. Shen Siliang, President of St. John's University, Mr. Chen Qingshi of the 工部局 Chinese Education Department, Mr. Lu Gaoyi, General Manager of the World Book Company, Ms. Nie Lingyu, Principal of the 工部局 Girls' School, and Mr. Zhao Zongyu, Principal of the Second Chinese Vocational School, were all pioneers in the education field and have long been respected by society. They came to the newspaper in the scorching heat to attend meetings and instruct the progress of the work, so that colleagues could avoid failure. The gentlemen's benefits to the scholars were commendable. In addition, Mr. Ding Guangxun and Ms. Xu Xuehai of the YMCA hosted the previous exam, working tirelessly, so that the newspaper could live up to the trust of the donors. This is what colleagues want to tell the donors in addition to gratitude.

The Enthusiasm of the Donors in Previous Sessions is Exemplary

Since the three sessions, all sectors have enthusiastically donated hundreds of thousands of dollars. Although the donations vary in amount, the enthusiasm　is the same.

### Municipal Government and Concession Authorities Set Up Vagrant Work Training Center, Xin Puyu Hall in the South City Agrees to Lend Part of the Remaining Houses

The standard of living is increasing day by day, so that the beggars on the streets are everywhere, which is unbearable to see. The Municipal Government and the two Concession authorities, in view of this, could not bear to stand idly by. Therefore, after several negotiations, 3 million yuan of funds were raised, which was divided and borne by the three authorities, and entrusted to Li Sihao, who is in charge of the Shanghai Branch of the World Red Swastika Society of China, to set up a vagrant work training center, collect vagrants, and teach them work, with the expectation of learning skills and becoming self-reliant.

### Intensifying the Handling of Enemy Property, Application Period Extended to February 9th

Most of the enemy properties in the city are actually owned by Chinese people. In the past, general real estate merchants and industrial and commercial entrepreneurs in Shanghai often liked to hang foreign business signs. After the outbreak of the Pacific War and the change in the situation in the Concession, these Chinese properties with foreign business signs were　sealed with　British and American property. After sealing, if the owner can provide formal evidence or a considerable contract to prove that it is not? property, he can request the authorities to unseal it. However, since last year, only one-fifth of the Chinese properties in the city that have requested the lifting of the enemy property disposal have been unsealed. It is known that after the country joined the war, the enemy property issue needs to be resolved urgently. Therefore, the authorities have issued another notice stating that all enemy properties that need to apply for lifting must complete the request before February 9th, and there will be no further extension.

### Various Cultural Groups Support the War

Anti-British and American Association Issues an Appeal to the People

The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association, since the National Government issued its declaration of war against Britain and America on the 9th of this month, immediately expressed its determination to lead the people in continuing its efforts against Britain and America. The association's directors, Yuan Lvdeng, Wen Lanting, and others, sent a telegram to Chairman Wang, expressing their support for the war. They also followed the Propaganda Department's instructions, printing and distributing slogans throughout the city in support of the government's entry into the war, and issuing an appeal to the people, elaborating on the significance of the declaration of war against Britain and America. The main points of the association's appeal to the people are as follows: "For over a hundred years, China has suffered countless acts of aggression from Britain and America. Now that the National Government has officially declared war on Britain and America, China can not only pursue internal rejuvenation but also enhance its international standing. The ultimate goal of entering the war is to share weal and woe with friendly nations and fight shoulder to shoulder. Our association has been engaged in the anti-British and American movement on behalf of the Chinese people for more than a year. Now, under the call to join the war, we are determined to mobilize the people with all our strength and work diligently. We sincerely hope that all compatriots will recognize that the enemies of East Asia, the British and American imperialists, must be overthrown with all our strength to complete China's rejuvenation and the liberation of the Asian nations."

Cultural Circles Hold a Symposium on Supporting the War

The Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office convened a symposium of cultural circles yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at its premises. Several dozen people from Shanghai's cultural circles, including Xu Liqiu and Liu Yu, attended. Secretary Ma Zongyao and Jiang Ke presided over the meeting. During the session, sincere support was expressed for the government's resolute entry into the war, and opinions were expressed on the future mission of the cultural circles. The general consensus was that cultural figures should adopt a frontline spirit, take up their pens, take on the responsibility of correcting people's erroneous thinking, and explain the sacred significance of the war to the people. Furthermore, they could use plays to expose the ambitions of the British and Americans and their oppression of East Asian nations. The mission of cultural figures is in fact even more important than that of soldiers on the front lines, etc. Later, it was resolved to send a telegram to Chairman Wang to express respect and support for the war. The telegram read: "To Chairman Wang of the National Government: After prolonged oppression, the nations of East Asia are bound to rise again. The Greater East Asia War is a historical turning point for the liberation of East Asia and the revival of China. Your Excellency, with insightful foresight, has resolutely led us into the war. We pledge our utmost sincerity to support the government, and under the guidance of the sole leader, to exert our utmost loyalty, to promote national policies, and to inspire the people to unite in their hatred of the enemy, so as to fulfill the responsibility of every citizen to save the nation. We are determined to work together to achieve the final victory of the Co-Prosperity Sphere and to implement Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism, thereby laying the foundation for the peace and prosperity of hundreds of millions of people of the same race. We send this telegram with the highest respect and earnest prayers. The Shanghai Cultural Circles Symposium in support of the government's entry into the war bows in reverence."

### Shanghai Qingxiang Branch Strictly Prohibits Troops from Demanding Supplies

The Shanghai Qingxiang Branch has previously instructed all teams in the Qingxiang areas not to demand any supplies from the local population. However, according to confidential reports, some unscrupulous elements, abusing their authority, are still demanding supplies from local areas, such as hiring boats and vehicles, procuring food, etc. Furthermore, if their demands are not met, they even arrest and severely flog people. Military personnel are supposed to defend the local area and protect the peace and security of the people, yet they dare to disregard the law, which is utterly deplorable. Therefore, we hereby reiterate the previous order: if any teams in the Qingxiang areas dare to disobey the order again and demand supplies from local areas, once verified or reported by victims, they will be strictly dealt with according to the law, as a warning to others.

### Strengthening Financial Strategies After Joining the War
### Adjustments to Financial Measures are Crucial
### Economic Policies in Central China are Poised for Reform

Authoritative sources reveal that now that our country's participation in the war has become a reality, the highest authorities are further studying how to strengthen the financial foundation. If the financial foundation cannot be strengthened, political power cannot be exercised. In terms of stabilizing finances and strengthening the gold standard, the authorities will make every effort to implement the following points in the future:

Ensuring Currency Value and Increasing Supply

(1) Regarding currency, the authorities' future policy for reserve certificates will be to increase their value, expand circulation, strengthen their financial network, and prevent their inflation. (2) Regarding price policy, local conditions should be taken into account to strengthen Chinese activities, and to establish relevant connections between resource procurement and distribution control agencies. (3) Developing above-ground and underground resources to ensure the supply of materials, with cotton, rice, and miscellaneous grains being the main agricultural products of Central China. The authorities will strive to increase the supply of these agricultural products. At the same time, it is necessary to promote the exchange of materials between Shanghai and various peaceful areas, and to strive for the revival of light industry. (4) Regarding trade, confirm the independence of Central China and seek to rationalize trade between Central China and Japan, North China, South China, and Southeast Asia.

Central China's Economy is Bound to Change

Furthermore, after China's entry into the war, the current economic policies in Central China must be comprehensively changed. (1) The current restrictions on the transfer of materials in Shanghai and various peaceful areas are implemented due to military needs and other factors. Now that the times have changed, these restrictions must be eased. (2) The inland economy should be guided towards self-sufficiency. (3) It has long been advocated that Chinese should be appointed as much as possible to the procurement agencies for distribution. Now that the time has come, it should be put into practice. (4) The connection between procurement and distribution agencies has always lacked organization, and this should be corrected in the future. (5) Since the Pacific War, the distribution of tobacco, matches, and candles to various peaceful areas has been limited. In the future, efforts should be made to rationalize the distribution.

### Party Affairs Meeting in Qingxiang District Concludes Yesterday

The Shanghai Qingxiang District Party Affairs Office of the Chinese Kuomintang held the Shanghai Qingxiang District Party Affairs Meeting on the 10th in the auditorium of the Zhoupu Party Office in Pudong, leading the people in the Qingxiang districts to cooperate in the East Asian War, sending a telegram to support the war, and issuing a declaration. The meeting lasted two days.

### Regulations on Interbank Lending Set Maximum Amounts
### Evaluation Discounts for Collateral
### Banks Have Settled Accounts and Resumed Mortgage Lending

The date for the general year-end closing for all businesses in the 31st year of the Republic of China has been decided as February 5th to 8th. Various businesses have been preparing accordingly, such as collecting outstanding customer accounts and transferring funds to repay overdrafts from various money houses. During this closing period, all transactions are limited to cash. Money houses have notified all their customers that previous overdrafts must be fully repaid before the end of the closing period. The methods for handling business before and after the general closing period will be submitted to the next standing committee meeting of the association for resolution. The time for the exchange of bills and all collection and return of bills will be decided by the Bank Joint Reserve Association and the Money Industry Joint Reserve.

Interbank Lending

After the Bank United Reserve Association established cooperation for interbank lending with member banks and money houses, it was stipulated that if banks and money houses need it for internal business, they may provide collateral to apply for interbank lending from the Bank United Association and the Money Reserve. The amount of interbank lending shall not exceed the total amount of the bank or money house's paid-up capital and public reserve. It is also stipulated that the evaluation discount for interbank lending collateral shall be 70% for government securities, 60% for Chinese commercial company bonds, 70% for Chinese commercial company stocks, but the evaluation amount shall not exceed the face value. Real estate in the concessions is discounted to 50% of the evaluation, and goods are discounted to 60% of the evaluation. However, the selection of goods is extremely cautious to avoid fueling speculation and hoarding.

Accommodating Loans

Since the banks and money houses have obtained interbank lending from the preparatory agencies, their own foundations have become more solid. In order to support the proper development of various industries, they are allowed to accommodate outstanding overdrafts for various customers. If reliable collateral such as goods is provided, mortgage loans may be granted, and credit loans may be granted at the discretion of each industry's credit. At the same time, now that the banks' annual closing period has passed, they have all resumed accepting mortgage loans from various industries.

### Passengers Traveling to Ningbo Must Present Citizen ID Cards to Purchase Tickets, Implemented on the 10th

Now that the Lunar New Year is approaching, the number of passengers traveling to Ningbo from this port is increasing daily, especially those taking the Ningshao and Mingdou No. 2 liners. It is reported that the ticket offices of these two liners, in order to avoid crowding when passengers purchase tickets, will, starting from the 10th of this month, require all passengers to first present their citizen ID cards or travel permits to reserve ship dates. After the company issues a reserved ship date certificate, stating the payment date, only after payment on that date can they exchange it for a ticket. Those without the above-mentioned documents will not be allowed to purchase tickets.

### French Consul General Stipulates Holidays for Japanese Festivals

French Consul General in Shanghai, Mr. Mary, issued an order stipulating that the French Municipal Council will henceforth take holidays to celebrate all important Japanese festivals.

It is understood that the Japanese festivals stipulated for holidays include: (1) February 11, Japanese National Foundation Day; (2) April 29, the Emperor's Birthday; (3) The Emperor Meiji's Birthday, Tencho-setsu. In addition, holidays will still be observed for Chinese festivals as usual. Catholic memorial festivals such as June 4 and November 1 will also be observed as holidays.

### Sino-Japanese National Policy Companies to Be Adjusted Soon, President of the Revitalization Company to Come to Shanghai

Since the National Government's entry into the war, in order to respond to the development of the new situation, based on the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty, the Sino-Japanese joint national policy companies will be adjusted. President Kodama of the Revitalization Company will come to Shanghai on the 15th to discuss this issue. The relevant companies of the Revitalization Company are also preparing. The direct targets of the adjustment are the Central China Silk, Central China Salt Industry, Central China Urban Automobile, and Central China Water Companies. The fundamental principles of the specific adjustment are roughly as follows: (1) The targets of adjustment, except for companies related to vehicle affairs, will be carried out gradually for general companies related to people's needs. (2) Increase the shares of the Chinese side in joint venture companies, increase Chinese staff, and concretely manage the company's operations. (3) The adjustment of national policy companies is not only aimed at the type of occupation, but also considers other conditions and adjustments based on other regional distinctions.

As for cotton fabric movement certificates, it is heard that the procedures for applying for them have begun.

### Woolen Fabrics Trade Rarely

Woolen fabric transactions are rare, partly because the inventory is gradually thinning, making it difficult to replenish sold items, and sellers are unwilling to sell; partly because shipping is not smooth, making delivery inconvenient; partly because scarcity makes things expensive, and prices continue to rise along with surcharges; and partly because actual sales are weakening and the end of the year is approaching, reducing buyers.

The price of large-style miscellaneous road "yuan" coins has slightly loosened as the recent quoted prices are slightly loose, but the market prices have not insisted.

### Hobbies and Life

—Hai Lin

After reading "A Type of Social Illness - Playing Mahjong" in this publication, indeed, this is a bad "hobby," and trying to cure it is not an easy task. "Prohibition of gambling" is certainly a positive method, but people will try every means to commit "gambling," although they have never heard of someone "starting a family by gambling," but "gambling," wanting to win money is still a secondary purpose. The main purpose is that people pursue hobbies after they are free, so those with weak will develop a gambling habit.

Researching this level can find that everyone has its hobbies, and all are regarded as a second life-like attention, so here is divided into good hobbies and bad hobbies.

There are many young people in society who learn to smoke before they can make money, and even run to dance halls, gambling halls... gradually embarking on the road of depravity. Although the profit-only bosses who open these paper-drunk gold fans places have to bear most of the responsibility, one aspect of the responsibility has to be borne by themselves. Some people are harmed by "playing along," thinking that "doing it occasionally" will not have any danger, but which one is not "a false step will cause eternal regret?"

Some young people loudly shout "boredom," yes, everyone feels bored when they are young, but they cannot take it as a plausible reason to seek comfort in stimulation, and the result is always getting deeper and deeper, so we should conversely use beneficial hobbies to break this boredom. Do not willfully embark on the path of destruction.

The environment cannot satisfy our desire for knowledge, which is a very good expression of young people's enthusiasm. Since this is the case, then we should use our own strength to pursue a rational and favorite aspect, and what we get in this aspect is often the most valuable and valuable part.

Young people should have good hobbies, for example, those who like to study books can often go to the library, which is a treasure house of knowledge, and I am afraid that you will not use it. I remember that when Sun Yat-sen was young, he was so poor that he was at a loss. Fortunately, many revolutionary comrades raised a considerable amount of money from overseas Chinese to take care of Sun Yat-sen's life, but who knew that he did not leave a penny and spent it all on buying books to read. As a result, life was still extraordinarily difficult. This hobby of reading is indeed admirable. It can be seen that a person's success is also greatly related to his hobbies. Is Sun Yat-sen's great work, the Three Principles of the People, not the harvest of his reading so much?

The knowledge of modern people should be multifaceted, and we should find hobbies related to our future and love as lifelong partners. It can solve your worries, increase your knowledge, and help your career.

### India-Tibet Border (Part 2)

— Jia Yuan

Under the crescent moon of a long night, which was quite bright, I followed Mr. Shen to the hilltop. Gazing into the northwestern sky, above the clouds, a sparkling white expanse emerged, which was the highest peak of the Himalayas. The mountain's summit, perpetually covered in snow, is known to the English as Kangchenjunga, with an altitude of 24,000 feet. According to books, the highest peak of the Himalayas is Mount Everest, at 29,022 feet. I am unsure whether that is this peak, or if there is another higher than this, which remains to be verified.

At that time, the clouds were light and the breeze was gentle. I could only see a winding stretch descending from the northwest, faintly revealing a snow-white mountain peak, with protrusions and depressions, appearing amidst the white clouds. In the vast expanse of the sky, after gazing upwards for a while, I returned to my room to sleep when the white clouds completely obscured it.

The next morning, as Principal Shen got up to paint, I followed him to the place we had looked up at the previous night to continue contemplating the mountain scenery. At this time, the red sun gradually rose in the east, and the sunlight reflected off the white snow of the high peaks of the Himalayas, glittering with golden light. The shape of the peak resembled a pyramid. However, due to the distance and the obstruction of several layers of mountains, only the upper half could be seen, but the bright and dark areas of the mountain peak could still be distinguished, especially with the surrounding smaller peaks, forming a majestic scene of mountains encircling and standing out. At this moment, the white clouds rose, and the mountain peaks appeared and disappeared intermittently, giving people a sense of pleasure.

Principal Shen was sketching, and as the mountain peaks changed, he found it quite difficult. He could only continuously apply thick ink. Until about eight o'clock, when the mountain peaks were obscured by thick clouds, the true face of the Himalayas was hidden and no longer visible. At this point, Director Li brought tea and milk. Principal Shen introduced me to him, and he was very hospitable, until about nine o'clock, when I bid farewell and left.

Sikkim · Bhutan · Nepal

Although Kalimpong has a population of 20,000, most are merchants and poor laborers, with a low level of education, so newspapers are scarce. The city has only one Tibetan monthly newspaper, edited by Tarching Babu. It is printed by lithography, with a circulation of 300 copies, mostly sold in various parts of Tibet, as well as the three small countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim.

Accompanied by Principal Shen on the morning of the 19th, I visited the newspaper. The office was also located on a hillside, with simple facilities. Tarching Babu, having lived here for a long time, knew the three small countries of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim very well. After I arrived in India, I originally intended to visit these three small countries. However, Nepal and Bhutan are very conservative and severely restrict the entry of foreigners. Therefore, in the past, except for Huang Musong, who had visited Bhutan, no other Chinese had entered. When I was in Calcutta, according to Liu Darun, secretary of the "Commissioner's Office in India," Nepal and Bhutan both have consulates in Delhi. If one were to formally negotiate, it might be possible, but the procedures are too complicated. I heard that Jiang Jianbai intended to visit Nepal and Bhutan, but I do not know if there were any results.

When I inquired about the inside stories of Nepal, Bhutan, and Sikkim from Tarching Babu, due to the haste, many questions were difficult to answer because he had not prepared in advance. What he said is recorded below:

"Among the three small countries, only Sikkim (Demojong) is a British protectorate, with a small area, and is an important route to Tibet. Darjeeling and Kalimpong, which are under its jurisdiction, have already been placed within the scope of the Indian government. Now only Gangtok remains, the area where the king resides. All domestic politics, military affairs, and diplomacy are handled by the British."

As for Nepal and Bhutan, the situation is slightly different. The British government regularly provides subsidies, the amount of which is unknown. In the past, it was 100,000 rupees, but whether it has increased now is not very clear.

Nepal is located in the north, with a land area of about 1,300 miles long and 500 miles wide. Bhutan is located in the south, bordering Assam in India, with a width of about 2,500 miles. As for the political systems of the two countries, both are autocratic, and the British government does not interfere in domestic politics. The people of Nepal are naturally fierce (the so-called Gurkha people). The domestic population reaches 3 million, and their reproductive capacity is very strong, so there are many immigrants in Assam and Kashmir in India. In addition to their own trained army, many strong men serve in the British army.

Bhutan has a smaller population, about 1.5 million. It has no army organization because it is located in the deep mountains and there is no foreign invasion, so there is no need for an army.

Both countries are located in fertile land, and the people live very well. They produce grains, miscellaneous grains, vegetables, white hemp, fruits, and the like. However, transportation to the outside world is very inconvenient, relying entirely on elephants and mules. At this time of war, these countries are living apart from the world, indeed like "Shangri-La."

Editor's note: The above three countries were originally tributary states of our country. Except for Demojong, which is under British protection and recognized by our country, Nepal and Bhutan, although not formally recognized, have no diplomatic relations with our country.

### A Small Contribution to Prohibiting Spitting Everywhere

— Bing

I read the article "Suggestions for Prohibiting Spitting Everywhere." According to Mr. Wang's suggestion, using police booths as the standard, setting up spittoons at every booth or every other booth is certainly reasonable. But how many police booths are there in all of Shanghai? How much would it cost to buy all those spittoons? And when spitting, it is inevitable that some will be spat outside or on the lid of the spittoon, so wouldn't the purpose of setting up spittoons to prevent the spread of germs be defeated? Or some might say, "Rinse with water," but aren't there many places where it is inconvenient to get water, wouldn't that be very troublesome?

In my personal opinion, it would be best to use the gutters along the roads as spittoons. Gutters are available at short intervals, more than police booths, which can be sufficient for needs and there will definitely be no shortage. Furthermore, the sanitation bureau orders cleaners to frequently rinse the gutters with water, so that the sputum spit outside does not remain on the lid, and the spread of germs will not occur.

So, without spending a large sum of money and reducing the spread of germs, isn't this something that is convenient for everyone?

### Don't Be Afraid!

— Xiao Lin

Don't be afraid of "work." No one has ever died from work. People only die from fearing the difficulties of work and worrying. Worry is the root of anxiety. If you worry when you see work, it will make you have unreasonable thoughts, make you lose balance and the spirit to work hard. So you fear one thing after another, and you accomplish nothing, hesitating and ending a precious life.

Don't be afraid of "love." If there is no love in life, you will not know what happiness is. A healthy spirit needs the cultivation of love, and a sound life needs the encouragement of love. There are many lovely things in the world. With the love of a kind mother, a child can grow up. With great love, life will move forward. To love, you must have a condition: that is, first make yourself "lovable."

Don't be afraid of "suffering." Suffering is an essential element of life's training. There is sweetness after suffering, and success after suffering. There is no successful person in the world who has not tasted suffering.

Don't be afraid of "death." No one can avoid "death." The most important thing is to prepare how to "die" with value. Don't let yourself disappear completely after death. You should leave your spirit and soul in the world before "dying."

### The Teacher of All Ages

— Written by James Hilton, Translated by Yi Jin Tan

(4)

Her name was Catherine Bridges: she was twenty-five—young enough to be Chips's daughter. She had blue, sparkling eyes, freckled cheeks, and smooth, slightly yellowish hair. She also lived on a farm, spending a vacation with a girlfriend. She thought she should be responsible for Chips's accident, so she rode her bicycle every day, along the lake, to the house where this quiet, middle-aged, and respectable man was lying.

That's what she initially thought of him. As for him, because she would ride her bicycle, without fear, to visit a man living alone in a farmhouse living room, he couldn't quite understand what the world was changing into. His bruising could only rely on her kindness, and soon it became clear how much he needed that kindness. She was an unemployed governess, with some money saved; she had read Ibsen's works and admired him very much; she even thought they should have the right to vote. Politically, she was a radical, and her views were leaning towards people like Shaw and William Morris. Every summer afternoon in Wasdale Head, she poured out all her ideas and opinions to Chips; and he, because he wasn't very good at talking, initially thought it wasn't worth arguing with her. Her friend left, but she still stayed; Chips thought again, what can you do with such a person? He often leaned on a cane, limping along a path to the small chapel: on the wall there was a stone slab, which was comfortable to sit on, facing the sun and the lush greenery of the mountain top, while listening to a—well, yes, Chips had to admit—very beautiful girl chattering away.

He had never met anyone like her before. He had often thought that the modernists, this "new woman" thing, would definitely make him afraid to approach; but now, she was that kind of person, but it made him look with certainty as she rode her bicycle, safely speeding around the lake. And she had never met anyone like him before. She had also often thought that middle-aged men, reading "The Times" and denying everything modern, were always terrible pests; but now, he was that kind of person, but he aroused her interest and attention more than young men her age.

Health Guidance

Answers by Dr. Yan Minqing

(1) Huang Yulin and Liu Qingkang ask: Is it effective to take "Engdemont" and "Pulesheng Solid Essence Tablets" for two years of spermatorrhea? If not, what medicine should be taken? What medicine is effective for brain leakage (excluding surgery)? Answer: It is okay to take the two medicines you mentioned for treating spermatorrhea, but I cannot guarantee their effectiveness. The most important thing is to treat the cause, such as stopping masturbation. Thoughts must also be pure and quiet, and attention should be paid to overall development and health. It is difficult to see results by relying solely on medication without removing the cause. As for the so-called brain leakage, what disease are you referring to? How can the brain leak? If a doctor diagnoses that surgery is necessary, it is still best to have surgery. Otherwise, pay attention to overall nutrition. If you can be healthy, you may be able to increase your resistance and avoid the continued deterioration of the disease.

(2) Wu Xiangsheng of Zhenhai asks: Living with relatives who have scabies, I was infected. I developed severe itching all over my body. When I scratch, red particles appear, and pus-filled sores often appear on my hands and feet, which are very painful. I have injected the Japanese drug 606, but it has not been effective. Please advise on a treatment method. Answer: You have scabies combined with impetigo, caused by a staphylococcus infection after scabies. For a quick recovery, you must simultaneously eliminate the scabies mites and the staphylococcus. 606 is not a specific drug for this disease, so it is not effective. This disease is not incurable, but it recurs due to repeated infection, so you must be isolated from those who are infected or treated at the same time. Clothes and bedding must be changed and disinfected by boiling every day to avoid repeated infection. The treatment method is to use a simple scabicide, such as 20% sulfur ointment, and rub it vigorously. The more vigorously you rub, the faster the treatment will be. When combined with impetigo, due to the complexity of the medication, a separate prescription is provided for use, and at the same time, take drugs such as Bainongqing or Xiaozhilong internally, or inject the drug.
