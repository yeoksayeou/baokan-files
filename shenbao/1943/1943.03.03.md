### Improving the Lives of Civil Servants

Civil servants are the actual implementers of national policies, so their lives are closely related to national policies and the people's livelihood. If we want to improve administrative efficiency, we must first improve and guarantee the lives of civil servants at all levels across the country.

The lives of civil servants can be roughly divided into three types: The first type are those who are both honest and capable. They only know how to be loyal to the country and serve the people. However, they end up with nothing to their name, unable to adequately support their parents and unable to adequately raise their wives and children. They embrace the principle of "a gentleman being steadfast in poverty" without diminishing their joy. The second type are those who both fulfill their duties and seek personal gain. This type of person has occupied a very high position in Chinese politics in recent decades. However, only a very few lucky ones can maintain their position without falling. Most people, due to seeking personal gain, initially only supplement their insufficient income, then gradually become greedy, and eventually suffer personal ruin and disgrace. The third type are those who only know how to seek personal gain and do not know how to handle affairs. They even engage in activities that harm the country and the people. Many of the country's good laws and policies are ruined by these individuals.

Today, when we advocate for improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants, the first priority is to thoroughly eliminate, in a negative sense, those civil servants who only take money and do not handle affairs, and absorb truly talented people from all fields to replace them. In a positive sense, we must improve their treatment so that they can maintain the minimum living standards for themselves and their families, and then hold them accountable for fulfilling their duties. The second priority is to do everything possible to improve the situation of civil servants who both handle affairs and seek personal gain, increase their salaries and allowances so that they can devote all their efforts to serving the country and the people. The third priority is to reward the aforementioned first-class excellent civil servants, regardless of whether their position is as high as a specially appointed official or as low as a clerk, as long as they are honest and devoted to public service, they should be given special rewards and publicly praised as model civil servants, while also guaranteeing their adequate living standards materially. These are the principles we advocate for improving and guaranteeing the lives of civil servants.

Regarding the actual living conditions of civil servants across the country at present, almost all of them feel that their income is insufficient to cover their expenses due to rising prices. Although some agencies have special allowances, they cannot keep up with the rate of price increases in reality. In other words, the salaries of all civil servants are insufficient to maintain their minimum living standards. Those at the top can only make ends meet, and it is already difficult to support their families. Those in the middle and lower ranks cannot even maintain their own lives, let alone support their families and educate their children. Their material lives are already difficult, and there is no spiritual comfort at all. Even if they were like Yan Hui, they might not be able to "not change their joy." As a result, most of them have a "five-day plan" mentality and no longer focus on political affairs.

We hope that the government will immediately find ways to improve the treatment of civil servants. It should re-determine the amount of salaries and allowances at all levels, using local price indexes as the standard, so that at least all levels of civil servants can support their families and educate their children. At the same time, it should enhance their self-esteem spiritually, so that they feel the weight of the country's trust and everyone strives to be devoted to public service.

Finally, we urge the government to absolutely prohibit senior civil servants from engaging in business and strictly prohibit the extravagant lifestyles of high-ranking officials. This will create a new atmosphere in politics, and then political efficiency will inevitably increase as a result. Only then can we adapt to wartime needs, implement the country's wartime policies, and accomplish the important mission of participating in the war.

Translated Commentary

### Soong Mei-ling's Trip to America

In the Casablanca conference, the United Kingdom and the United States decided to focus their main efforts on the European theater, while taking a defensive stance in the Pacific. Australia and Chongqing have expressed great dissatisfaction with this. Roosevelt explained the Casablanca decision on Lincoln's Birthday on the 12th of last month, saying that the specific plans for the future are not limited to a certain battlefield, continent, or body of water. Many other matters were also decided at the meeting, and within the next year, the world will receive answers not in words, but in actions. Soong Mei-ling's brief ten-day trip to Washington was to explore the details of the conference.

Based on its experiences in the South Pacific War, the United States understands that in order to attack the Japanese mainland, it must use China as the base for its offensive against Japan. China's importance is increasing due to strategic changes. The question is when to start the attack on Japan.

Chongqing's anxiety, impatience, and resentment are all because American aid is lip service and not substantial. Soong Tzu-wen called out first, followed by Soong Mei-ling's trip to America. During her previous trip to America, Soong Mei-ling brought back a gift of a 500 million USD loan. In Chongqing, Soong Mei-ling is revered as the "Mother of the Nation." In the United States, she and Eleanor Roosevelt are praised as "great women in the world symbolizing democracy and freedom." Therefore, Soong Mei-ling's sudden trip to America is based on this self-confidence.

Roosevelt's opinion on the offensive against Japan is completely consistent with Chongqing's; it is only a matter of time. This time can only be sought from God, praying for its speedy arrival. Everything is entrusted to God and used as an excuse for evasion. We can learn Roosevelt's true face beneath his disguise from Soong Mei-ling's activities in America.

We are extremely dissatisfied to hear the American press corps' question, saying that "China has not yet fully utilized its human resources." The method that the United States hopes for Chinese people to bleed for America is for Chongqing to use flesh bombs, without American weapons, to fight against the Japanese army. This question simply treats Chinese people as American slaves. What an insult this is to the Chinese people! However, Soong Mei-ling remained indifferent. She replied, "Many Chinese people are fighting with bare hands." This is truly a cup of bitter wine.

The essence of the relationship between the United States and Chiang Kai-shek is fully exposed in this exchange. Chongqing is the United States' cannon fodder, and the Chongqing regime has sold out the blood of the Chinese people. After Soong Mei-ling returns to Chongqing, she may feel disappointed and resentful, and the gift she brings back from the United States will probably be the awakening of the nations of East Asia.

Eastern Battlefield Ice and Snow Melting German Army Counterattacks in the South Soviet Forces Halted West of Kharkov (Soviet Tank Corps Commander Pavlov Killed)

German Headquarters, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: German war reports state that the German army launched several counterattacks in the southern sector of the Eastern Front yesterday. The German army in the area severely attacked the Soviet army, destroying the enemy's attempts to advance. Although the climate and terrain in the Izium area are unfavorable for troop movement, the German army still defeated the Soviet army, captured many locations, and the number of captured enemy soldiers and spoils of war is increasing daily. Lieutenant General Pavlov, commander of the 25th Soviet Tank Corps, was killed in action. The Soviet forces attacking west of Kharkov, north of Orel, and south of Lake Ilmen failed in their attempts and retreated with heavy losses. The Demiansk bridgehead southeast of Lake Ilmen, a position that the Soviet army has repeatedly besieged and attempted to capture unsuccessfully for fourteen months, was recently abandoned by the German army according to a pre-planned schedule. Before the German army withdrew, it transported all its military supplies out, and encountered no enemy resistance during the withdrawal.

Stockholm, Sweden, February 1st, Allied News Agency: According to information received here today, the large-scale Soviet winter counteroffensive has now weakened because the ice and snow on the battlefield are melting earlier than usual. The German army holds the advantage in three main battle areas. The first is in northern Ukraine and near Kharkov and Kursk, where General Golikov's troops were severely damaged by the German army. The second is in the Donets Basin, where the German side has been continuously sending tank formations and mechanized units. The third is west of Rostov, where the German army has launched a strong counterattack on the Tank Long and Mius River.

Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: There are three main wars on the Eastern Front recently: (1) The German army's attack on Izium is progressing smoothly. (2) The Soviet army's progress northwest of Kharkov has been curbed. (3) The Soviet army's pressure on the southern flank of our defense line in Orel has been ineffective. In addition, the vanguard of the German army in the central Donets has now reached northwest of Kramatorskaya and north of Roso. Fierce street fighting is currently taking place in Babenkvo, and the Soviet army is about to be surrounded and annihilated. The Soviet army is still resisting fiercely along the Donets, with many soldiers but very few tanks. From February 21st to February 28th, the Soviet army lost more than 1,060 tanks, which shows that the Soviet army is feeling a shortage of tanks. The Soviet army's attack on Mius seems to be to relieve the urgency in Izium, but it has not succeeded. The Soviet army's progress in the Gonopura area has also been curbed.

Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: Military sources in Berlin said last night that the weather in various sections of the Eastern Front is improving, and the positions defended by the German army are becoming increasingly consolidated.

Istanbul, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: According to information from semi-official sources in Moscow this morning, due to the recent victories of the German army, the Soviet army's defenses against the German counteroffensive and the Soviet army's supply lines must be redeployed. Moscow admitted that the Soviet army in the Donets area failed to curb the vanguard of the German tank formation yesterday, and the German army has broken through the positions occupied by the Soviet army in early February. The German army in Kramatorskaya has also achieved partial victories. The Soviet army is now preparing for the second phase of the offensive.

Tank Battle Still Ongoing in the Donets River Basin

Somewhere on the Soviet border, February 2nd, Havas News Agency: Yesterday, German and Soviet troops continued to engage in fierce fighting in the Donets River Basin. The German army advanced near the city of Kramatorskaya. Soviet officials have not frankly stated the positions held by the Red Army in the warzone. However, according to German sources, it has been confirmed that the German army has occupied the two cities of Kramatorskaya and Roso伏亞, and a large Red Army unit has been isolated and helpless. They are currently setting up positions around the city of Barvenkovo for a final struggle. According to reports from British visitors to Moscow, "When Nazi Germany decided to mobilize a large number of troops to fight on this narrow front, the Red Army could not stop its advance. Therefore, it is normal for the German army to gain a foothold. New German troops are still being sent to the Kramatorskaya area for reinforcements. The two sides have fought over several locations, and control has changed hands several times. They are still fighting hard." The Red Army General Headquarters also issued a war report stating that a large-scale tank battle had taken place in the Donets River Basin and is still ongoing. According to German sources, the armored formation under the command of the famous Soviet General Popov suffered heavy losses, which is enough to constitute a source of weakness for the Red Army. Semi-official sources in Moscow said that the Red Army's offensive has slowed down. There are three main factors for this: (1) the German army's resolute resistance, (2) the melting of ice and snow on the ground, and (3) the need to consolidate recently gained positions. Therefore, the nature of the war in the Donets River Basin and the Kharkov area has changed. In the past, both sides concentrated large numbers of infantry troops to fight and used tanks to charge. But at this time, it has been changed to guerrilla warfare. Soviet engineers are repairing transportation lines in the rear. It is very difficult to check this work. Before the German army withdrew, they burned them all, destroying them almost entirely. In addition, the recent melting of snow has filled the trenches with rainwater. This is the general situation on the Eastern Front.

Timoshenko Commands Military in Northwest Theater

As for the war situation in each region, they are described as follows: (1) There are no important events to report in the Caucasus. (2) In the Taganrog area, the Red Army launched a large-scale offensive on an eight-mile front near the Mius River. No fewer than several divisions of the Red Army participated in this battle. (3) Donets River, the Soviet side admits that the German army has adopted a certain strategy that puts the Red Army in the Kramadorska area at risk of being surrounded. The Red Army advancing along the Kharkov-谷諾托普 line seems to have been completely bogged down and unable to make progress. (4) There are no major changes in the Kursk area, but the troops under the command of General Golikov, starting from the city of Kursk and advancing along the railway, have already passed Orel. (5) Lake Ilmen area, the Soviet side declared that the Red Army has achieved major achievements, recovering the city of Temiask and two other cities. According to a message broadcast by Moscow Radio Station, the defeated soldiers belonged to the 16th German Army Corps, commanded by General Busch. The Red Army that won the victory belonged to the troops of General Timoshenko. The Red Army war report has not mentioned General Timoshenko for a long time, but his name has appeared again in this war report. This victory of the Red Army is of great significance, because the protruding part of the German army in the Seliger Lake area has always been a threat to the Moscow-Leningrad railway. This victory of the Red Army has eliminated this threat. However, from now on, there will only be local nature, not likely to develop into a large-scale offensive. South of Lake Ladoga, the Red Army attacked the German positions no less than seventeen times, but all were repelled by the German army and suffered heavy losses. (6) The Finnish front is quiet.

Helsinki, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency: When the Moscow Radio Station reported on the war situation in the Lake Ilmen area yesterday, it stated that the Northwest Theater is now under the command of Marshal Timoshenko. When he took office in this position was not disclosed.

Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency: According to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a special announcement on the night of the 1st, stating that the Soviet troops under the command of Marshal Timoshenko have launched a new operation in the area between Moscow and Leningrad.

### Advisor Ishiwata Delivers Speech Strengthening the National Government Economic Committee

According to Mr. Ishiwata Sotaro, economic advisor to the National Government, who is currently in Japan for official business, the three gentlemen are all giants in the Chinese financial world. Mr. Zhou Zuomin is currently the General Manager of Jin City Bank and is an authority in the financial world. His qualifications and experience have always been respected by people in the financial world. Mr. Zhou is full of talent and is particularly proactive in handling affairs, and he is fluent in Japanese. He is an old friend of mine for many years. I met with him in Nanjing. He has devoted himself to developing cotton production in North China and has achieved remarkable results. Now that he has taken office as a member of the National Economic Committee, his full activity in the future is worth looking forward to. Mr. Tang Shoumin has served in the financial world since returning to China after studying in the United States. He has served as the General Manager of the Bank of Communications and is a giant in the Shanghai banking world. His reputation has always been well-respected. It can be said that the National Government has gained a talented person with his cooperation to establish the financial world in the future. Mr. Wu Zhenxiu is a graduate of Keio University in Japan, is exceptionally fluent in Japanese, and has a deep understanding of all aspects. He is currently the General Manager of the Bank of China and is very skillful. When the National Economic Committee held a conference in Beijing a few days ago, Mr. Wu attended despite his illness, and Chairman Wang was deeply moved. In short, the three gentlemen are the great pillars of the Chinese financial world. Their active cooperation with the National Government this time shows that the connection between the National Government and the financial world has become closer. At the same time, the negative people of the past will also join the National Government camp one after another and work hard for the construction of the new China.

### Wang Jinzai Writes to Li Zongren

Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Since being captured by the Japanese army on the 25th of last month, Wang Jinzai wrote to Li Zongren, Commander-in-Chief of the Fifth War Zone of Chongqing, on the 1st, saying that "During this war of resistance, I have worked hard, but I have been subjected to fierce attacks by the Japanese army, and my subordinates have suffered heavy casualties, which is very painful. At 4:00 p.m. on February 25th, when I led a team of 23 people to retreat, I was pursued by the Japanese army again. I was captured because of a foot injury. The Japanese army is now treating me exceptionally well, so I have decided to participate in the peace movement after my injury heals and strive for the common "welfare" of the East Asian nations."

Hankou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: Mr. Honma, a member of the Press Department of the Japanese China Expeditionary Army, accompanied the army this time to participate in the spring operation to attack the troops of Wang Jinzai, who was loyal to Chongqing. According to the situation in the Jianli area of Hubei Province, the main point is that this operation wiped out the troops of Wang Jinzai, loyal to Chongqing, but in order to ensure the triangle area of Hubei Province, the work of appeasing the local residents at the same time as the Japanese army's offensive was particularly successful. For example, many residents in the Jianli area prepared Japanese national flags when they learned that the Japanese army would attack. According to prisoners of war and residents, Wang Jinzai's army was just a bandit, and they were always looking forward to the National Government army and the Japanese army coming to rescue them. They had heard from people from Hankou that the Japanese army absolutely protected the safety of ordinary people, while Wang Jinzai's army often forced young men in the Jianli area to serve, so parents often ordered their sons to flee to other places to wait for the arrival of the National Government army and the Japanese army. The residents of the area are very simple and honest. There are many who have never seen a car in their lives. In addition, since the Hubei Provincial Security Team entered Jianli, it has gained the trust of the residents due to its strict military discipline, so the market has become quiet, especially after it was first occupied. Local agricultural products such as cotton and miscellaneous grains are stored in large quantities. At that time, Wang Jinzai was planning to forcibly purchase them, but because of the rapid offensive of the Japanese army, he did not get his wish. In addition to a group of cadres, the rest of Wang Jinzai's army were all farmers who have now been disarmed and returned to their hometowns. These simple-minded residents will be able to live and work in peace under the rule of the National Government in the future. In this way, agricultural products in the area can also be greatly increased, and the food problem in Wuhan can be adequately supplied.

### Suzhou Political Affairs Office Established Within Days

Suzhou, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Suzhou Provincial Government has been ordered to establish a Political Affairs Office, with Mr. Huang Jingqi, specially appointed by the Central Government, as the Director of the Political Affairs Office. The Civil Affairs Office completed the transfer of matters at the end of last month, and yesterday sent personnel to the Civil Affairs Office to receive all the seals, documents, property, etc., all of which were handed over clearly. The official date of establishment of the Political Affairs Office is expected to be within ten days.

### Chongqing Opens Military Conference Discussing Accelerated Fortifications in the Southwest Japanese Army Attacks Communist Army in Guidetang

Guangzhou, February 2nd, Allied News Agency: According to information received here in Chongqing today, due to the expansion of Japanese military operations in Yunnan Province and the success of the Japanese army in southern Hubei Province, Chongqing has had to accelerate fortifications in southwestern China. It is reported that several military conferences have been held. General Bai Chongxi flew from Chongqing to Guilin by plane on February 21st to discuss with military leaders there on preventing the Japanese army from threatening the southwest.

Kaifeng, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The Japanese army's various units launched a fierce attack on the Communist army's Hebei-Shandong-Henan Border Region Education Team of about 3,000 people north of Guidetang on the Longhai Line at dawn on the 27th of last month. On the 28th, they surrounded them in Huzhuang, Fuji, and Gaoti, and gave them a thorough blow, and completely wiped out their nest. In this battle, 823 Communist army corpses were left behind, and 270 people were captured. The Japanese army also intercepted one mortar, twelve light machine guns, three grenade launchers, and 318 rifles, and occupied its factories and food warehouses.

### North China Political Affairs Committee Changes Governors of Hebei and Henan Provinces

Beijing, February 2nd, Central News Agency: The North China Political Affairs Committee held a Standing Committee meeting on the 1st and has decided to change the governors of Hebei and Henan provinces.

Since China's participation in the war, they have advocated establishing responsible politics and strengthening security, which is particularly urgent in the future. This time, two generals of the Security Army have been promoted to new governors, which can show the Chinese authorities' determination to suppress bandits and ensure security in the future.

### Large-Scale War to Be Launched in the Mares Area of Tunisia

Headquarters of the German Leader, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – German military reports stated that in Tunisia, German aircraft assisted in the Axis forces' offensive, achieving further progress yesterday. Enemy transport facilities and ships anchored in the port of Bone were attacked by air and suffered heavy losses. German aircraft and anti-aircraft guns shot down eleven enemy aircraft in the Mediterranean area.

Rome, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – The Italian military headquarters announced today that thirteen enemy aircraft were destroyed on the Tunisian front, seven of which were shot down in aerial combat, and the remaining five were shot down by anti-aircraft guns. There were local battles in Tunisia yesterday, with our side holding the advantage.

Lisbon, February 2nd, Central News Agency – According to news from the North African front, on the 28th, the Axis forces launched a full-scale offensive on a vast front of 50 kilometers, starting from Cape Serrat, about 35 kilometers west of Bizerte in northeastern Tunisia, passing through Medjez el Bab, to Bou Arada. The fiercest fighting was in the area of Banjia, 40 kilometers west of Tunis. German forces deployed new tanks and infantry to concentrate attacks on the anti-Axis positions, and have now approached a point 15 kilometers east of the area. Anti-Axis front news also widely reports the crisis in Banjia, stating that if the anti-Axis forces cannot stop the Axis advance, and the Axis forces advance to Medjez el Bab, the anti-Axis forces' retreat will be cut off. Also, after the Rommel forces advanced once in the central region of Tunisia, they turned to another location, using clever tactics to lure the anti-Axis forces from Kasserine to the minefields of Fériana, 28 kilometers south of the area, and continued to advance north of Sbeitla, completely foiling the enemy's attempt to advance eastward.

Bern, Switzerland, February 1st, Havas Agency – According to news from both the Axis and Anglo-American sides, the fighting on the Tunisian front was not very active yesterday. Rome issued a military report stating that only local battles occurred on the Tunisian front, with the Axis forces gradually gaining the upper hand, and mutual artillery bombardments in some war zones. A destroyer was sunk off the coast of Algeria by Italian aircraft. The German military report also stated that the German Air Force bombed Allied lines of communication and Algerian shipping. The Allied Headquarters in North Africa stated that American forces recaptured the city of Fériana on the Gafsa railway, south of Kasserine, and the position of American forces in the Sidi Nsir area has also improved. Furthermore, according to the military report issued by the French separatist headquarters, "Artillery battles and activities of scouting units continue in the central sector." "Nothing noteworthy on the southern sector." In addition, both sides are preparing to launch a large-scale war in the Mares area at the southern tip of Tunisia. General Eisenhower's headquarters has moved to the foothills of the Ksour Mountains, so observers generally believe that General Eisenhower does not want to break through the railway from Métouia to Gabès, but will attempt to bypass the Mares defense line and enter the Matmata area, directly approaching Tala. However, this move by the American forces will still encounter strong resistance from the fortified positions from Gabès to Chotts.

Berlin, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – British newspapers and magazines have stated that the sole purpose of the Allied military operations in North Africa is to contain the Axis forces, but the recent developments in the Tunisian war situation have proven otherwise. The original purpose of the Allies was to quickly complete the occupation of Tunisia, eliminate the Axis forces, and then seize control of the Mediterranean sea route, which could then be used to advance into Europe. We still remember that at the beginning of November 1942, when the Allies landed in Morocco and Algiers, there were no German or Italian soldiers in Tunisia. Later, German and Italian troops crossed the sea to Bizerte and Tunis, and the Allied advance was immediately stalled. Anglo-American troops repeatedly launched large-scale attacks on Tunisia, but ultimately failed to succeed. The Allies in North Africa originally wanted to contain the Axis forces, but now they have not only failed to achieve their goal, but have instead been severely beaten by the Axis forces and are in a state of complete helplessness.

The Rome Talks Fully Noted the Movements of Neutral Countries; Italy Strengthened Economic Cooperation with Germany

Rome, February 2nd, Central News Agency – After German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome on the 24th, he held four talks with Prime Minister Mussolini from the 25th onwards. According to sources, the content of the talks was as follows: (1) The anti-Axis countries have recently spread various rumors, but the German and Italian governments have decided not to recognize them. The just demands of the Axis powers will not be discussed in peace talks. (2) The overall industrial mobilization in Italy is not yet practical. Economic cooperation with the German government must be strengthened. This economic cooperation plan was reviewed at the talks. (3) To counter the threat of communism, the German and Italian governments must ensure the cooperation of their forces with other countries. In order to achieve the above objectives, the Italian government needs to clear up past outstanding issues. It is expected that the representatives of the two countries will carefully discuss this matter. (4) At the current stage of the war, full attention should be paid to the movements of neutral countries. The German and Italian governments must adopt a consistent attitude. The German and Italian governments, in view of the Anglo-American machinations against the Balkan countries, must express an attitude of understanding. The two countries have carefully exchanged views.

Rome, February 2nd, Huitong News Agency – Political figures here stated that the four-day talks between Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop were the Axis powers' response to the Casablanca Conference, and also demonstrated the Axis side's iron determination to strive for final victory. It is noteworthy that military representatives from Germany and Italy participated in the talks. Italian newspapers, when commenting on the authorities' public statement, specifically pointed out two points: First, the Axis powers are determined not to allow the Bolsheviks to ravage Europe. Second, the Axis powers reiterated their commitment to establishing a new European order to protect Europe.

German Foreign Minister's Visit to Italy

Rome, February 2nd, Central News Agency – The Italian government issued a statement on the afternoon of the 1st, stating that "Foreign Minister Ribbentrop of Germany visited Rome on February 24th on behalf of Führer Hitler. When Foreign Minister Ribbentrop arrived in Rome, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Cabinet Secretary-General Rosini, representatives from the party, government, and military, as well as German Ambassador to Italy Mackensen, and German Embassy staff, all went to welcome him. The Foreign Minister was accompanied by German Foreign Ministry Ambassador Ritter, Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Warlimont, and German Foreign Ministry experts. Italian Ambassador to Germany Alfieri also accompanied him. The next day, the German Foreign Minister visited Prime Minister Mussolini at his official residence and personally handed him a letter from Führer Hitler. A meeting was then held, lasting a total of four hours, with Italian Ambassador Alfieri in attendance. Subsequent talks were held continuously for several days, reviewing all European issues and Axis operations. Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini held a long talk with German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop. At one of the meetings, Italian Deputy Foreign Minister Bastianini, Italian Chief of Staff Averoldi, and German Deputy Chief of Staff Lieutenant General Warlimont were present. The meeting proceeded very smoothly, and the atmosphere was very harmonious. The result was complete agreement that Germany and Italy should continue to fight together with the full support of Japan and other allies, and strive for final victory. Prime Minister Mussolini and Foreign Minister Ribbentrop reaffirmed the determination of Germany and Italy to devote all necessary national power to the war until the enemy is annihilated, to eliminate the danger of Bolshevism on the eastern border of Europe, and reiterated the determination of Germany and Italy, after achieving final victory, to help the people of all European countries based on justice, to liberate them from financial power and Jewish exploitation, and to promote the protection of the rights of all nations within the secure confines of a Greater Europe, so as to build a new order that guarantees the survival of the people of all European countries. After completing his mission, the German Foreign Minister returned to his country on the 28th with his staff."

### Hong Kong Seamen's Training School to Open in Mid-Month

Hong Kong, February 2nd, Central News Agency – The Governor-General of the occupied territory of Hong Kong, in order to train nautical professionals and develop the shipping industry, has established the Hong Kong Seamen's Training School, and it is scheduled to officially open on the 15th of this month. The school's navigation and mechanical engineering departments originally planned to recruit 15 Chinese students, but the number of Chinese high school graduates around the age of 20 who applied for the exam was very high. After strict screening, it was decided to expand each department to 20 students. The duration of study for these students is set at three months. If their performance is excellent, the program will continue to be offered in the future to train a large number of Chinese nautical personnel.

### France Returns Concessions in China

— Glimpses of Japanese Public Opinion

One

The French government has announced the return of concessions in China and the abolition of extraterritoriality. Japan signed a Sino-Japanese agreement with the same content with the National Government on January 9, and its ally Italy followed suit on January 14. However, the concessions that the French government decided to give up this time, such as the French Concession in Shanghai, took nearly a hundred years to create and had the significance of a quasi-colony. France had made considerable sacrifices. On January 11, the UK and the US abolished extraterritoriality and returned concessions in China in order to ingratiate themselves with Chongqing. Of course, this cannot be compared. The reason being, France, in fact, has so-called concession areas within the territory of the Republic of China, and maintains the so-called extraterritorial rights over people. On the other hand, the UK and the US have virtually eliminated them in reality, and although they claim to give them up, it is of little practical significance.

The establishment of the Shanghai French Concession is based on formal treaties and has a legal basis. After years of hard work, there is a complete organization under the Consul General, including administration, judiciary, police, health, fire protection, education, etc., and there is also the stationing of regular French troops, so it is not much different from a purely French colony. The abandonment of this important area and the extraterritoriality that has existed for a hundred years cannot but be said to be a show of goodwill from France towards the new China with the National Government as its center. Furthermore, the fact that the French Ambassador to Beijing, Cosme, held talks with Foreign Minister Chu Minyi of the National Government in Shanghai a few days ago is also noteworthy.

This wise move is due to the discernment of French leader Laval, who has taken a coordinated attitude towards Japan. After the recovery of the concessions and the restoration of legal rights, it is hoped that the achievements in administration and justice will surpass those under the rule of foreign officials in the past, and that the significance of sweeping away the old international affairs of a century will be clearly demonstrated to China and foreign countries. Moreover, this measure by the Vichy government can be said to be a reward for Japan's years of efforts to stabilize East Asia. China, Japan, and France cooperate with each other to establish eternal peace in East Asia. (Xiang: Translated from the Asahi Shimbun editorial on February 24)

Two

On the 23rd, the French government notified the Chinese National Government of its decision to return the Beijing Embassy District and the concessions in Shanghai, Tianjin, Hankou, Guangzhou, Gulangyu, and other concessions and public concessions. When the National Government participated in the war, the Japanese government, based on the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration, returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, solemnly expressing respect for Chinese sovereignty. The allied Italian government continued to respond. The Chinese people believed that only France had not yet abolished the unequal concessions and extraterritoriality. However, the wise French authorities also resolutely returned the concessions and abolished extraterritoriality, allowing China to escape the shackles of a century and restore the reputation of a complete and independent country.

Since the establishment of the Laval cabinet, France has abandoned its former illusions and worked with Germany to seek national regeneration. Leader Laval has held firm to this fundamental policy, breaking through all domestic difficulties and urging the people to move towards this bright path. Last autumn, the United Kingdom and the United States illegally invaded French North Africa and openly declared war on France, and France's policy of assisting the Axis powers also reached a decisive stage at this time. France's policy of assisting the Axis powers is not only to cooperate with Germany and Italy in Europe to strive for victory, but also to extend the policy of assisting the Axis powers to East Asia. After the publication of the Japan-Vietnam Joint Declaration, the relationship of friendship was enhanced, and then an economic agreement was established. When the Japanese army advanced into Guangzhou Bay this time, the French government and the authorities in Vietnam showed goodwill and cooperation, which in fact proved the close relationship between the two sides. The French government not only assists Japan, but also wishes to assist the National Government, which is on the same front with Japan and advancing towards the conquest of the United Kingdom and the United States, and resolutely announced the return of the concessions and the abolition of extraterritoriality, hoping to enhance Sino-French friendly relations. Although the French government has not officially recognized the National Government, this measure is of great significance. The National Government is certainly grateful for France's kindness, and Japan, which is in the position of an ally, also expresses its utmost gratitude.

After China's sovereignty is fully restored, the foundation of the National Government will become more solid, and politics will inevitably be strengthened. Chairman Wang can also take this opportunity to fulfill his century-old wish. After independence, autonomy, and political power are grasped, he will be able to thoroughly promote various wartime measures and make every Chinese person aware of the mission of "the nation at war." Is not the recovery of concessions and the abolition of unequal treaties the only slogan of Chongqing's resistance and national construction? However, Chongqing has only obtained empty promises from the UK and the US without any practical value, and still willingly degenerates into treason, while the National Government has obtained the support of Japan, Italy, and France, solving the century-old shackles in one fell swoop and completely restoring the country's autonomy. From now on, Chongqing's reason for resistance will be eliminated, and the hearts of the Chinese people will inevitably lean towards the National Government.

### Japanese Parliament Passes This Year's General Budget; Including Temporary Military Expenses, Totaling 36 Billion Yuan

Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency – The Japanese Parliament, in order to meet the needs of the current situation, has followed the planned schedule and aims to complete the deliberation of various proposals within this week.

### Communist Movement to Be Completely Eliminated; Director Sato of the Military Affairs Bureau Responds to Questions from Members

Tokyo, February 2nd, Central News Agency – Director Sato of the Japanese Army Ministry's Military Affairs Bureau, when answering questions from Congressman Kakeo in the House of Representatives' Special Committee on Wartime Criminal Matters this morning, explained the countermeasures against the communist movement in China and the South, stating in brief: Although the actual strength of the Chinese Communist Army is not accurately known at present, it is roughly no more than 500,000 to 600,000. The Communist Army must not only be defeated, but in fact, its cell structure must be thoroughly destroyed. In particular, regarding the question of how to eliminate the forces they have established in North China over the years, research has led to considerable conclusions. Our side has been working hard to destroy its fundamental organization for two years, and has achieved great results. Regarding the ideological war against the Communist Party's army, it should be the responsibility of the National Government in China. Moreover, Chairman Wang has raised the banner of anti-communism and is practicing the elimination of communism. Following the shift in Japan's China policy, the political and military strength of the National Government is becoming stronger and stronger, and public movements are becoming more and more active. The results are worth anticipating. There are also potential activities of the Communist Party in various parts of the South, but there are adequate preparations for ideological work and security work in the South. If the spirit of Japan's "Eight Corners of the World Under One Roof" is promoted and given full play, then these areas will not be easily exploited by the Communist Party. Therefore, we must make our greatest efforts in the future. Furthermore, Japan's diplomacy and anti-communism within our country and sphere of influence should be separate issues.

### Japanese Military Authorities in Java Issue Statement; Clarifying Future Intentions

Jakarta, 2nd (Central News Agency) - It has been one year since Japanese forces landed in Java on March 1st of last year. At that time, the Japanese commander issued Proclamation No. 1 on March 7th, when the flames of war had not yet completely subsided, and began to implement a strong and peaceful military administration. Recently, the military authorities issued a statement, reviewing the facilities of the past year and clarifying their future intentions. The gist is recorded as follows: The Japanese army's invasion of Java was aimed at liberating and rescuing the local indigenous people, because they had been subjected to long-term exploitation by the former Dutch East Indies authorities in terms of economy, and their lives had long been in distress. After the Japanese army occupied Java, it immediately transported a large number of cheap daily necessities from Japan to provide relief and alleviate the people's difficulties. The indigenous people were deeply grateful for the Japanese side's kindness. Java has various specialized technical talents, abundant labor, and the output of raw materials for heavy industry is also beyond our expectations. Therefore, Java is a good source of resources, and its future development is deeply anticipated. Regarding military administrative agencies, the central agencies have a central headquarters, divided into eight departments: General Affairs, Internal Affairs, Justice, Police Affairs, Finance, Industry, Transportation, and Propaganda. In addition, there are also the Enemy Property Management Department, land transportation and communication enemy property management parks, private territory management public corporations, local electric power business public corporations, etc. As for local administrative agencies, they are divided into seventeen state halls, two Marquis territory affairs bureaus, and the special city of Jakarta. The English Marquis territories will retain the titles of their respective Marquis, but will implement administration adapted to the new era under the guidance of the Marquis Territory Affairs Bureau. As for the policy of dealing with the residents, Dutch people who have been mobilized by the enemy army are treated as prisoners of war, excluding those of mixed blood. Only tens of thousands of Dutch people of purely Dutch descent are dealt with. This was the biggest problem at the beginning of the implementation of military administration. For foreigners other than Dutch and indigenous people, a residency registration system is implemented. Those who have obvious hostile behavior will be detained. There are a total of 900,000 overseas Chinese here. Those overseas Chinese who had obvious anti-Japanese hostility before the war were resolutely arrested and their property confiscated. By December of last year, this measure had come to an end. In the future, the authorities will protect overseas Chinese who cooperate in construction. Since July of last year, overseas Chinese elementary schools have been allowed to resume classes, and two overseas Chinese newspapers have also been allowed to operate. As for the indigenous people, the Native Purchase System Investigation Committee was organized in November of last year to advise on education, hygiene, and literacy, and to bear the important task of conveying public opinion. The public security of the whole island is also extremely good. The British and American sides may engage in propaganda after defeat, but the Japanese side has taken preemptive measures, implemented thorough prevention plans, and started training for active air defense. As for the overview of the implementation of military administration, it can be summarized into the following four points: (1) Education: The authorities attach great importance to it. The main policy is to establish a primary education system, eliminate illiteracy, popularize Japanese, and train teachers. Currently, there are 13,000 schools on the island with approximately 1.8 million students. (2) Hygiene: The authorities will use Javanese-produced quinine to eradicate tropical malaria and have announced the establishment of a medical university in Jakarta. (3) Finance, currency and finance: Before the landing operation, the enemy often made counter-propaganda against the Japanese military notes (currency). However, since the Japanese army occupied Java, the circulation of military notes has been very smooth, and the general public trusts them more than the old currency. The compilation of the outline of the military administration accounting insists on the policy of making military point expenditures for necessary funds, while also taking into account the balance of the entire expenditure, so the financial situation has always remained sound. Regarding prices, the issuance of military notes has been carefully studied and appropriate countermeasures have been taken, so there is no phenomenon of soaring prices. As for financial institutions, Zhengjin, Taiwan, Mitsui, and Huanan banks have been allowed to operate. Other rural banks, rural rice banks, and state-run pawnshops, which have a significant relationship with the daily lives of the indigenous people, have also been allowed to operate to ensure the stability of the people's livelihood. The Southern Development Bank also started business in July of last year, undertaking the important task of guiding the financial world. (4) Industry and economy: The authorities' future industrial policy is to fully exploit Java's new mission as a supply base for operations. The Military Administration Supervisory Department has appointed a sugar industry management affairs committee, reorganized the old organization, and established the Java Sugar Industry Federation and the Java Sugar Sales Federation to enable Taiwan Sugar, Meiji Sugar, Shioshui Port Sugar, Nanyo Xingfa Okinawa Sugar and other companies to participate in cooperation, specifying production quantities and making efforts to increase production. In short, the various measures of the various departments of the Javanese military administration and the progress of various enterprises in Java are not shifted by the interests of Java alone, but are aimed at completing the Greater East Asia War, establishing a decisive battle system, and becoming one of the main links in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. What we must not forget now is to earnestly arouse the need to save ships and save consumption. We now have a considerable amount of daily necessities that are transported from Japan at the risk of sea transport. This spirit is greatly appreciated by the residents of Java.

### Respect for the Sovereignty of the National Government; Japan Reaffirms Policy

At the meeting of the North China Development Company Committee of the House of Representatives on the afternoon of February 24th, Chairman Teshhiroki asked the government about its policy towards China:

(1) The basic policy taken by the Japanese government towards China is to strengthen the political power of the National Government and to move forward in mutual cooperation between Japan and China to complete the Greater East Asia War. In terms of implementation, what attitude will the government take towards China? I hope to explain this point.

(2) Secondly, measures such as the return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights will naturally have a considerable impact on the economic activities of state-owned companies such as the North China Development Company and the China Central Revitalization Company, as well as the general Japanese in China. What is the government's policy on this? Please explain so that those concerned can know what to do.

Regarding the basics of Japan's policy towards China, Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied. Regarding the Greater East Asia War's relation to China, the Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Army Ministry, Sato, will explain. A summary of the main points is recorded below:

Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia: Japan's fundamental policy towards China is to respect China's freedom and independence and to exert the political power of the National Government. This has been repeatedly explained in this committee and other meetings. The National Government, by participating in this war, lives and dies with Japan, cooperates with each other, and is determined to stand up and destroy the Anglo-American war. Japan and China maintain close cooperation in politics, military affairs, and economy, and move forward to complete the Greater East Asia War. The relationship between the two countries will of course be closer in the future. Because this is cooperation between two independent countries, we strictly adhere to respecting each other's position. The National Government is fully exerting itself automatically in various political affairs in order to express its cooperation with the Japanese side, and Japan does not interfere with its administration.

For example, the issue of the national flag is entirely the automatic exertion of the sovereignty of the National Government and has nothing to do with Japan. At the same time, Japan's adoption of measures such as returning concessions and abolishing extraterritorial rights is to respect China's sovereignty and is entirely based on Japan's automatic consideration.

Secondly, in terms of the impact of the measures taken by Japan on the Japanese in China, Japan's attitude towards China hopes to realize true Japanese-Chinese cooperation. Therefore, the economic development of the Japanese should abandon the concept of rights and privileges held by the British and Americans. In the future, the related businesses of the North China Development Company and the China Central Revitalization Company will also cooperate with the revitalization of Chinese industry and will need to be appropriately adjusted. As for the activities of the general Japanese, some impact is unavoidable, but there will be no impact on activities based on the spirit of true Japanese-Chinese cooperation.

In this way, the foundation for true Japanese-Chinese cooperation, coexistence, and co-prosperity can be established. Only by standing on this new foundation can the permanent and leaping development of the Japanese be ensured. Japanese people who are engaged in business in China are eager to fully understand the meaning of national policy and cooperate with pleasure.

Director of the Military Affairs Bureau Sato: I agree with the interpretation of the Minister of Greater East Asia just now. Now I will add some points from the perspective of war guidance. The policy taken by Japan towards China, from the point of view of war, is to eliminate the basis for the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing. The guiding spirit of Sun Yat-sen's revolution was to abolish unequal treaties and liberate China from its colonial status: in other words, the guiding spirit of the modern Chinese national movement is to seek China's departure from colonial status and ensure complete independence. If China uses its own strength for this great cause, it is questionable whether it can succeed even after a long period of time and with extraordinary sacrifices. However, because of the change in Japan's policy towards China, this great cause was easily completed. This move will produce great changes in the history of China, Japan, and even East Asia. However, the reason for the realization of this move is due to the efforts and achievements of Chairman Wang since the return of the National Government to Nanjing, and Japan's deep reliance on and cooperation with it.

Moreover, not only has the anti-Japanese war in Chongqing lost its basis, but the United States has also lost most of its war objectives. Since the China Incident, the United States has often obstructed Japan, and Japan's actions in China have been arbitrarily dominated by infringements on sovereignty and territory, and economic monopolies.

Now that Japan has taken this policy, it can no longer be said to be an infringement on sovereignty and territory. The restoration of China's complete independence, which the Chinese people have been eagerly demanding since Sun Yat-sen's revolution, has been realized with Japan's cooperation. What does the United States think about this? Also, the term economic cooperation is often arbitrarily considered by the United States as Japan's attempt to monopolize China. Now, not only have concessions and extraterritorial rights been returned, but Japan has also returned all of the enemy property rights obtained by bloodshed in the war to China. What does the American who arbitrarily dominates the economic behavior of monopolization have to say after seeing this? Of course, we do not need the United States to understand this now, but this change in Japan's policy has an extremely important impact on eliminating the anti-war excuse of the Chongqing and American sides.

Due to the change in policy, from the perspective of individuals between Chinese and Japanese personnel, or from the position of the company, perhaps some damage has been suffered. People in this position may oppose it because the national policy is of no help and instead hinders their own interests. However, thinking from the big picture, the government and the military will resolutely eliminate any obstacles in order to implement this policy.

### Sino-Japanese Cooperation in Water Conservancy; Yellow River Management Plan Determined

The Yellow River embankment upstream of Kaifeng was breached by Chiang Kai-shek's regular army in 1938 in order to clean up the post-fall situation in Kaifeng, resulting in flooding in the Huai River basin and even the vast area of the Yangtze River downstream. In addition, the downstream Yellow River basin at the breach point, namely northern Henan Province and Shandong Province, was cut off from water irrigation. As a result, vast Chinese villages were abandoned, resulting in the complete loss of agricultural products that annually produced 00 dan of cotton and 0.0 million tons of wheat. In order to improve this situation, Japan has been researching and investigating for several years, gradually reaching a plan and cooperating with the National Government to implement it. Minister Aoki of Greater East Asia replied to the question of Mr. Haraguchi Junin at the Committee of North China Development Company of the House of Representatives on the morning of the 23rd:

"The management of the Yellow River, as history shows, has been a major issue in China for thousands of years. Chiang Kai-shek not only did not repair it, but worsened it, so the Huai River basin became a vast ocean, while the old river became dry. It goes without saying that its relief is a major issue in terms of security and rural revitalization. The Asia East Institute has conducted detailed surveys and studies, and has obtained a preliminary plan for a concrete repair and water management policy. Now we will cooperate with the National Government to start this historic great cause. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on February 24)

### General Price Situation in Shaanxi Province

— Jin Yan

Prices Rise Steadily, Especially This Year; Inconsistent Authority of Control Agencies

The price issue in Shaanxi is the most valued thing in recent years. No matter what level of society, friends who meet, talk for a minute, most of them will be involved in this incident. In the past, it was the general public (consumers) who worried about rising prices, but now it is a small number of people (hoarders) who are afraid of falling prices. So you can hear the voices of research and manipulation of control everywhere, but in fact, prices have not fallen, and they have not fallen. Gai hoarders are afraid of falling, want to sell, and the general public is also afraid of falling, and dare not buy. Under this situation, the actual price is only temporarily stable.

For several years, prices in Shaanxi have been rising steadily, especially this year, which has made great progress and is very different. For example, native ground flour costs 5 yuan and 6 jiao per catty, and the official price of machine-made mixed flour is 193 yuan per bag, but in fact, it cannot be bought. The black market has risen to 260 to 70 yuan! Ordinary cloth needs more than 20 yuan per foot, Dumi sells for 90 yuan per city dou, limestone is 700 yuan per ton, and Chinese cabbage is 1 yuan and 45 jiao per catty. In particular, hawkers cut open Chinese cabbage for retail sales, which is an unprecedented phenomenon. Old people are surprised as a spectacle. To the ordinary haircut needs 12 yuan, so the clothing and food life of the general public have problems, thus arousing dissatisfaction from all parties. The reasons for the rise in prices in Shaanxi are: First, the source of goods has decreased, and the supply and demand are out of balance; second, many goods from various southeast regions. Shaanxi is the only import hub. Not only do Gansu, Qinghai, Ningxia, etc. have always been imported from Shaanxi, but also Sichuan merchants come here in large groups to buy goods. According to the survey, there are no less than 1,000 families with large capital and great background. Among them, in addition to a few who go east to Luoyang Jieshou to snap up, the rest are mostly bought in Xi'an, with refreshing prices and unlimited quantities. This matter is of great significance to the stimulation of prices in Shaanxi. Third, there are more banks in Xi'an than ever before. In addition to Zhong, Zhong, Jiao, and Nong, as well as the old Jincheng, Shanghai, and Shaanxi Province commercial banks, there are also Chuan Kang, Chuan Salt, Yuhua, Yaxi Industrial, Xingwen, Siming, etc., with new ones being established every month, either buying land to build houses or renting houses to renovate. They have all opened one after another. In addition, there are branches or offices of banks in various provinces, totaling no less than dozens of them. Since there are many banks, it is inevitable that some of them are engaged in activities other than legal business. There are even those who assume the name of factory companies, buy up agricultural products in large quantities, saying "raw materials". In fact, some factories have not started construction, and some buy more with less, but wait for the price to sell, or simply and directly, only see buying in, not selling out. The stimulation of prices is the most important thing. When the wheat-producing area in Guanzhong harvested wheat this year, heavy rain caused disaster, and both quantity and quality were greatly reduced. After entering summer, there was a long period of drought, and the autumn harvest was thin. Therefore, there is a lack of food. On the one hand, the population of Shaanxi has increased sharply in recent years. No less than millions of people from Shanxi, Henan, and various southeastern provinces have come to Shaanxi and live in various counties. At present, along the Longhai Railway line, almost half of the pedestrians on the streets of various cities have accents from other provinces. All these new customers are either officials or small industrial and commercial vendors. It can be said that there are very few who farm the fields. Even if there are, the arable land has not increased. Therefore, there are few producers and many eaters, and there is a greater lack of food. In addition, the disaster situation in Henan Province is currently very serious. Refugees come to the west in an endless stream, and this province must also provide food for the military and civilians in Henan. A large amount of food is transported to the east, and the lack of food stimulates the rise in wages and prices. In the past, the authorities had not organized control of materials, but the authority was inconsistent, there were too many constraints, the design was not strict, and omissions were made, so it was not possible to achieve practical results in the end. The Shaanxi Provincial Government has recently formulated various regulations to stabilize prices, established inspection and flat-selling agencies. It is still unpredictable what effect will be achieved in suppressing and stabilizing prices.

More than 200 trade associations in this city have been formally approved and established. Now, under the urging of the relevant authorities, those who have not joined the Shanghai Special Municipal Chamber of Commerce as members must promptly submit a request to the Chamber of Commerce for registration and record, and prepare a membership list. The list should clearly state: 1. Business name; 2. Representative name; 3. Gender; 4. Age; 5. Native place; 6. Education; 7. Experience; 8. Whether or not they have joined any party; 9.

Any goods operated by the trade must be evaluated by the association's evaluation committee to determine standard prices and sold within the specified period. However, the spot goods required for the market will be distributed fairly by the association's distribution group. Furthermore, various industries are adapting to the current economic structure and are discussing better methods separately. Therefore, the organization of various industries has gradually become stronger.

Municipal Women's Association to Host Press Today

Commemoration of March 8th Women's Day

The Shanghai Special Municipal Women's Association has been reorganized since the incident and is affiliated with the Social Movement Guidance Committee, sparing no effort in promoting various women's welfare undertakings.

Fishmongers' Association Petitions Authorities to Expedite Production of Standard Weights and Measures

Regarding the weights and measures used by members, the Fishmongers' Association of this city yesterday sent separate letters to the authorities of the two concessions, urging them to expedite the production and issuance of standard weights and measures. The essential points of the original letters are excerpted as follows: The authorities have strictly controlled the vegetable markets and cracked down on inaccurate weights and measures, and the results have been remarkable since the implementation. However, the market scales used by general vendors are all purchased from the market, and they are also subject to crackdown during inspections, which is very painful. The association believes that it is urgent for the government to specially manufacture standard weights and measures and distribute them to vendors for application. The association is willing to lead its members to purchase them unanimously, and at the same time, strictly crack down on illegal weights and measures prepared by citizens themselves, so as to eliminate malpractices and maintain the business of vendors. The association is organized by fishmongers in all vegetable markets in the city, and will naturally adhere to the policies and adopt them for implementation.

First Category Income Tax for the 31st Year to be Collected This Month

The Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance, in accordance with the provisions of Article 26 of the revised Detailed Rules for the Implementation of the Provisional Regulations on Income Tax, stipulates that the tax payment period for the first category, A and B items, should be in accordance with the annual settlement period of each industry, and should be paid in one lump sum from March 1 to the end of May each year. All first category, A and B items, income tax for the 31st year should be collected from March 1 of the 32nd year in accordance with the provisions of the Detailed Rules for Implementation. The tax arrears before that should still be levied according to regulations until they are fully paid. However, the district bureaus should comply with the regulations for the first category income tax for the 31st year and start with individual account checking, and should not perfunctorily handle the matter. In addition to submitting a report to the Ministry of Finance for record, a special telegram was sent to the collection bureaus in each district to comply. It is reported that after receiving the telegram from the Shanghai District Collection Bureau, it yesterday issued a notice to all companies, firms, banks, and factories to truthfully declare the amount of income from profit-making businesses of the first category for the 31st year in accordance with the regulations from the 1st of this month, and to also supplementally declare the tax arrears before that for verification and handling.

French Water and Electricity Company to Issue Wage Loans Today

All workers of the French Water and Electricity Company requested the company to improve their treatment, increase wages and rice subsidies.

Workers in the lathe room and other 17 departments, the foremen should not exceed 141 yuan at most, and the workers should not exceed 135 yuan at most. Except for rice subsidies, those who have not worked for 20 days in February will not be given loans. As for the workers' request for rice subsidies, the original plan was to reply at the end of last month, but because various aspects have not yet been properly negotiated, the company has not yet made any statement. However, the labor side is anxious to solve the problem and has appealed to the Shanghai Social Welfare Bureau and the Shanghai Office of the Social Movement Committee.

Special Issue on Various Places in Nanyang, No. 5

A Record of the Vicissitudes of the East Indies (3) By Qiao Song

(B) Mineral Resources: Mineral products are an important resource second only to agriculture in the East Indies. The main buried substances are oil, coal, gold, silver, manganese, potassium iodide, iron, dicupric oxide, nickel, bauxite, hard petroleum, diamonds, sulfur, lead, zinc, chromium, mercury, hoe, antimony, lead, tungsten, etc.; the ones that have been mined now are oil, coal, gold, silver, manganese, potassium iodide, tin, hard petroleum, bauxite, diamonds, sulfur, etc., and the resources of oil and tin are especially famous in the world, and the mineral reserves of iron and nickel are also very rich, but they have not been developed on a large scale, because the mining law of the Dutch East Indies in the past did not allow people to freely mine. The output of the main minerals in the Dutch East Indies is shown in the following table:

Output of main minerals (unit: metric tons):

The numbers are based on the "America-Britain Tracking and Greater East Asia Economy" by Dai Mei.

Petroleum is the largest mineral product in the East Indies, with reserves of about 3 billion barrels (Barrie), and its distribution is very wide. The oilfields that have been mined are Sumatra, Java, Borneo, and Ceylon. The rest are waiting for future investigation and development, but the oil production in 1939 was 7,948,000 tons, ranking fifth in the world. (698,000 tons of crude oil were sold as fuel, and the remaining 7,250,000 tons were refined oil, 2 million tons of gasoline and 410,000 tons of aviation gasoline). This kind of oil in the East Indies has always been operated exclusively by the three major companies under the British, Dutch and American capital.

Tin is a necessary metal for military purposes. None of the world powers have enough production, and it is a product monopolized by the Nanyang area. The tin production in the East Indies ranks third in the world after Malaysia and Bolivia, with an annual output of about 30,000 tons. The main areas for tin production in the East Indies are Bangka Island, Belitung Island, and Singkep Island between Sumatra and the Malay Peninsula in the Bangka Strait between the two major islands of Sumatra and Borneo. In addition, the Riau Islands Karimun, and Sumatra Island also have famous tin mines, among which the tin mine on Bangka Island is directly operated by the government, and Belitung Island is operated by the Belitung Mining Company jointly funded by the government and the people.

The base of lead ore bauxite is centered on Bintan Island in the Riau Islands, and Batam Island, Karimun Island and Bangka Island in the south also have considerable good quality discoveries. In addition, Borneo and Java also have deposits, but they have not been developed in large quantities. In addition, the bauxite ore on Bintan Island was discovered by the Japanese, and its ore volume is about 40 million tons.

Other minerals such as nickel have abundant reserves in Sulawesi. The nickel mines near Lake Matani and Lake Dewazi on the island have a grade of more than 3.5%. Iron ore in Java, Sumatra, Borneo, Sulawesi, the Moluccas Islands are rumored to have reserves of about 1 billion tons that have not yet been developed. At present, gold, silver, manganese, diamonds, potassium iodide, sulfur, hard petroleum, etc. have been developed on a considerable scale. In general, abundant mineral deposits are still in an uninvestigated and undeveloped state.

(4) Intrusion of International Capital

Since the Netherlands obtained the ruling power of the East Indies, it has guided the enterprises of the East Indies for the prosperity of the Netherlands, using the labor of the natives to encourage the cultivation of agricultural products such as rubber trees, tea, coffee, sugar, palm oil trees, etc. that the world needs. The result of this vigorous encouragement of planting specific agricultural products has caused changes in the structure of the East Indies economy. One is the development of international trade, and the other is the international agreement on important commodities.

For example, in the rubber aspect with the most prosperous trade with Britain and the United States, international cartels have been formed like bamboo shoots after a rain, such as the international cartel of tea, the international cartel of sugar, and other international industry alliances, making the Dutch East Indies a member of this kind of cartel. However, in these international cartels, Britain and the United States, especially Britain, occupy a leading position, and Britain and the United States occupy a larger amount in the foreign investment amount in the Dutch East Indies. Therefore, it is not difficult to imagine that the Dutch East Indies is a profitable place for Britain and the United States, and everything in the Dutch East Indies is indirectly manipulated by Britain and the United States.

Investment amount of various countries in the Dutch East Indies (unit: 1000 guilders):

Numbers (based on the same table above)

Let's look at the investment situation of various categories:

Students in Chengdu District Serve on the Roads Once Every Sunday

Direct Traffic, Correct Unhealthy Habits, End After Satisfaction with Exercises

The circumstances of Chengdu District schools selecting students to set out on various roads to assist patrol officers in directing traffic, and conducting exercises for the first time on the 28th of last month, have been briefly recorded in the newspaper. The reporter is now exploring and recording the details as follows:

Held Once Every Sunday

In order to promote students' traffic ethics and hygiene ideas, the Chengdu District Police Department specially selected students to try out exercises on various roads in the district. The date is scheduled for every Sunday, taking advantage of the weekly holidays, so as not to cause students to be absent from class.

Assist Traffic and Guide Hygiene

This movement has already started for the first time on Sunday of last week (that is, February 28). It is found that there are 80 primary and secondary schools in Chengdu District, and it is stipulated that each school selects 6 students, that is, one senior and five intermediate, to go to the Chengdu District Police Station for assembly, and send them to various roads in the jurisdiction to assist in directing traffic, and correct various habits of passers-by that hinder hygiene in a persuasive way.

Held Again on the 7th of This Month

The assembly time at the police station every Sunday is 8:15 a.m., and then they go to various roads in the district to carry out traffic direction and correct unhealthy habits, working for two hours, until 10:15 a.m., when the task is completed and they return. The above exercises will still be held on Sunday, the 7th of this month. The number of serving students will increase to more than 400. The exercises will be terminated after they are deemed satisfactory.

Beggar Shelter Submits to Grain Bureau, Requesting Approval to Purchase Miscellaneous Grains

The beggar shelter in this city houses a large number of beggars, but at this time of high rice prices and expensive firewood, the livelihood of the beggars in the whole shelter is extremely serious. Therefore, the shelter specially submitted a petition to the Municipal Food Administration Bureau yesterday, requesting approval to purchase Shantou sugar and miscellaneous grains, etc., in order to maintain the lives of the beggars in the shelter. After receiving the petition, the Grain Bureau stated that the beggar shelter is in the International Settlement and should apply to the Public Works Department.

Wine Shop and Clock Shop on Kangti Road Collapsed Suddenly

At 8:50 last night, a brick wall between two adjacent households in the Yixing Wine Shop opened by Peng Xu, a Hunanese, at No. 112 Kangti Road in the French Concession, and the Heng Han Clock Shop set up by Tian Baozhi, a Yangzhou native, at No. 114 collapsed suddenly, with a loud noise. The owners and partners in the two shops fled in panic. Neighbors nearby heard the alarm and thought that a tragic accident had occurred due to the collapse of the wall in the shop, so they urgently reported to the Lujiawan Police Station by telephone and sent detectives to investigate. At the same time, the Fire Brigade also received the report and quickly sent an ambulance to the address. It was only then that they knew that no one was injured due to everyone's alertness and avoidance. However, although the number and value of the clocks and watches damaged in the Heng Han Clock Shop could not be estimated, the losses were very heavy. As for the wine and wine jars piled up in the Yixing Wine Shop, the damage was not small.

Christian Lecture Hosted by YMCA

In order to promote moral education, enlighten young people's understanding of life, and guide rational life, the Shanghai YMCA has specifically scheduled to hold a Christian lecture from 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. from March 3rd to 5th. The topics for the 3rd are (1) Life needs guidance, (2) How did Christ guide people's lives, (3) How does he guide us today. The location is in the auditorium of the Eight Immortals Bridge YMCA, and Rev. Zhu Xin-shen will be the speaker. There will be musicians playing famous songs each time. The association welcomes people from all walks of life to freely attend the lectures.

Commemorating "3-3" Friendship Day

Today is the 9th anniversary of the International Friendship Day, and it is also the 30th anniversary of Huang Jingwan, the initiator, serving the society. We will all respect the friendship motto of "propriety, righteousness, loyalty, and trustworthiness", work hard at our posts, review our shortcomings in friendship, and make a solemn spiritual commemoration. At the same time, we will automatically save and donate to help those in need. Mr. Huang expounded his feelings to reporters yesterday, saying briefly:

The Initiator Expounds His Feelings

"The times have given me many hardships, and I have experienced valuable lessons, which have given me a clear understanding of society and life. It tells me how cold society is, and how weak human feelings are. It instructs me to fight against the harsh environment, and indicates the path that should be taken. Only 'self-reliance' can lead to 'regeneration', and 'self-help' can lead to 'friendship'. As for Friendship Day, I gathered six friends from various provinces in Shanghai at the Chenggeng Village Industrial and Educational Group in West Shanghai at 3:00 p.m. on March 3rd in the 23rd year of the Republic of China, and held a tea party to promote friendship. It was decided that a gathering would be held on this day every year. Although there have been years of war and no peace in the world, it is still commemorated on this day. Various newspapers have responded, which has shown the perseverance and wishes of friendship. By promoting it widely, transforming prejudices, cultivating kinship, and jointly seeking the promotion of friendship and the common prosperity of the nation, we will surely create a survival that conforms to justice and fairness for mankind."

Friendship Day, Review the Old and Know the New, Yang Yusheng

Friendship is the greatest. The ancients attached the most importance to friendship, but today's people ignore it. We should still start with friends, recognize parents and brothers as friends of blood, so that there will be no tragedy of watching the wall, recognize husband and wife as friends of the family, so that there will be no tragedy of divorce, and recognize that all levels of society can be friends, so that there will be no riots of resentment and hatred. China has always been a country of etiquette and righteousness. I have specially excerpted the teachings of ancient sages in China and the West. To build a new order, we must review the old and know the new!

(1) Confucius said: There are three kinds of beneficial friends, and three kinds of detrimental friends, (2) Book of Songs: Look at those birds, they still seek the sound of friends... The gods listen to it, and it will eventually be harmonious and peaceful, (3) Analects: In friendship with friends, words must be trustworthy, (4) Zengzi: Gentlemen gather friends with literature, and assist benevolence with friends, (5) Lu Xi said: To become a good person, you must find good friends. If the yeast is sour, how can you get sweet wine? (6) Strategies of the Warring States: Those who make friends with wealth will end their friendship when the wealth is exhausted, and those who make friends with beauty will be betrayed when the beauty fades, (7) Rousseau said: A person who abandons friends for his own sake has no value in making friends. Be careful, (8) Ancient poems: "Friends of profit cannot be close, you must make friends with old adults, kindness has the atmosphere of orchids, and true nature is seen in times of need," (9) Zeng Guofan said: The first thing to choose friends is "to choose those with lofty ambitions," (10) Western proverb: A person without friends can only be considered half a person, (11) Byron said: Good friends do not forget to fulfill their obligations, (12) Book of Han: Life and death reveal friendship, poverty and wealth reveal the state of friendship, (13) Zhuangzi said: The world and I are born together, and all things and I are one (friendship extended to the world), (14) Avatamsaka Sutra: May all sentient beings obtain peace and happiness, without all diseases and suffering (friendship extended to all sentient beings), (15) Nagarjuna Bodhisattva's Treatise on Generating Bodhicitta: I should benefit and bring peace and happiness to the rest of the sentient world, and view all sentient beings in the ten directions as if they were my own body (this is the greatest friendship, it is the heart of a Bodhisattva),

Friendship Day Song, Jiang Qian

There is no greater clan in the world than friends, the word friend is shaped from two hands, helping each other in times of trouble, with a common pulse connecting left and right. One village and one country have limited people, but friendship can be extended to the universe; making friends with ancient sages who have lasted for thousands of years, facing each other with a book and being sincere, making friends with outstanding people in all directions, writing earnestly as if face to face; moreover, times are the same and places are the same, a hall of laughter is harmonious and harmonious. Learning from each other's strengths and advising on each other's weaknesses, helping each other with strength and sharing wealth; my parents know my friends, the friendship of Bao and Guan is rare. The teaching of friendship in Nishan spreads to all countries, walking with fate in all directions; old people are safe and young people are cared for by trusting friends, the sages are the masters of all ages. Guanyin has a thousand hands and a thousand eyes, protecting and taking care of everyone without bias; Confucius, Lao Tzu, Jesus, and Muhammad are interested in the Buddha's sea, this heart and this reason are not different. The Western Paradise has no suffering, the upper saints gather in a magnificent light; holding the Amitabha number with the same heart, from now on, we will follow each other without separation. Mr. Huang makes friends most sincerely, and this song is passed down as a poem of the common people.

Several Questions on Friends, Yale

——Written to commemorate the 3-3 Friendship Day——

Today is the ninth Friendship Day. In the past, life was stable, and this festival was quite lively. Now that life is difficult, everyone has little mood to hold gatherings and enjoy themselves. It is precisely because of the difficult times that we should not stick to formalities, but cherish the relationship between friends even more, and achieve the true meaning of friends.

If we summarize the writings of ancient and modern times on friends and friendship, it does not go beyond the great path of loyalty, forgiveness, faith, righteousness, benevolence, and love. Although it is old-fashioned, we cannot deviate too far from the goals of these great paths when it comes to the way of friends. We only need to make the narrow meanings in the old principles more broad and make those that do not conform to the world more conform to the world, and we can do our best.

I don't want to quote classics, let's talk about several questions about friends.

(1) Rather Be Lacking Than Indiscriminate

A person should have great tolerance. Anyone who is acquainted can be regarded as a friend, but because of the relationship of "those who are near Zhu are red, and those who are near Mo are black," there are differences in interests. Therefore, it is necessary to carefully select friends in terms of "quality," and it is better to "rather be lacking than indiscriminate." The ancients said: "It is no regret to have a confidant." The formation of a confidant is due to the harmony of purpose and temperament, and everyone should know that the psychology of confidant friends is the same. However, the so-called confidant friends generally have great differences in nature, and the difference in nature can determine the length of time. Probably, the confidants in wine and meat pursuits have few happy days, while the confidants who assist benevolence with friends are stronger over time. All friends who open their mouths to talk about confidants are just pleasing people. You should certainly have more confidant friends, but to make friends think that you are a confidant, the first thing you need is to treat friends with loyal and sincere principles. In this way, time will tell, and friends will naturally be convinced and welcomed by friends, and sincerely willing to make you a confidant friend. The so-called "those who gain the Dao will be helped more, and those who lose the Dao will be helped less." The key to gain and loss lies entirely in this.

(2) Emotion and Reason

In general, the relationship in friendship is mostly composed of emotion, but blindly immersed in emotion, waiting until it exceeds the limit, is like a runaway horse, which is quite dangerous. Often there are kinds of friends who are very enthusiastic. Once the emotions are indulged and break down, they are regarded as strangers, what a pity! Therefore, it is really not very reliable to maintain friendship solely from the effect of emotion. It must cooperate with one's own reason to be able to "complement each other," because emotion can sometimes be hypocritical and sometimes abnormal. For example, in the process of love between male and female friends, no matter how close the emotions of both parties are, if there is a lack of rational judgment, it is inevitable to cause a lot of trouble. Rational male and female friends should talk about love, but even if "the falling flowers are intentional and the flowing water is merciless," the friendship can still be maintained, which is so valuable. In any matter, "too much and not enough" will have the result of "the extreme of things will turn against them." Emotion is also the same. It is not good to be too strong, and it is not good to be too weak. It is certainly important for friends to be rich in emotion, but when necessary, reason is more important, because it can grasp emotion and prevent it from tending to extremes.

(3) Astuteness and Loyalty

People's hearts are different, each like their face. There are naturally all kinds of friends, and the two kinds of friends that are obvious are "astute" and "loyal." Both astute friends and loyal friends are beneficial to everyone. Because in astute friends you can understand a lot of worldly affairs, and in loyal friends you can get honest and selfless criticism as well as virtues that are helpful for being a person. I think that if astute friends will not "harm others to benefit themselves," then using them to benefit the masses, their achievements will certainly be very impressive. As for loyal friends, in this society, they are almost regarded as good old gentlemen and are often easily deceived. This is unfortunate for the deceived, but deceiving good people is not a glorious thing after all! At the same time, loyal friends are easily tricked by astute friends because of their own honesty. Therefore, on the one hand, I hope that everyone will promote the spirit of friendship and sympathize with loyal friends, and on the other hand, loyal friends themselves should always look at the objective environment. Finally, I hope that astute friends will pay more attention to their learning and abilities, and do not be astute only to friends, but fall into meanness and selfishness.

(4) Loyalty and Mutual Assistance

"There are only friends for a thousand years, and no masters for a thousand years." Although this sentence seems excessive, it is indeed a fact that the relationship between friends is better than that of masters and relatives. This is the power of "loyalty" flowing through. Loyalty and friends are the most valuable things. There are many famous loyal friends in history, who are truly loyal and immortal. Friends with loyalty can maintain their friendship for a long time and show their greatness: and the spirit of mutual assistance in loyalty is even more valuable, and mutual assistance in times of trouble is even more rare. The saying goes: "Giving me the benefit of surplus can broaden virtue; leaving people with inexhaustible feelings can complete friendship." Therefore, you should let go of your feelings for friends, because this is the loyalty of friends, the condition of mutual assistance, and the days of friendship are long. Helping friends is no different from helping yourself. In short, those who help should regard this as the mutual assistance spirit that human beings should have and the duty that friendship should fulfill, and those who are helped should also have the loyalty of "gentlemen do not forget their roots."

Friends are the reality of life. The author has not experienced much of the world, and my talents are shallow and my knowledge is thin. What I have said is all superficial, and there are many things that have not been exhausted. This still needs everyone to correct me.

Last Year's Industrial Economy in This City Changed from "Laissez-faire" to "Control"

Obstructed Overseas Sales, Increased Number of Factories Closing Down, Authorities Implemented Management, Industries Saw Ups and Downs

The Public Works Department recently released the annual report of the Industrial and Social Affairs Department, saying that the department undertook several emergency tasks in the first few months of last year, such as registering industrial raw material inventory, investigating the annual raw material needs of factories within the boundary, and cooperating with other authorities to implement population evacuation plans. The enforcement of price limits was handled concurrently by the Industrial and Social Affairs Department before the establishment of the Goods Control Office. In addition, the new tasks added to the department last year included the issuance of sublease licenses, the establishment of employment agencies, and the search for original families and foster families for lost and abandoned children.

1. Industrial Conditions

Regarding the industrial situation last year, one point that is more noteworthy is the transformation of "laissez-faire economy" to "controlled economy." After the outbreak of the Pacific War, most of the Chinese and foreign commercial and industrial factories that continued to operate lasted for about six weeks. Later, due to restrictions on the movement of inventory, the suspension of overseas sales, and the takeover of factories operated by nationals of belligerent countries, the number of factories closing down gradually increased.

Investigating Labor Conditions

Since the commercial markets of this port were isolated from overseas markets, this city had to rely on its own resources and raw material inventory. In view of this, the authorities gradually took measures to manage industrial activities. In March and July of last year, the relevant authorities conducted two investigations into the industrial and labor situation of the city as a basis for adjusting industries. At the same time, in order to maintain production efficiency under the principle of self-sufficiency in production, the China-Japan Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and important Chinese commercial factory groups were organized. The permits for the movement of raw materials and manufactured products could be obtained through these associations. Later, raw materials and coal were also distributed separately through these associations.

Crackdown on Black Market Transactions In February of last year, due to the Chinese New Year, the commercial market stagnated, and thus the industry declined even more. However, the establishment of the above-mentioned China-Japan Industrial and Commercial Friendship Association and other organizations boosted the revival of Chinese commercial factories. From March to June, the output of most factories suddenly became popular. In view of the difficulty in obtaining raw material supply and the sharp increase in manufacturing costs, the factories gradually increased the selling price of their products. When the Central Reserve Bank notes were circulated and the old legal tender was depreciated, merchants and speculators competed to search and purchase, and exchanged cash for goods. By June, the currency system problem had stabilized, and the short-term development of the above-mentioned industrial sector returned to normal due to the authorities' tightening of price controls, but speculation remained active. The relevant authorities decided to take strong measures to crack down on black market transactions. For example, the bureau stipulated the retail price limit for gauze in October, and implemented the highest factory wholesale price for gauze from December 1. At the same time, it organized the registration of gauze inventory. The authorities are now trying to promote the commercial relationship between this port and various countries in the Co-prosperity Sphere. The future of Shanghai will become brighter due to the authorities' efforts to promote the adjustment and progress of the city's industry.

The following is a summary of the more important industries:

(1) Cotton Mill Industry At the beginning of last year, all cotton mills owned by nationals of belligerent countries, as well as general cotton mills registered by nationals of belligerent countries but actually operated by Chinese merchants, were seized by the authorities. By May, seven such Chinese commercial factories had been returned separately. After the return, they gradually resumed work. At that time, the Central China Controlled Cotton Association had been organized and established, and the China-Japan Cotton Mill and Cotton Industry Bank had joined the association. The association sent personnel to the cotton-producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces to purchase cotton at the prescribed prices and distribute it to member factories, so as to replace imported cotton. (To be continued)

This method will be implemented after being submitted to the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Qingxiang Branch for approval. At the same time, it was also decided to prepare 1.6 million bamboo poles for the purpose of blocking bamboo fences. Residence permits will be issued by the end of March, so that people can obtain convenience during Qingxiang.

### Forthcoming Implementation of Rationing by Population; New Prices for Oil and Sugar Announced; Ration Amount for March is Half a Catty per Person; Sugar Price Reduced to Approximately 5.5 Yuan per Catty in Reserve Coupons; Oil Price Set at 1.8 Yuan per Municipal Catty in Military Certificates

After the Oil Industry Wholesalers' Association and the Grain Merchants' Cooperative Business Office received approval from the military rationing authorities to implement oil and sugar rationing based on population, they entrusted the Shanghai Municipal Council (SMC) and the French Municipal Council (FMC) with handling the issuance of oil and sugar purchase certificates in the Public Concession (including Hongkou) and the French Concession areas. These certificates have been successively issued along with household grain ration cards, consisting of two coupons for edible oil and one coupon for sugar. As for the Nanshi, Zhabei, and Huxi districts, the Wholesalers' Association and Cooperative Business Office will handle the process themselves. The entire city has been divided into areas, and the re-registration of oil and sugar retailers has been completed. Consumers can purchase oil and sugar from designated retailers by presenting their purchase certificates. Recently, the authorities approved and announced the new prices for oil and sugar and are expediting the distribution of rationed oil and sugar to retailers. According to information obtained by a Shanghai Press reporter from relevant sources, the quantity of oil and sugar rationed per person will be determined by the monthly allocation from the military rationing authorities. In March, the ration for both oil and sugar is half a catty per person. The date for purchase will be announced once the retailers are ready. The newly set prices for oil and sugar are listed below:

Sugar Price

After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office announced the newly set sugar prices on the 26th of last month, the authorities have now approved a slight reduction. The announcement states: "As sugar rationing by population is about to be implemented, this office, in order to uphold the intentions of the rationing authorities, is willing to make sacrifices and temporarily reduce sugar prices. With the approval of the authorities, we will sell sugar according to the following prices starting from March 2nd. All Class A retailers and consumers are hereby notified: (1) Military Certificate prices: coarse granulated sugar 1 yuan, snow-white sugar 1 yuan, Dutch red sugar 9.5 jiao, brown sugar 9.5 jiao, rock sugar 1.15 yuan; (2) Reserve Certificate prices: coarse granulated sugar 5.56 yuan, snow-white sugar 5.56 yuan, Dutch red sugar 5.28 yuan, brown sugar 5.28 yuan, rock sugar 6.39 yuan. The above prices are for 16-tael scales with sufficient weight. Retail tax of 1% is extra."

Oil Price

The Edible Oil Industry Wholesalers' Association issued a notice regarding the revised edible oil prices: "As stipulated by the authorities, the revised prices for various edible oils are as follows: (1) Rapeseed oil: Military Certificate 1.785 yuan per municipal catty; (2) Uncooked oil: Military Certificate 1.887 yuan per municipal catty; (3) Sesame oil: Military Certificate 1.836 yuan per municipal catty; (4) Soybean oil: Military Certificate 1.836 yuan per municipal catty; (5) Cottonseed oil: Military Certificate 1.785 yuan per municipal catty. The above prices are per municipal catty, and the retail price including the additional 2% sales tax. The prices for all types of edible oil will be implemented from March 1st. The rationed oil will be available for purchase soon. Once the arrival of edible oil is confirmed, the authorities will determine the date of sale and issue another announcement."

### Increased Grain Ration in the City Area; Starting from the Sixth Period, 2.5 Sheng Per Period

After the City Grain Administration Bureau implemented grain rationing by population in the city area, manipulators of rice prices in the city lost their basis. However, the grain rationed per period was still insufficient. Therefore, the Grain Administration Bureau decided to increase the ration to 2.5 sheng per period starting from the sixth period. This will be implemented uniformly in Nanshi, Zhabei, Huxi, Pudong, and other districts.

### Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau Officially Reorganized; Still Headed by Li Kaichen

The former Ministry of Communications' Shanghai Maritime Affairs Bureau in this city, under the leadership of Li Kaichen for several years, has now been reorganized as the Ministry of Construction. Mr. Li has been reappointed to continue overseeing the bureau's affairs. Mr. Li went to Beijing a few days ago to consult with Minister Chen and has returned to Shanghai. The official reorganization will take place on the 1st of this month, and personnel adjustments will be made simultaneously.

### Average Combination of Brown Rice and White Rice; Attention Should Be Paid When Collecting Household Rice

Due to the recent inclusion of both brown rice and white rice in the whole rice component of the two recent ration periods, the grain administration authorities in the two concessions are striving for fairness in the distribution of whole rice to each rice store, ensuring an equal opportunity for residents to obtain white rice. According to a Great News Agency reporter, the authorities are dispatching personnel to various locations for secret surveillance to prevent retail rice stores from taking advantage of differences in grain quality and engaging in private malpractices. If it is discovered that a store is selling brown rice from this period, which was not allocated by the authorities, to food consumers with purchase certificates instead of the required white rice, they will be penalized with the revocation of their license and a permanent termination of their business rights. The authorities also hope that residents will report any discovery of the above-mentioned private malpractices in consideration of their own interests and the future of grain distribution.

### Bank of China Gradually Resumes Operations in Six Locations Including Nanjing; Depositors Requiring Receipt and Payment in Shanghai Can Contact the Shanghai Branch to Arrange Transfer Procedures

The Bank of China will gradually relocate its branches in Nanjing, Yangzhou, Wuxi, Jiaxing, Wuhu, Nantong and other six locations back to their original sites to resume business. After relocating, these branches will no longer handle receipts and payments in Shanghai. All depositors of these branches who need to receive and make payments in Shanghai can immediately go to the bank at 50 Hankou Road to handle the transfer procedures.

### French Authorities Dispatch Personnel to Check Identity Cards; Those Without Identity Cards or With Folded and Damaged Cards Will Be Taken to the Police Station and Fined 10 Yuan

The French Concession authorities distributed resident identity cards to residents within the concession as early as last year. To prevent spies, thugs, and petty thieves from hiding, they have notified all residents to carry these resident identity cards when going out. On one hand, each police station dispatches personnel to conduct household re-inspections in conjunction with the Baojia chiefs to prevent any omissions. The French authorities, fearing that residents within the concession might become negligent over time or forget to carry their resident cards, have, starting a few days ago, dispatched detectives from each police station to check the resident identity cards of men and women pedestrians on various roads and streets within their jurisdiction. Those who are found without a card or who intentionally fold and damage their cards will be taken to the police station and fined 10 yuan. They are also instructed to carry their cards at all times in the future and not to fold them arbitrarily, otherwise the penalty will be increased. It is said that women account for the majority of those caught.

### More Than 6,000 Packages of Green and Yellow Soybeans Have Been Distributed; Goods Can Be Picked Up and Distributed Within Days

The military rationing authorities transported approximately 6,000 packages of yellow and green soybeans from Xuzhou and Nanjing last month. The Grain and Miscellaneous Grain Association's Miscellaneous Grain Group is responsible for the distribution. The group has already notified various retailers of both raw and cooked goods to register. It is understood that the group has completed the registration procedures for all retailers, and the funds have also been collected. Therefore, distribution package application forms have been separately completed and submitted to the military rationing authorities for approval and for separate removal certificates. After these removal certificates are approved and issued in approximately two or three days, the goods can be picked up and distributed to the various retailers.

### Winter Relief in This City Continues

Since the reorganization of the Shanghai Municipal Social Affairs Bureau and the transfer of its managed affairs, the Winter Relief for the 31st year of the Republic is still being held as ordered. The Winter Relief Office received the second batch of 100 bags of Saigon broken rice yesterday and allocated it to the Nanshi and Huxi porridge factories for porridge distribution. According to statistics, over 5,000 elderly, weak, and women eat porridge every day. If the porridge distribution period is extended, it will greatly benefit the poor. Over 7,000 sets of cotton clothing will be completely manufactured by the 10th of this month and will be distributed to various districts and applicant groups for distribution. In addition, the fundraising work for the Winter Relief expenses for the 31st year has been ordered to be completed. The receipts and expenditures are currently being prepared, and a record of all donations will be publicly announced to all sectors of society.

### Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee Merged into the Social Welfare Bureau; Over 160,000 Yuan of Relief Funds Transferred; Outstanding Matters Will Continue to Be Handled

The Shanghai Branch of the Relief Committee has merged into the Social Welfare Bureau and was handed over on March 1st. At 10 a.m. that morning, five members from the Social Welfare Bureau, including Secretary Hu Shouqi, and others, along with Shanghai Special Municipal Government Commissioner Shen Zhenji, went to the branch at Xinzha Road to take inventory. All branch staff handled the handover of their respective responsibilities. A total of 14 volumes were transferred, including public property, assets, staff receipts, and expenditure records. Over 160,000 yuan in relief funds were transferred. The Winter Relief for the 31st year was transferred as a special project, and the Welfare Bureau will continue to handle unfinished porridge relief matters. The preparatory work for the Shanghai Children's Education Institute will also be taken over by the bureau. It is said that this organizational restructuring is in accordance with central regulations and is a consolidation. All staff will continue to work as usual.

### Statement by Matsuda, Deputy Spokesman for the Japanese Army: Indian People Demand Freedom; British Appeasement Has Failed

A dispatch from the Allied News Agency's Shanghai office states that Mr. Matsuda, the Deputy Spokesman for the Army, stated at Tuesday's press conference that the danger of Britain losing India has never been greater. When commenting on the situation of the British army in India and its attempts to recapture Burma, Mr. Matsuda believed that only action could be taken due to the results of past events, and criticized Britain for suppressing India. Recently, the Japanese air raids on Calcutta and New Delhi have greatly inspired the people. This kind of hint is extremely significant. Welcoming old friend Japan to India, Japan's attack on India as an "Asian friend" is actually intended to save India from the scourge of war, while the British do the opposite. Britain's mistaken view is that Burma can be regained, India's food problem can be solved, and anti-British sentiment can be eliminated. As a result, military operations are occurring on the Burmese-Indian border. The Indian people demand freedom, and this kind of appeasement has completely failed. Britain's dilemma can be seen from the fact that troops from South Africa and the United States are being deployed to reinforce the British troops stationed in India. Of all the territories that the British want to continue to control, none is more important than India, so they are giving the Indian army equal treatment to show their gentleness, but this is precisely enough to promote India's independence. The Indian people's desire is to expel the rule of British imperialism from the country. Various actions cannot gain the trust of the Indian people.

### Rubber Shoes Should Be Used Economically; Purchases Still Limited to Rainy Days

Due to the increasing number of people buying and selling rubber overshoes for profit, the Rubber Overshoe Trade Association and its member stores in this city have formulated purchasing restrictions to maintain the supply for legitimate users. Overshoes are only sold on rainy days and are absolutely not available on sunny days. Buyers must present their property tax receipts and corresponding citizen ID cards from the two concessions or the city, and must wear the overshoes on the spot. After the implementation of these measures, hoarding and profiteering have gradually disappeared. However, as overshoes are a daily necessity for citizens, purchases are still very enthusiastic. The problem has become more serious in recent days. On days with light drizzle, large numbers of citizens rush to rubber overshoe stores to buy them. Store authorities even pull down iron gates to maintain order. According to people in the industry, rubber is one of the necessities in wartime and should be economized. Therefore, they urgently hope that citizens will strive for economy in their wearing habits.

### French Concession Subletting License Office Relocated

The French Concession's Subletting License Office has moved from today onwards due to insufficient space in its original location to the first floor of the French Postal Steamship Company Building at No. 9 Bund, Avenue Edward VII. In the future, all matters related to subletting licenses for houses within the concession must be applied for and approved at that location.

### Engaging in Securities Transactions Requires First Obtaining a License from the Authorities; Individuals and Partnerships, Regardless of Nationality, Are Subject to the Same Regulations; Severe Penalties Will Be Imposed for Future Violations

Shanghai Municipal Council Notification No. 6181 states: "Notification is hereby given that, in accordance with Clause 34 of the Land Regulations Appendix, as stipulated in this Council's Notification No. 5965, all persons, partnerships, commercial firms, companies or associations, regardless of nationality, who engage in the transaction of valuable securities must first obtain a license from this Council before being permitted to operate. It has been observed that violations of this regulation are increasingly frequent. Therefore, this notification is issued to inform all that, from today onwards, anyone found to be engaging in the transaction of valuable securities without obtaining a license from this Council will be severely dealt with. Such violators will be subject to the closure of their business premises and other severe penalties. This notification is specially issued for general knowledge. This notice is dated March 2, 1943. Signed, Seiichi Ozawa, General Manager."

### From the Return of Concessions to a Few Points for Improvement in Nanshi

— San Jin

In order to strengthen the diplomatic relations between China and France, the French government, following the friendly nation of Japan, signed an agreement with our country to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. It can be seen that the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified. Not only are the citizens of Shanghai feeling infinitely excited, but the people of the whole country, and even the countries that are friendly to us, are all celebrating in unison. However, our responsibilities have become even greater, because we must not only maintain the status quo of the concessions, but also carry them forward; not only must we carry forward the concessions, but we must also strive to improve the city's administrative power and keep pace with the concessions, so as to avoid abnormal situations and complete the long-standing Greater Shanghai Plan. This is the only way to live up to the good intentions of friendly nations in returning the concessions. For example, Nanshi has the following points that urgently need improvement:

(1) Public Announcements on a Regular Basis. The previous rationing method for rice and flour in Nanshi was not the same as in the concessions. It is hoped that in the future, public announcements will be made on a regular basis, and the quantity will be the same as in the concessions. This will be more convenient for residents.

(2) Clearing Garbage. The City Police Headquarters has issued a notice to eliminate unsanitary habits in order to effectively maintain public health in the city. It has strictly prohibited the dumping of garbage on the side of the road, defecating anywhere, and spitting arbitrarily, as these are likely to spread epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis. Violators will be punished. However, the first step in prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the side of the road is to thoroughly clear away the mountains of garbage that are piled up everywhere. Then, the police teams should be instructed to assist in prohibiting the dumping of garbage on the side of the road, so as to emphasize hygiene and produce practical results.

(3) Restoring Traffic. Although the French government has signed an agreement with our country to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights, it may not be possible to implement it in the shortest possible time due to procedural matters. However, the full opening of the iron gates at the border between Shanghai's Chinese and French areas to restore the pre-war state can be implemented immediately. It is hoped that this can be realized as soon as possible.

Nanshi had trams and buses before the war, and buses were also running after the war. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, buses have been suspended and have not been restored. In order to facilitate transportation and rectify the city's appearance, it is hoped that tram or bus station traffic will be restored as soon as possible.

(4) Repairing Streets. Opening new roads or widening streets may not be easy to carry out for the time being, but repairing roads, especially clearing the debris on the streets, is easy to do. It is hoped that the municipal authorities will pay attention to this.

In short, the Shanghai municipal administration will soon be unified. Before the unification, everything in the city must be comparable to the concessions, so that there will be no gaps in the future. How about we ask the municipal authorities?

### Central Reserve Bank's Business Last Year

A dispatch from the Allied News Agency's Shanghai office states that according to Monday's report in the Continental New Paper, the Central Reserve Bank announced on Monday that its profits for 1942 were 17,462,000 yuan, an increase of 12,878,000 yuan compared to 1941.

### Establishment of the Local Produce and Fruit Distribution Cooperative; Yang Yunwen and Others Elected as Directors

The Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Central Local Produce and Fruit Industry Brokers Association has been in existence for nearly four years. The vegetables of millions of citizens in Shanghai all depend on it. Under the leadership of Chairman Yang Yunwen, the association's business is booming. Recently, in order to comply with the authorities' balanced distribution of materials, the association reorganized the original brokers into the Shanghai Special Municipality Central Market Local Produce and Fruit Investment Distribution Cooperative Co., Ltd. and held the founding meeting at 2 p.m. yesterday in the Central Market cafeteria. Hundreds of people, including Market Managers Tao Wenqi, Ikeda, Chengbei, and Kui Wenguang, as well as all the shareholders of the cooperative, attended the meeting. Yang Yunwen, Shen Yucheng, and Zheng Zhonghai were publicly elected as the presidium.

Chairman's Speech. At 2 p.m., the meeting was opened with a bell. First, Yang Yunwen delivered a speech, stating that the cooperative was reorganized and established in order to seek the welfare of the Shanghai citizens and to balance the distribution of materials, and in accordance with the instructions of the Market Authority. Today, the founding meeting is being held, and it is a great honor to have so many guests and all the shareholders of the cooperative in attendance. From now on, the cooperative will continue to seek ways to improve and adapt to the wartime economic system, so as to conform to the purpose of balanced material distribution and achieve the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. After that, Market Managers Tao Wenqi, Ikeda, Chengbei, and others delivered speeches successively. Then, the voting began to elect the directors and supervisors.

### Central Market Handles Registration of Retailers; Registration Is Only Allowed with a License from the Authorities; Peddlers Must Verify Tax Payment Certificates and Citizen Certificates

In order to adapt to the wartime system, the Shanghai Central Market has submitted to the authorities for approval to reorganize the upper-level organization of the broker trading system into a distribution investment cooperative to unify the purchase and distribution of goods and strengthen the mission of the market's public institutions. Regarding the lower-level organization after the reform, all retail stores must be approved by the Municipal Government and the Shanghai Municipal Council to register and issue licenses before they can be designated as retail stores and allowed to register, so as to improve distribution and ensure reasonable prices.

Name of Each Industry. As for the name of each industry, such as (1) Local Produce and Fruit Retailer, (2) Poultry and Egg Retailer, (3) Southern Goods Retailer, (4) Northern Goods Retailer, (5) Cured Meat Retailer, (6) Chinese Paper Retailer, (7) Grocery Retailer, (8) Tin Foil Retailer, (9) Wax Retailer, (10) Liquor Retailer, the above-mentioned retailers can go to register.

### Hoping All Sectors Donate at Any Time; Preparing for Next Year's Student Aid; Minsheng Bank Diverts Tea and Refreshment Expenses to Student Aid

The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund received a donation from Mr. Tang Zhiliang, who diverted funds saved from tea and refreshments at the opening ceremony of the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank, and from Mr. Sun Qifang, who diverted funds saved from his wedding. This kind of advocacy for thrift and talent cultivation is of great significance to society and benefits young people. It is truly commendable.

Donate at Any Time, Regardless of Amount. The Shanghai News understands that the current cost of living continues to increase, and poor students will feel more difficult when enrolling or continuing their studies in the summer vacation of this year. As there is no hope of reducing tuition fees in various schools, the newspaper is praying that the general price level can be suppressed on the one hand, and on the other hand, it hopes that various schools will do their best to avoid placing excessive burdens on students. The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund is unwilling to slack off its initial intention to provide modest assistance when most students are in dire need of help. The next student aid fund will naturally still hope that all sectors will donate at any time. Increasing the balance by several hundred yuan today means reducing the number of students who drop out of school in the summer vacation by several students. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention to the urgency of this student aid matter and donate at any time, regardless of the amount, and pool the strength of the masses to complete the studies of poor children. This should be advocated and supported by people from all walks of life.

Diverting Tea and Refreshment Expenses to Donate to Student Aid. The Shanghai News received a letter from the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank yesterday stating: "Dear Sir, We are grateful for the presence and guidance of eminent figures from all sectors at our opening ceremony. As it is a time of special circumstances, it is appropriate to be thrifty. Therefore, we have diverted 15,000 yuan of tea and refreshment expenses to various scholarship institutions as scholarships, in order to assist the good intentions of guests from all sectors in cultivating young people. In addition to sending separate letters, we are also sending a certificate for 6,000 yuan. We hope that you will accept it and announce it to the public."

Student Aid Received Yesterday. The Shanghai News Readers' Student Aid Fund's income and expenditure report was published in yesterday's newspaper. As of the end of February, the balance was 217,284.52 yuan (the amount of student aid paid out in this term is calculated based on the number of checks issued before the end of February. Any student aid refunds or continued payments will be included in the next public announcement). On March 1, donations from various sectors of society totaled 602 yuan, and the donors' names were published in yesterday's newspaper. Yesterday, we continued to receive donations from various sectors of society, including 6,000 yuan from the Minsheng Commercial Savings Bank, 1,000 yuan from Tang Zhiliang, 200 yuan from Pei Ji, 100 yuan from Cao Changxing (whose son received the museum's student aid once in the past), 50 yuan from Chen Hailing (savings from his birthday), and 20 yuan from Pu Jiting (in memory of his late father, Liangbo). The total amount received was 7,370 yuan in reserve coupons, and the balance is 225,274.56 yuan.

### Wusong Gas Plant Increases Production; Monthly Increase of 10,000 Tons

In order to meet the needs of industrial use, the authorities of the Shanghai Gas Company have notified all users to conserve gas as much as possible, and are actively increasing production at the gas plant in Wusong. According to the Great News Agency, the plan to increase production at the plant has been completed, with an increase of approximately 10,000 tons per month compared to before. This move will greatly benefit the industrial sector in this city.

### Municipal Chamber of Commerce Strives to Reform the Organization; Plans to Re-adjust the More Than 300 Trade Associations in the City

Various Chinese business groups in this city are working separately to establish an autonomous control mechanism for Shanghai's economy, especially the movements of the Municipal Chamber of Commerce, which are attracting the most attention from all parties. It is said that the Municipal Chamber of Commerce plans to re-adjust the more than 300 trade associations in this city to establish an autonomous control of Shanghai's economy. The main goals are as follows:

Obtain Guiding Power

Taking the acquisition of the guiding power of all trade associations as a prerequisite, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce itself must first be reformed. Therefore, the Municipal Chamber of Commerce is currently discussing reform measures. The key points of the reform are to break away from the character of liberalism and possess the elements of the highest control institution, so as to obtain guiding power and expand and strengthen its own guiding strength. At the same time, it requires the National Government to transfer the power to guide the associations to the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

Reorganize Unit Associations

There are currently more than 300 trade associations in Shanghai. However, in order to control commodities, there should be merged associations, and there should also be separate and independent associations. Taking reasonable control as a prerequisite, they should be re-adjusted. The nature of the current associations is an organization that maintains the same industry, that is, a liberalist group with profit objectives. Therefore, it will fundamentally change its character so that it can develop into a unit organization that controls Shanghai's economy.

Establish an Intermediate Control Mechanism

The more than 300 unit trade associations will be classified according to their nature. In each category of trade associations, a federation will be set up, whose position is intermediate between the unit association and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce.

The Municipal Chamber of Commerce's autonomy control plan is roughly as above. Whether it can be fully realized is another matter. In general, it seems to have received the support of the umbrella dealers. (March 2, Continental News)

Economic Commentary

### The Transformation of the Chinese Economy Should Be Epoch-Making

The characteristic of the Chinese economy is that China has always been the world's largest consumer country, living on borrowed money with annual trade deficits ranging from a minimum of over ten million yuan to as much as eighty million yuan. It was not until after 1932 that the Chinese people gradually began to pay attention to construction, the immaturity of which is self-evident. In today's world of intense commercial warfare, where the law of natural selection prevails and only the fittest survive, no nation can survive in the global community if it focuses solely on consumption and neglects production.

To achieve China's self-reliance, a transformative shift in the Chinese economy is necessary, from a consumer nation to a producer nation. In the past, China's exports were mostly raw materials and foodstuffs, while imports were manufactured goods, especially luxury and consumer goods. This is entirely characteristic of a consumer nation. Although imports of machinery, tools, vehicles, and ships have become increasingly important since 1932, imports of consumer goods remain significant. China is a country uniquely blessed with abundant resources, and its self-sufficiency in raw materials should be considerable, with imports mainly focused on necessities for production. This is the first point.

As the ancients said, foreign debt can be borrowed, but China must not borrow foreign debt. These are painful words. If China can make good use of foreign capital in the future, then borrowing foreign debt is not entirely impossible. Utilizing foreign capital properly means importing essential production materials under conditions that do not harm China's sovereignty, and genuinely engaging in industrial development. In this way, foreign debt can be repaid quickly through increased production, and the temporary trade deficit during the use of foreign capital is not a major concern. Otherwise, if debt is used to import luxury goods, or even for purposes that harm China's productive capacity, then China will be trapped in the position of a consumer nation, which is a matter of grave concern. This is the second point.

China has always been an agricultural nation. It is estimated that among the 400 million people, farmers account for about 300 million. Therefore, the livelihood of farmers affects the entire economic lifeline of China. Given the vastness and fertility of China's land (the economic advantage of production lies in agriculture), China's production should primarily focus on agriculture. Therefore, special attention must be paid to improving farming methods, enhancing the quality of agricultural products, and reclaiming wasteland to lay the foundation for China's production. In addition, expanding into forestry, animal husbandry, and fisheries will ensure that the country has ample resources. This is the third point.

Furthermore, major heavy industries must strive for self-sufficiency. Items essential for the lives of the people and the survival of the nation must be manufactured domestically. Transportation must be developed, and mineral resources must be exploited. The emphasis on agriculture does not mean neglecting industry and mining altogether; rather, they serve as supporting industries. This is the fourth point.

The above four points are merely the most salient. To realize them, the government should have a comprehensive and detailed plan and policies. State-owned enterprises should be state-operated, and private enterprises should be guaranteed reasonable profits and incentivized by the government. The people should abandon their ingrained habits of consumption, be hardworking and resilient, unite and cooperate, and each strive in their respective roles, fulfilling their responsibilities as citizens. Then, the majority of the 400 million people, who are currently consumers, can be transformed into productive citizens. Only with this epoch-making transformation of the Chinese economy can the emergence of a new China be discussed.

### Japanese Government Insists on Original Cost Accounting System: Explanation by President Suzuki of the Planning Board

The Japanese side, recognizing that industrial strength is the foundation of enhanced war capabilities, considers the strengthening and establishment of the industrial system to be a matter of utmost urgency. Taking advantage of the Diet session, they carefully reviewed the matter again. On the 24th, at the Special Wartime Administrative Law Committee of the Diet, Mr. Takao Godo raised questions about the original cost accounting system. President Suzuki of the Planning Board provided detailed explanations and clarifications, dispelling misunderstandings about the authorities' intentions to ease the original cost accounting system.

Mr. Takao Godo: During the budget committee chairman's report at the previous House of Representatives meeting, I raised questions about original cost accounting. The government's response indicated that while it could not be completely suspended, it was also inconvenient to implement it fully. Therefore, the public misunderstood that the authorities intended to ease the original cost accounting system. I would like to take this opportunity to clarify the matter.

President Suzuki of the Planning Board: This issue centers on the problem of prices. Insisting on a low-price policy to increase production is the origin of the relationship between original cost accounting and price issues. The government is determined to adhere to a low-price policy while striving to expand production. To rationalize various industries and improve efficiency, it is necessary to insist on the original cost accounting system. The public's perception of prices reflects the public psychology after the implementation of these prices. Industry personnel should prioritize the nation. If they can abandon all characteristics of trade profit, the original cost accounting system would be unnecessary. However, based on past economic conditions, the private sector is not yet able to abandon trade profit. Therefore, there is no intention to ease the original cost accounting system, and it will be handled appropriately depending on the situation.

Mr. Takao Godo: The public misunderstands the President's words. Original cost accounting should not be considered as price regulation, but rather as a way to improve efficiency. The expansion and contraction of the price index, apart from original cost accounting, has no other way. This is the necessity of original cost accounting.

President Suzuki: Using original cost accounting to move from low efficiency to high efficiency is more important than price regulation.

Mr. Takao Godo: There are already implementations of the original cost accounting system. There are discrepancies in the original cost accounting. For basic industries receiving subsidies, they must comply with the original cost accounting system. The original cost accounting system must be fully adopted, but single original cost accounting is not appropriate. Easing the original cost accounting system must not be allowed.

President Suzuki: There is fundamentally no intention to ease original cost accounting. The original cost accounting system will be maintained based on the principle of not being divorced from reality.

After Mr. Godo and President Suzuki finished their questioning, they questioned the Army and Navy authorities for their views. The directors of the Army and Navy Accounting Bureaus replied separately as follows:

Director Kuribayashi of the Army Accounting Bureau: Currently, the Army authorities are diligently implementing the original cost accounting system, and the results are exceptionally good. It is deeply felt that the original cost accounting system is the most necessary for expanding productivity. In short, the Army authorities will gradually strengthen the original cost accounting system and strive for rationalized production.

Director Takei of the Navy Accounting Bureau: Regarding the implementation of the original cost accounting system, the Navy holds the same view as the Army. This system is the only way to improve efficiency. Factories under the Navy's jurisdiction have been using this method for the past twenty years, and there have been no changes to date. In the future, efforts will be intensified to popularize this system. (February 25, Yomiuri Hochi)

### Japan Increases Taxes on Non-Essential Goods to Reduce Unnecessary Consumption by the People

Tokyo, March 31, Haitong News Agency: The Ministry of Finance, to reduce the purchasing power of the Japanese people in terms of unnecessary consumption, has increased various taxes starting today. Taxes on all luxury goods have been increased to 10 to 80 percent (previously 10 to 50 percent). Restaurant taxes have also increased significantly. Hotel bill taxes, previously 20 to 30 percent, have now been increased to 20 to 50 percent. Other taxes, such as gas, cinema, theater, and all entertainment taxes, have also increased significantly.

### Abolishing Import and Export Movement Restrictions Has a Very Positive Impact on the Economy: Mr. Shudo Talks After Inspecting North China

Mr. Shudo, Deputy Manager of the Yokohama Specie Bank's Shanghai Branch, recently went to North China and Manchuria to inspect the economy. He spent over a month and has now returned to Shanghai. At 4:30 PM one day, he told reporters at the bank that the currency and prices in North China, as well as the purchase of goods, were quite smooth. The two major issues of suppressing prices and purchasing goods have been implemented since mid-February. After the abolition of import and export restrictions in Tianjin and Beijing, the situation has gradually improved. In the following conversation, Shudo hinted at many measures for purchasing goods and suppressing prices in Central China. He believes that after the abolition of import and export restrictions in Beijing and Tianjin, the purchase of goods and the suppression of prices have improved. Because after the restrictions were lifted, all controlled commodities could be freely imported and exported without the permission of the authorities (except for special commodities). Therefore, the Chinese side unanimously expressed their appreciation. The material distribution and purchasing agencies after the abolition of restrictions there are currently under preparation. Once they are ready, the distribution and purchasing matters can be handled by a fixed agency, and the flow of materials will be smooth. This situation is the same in Shanghai. If the flow of materials can be opened and the distribution and purchase of materials can be handled freely within the possible scope, then the flow of materials can be smooth, and prices can gradually stabilize. If the price of rice in Central China and the price of wheat in North China fall, then other prices can also tend to stabilize. The supply of all materials in North China is centered on the purchasing agencies in various places, which are engaged in purchasing important agricultural products such as cotton and wheat. The supply of cotton and wheat is very smooth. Regarding financial currency work, the Allied Reserve Bank notes are widely circulated in North China and are deeply trusted by the people. The amount of circulation is quite large, and all materials are traded in Allied Reserve Bank notes. There are more than 30 branches and offices of the United Reserve Bank. In addition, there are the North China Provincial Bank and other Chinese banks, which unanimously assist in the work of Allied Reserve Bank notes. The ratio between the Japanese yen and the Allied Reserve Bank notes will not change in principle. (Translated from the March 2nd Continental News)

Economic Translation and Discussion

### The Question of the Reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange

Shanghai originally had two stock exchanges, one being the Chinese-owned Chinese Stock Exchange, and the other being the foreign-owned (mainly British and American) Shanghai Stock Exchange. The former, although having the name of a stock exchange, did not have the reality of a trading market for Chinese corporate capital, and only engaged in turbulent public debt speculation, eventually leading to its own decline. The latter traded 38 kinds of rubber and colonial stocks, as well as 155 kinds of stocks belonging to foreigners in China, including spinning mills, canals, banks, and insurance companies. Since the Japanese army occupied the concessions, these two stock exchanges have been in a state of closure.

However, the trading of securities in Shanghai will never disappear due to the closure of the above two stock exchanges. After the incident, powerful speculative funds tried to escape funds by secretly purchasing foreign exchange, foreign stocks, and depositing soft currency in foreign banks. With the elimination of foreign forces, they turned to purchasing Chinese stocks, causing an improper surge in stock prices in large and small trading markets outside the two exchanges. The number of various stocks also increased sharply, with the number of trading companies after the Greater East Asia War increasing from 19 to 128. This extremely unhealthy state intensified due to the increase in speculative funds, and at the end of last year, the policy of allowing the stock exchange to reopen was announced.

Regarding the reopening of the stock exchange, the authorities of the Asia Development Board first spoke on October 30 as follows: The Shanghai Stock Exchange will be reopened under military management. Under the Central China Liaison Department of the Asia Development Board, trading of Chinese stocks and central and local public bonds will be allowed, with the aim of reviving the economy of the peaceful areas. Therefore, strict measures will be taken to crack down on speculation as before. Secondly, on December 2, the Shanghai Embassy Office announced the application for traders and registered objects. Registered objects will be limited to Chinese stocks for the time being, and other various securities and public bonds will be registered after the opening of business depending on the situation. It is hoped to guide investment into important industrial sectors.

The above announcement of the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange caused a great response from all parties concerned, and they urgently awaited its realization. The Shanghai Stock Exchange has been delayed and has not yet reopened, and it is rumored that there are some entanglements, probably because various difficult problems will arise when it is implemented. Establishing a securities exchange in Shanghai is necessary not only for the future, but also for the current realistic problems. The points officially announced by the authorities cannot be regarded as having no further developments. Various measures will eventually be taken to realize it. Now, assuming that we leave this issue aside, what mission does the Shanghai Stock Exchange have under the Greater East Asia War?

According to the announcement of the embassy, the purpose of the reopening of the Shanghai Stock Exchange is to guide national capital into the necessary industrial sectors under the appropriate management of stock prices. Studying the situation after the opening of business, not only will Chinese stocks be limited, but also various other securities and public bonds will be included, possibly including the various companies related to the revitalization of Central China, rubber stocks, and various other Japanese stocks. For all important industries and investments in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it is difficult to complete solely by reopening the stock exchange, because the interest rate in China is as high as 30 percent, so a dividend of 5 or 6 percent is not enough to become an investment target. Assuming that funds are used for speculative operations, the result will inevitably make the buying and selling of such stocks very popular, but this trend will also affect other regions, which is still not a good phenomenon. To guide funds into the necessary industrial sectors, no matter what method is used, is not the task that should be assigned to the Shanghai Stock Exchange in the current wartime situation.

Secondly, what about the supply of funds for various industries operated by the Chinese? The current so-called fierce search for Chinese stocks has nothing to do with the business of the various enterprises. For example, the textile industry, due to the insufficient supply of raw cotton, the supply of power is not expected to improve, and the sales channels are also becoming narrower, so there is no reason to be optimistic about its future. However, textile stocks are rising abnormally. The publications of various bookstores have almost been cut off, but cultural-related stocks are also rising similarly. The object of investment does not regard its own business, but regards the value of its assets as the standard of selection.

Not only that, but under the above-mentioned difficult production conditions, more stocks are actually increasing capital. About 50 Chinese enterprises increased production in the second half of last year, and the most serious case was an increase of 24 times in two years. The main reasons for increasing capital are the soaring prices, the expansion of assets, and the jump in old capital. China originally had few decent industries other than textiles and flour mills. In addition to the above-mentioned actual situation of Chinese stocks, it is difficult to treat the Shanghai Stock Exchange with the scale of advanced countries introducing industrial funds. Therefore, the current reopening of the stock exchange should aim at adopting measures to deal with speculation and stimulate the expansion of speculative funds. Although the reopening of the stock exchange cannot hope to guide speculative funds into national capital, it can be said to be a great harvest if it can slightly reduce the speculation in the stock market. Mobilizing the production funds of the Shanghai market is an urgent task that should be planned for in the future. If there is cooperation from the Chinese side, more bold measures can be taken.

Qingjing Lecture Series

### From the Anguish of Enterprises: On the Future of Enterprises

In the sixth issue of the first volume of "Enterprise Weekly," Mr. Guo Zuxiao has an article entitled "The Anguish of Enterprises." In this article, Mr. Guo wrote about the various anguishes of the current business community in a very systematic manner, representing the business community in shouting out the depression in their hearts. Now, in this heavy anguish, we have already seen a bright path: Following this path, we will be able to reach the bright shore, as long as we see whether we have the determination to take this path and how to take this path. What is this path? It is the wartime economic policy guidelines formulated by the first plenary meeting of the National Economic Committee of the National Government on February 12.

The passage of the wartime economic policy guidelines is the most significant achievement of the National Government since it declared war on Britain and the United States. Although the government will also formulate various wartime policy guidelines suitable for the needs of the situation after the war in other areas besides the economy, such as politics, military affairs, and education, etc., in view of the fact that the people's livelihood is the ultimate goal of all problems, we stand at the position of the industrial and commercial business community and say that the passage of the wartime economic policy guidelines is a great achievement that transcends everything, which is naturally not too much.

The wartime economic policy guidelines include a total of five items and 22 articles, none of which are not aimed at the shortcomings of the current economic community, and none of which are not suitable for the needs of the current economic community. It can be said to be a refreshing prescription for curing the anguish of the business community. But: We must know that it is easy to set a direction, and after setting a direction, we must continue to practice in order to receive the expected effect, and this effect is the price of hard practice.

From the formulation and promulgation of these wartime economic policy guidelines by the authorities, we can clearly see the determination of the authorities, but it is not enough to rely on the determination of the authorities alone. To make the process of practice more effective, it must rely on the cooperation of the private sector, especially the industrial and commercial business community.

Therefore, I cannot but talk about the issue of prices first. The issue of prices is the foundation of all economic issues. The purpose of solving the entire wartime economic policy guidelines is nothing more than the issue of prices: Only under the premise of stable prices can all economic facilities and various legitimate businesses be able to seek their legitimate and substantial development in stability. Then, we can accurately control our business. May I ask: Do we need such an environment and situation?

The best development of industrial and commercial enterprises is the development in stability as mentioned above. Although there are examples of making profits behind closed doors by relying solely on rising prices, that is a false profit. The current hoarding mentality believes that holding materials is always more valuable than holding currency or saving soft currency. They have a fundamental misconception of looking down on the credibility of currency or deposits: They do not know that the depreciation of the value of currency or deposits is due to the soaring value of materials. Currently, the currency circulating in the Hua Central and Hua South areas is the reserve coupon. Although the reserve coupon has increased in recent years, the large amount of old legal tender being withdrawn and prohibited from use, as well as the increasing expansion of the reserve coupon's circulation area, can be seen that its issuance has not reached the point of flooding, and on the contrary, we see a kind of artificial contraction. The means of that artificial contraction is to tighten the lending of the Central Reserve Bank to the same industry on the one hand, and to urge the same industry to hand over the legal part of the deposit reserve to the Central Reserve Bank to make the reserve coupon flow back; its purpose is to use this method of tightening currency issuance to create a tight silver root in the market to suppress this speculative hoarding atmosphere. Who knows that the silver root in the market is indeed tight, but this speculative hoarding mentality is still not easy to eliminate. It can be seen that to seek a reasonable solution to the price problem, it is not enough to start purely from the currency side. After this speculative hoarding atmosphere spreads and becomes the ordinary hoarding mentality in society, not only is the general industrial and commercial community unwilling to sell their goods in large quantities, but also all classes of the people are unwilling to maintain their purchasing power and are eager to purchase non-urgent materials, which makes the industrial and commercial community have the anguish that even if they are willing to sell their goods, they cannot replenish them at the original price. So: price increases, panic buying, with limited materials, for insatiable demands, prices rise faster for reasons other than productivity and transportation. After such a vicious cycle is created, most people's energy is spent on unnecessary waste, so: the shrinkage of production capacity is formed, which in turn creates a vicious cycle. As prices continue to rise in this way, everyone's mind has the illusion that prices will continue to rise, but they do not know that this mentality is one of the important factors that contribute to the rise in prices. So: today, A has some currency in hand and uses it to purchase materials from B: tomorrow, B uses the currency to purchase materials from within, C from D, D from E, everyone only wants to purchase materials, and everyone only adds profits to the materials. Prices will certainly continue to rise, and the silver root will become tighter as a result. This is the other side of the relationship between prices and currency.

Since the rise in prices has formed the decline in currency value: the decline in currency value has also formed the expansion of industrial and commercial expenditures. Today's industry and commerce can make money without doing business behind closed doors, but they must always sell part of their goods to make up for their huge expenses. If this situation continues unchanged, there will always be a day when all the inventory on hand is completely transformed into expenses and consumed. Even if only a unit of goods is kept on hand, the book value is still thousands of times more than the capital. Do you hoarding people who only hope to make huge profits from rising prices and do not plan to serve the society from your own position, have you thought about it?

Since we know that the profits generated by the rise in prices are not true profits, we should fundamentally eliminate this hoarding and speculation mentality and stabilize prices at the current level. Then, under the supervision and guidance of the authorities, according to the guidelines set in the wartime economic policy guidelines, everyone should do their best, and everyone should devote themselves to improving production, transportation, distribution, and other institutions from their own position. From now on, consumers will no longer purchase more than they need or non-urgent materials, the industrial and commercial business community will no longer waste useful energy and time on the repeated investment of existing materials, and will no longer sell inventory to unscrupulous merchants who intend to hoard, everyone will regard the wartime economic policy guidelines as a mirror and use the courage to blame others to help themselves. Then, although the current enterprise is full of anguish, the bright future of the enterprise may be just around the corner. (Lu Tingfang)

### Special Feature on Prominent Figures in the Economic World

— Mr. Lin Kanghou

Mr. Lin Kanghou, a native of Shanghai, Jiangsu, is currently sixty-eight years old. In his youth, he held innovative ideas. Upon reaching adulthood, he dedicated himself to improving education, having founded the primary school affiliated with Nanyang Public School, where he served as head for ten years. Throughout his life, he cultivated numerous talents, and many prominent figures in society have emerged from his tutelage. When the provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang organized the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway, he was in charge. Subsequently, he was recruited by the financial sector and served as the manager of the Shanghai branch of the New China Savings Bank. After 1921, he became the manager of the Shanghai Chinese Banking Corporation, while also prioritizing serving society. He participated in various Shanghai associations, such as charitable, public welfare, and commercial organizations. In 1927, when the National Government was established, he presided over the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce, serving as chairman. The following year, he concurrently served as chairman of the National Federation of Chambers of Commerce. At that time, the Shanghai Banking Association appointed him as secretary-general, a position he held for seventeen years. In 1936, he served as the deputy head of the delegation to Siam (now Thailand). In 1938, he attended the 24th International Labour Conference and the 16th World Red Cross Conference. He also toured countries such as Britain, America, Germany, and Italy, returning home after more than half a year. Last spring, he returned to Shanghai from Hong Kong and, in accordance with his long-held aspirations to serve society, he resumed his role as secretary-general of the Banking Association and held key positions in other charitable and public welfare undertakings.

Mr. Lin is blessed with a naturally robust constitution, rarely suffering from illness throughout his life. He always maintains an optimistic outlook, never speaking harshly or looking sternly. He is kind and approachable in his interactions with others. He rises early every day and always attends meetings and banquets, no matter how busy he may be. He enjoys drinking alcohol, but not in excess. At the age of sixty, he gave up smoking. In his leisure time, he finds joy in practicing calligraphy, and many seek his work. His calligraphy follows the style of Li Bei Hai, exhibiting elegance and grace.

Mr. Lin, noting that the number of member banks has increased from only fifty-odd in the past to over one hundred and twenty today, believes that this progress is rare in the history of Chinese banking. He believes that it is important to establish a solid foundation to ensure the long-term prosperity of the Chinese financial sector. This is an issue worthy of study for those engaged in the banking industry. Mr. Lin believes that there is a shortage of qualified personnel in the banking industry. While there are many competent individuals, there are also those who are unqualified. Often, they lack the necessary skills in dealing with customers and handling procedures, and urgent training is needed to improve their professional development. He also stated that during the banking business hours of one to three o'clock, it seems that there is nothing to do. This waste of time is contrary to the ancient virtue of cherishing every moment. The authorities of each bank should pay attention to the employees' after-work hours and provide more guidance and training in technology and knowledge. At the same time, the bank should cultivate specialized talents. Otherwise, it would merely be adding a customer to the consumer industry, and the resulting malpractices, however minor, should not be ignored. Regarding the issue of commodity controls, Mr. Lin believes that the principle is good, but in China, with its vast territory and different customs, it is necessary to adapt to local conditions in order to be effective. Therefore, he believes that the methods of controlling essential goods still need to be studied and improved to achieve perfection. Regarding the items that are already under control, he believes that it is necessary to strictly crack down on the black market in order to maintain the livelihood of the people.

Free Talk

### Striving for Life

— Wu Jing

I was chatting with a few salaried friends, and all we talked about was the same old complaint: "Life is hard."

Just then, a pair of birds outside the window were singing in the trees. One friend listened and said with great emotion: "Listen to those birds, how happy their lives are! Alas, we humans, the most intelligent of all creatures, are not as free as they are!"

The other friends present nodded in agreement, wishing they could instantly sprout wings and go sing on the branches too.

Writers often praise the carefree nature of singing birds and swimming fish in their works. When we read good poetry, we often feel "transcendent" and "ethereal" because poets praise fish and birds.

People struggle for life, either relying on others, or flattering superiors, or running around, or deceiving and intimidating, working hard both mentally and physically, and it is really not easy, especially in these extraordinary times. It is only natural to envy singing birds and swimming fish because of the difficulties of life.

However, from a biological point of view, this concept is wrong. According to biologists, all living things must struggle for life; the higher the living thing, the more complex the life, and the more difficult it is to make a living.

We see singing birds and swimming fish as free, but in fact, they spend a lot of energy looking for food, finding mates, and defending against enemies. How can they be carefree? What "bird happiness" or "fish happiness" is just human subjectivity. If singing birds and swimming fish are really full of happiness, then how can we explain "a bird startled by a bow" and "when the city gate catches fire, the fish in the moat suffer"?

In short, unless you don't want to be a living thing, if you want to be a living thing, especially a higher living thing, you must strive for life. Although there are many unreasonable things in the current society, we must strive to improve them and never be decadent and passive.

### A Casual Discussion on Insomnia

— Zhong Ren

These days, insomnia can be said to be a common epidemic, especially among intellectuals and salaried workers.

The brains of intellectuals (including salaried workers) are specially trained institutions that are good at thinking. In peacetime, their thoughts are limited to the two areas of work and knowledge. Now, the cost of living is so high that they have added a difficult-to-solve problem of life to their brains. It's like adding a tangled hair to the mechanism of a clock. Naturally, it will make them worry and worry, and over time, it will become what is called insomnia.

Nineteen out of ten cases of insomnia are mental illnesses, which can be proved by the fact that one out of a hundred manual laborers suffers from insomnia. The only way to get sick is to consult a doctor, and the best thing to do when you have insomnia is to ask a doctor to diagnose it, because physical illnesses can also cause insomnia. However, if your insomnia is due to mental unrest, the doctor cannot give you much help. At most, he can only tell you some self-healing methods.

To treat insomnia, you must have a fixed time to get up and go to bed. You must go to bed at a certain time at night and get up at a certain time in the morning. This is a prerequisite for treating insomnia. Patients must develop good sleeping habits.

Rest is the main factor in sleeping well. When going to bed, all the nerves and muscles of the body must be relaxed at the same time, and must not be tense. When the brain is working at high speed, the body cannot get the rest it needs, which is why intellectuals often suffer from insomnia.

Physical fatigue alone cannot make people fall asleep. The participants in the bicycle endurance race can sit on the bicycle for five or six days in a row. During these days, he carries half an hour of sleep each time, and he must also work hard to fight. We always thought that he must sleep for a few days after the end of the game, but in fact he had to wait more than ten hours after the end to fall asleep, because he was overstimulated, and his nerves and muscles were still in a state of tension. He had to wait until the nerves and muscles were relaxed before he could fall asleep as usual.

Some people often say: "I can't sleep at all at night." He doesn't think his words are a bit too much. There is absolutely no one in the world who can't sleep at all. People with minor illnesses and pains often like to exaggerate their illnesses and pains. If he says: "I only slept for two hours last night." In fact, he probably slept for three or four hours, but the fact is that intermittent and discontinuous sleep every two or thirty minutes cannot completely restore the body's fatigue.

Some people often say: "I always have to go to bed very late to fall asleep, and I have to wake up very early in the morning." This person's insomnia is often due to psychological effects. He thinks that he must go to bed at two thirty to fall asleep, and as a result, he can't fall asleep until two thirty. He thinks that he must wake up at four thirty, and as a result, he wakes up at four thirty.

People who think they can't sleep well are nineteen out of ten cases of not sleeping well. This is a bit like hypnotism, because he believes that he can't sleep, so he can't sleep. Regardless of whether there is a physical illness or not, the treatment of insomnia has a significant relationship with the patient's mental attitude.

If you can eliminate worries and close your eyes to rest peacefully, insomnia will not have much impact. The worst thing is to worry. If you don't get enough sleep today but don't worry, you can make up for the lack of sleep tomorrow. As long as you can eliminate worries, insomnia is not a concern.

However, in the current situation, most people have many worries. Last summer, cholera, typhoid fever, and other infectious diseases were discovered in the city. Fortunately, the Public Works Bureau implemented strict epidemic prevention, and it did not become a major disaster. If someone could invent a surgery to cut off the root of insomnia for most people today, that would be Amitabha, and the merit would be immeasurable.

### Root

"I've already spoken with Master Huang," Master Yang picked up the covered tea bowl and took a sip, but the tea didn't help his throat. The sounds coming out were still extremely hoarse, "Master Huang sees that you're really suffering!"

"Yes, yes." He retreated two steps.

"Master Huang also considered my face!"

"Yes, yes." He retreated two more steps.

"Finally, he agreed to buy your field!"

"Yes, yes." He had retreated very far, not knowing where to retreat to.

"Genming, you sit here," someone said to him from behind.

"Yes, yes." He replied, turning around to see a pale-faced man of about his age, and continued, "Mr. Du Zhou, it's really cold today, I'm sorry to trouble you to come."

Saying that, he sat down on a round stool next to Mr. Du Zhou.

"Master Huang said," the hoarse voice was still ringing, "that piece of what field!"

"Old Stone," Genming replied.

"That piece of Old Stone is priced at fifty silver dollars."

"Yes, yes." He habitually replied twice, but immediately realized and changed his tone, "But, but..."

"But what? I persuaded him every way I could, and Master Huang finally considered my face and added four dollars, totaling fifty-four dollars, that's good enough."

"But, but..." Of course he didn't think it was good enough, but he couldn't say anything.

"Fifty-four silver dollars, isn't that good?"

"But, but..."

Master Yang said nothing more and began to puff on the water pipe Master Huang handed him.

Genming "butted" for a while and then stopped "butting." He was thinking, thinking about what words he could use to increase the amount by a few dollars.

Suddenly, a person at the account desk by the window turned around, took the cigarette out of his mouth, exhaled the smoke he had inhaled, and said lightly, "Old Gen, are you selling the field?"

### Eighth Place in the January Essay Contest, My Life (Part 1)

— Ziwei

—A Glimpse of Life as a Clerk—

At this moment, I am writing this article as a "minimum" clerk in a money shop. However, in the past, I was not from a "regular" background, having apprenticed and studied for three years. It's embarrassing to say, but I used to make a living with a pen, serving as a so-called "uncrowned king," a journalist. But suddenly, I "left the priesthood halfway," abandoning the pen for the abacus, becoming inextricably linked with numbers. This is entirely the work of "the times" and "the environment." Even I feel like I'm dreaming, unable to control myself.

I was born into a middle-class family in an ancient city on the north bank of the Yangtze River in Jiangsu. My parents were married for more than twenty years and had ten children, including brothers, sisters, and me. As the "eldest son," this "full house of children," which others often call "blessed," was a heavy burden for my father. Therefore, he had high expectations for the "eldest son." He wanted to make me a talent to help him shoulder part of the burden. But with limited financial resources, he could only provide for me up to high school graduation. I couldn't afford to go to college. Since there was no hope of further education, I had to find a job in society. But at that time, I was just an eighteen-year-old high school student, and it was really not easy to find a job in the "overstaffed" job market. "Unemployed" at home, I had no way to vent my mental depression, so I borrowed a pen for recreation, often submitting articles to a local newspaper. Fortunately, the editor had a "keen eye," and my clumsy articles often appeared in the newspaper. The remuneration was of course very limited, but later, that editor became my "literary friend." He recommended me to the newspaper's president and invited me to edit the "supplement." The salary was also very low, but it provided room and board. At that time, I was young and eager to do good, and my desire to publish was very strong. Once I was "honored" as an editor, wielding scissors and paste and evaluating articles, I was as happy as a "king facing south." I didn't care about the meager salary. Unfortunately, a good dream doesn't last long. At the age of twenty, I married a woman I didn't know. After marriage, the "household expenses" increased day by day. The few dollars I received from the newspaper were not enough. My father and wife also didn't approve of me doing this all the time. Coincidentally, the "×× Railway Bureau" Car Service Department was recruiting prospective car service staff. A relative who worked at the bureau wrote a letter calling me to Shanghai to take the exam. Fortunately, I was admitted. But in the second month of my training at the "Railway Bureau" after painfully "giving up" my editing job, unfortunately, war broke out. Our training class was immediately disbanded. From then on, I followed my family, moving from place to place to escape the disaster, living a life of fear, displacement, and instability. It wasn't until the second half of the year before last that I returned to my hometown, where order had been restored. I was still "unemployed," but the soaring cost of living did not allow me to leisurely find a suitable job. So, relying on the favor of relatives, I "ate without choosing food" and squeezed into the money shop.

Speaking of money shops, they are generally considered to be the "nerve center" of commerce, second only to banks. They have a lot of money, and the living standards of employees are much better than in other industries. The work is easy, and there are fixed hours. This is certainly true, but the young people working in the money shop always feel that there are many places where they are not satisfied. To be honest, I am also "one of the dissatisfied." This is of course due to the lack of patience, fickleness, and fondness for the new and dislike of the old among young people, but this kind of "freehand" life has its own shortcomings. "There is no need to hide it." Let me explain a few points:

### A Brief Discussion on Art Education

— Boke

Crude production, deceptive lenses, can represent most of today's shadow plays; absurd structure, exaggerated performances, can represent most of today's dramas; the promotion of taste, the selling of gimmicks, can represent most of today's magazines. In them, you can't find art.

I don't know if the people who run them understand art. If they do, maybe there's something they can't help but pretend they don't understand, and don't express true art. If they don't understand, then of course there's even less to talk about.

If the kind of art they are now showing is not guided, supplemented, and corrected by true art education, where will our art flow to? I think no one can deny that our art will inevitably regress for thirty or fifty years, to the point of not knowing what it's talking about, until some future person with a heart comes along to start over. This is truly a huge waste!

Now, if there are those who can engage in true art education, then, whether it's an organization or an individual, we always welcome them. We are always willing to lend a hand to their cause, so that they can see its completion as soon as possible. At the same time, young people who love art are always more willing to receive this kind of education.

Recently, I saw the (China Art) Monthly, and visited its publisher, the "China Academy of Art," once, which gave me a lot of feelings. In today's world, people only know how to make money in shadow plays, dramas, and magazines, who still pays attention to art and art education. But I believe their work is precious, and the future will definitely tell us the truth.

However, we cannot but have true art, and we cannot but have active art education. However, in such a large city as Shanghai, there are only a few people engaged in this. How can this not make me feel infinitely emotional! (Remuneration for scholarship assistance)

### The Spirit of Mutual Assistance in Friend's Day

Preferential Treatment for Teachers to Benefit Impoverished Children

(1) A letter from the Friendship Mutual Aid Medical Center: "Parents gave birth to me, friends love me. We are pleased to celebrate Friendship Day on March 3rd. Our hospital is named Friendship Mutual Aid. In order to repay the kindness of friends, we are holding a Friendship Free Medical Commemorative Week. Because life has been difficult recently and nutrition is difficult to provide, there are many people suffering from lung disease and skin disease. During this week, those suffering from the above-mentioned diseases can send a letter to inquire about their condition, or ask for research on difficult and complicated diseases. No fees will be charged. Those with lung disease who wish to go to a quiet place for recuperation (such as West Lake in Hangzhou) can also be introduced on their behalf, so as to reduce the pain of sick friends and fulfill the obligation of human mutual assistance." The address is at the intersection of Route Say Zoong and Route Cardinal Foch.

(2) Mr. Tong Chi-leung is enthusiastic about public welfare and sympathizes with the poor and sick. He especially respects teachers. Now, taking advantage of this newspaper's organization of the Primary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund, he generously donated 1,000 dollars, saved from his grandson Kai-fong's wedding, to the aid fund. Mr. Tong's spirit of mutual assistance is truly an example for the general public.

(3) In response to this newspaper's Primary School Teacher Medical Aid Fund, Dr. Poon Bing-kui will provide free preferential treatment to all primary school teachers and poor students who are introduced by this newspaper or have written proof from the school. The clinic is located at No. 3, Lane 390, Fong Pan Road, Nanshi, every morning, closed on Sundays.

(4) A letter from Mr. Szeman: "I was very impressed after reading in your newspaper the plan to send orphaned children back to their hometowns. I have now heard that the Fu You Yuan is run by special staff, is seriously managed, and is economically transparent. In order to support its development, I donated 500 dollars from the 50th birthday banquet of Mr. Yim Ming-tak Tang to help with the needs of work-study programs. (Please ask the accountant of the hospital to prepare a receipt to be collected at this office.)

(5) Mr. Chan Hang-sun's grandson donated 50 dollars to the Notre Dame Infant Asylum for the sake of saving orphans, so as to create blessings for his ancestors.

(Please ask the treasurer of the hall to prepare a receipt to be collected at this office.)
