### Shift in the Center of Gravity of the World War Situation

The end of the bitter fighting in Tunisia is only a matter of time. The eyes of world strategists and war situation observers have begun to shift to the Mediterranean region. The battle for "Who is the master of the Mediterranean" will undoubtedly be the second act of the world war in 1943.

The Mediterranean is a vital link between Asia, Europe, and Africa. For thousands of years, the struggles of various nations with the Mediterranean as their stage have been aimed at controlling the Mediterranean in order to manipulate the politics and economy of the three continents. Britain has long wanted to make the Mediterranean a pond in its own golden valley, excluding the power of other nations, and exclusively enjoying its economic and even political privileges. Especially since the Battle of La Hogue in 1692, it has grasped the hegemony of the Western Mediterranean, and then attempted to grasp the entire Mediterranean in order to establish its dominance over the European continent and the relationship between the three continents. And the Mediterranean coastal countries, such as Italy, France, Turkey, and Spain, all hope to obtain the sovereignty of the Mediterranean in order to protect their military and economic security. This strategic situation has even more important significance today. Especially since General Rommel flew to the African battlefield and the Axis forces occupied Crete as their center, the Axis forces that rushed from Libya to Egypt, if they captured Cairo and controlled the Suez Canal, while at the same time the Axis forces on the eastern front marched south from the Caucasus and converged in West Asia, the Mediterranean would become an inland sea for Germany and Italy; and more importantly, at that time, through the Persian Gulf and the Indian Ocean, the wars in East Asia and Europe and Africa would be integrated. Due to various accidental events, especially the betrayal of the Darlan faction in France, the landing of American troops in Africa, and the westward advance of British troops, this situation has been blocked. However, from the perspective of the entire war situation, the Axis forces must not slacken their determination to defend the Mediterranean. Because only by exerting all their strength to ensure their dominance over the Mediterranean can they maintain the strategic superiority of the Axis powers on the European battlefield and launch their offensive against Africa and West Asia again.

At present, the situation in the Mediterranean seems to be favorable to the anti-Axis forces on the surface. Once the war in Tunisia ends, the British, American, and French rebel forces may control the entire southern coast, posing a major threat to Italy, the southern coast of France, and Greek territory. However, up to today, the Axis forces still maintain a considerable superior position in the Mediterranean. The Apennine Peninsula, which protrudes into the Mediterranean, is, in terms of terrain, a victorious foundation for Mediterranean operations. From this peninsula and between Sicily and Bizerte in Tunisia, the Axis forces maintain an unshakable line of communication, completely invalidating Malta, the main strategic stronghold of the United Kingdom, and ensuring the persistence of the war in Tunisia. In addition, since the Axis forces entered the southern coast of France, they have been actively engaged in defense facilities, which not only suppressed the brewing of internal rebellions in France, but also became a powerful guarantee for Spain to consistently adhere to its position. In the Eastern Mediterranean, the main strategic bases such as the Dodecanese and Crete are all in the hands of the Axis forces, preventing the anti-Axis forces in Cyprus from operating, and at the same time becoming the basis for Turkey's firm neutrality. In summary, the overall situation in the Mediterranean shows that the Axis forces still occupy a superior position. When the United Kingdom and Italy attempt to further expand the war situation, they must first hesitate because of this established fact. Therefore, even the most lighthearted and optimistic strategists in the United States have recently had to point out that if the war in Tunisia ends, the anti-Axis forces will have to engage in bitter fighting in the Mediterranean for at least six months before there is a possibility of launching a "second front" towards the European continent.

Regardless of the future trend of the world war situation, in addition to the real situation in the Mediterranean, we must also recognize that the following two battlefields are always of decisive significance. The first battlefield is the Eastern Front between Germany and the Soviet Union. The muddy season following winter is coming to an end. In the past few months, the Axis forces have been committed to preparing for the spring and summer offensives, avoiding the consumption of combat power in the war, and striving to increase new combat power in the rear. The Battle of Kharkov was a small test. The launch of a major offensive in the future is expected. During the same period, the Soviet Union adopted an offensive stance. Therefore, whether the consumption of combat power and the reorganization of new combat power in the rear can be compared with the Axis forces is ultimately a question. Therefore, we can assert that the future battles on the Eastern Front are no less important than the Mediterranean or other battlefields. Without a sure-win premise on the Eastern Front, the United Kingdom and the United States will never be able to launch the so-called "second front." This is very obvious.

The second battlefield that will determine the future war situation is in the Pacific. We must solemnly point out that, no matter how cleverly the United Kingdom and the United States argue, in the past year or more, the reason why the anti-Axis forces have not been able to open up a "second front" in Europe is not so much due to the contradictions between the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union, or various other reasons, but rather to say bluntly that it is due to the lack of strength of the United Kingdom and the United States. And the main reason for the lack of strength of the United Kingdom and the United States is that, in addition to the fact that almost all of the United Kingdom's military force has been concentrated in the Mediterranean, the more important thing is that most of the United States' combat power has been dragged down in the Pacific. Now, while strategists and newspapers in the United Kingdom and the United States are extravagantly talking about "future war situations" and "second fronts," they have to pay special attention to Japan's threat to the Southwest Pacific and even the United States mainland. The panicked cries of "Australia is about to be invaded" and that the Japanese army will conquer all of "New Guinea" can further prove this point, and the crux of the anti-Axis forces' loss of confidence in the future war situation lies.

In short, the shift in the center of gravity of the world war situation has obviously made the Mediterranean a battlefield of renewed focus for people around the world, while the Eastern Front and the Pacific battlefield will always have a decisive force on the world war. We East Asian nations should especially enhance our confidence in victory in this new war situation, and strive for the sacred goal, and never allow ourselves to be complacent and evade responsibility.

### The Soviet Government Announces Severance of Diplomatic Relations with Poland: First Exposure of Rifts in the Allied Camp

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th - Moscow Radio announced last night that the Soviet government has severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile of General Sikorski in London. This is the first public rupture within the so-called "Allied" camp. Central News Agency, Stockholm, 27th

According to Moscow Radio: Soviet Foreign People's Commissar Molotov issued a note verbale to the Polish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Roman, on the 26th, announcing the Soviet government's severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government. After receiving the note verbale, Ambassador Roman departed from Moscow for Kuybyshev. The contents of the Soviet government's note verbale to Poland are as follows: (1) The attitude of the Polish government-in-exile towards the Soviet Union is obviously abnormal, and it despises all the rules and normal procedures between allied countries. (2) At the time when hostile rumors about the Soviet government massacring Polish officers and soldiers in Smolensk were rampant in the international community, the Polish government-in-exile also took the opportunity to engage in hostile propaganda, and attempted to expand the incident with its newspapers. (3) The Polish government-in-exile not only demanded that the Soviet government clarify the incident, but also further requested the International Red Cross in Geneva to investigate the truth of the incident. In view of the above, the Soviet government declared the severance of diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile.

### The Course of the Breakdown of Soviet-Polish Relations

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - Previously, when German troops began fighting with Poland in September 1939, Soviet troops took the opportunity to invade Poland, seize most of eastern Poland, and incorporate it into their own territory. Regarding this matter, the Polish government-in-exile in London made a serious protest to the Soviet government, but the Soviet government stated that the area originally belonged to the Soviet Union, and was later taken away by Poland based on the Treaty of Versailles, and completely ignored the protest of the Polish government-in-exile. Since then, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland has been in a state of severance. It was not until June 21, 1941, when Germany and the Soviet Union went to war, that the Soviet government attempted to restore diplomatic relations with the Polish government-in-exile. Therefore, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski went to Moscow for negotiations, and as a result, the two countries concluded an alliance. In the treaty, the Soviet government stated that it would respect Poland's sovereignty, and agreed to release Polish prisoners of war to recover lost territories, and that the two armies would cooperate in fighting the German army. After the Soviet army's first winter counter-offensive began, the Soviet Union mobilized all propaganda organs to clearly express its intention to incorporate the old Polish territory into its own territory after the war. Foreign People's Commissar Korniychuk openly denied the existence of the Polish state in Pravda, and the Polish government-in-exile became deeply uneasy, and ordered Ambassador Roman to the Soviet Union to make a serious protest to the Soviet government. At the same time, Polish Prime Minister Sikorski personally came forward and begged the British and American governments to support the post-war guarantee of the borders of old Poland, but the British and American governments, in order to curry favor with the Soviet Union, did not care about it because the time was still early. The Polish government was greatly disappointed with this ambiguous attitude of the British and American governments. It once again questioned the Soviet side, but the Soviet government sent a final ultimatum to Polish Prime Minister Sikorski. As a result, the relationship between the Soviet Union and Poland encountered a breakdown at this point. On April 22, the German authorities announced that the Soviet secret police had massacred more than 10,000 Polish officers and soldiers in the Katyn Forest near Smolensk. Upon hearing the news, the Polish government was deeply indignant and demanded that the Soviet Union explain the details, but the Soviet government only said that this was fabricated by German Propaganda Minister Goebbels and ignored it. As a result, the Polish government entrusted the International Red Cross to investigate the truth, and the Soviet government believed that the "ally" in the anti-Axis camp had been encouraged by Axis officials and had taken hostile actions, so it became angry and broke off relations with Poland out of shame. Judging from the statement issued by the Polish government-in-exile in London on the 16th, it can be seen that the Soviet Union and Poland were really unable to share the same boat.

### Emergency Meeting of the Polish Government

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - According to a telegram from London: After the Polish government-in-exile severed diplomatic relations with the Soviet Union, in order to decide the government's future attitude, it convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 11:00 a.m. today, but did not issue any official statement after the meeting. There are still several divisions of Polish troops stationed in Iran, so the relationship between the army and the Soviet army is highly valued by the general public. However, according to observation, because the Polish army is stationed in British army garrison areas, the problem of handling the Polish army after the severance of Soviet-Polish relations may not become serious.

### Washington Expresses Regret Upon Hearing the News

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - According to a Washington dispatch: A U.S. State Department spokesman expressed regret yesterday over the breakdown of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and the Polish government-in-exile. He said, "The U.S. government does not express its opinion on the issue of discord between the two governments, but is deeply saddened to learn of this development."

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 27th - The British Foreign Office recently expressed its opinion on the Soviet government's announcement of the severance of diplomatic relations with Poland, briefly stating that the only countries that are probably satisfied with the incident are the Axis powers, and that this incident can be said to be a victory for Goebbels' propaganda. As for the anti-Axis countries, they do not have any identical relationship with either the Soviet Union or Poland, but only hope to maintain the unity between the anti-Axis countries.

### Identification Work on the Mass Grave Case

Central News Agency, Berlin, 27th - According to a Havas news report, 500 corpses of Polish officers were exhumed by Kotensenko in mid-April, and the corpses were buried in a hidden place in the forest. Now that the Polish Red Cross has joined the investigation committee, the identification work is proceeding smoothly, and the list of identified corpses has been announced by the German side. The ranks of the victims range from lieutenant to colonel, and they all belong to the army and air force.

Central News Agency, Madrid, Spain, 27th - The famous Spanish medical scientist, Professor Bi Jia of Forensic Medicine at Madrid University, has departed for Smolensk to examine the corpses of Polish officers in the mass grave case with many foreign medical experts.

### Jin-Nan Encirclement Battle Nears Completion; War Enters Final Stage

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin-Nan Taihang Mountain front on the 27th, the Japanese army's annihilation battle against the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing forces has entered the final stage. The Chongqing troops in the Linqi Basin and near Lingchuan, Tianjiajing, Badong, and Yaoji are now in a state of complete chaos, surrounded by the Japanese army, and will soon be annihilated. Jiang Dingwen, commander of the Ji-Cha war zone, has not sent reinforcements to preserve his own strength, so the generals and colonels who surrendered to the Japanese army are all indignant. Chongqing is quite dissatisfied with Jiang Dingwen's actions regarding the failure of this battle. Wei Lihuang was criticized by Chongqing for the failure of the Central Plains campaign the year before last, and was dismissed. Jiang Dingwen, director of the Tianshui Xingying, was ordered to succeed Wei Lihuang. With the defeat of the 24th Army Group and the surrender of Sun Dianying, the commander of the newly formed 5th Army, it is expected that Jiang Dingwen will also follow in Wei Lihuang's footsteps and fall into a tragic fate.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin province front on the 27th, the Japanese army in the Jin-Yu province border region issued a battle report at 3:00 p.m. on the 27th, stating that the Japanese army and nearby troops joined forces on the 23rd to encircle the main force of the 24th Army Group of the Chongqing forces near Linhong. They inflicted heavy damage on it on the 24th. The Japanese army pursued the defeated Chongqing troops to the mountainous area on the border of the Jing-Ji province, defeated them, and destroyed the Chongqing army's base. The Japanese army achieved considerable results in this operation. As of the evening of the 26th, the investigation results showed that about 3,000 Chongqing troops were killed and 7,000 were captured. A large number of weapons and ammunition were seized. Among the Chongqing troops captured or killed in battle, there were more than a dozen lieutenant generals, including the army commander, etc., which proves that the Chongqing army in that area has been completely on the verge of annihilation.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th - According to a telegram from the Jin province front, Lieutenant Imamura of the Goto unit of the Japanese army participated in the battle to capture Linqi, the base of the newly formed 5th Army of the Chongqing forces. According to a statement on the situation of the capture of Linhong and Sun Dianying's surrender, the gist is as follows: The headquarters of the newly formed 5th Army of the Chongqing forces was located in Linqi, and its division headquarters was located in Xizhang Village, south of Linhong. The road from Linhong to Xizhang Village was quite clean. The Japanese army's encirclement operation of Linhong began on the 22nd, so as to echo the southward advance of troops. At that time, a large number of Japanese aircraft also participated in the operation, bombing the Chongqing army's positions fiercely. Although the Chongqing army resisted stubbornly, it finally collapsed after being fiercely attacked by the Japanese army, and fled towards Luzhou. At that time, the southward advance of the Japanese army had cut off its retreat, and 20,000 Chongqing troops were surrounded by the Japanese army, becoming turtles in a jar. From the morning of the 23rd, the Japanese army launched an annihilation battle at the same time. After two hours of fierce fighting with the main force of the Chongqing army in Lijiazhai, southwest of Linhong, when the pursuit battle was being carried out, they saw military envoys such as Sun Dianying's chief of staff in the Chongqing army's positions, holding white flags and applying to surrender. At 2:55 p.m. on the 23rd, Sun Dianying surrendered to the Japanese army.

Central News Agency, Xuzhou, 27th - The Japanese army operating along the eastern section of the Longhai Railway attacked 3,000 troops of Li Xianzhou's 92nd Army of the Chongqing faction, which invaded northward, southeast of Dangshan on the evening of the 25th. Cooperating with the Japanese army that moved out from a certain direction, they launched a fierce annihilation battle, which continued fiercely until the night of the 26th, and achieved great results. The Japanese army's elite units have completely frustrated the attempt of Li Xianzhou's 92nd Army to move to Shandong Province in this campaign. The comprehensive war results obtained by the Japanese army from the evening of the 25th to the morning of the 27th are recorded as follows: 1,300 corpses of Chongqing troops were left behind, 230 people were captured, and the seized items included 2 mortars, 30 mortar shells, 3 heavy machine guns, 11 light machine guns, 11 grenade launchers, 247 rifles, 50 rounds of ammunition, and 27 pistols.

### Vice President Zhou's Speech in Beijing

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 27th - On the 19th of this month, Vice President Zhou's speech in Beijing was related to the future National Government's policy on local political adjustments. There have been many discrepancies in the telegrams that have been transmitted in recent days. The original manuscript has now been found and is disclosed below: "My previous decision to inspect the north was in the summer of the 29th year of the Republic, which was the time when the National Government returned to the capital, a new era in Chinese history. This time, I have come again at a time when China has declared war on Britain and the United States, a more magnificent period in Chinese history, so I am sincerely delighted. Since the Opium War, China has been exploited and oppressed by Britain and the United States for more than a hundred years. This time, declaring war on the old enemies Britain and the United States is to avenge a hundred years of hatred, wash away a hundred years of shame, and wash away a hundred years of humiliation. It is truly one of the most uplifting days for China. At the same time, thanks to our friendly country Japan for voluntarily abolishing extraterritoriality and returning concessions, the task of abolishing unequal treaties and seeking China's freedom and equality, as instructed by the Founding Father, can be completed. In addition to gratitude, we feel that the future is infinitely bright. Coming here and seeing the Blue Sky White Sun flag flying over the embassy area in Dongjiaomin Lane, the main base of Britain and the United States in China, I cannot help but feel encouraged. However, the remaining forces of Britain and the United States have not yet been eliminated, and the final victory has not yet been achieved. In the future, we must still make efforts and struggle. I believe that in order to complete the sacred mission we bear, we must be united externally and unified internally. The unity of the East Asian Axis countries must be as firm as iron and stone, and each must contribute all human and material resources to the war. Then the surrender of Britain and the United States can be expected, and the victory of the war can be anticipated. As for the country, no matter east, west, north, or south, all forces should be unified in the central government. The concentration of five forces makes it strong, while dispersion makes it weak. If we cooperate with Japan with dispersed forces, our strength will be weak, and the results will be small. If we cooperate with Japan with concentrated forces, our strength will be great, and the results will be significant. Therefore, in order to cooperate effectively with our friendly country Japan, and to make a strong contribution to the Greater East Asia War, China must gradually adjust its fragmented situation and form a truly unified situation before this goal can be achieved. Wise men in China and Japan, with foresight, must have the same feeling. Chairman Wang has never forgotten the food problem in North China, and the central government has never neglected it for a day. North China is the North China of the central government, and the central government is also the central government of North China. The people under the jurisdiction of the National Government, no matter where they are, should share weal and woe, and prosperity and adversity together. In the past, it was only because of lack of power that we were unable to provide more facilities for the welfare of the people in North China, and we feel deeply sorry. In the future, regarding the exchange of materials, the financing of transaction funds, and other issues, if the central government can reach them, it will do its best to provide relief for the people's livelihood in North China. I have not been to North China for three years. This trip is intended to exchange views with the North China authorities and the leaders of the friendly Japanese military and political circles in North China on issues such as stabilizing the people's livelihood in China and enhancing China's war-making power, so that China's responsibility in the Greater East Asia War can be completed, and China's people's livelihood can become increasingly stable. During this visit to Manchuria, I received a warm welcome from all levels of society in Manchuria, for which I am very grateful. Inspecting various places, I witnessed the rapid progress of its various industries, and at the same time expressed my deep respect for the hard work of its authorities. At the same time, I deeply felt the urgency of our country's industrial development."

### Henan Suffers from Drought and Flood, Disaster is Severe; Representatives Go to Beijing to Appeal for Relief; Ministry of Social Welfare Sends Personnel to Investigate and Provide Relief

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since Henan Province experienced the ravages of war, it has been followed by drought and flood disasters. To date, the disaster has expanded, and cries of suffering are heard everywhere. The province has specially dispatched representatives Ren Shouting and Wang Dexiu to come to Beijing to request relief. According to them, the Yellow River in Zhongmu County has backflowed into the Huai River.

Nanjing, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Since the Yellow River breached in the 29th year, the counties in eastern Henan have suffered from floods. Last year, locusts and drought caused disaster throughout the three provinces of Hebei, Shandong, and Henan. Vast areas were barren for miles, and the starving died on the roads. Since the beginning of this year, during the time between the harvest of old crops and the ripening of new crops, the food panic has become even more serious. The impact has also extended to major cities. It is often heard that people are dying of hunger every day. This is truly the greatest disaster situation in the last ten years. Various local governments in North China and charitable organizations in Peiping and Tianjin have jointly launched relief efforts. However, due to the lack of food, it is only a drop in the bucket and cannot be widely distributed. The Ministry of Social Welfare has received reports that the disaster situation in the area is dire. It has also carefully considered countermeasures, made overall plans, and contacted local authorities in North China and fellow provincial associations in Beijing from Hebei and Henan to launch extensive and universal relief efforts. In recent days, it has convened meetings with relevant parties to discuss and decide on relief methods. Furthermore, the ministry has received a joint telegram from seven gentry members of Shangqiu and Taikang counties in eastern Henan, including Tang Shiyuan, as representatives of the disaster victims, requesting relief. Additionally, Zhang Lanfeng, commander of the Provisional 1st Army of the Border Pacification Headquarters in the Jiangsu-Henan Border Area, has separately forwarded requests for relief to the ministry. These requests have been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval, and it is requested that 50,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Bank notes be allocated first for emergency relief.

### A Trial Ride on the Newly Opened Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway

The newly constructed Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway has finally opened to traffic amid the anticipation of millions. In mid-May of last year, the operation to open up the Zhejiang-Jiangxi line was launched, securing the eastern Zhejiang region. Various construction projects have achieved significant progress within this year.

The 175-kilometer newly constructed Zhejiang-Jiangxi Railway from Jinhua to the south bank of the Qiantang River has been completed. This reporter made a special trip to take a trial ride on its maiden voyage. The following is the trial ride report:

…At 6:00 AM, when the sky was not yet fully bright, a "Greater East Asia" train was parked at Jinhua Station, with Chinese and Japanese national flags waving. As the wheels rumbled, the train moved forward, and the cheers of the crowd were deafening. After the train started, looking out over the city of Jinhua, the traces of battle were clearly visible, with bullet holes and gun marks everywhere. Under the strict guard of the Japanese army, public order has been fully restored. This is currently a busy period for agricultural work, and smoke is swirling from the chimneys of every household. Farmers are diligently plowing the fields with water buffaloes. The fields, having been soaked by several heavy rains, are like natural fields. The dark red soil, green wheat, and white flowers are symbols foreshadowing a bountiful harvest. The rural scenery is endless, and the beautiful scenes are beyond description.

…With the sound of wheels whirring, the speed is extremely fast. A military officer in the car pointed to a small mountain on the left and said:

"The area around there was the scene of the fiercest battles." As we looked, the train moved on. The farmers in the fields saw the train coming and raised their hands, cheering "Banzai!" People in the car waved back in enthusiastic welcome.

…At the small stations along the way, flags were hung to welcome the train. The passengers boarding the train were very crowded. The sounds of vendors selling snacks, eggs, and watermelon seeds were noisy. Before long, the train arrived in Yiwu. This place used to belong to Kuaiji Commandery. It was first named Yiwu in the seventh year of the Wude era of the Tang Dynasty. During the Ming and Qing dynasties, it was under the jurisdiction of Jinhua Prefecture. Now it has a county government. The products include fluorite, coal, cattle, pigs, sheep, etc., and it is one of the main places of origin for Jinhua ham. Most of the Yiwu station has been completed. The side of the waiting hall is piled with fluorite, and the scenery is extremely beautiful. The scenery is pleasant along the way from Yiwu to Suxi, which can be described as "mountains and clear waters." Ancient cypress trees and green pines stand side by side with mountains and rivers, making the people on the Greater East Asia train exclaim at the wonders of nature. The train soon arrived at Suxi. The mountains and rivers are dangerous near here, and the route is winding and difficult to construct.

…From afar, you can already see the scenic area of Taohua Ridge near Zhuji. Soon after, we arrived in Zhuji. Many trains from Hangzhou were already parked here, waiting for the arrival of the Greater East Asia. Our train stopped, and the passengers on both sides greeted each other cordially through the windows. After a while, the Greater East Asia started moving forward again, and the passengers on both trains shouted "Banzai!" to say goodbye. Zhuji was formerly known as Ji Country. Later, because of the presence of the Zhu Mountains and the Ji River, it was renamed Zhuji. Famous local products include fluorite, tea, livestock, ceramics, and tung oil. Just outside Zhuji, you can see the famous Jianshan Mountain. Flat fields and discontinuous hills connect to each other. We also saw a wooden sign with the words "Dongshan" written on it at a small station. Further on, we saw a wooden bridge over a small river with the words "Greater East Asia Bridge" written on it. These words were all written by the Japanese soldiers guarding the railway line. Not far past Jianshan Mountain is Meichi. After a while, we arrived at Meichi, which is the terminus of the first phase of the project. Most of the construction has been completed, and the waiting room and office are very tidy.

…At noon, we arrived at Xiaoshan. Xiaoshan was called Xiling of the Yue Kingdom during the Spring and Autumn period. During the Han Dynasty, it was renamed Yuji County. During the Song, Yuan, and Ming dynasties, it belonged to Shaoxing Prefecture. There are long-distance buses from Xiaoshan to Shaoxing to provide transportation. It is said that the highway will soon be extended directly to Ningbo, which will surely promote the exchange of goods in the eastern Zhejiang region. Xiaoshan also produces a lot of products, including cotton, paper, rice, raw silk, tung oil, and livestock. At 3:30 PM, we arrived at the riverbank on the south bank of the Qiantang River. The maiden voyage across eastern Zhejiang in ten hours was completed. It is hoped that this railway line will soon be completed as a major trunk line of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The black smoke of the Greater East Asia train flies across the north and south, which is what we eagerly hope for. This reporter got off the train at the Jiangbian Railway Station, ending the mission of this trip and gaining the reward of witnessing great construction.

### Allied Forces Attack in Three Routes; Tank Battle Unfolds in the Breakthrough; Axis Forces Shorten Lines for More Advantageous Defense; German Counter-Attack on the Pont du Fahs Front Brings Great Victory

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Last night, the German News Agency reported: German Lieutenant General Arnim has shortened his lines in several locations in order to more effectively contain the attempts of the British and American forces to advance towards Tunis and Bizerte. German military personnel are confident about the future development of the Tunisian campaign. Although American General Anderson has joined the battle with a powerful tank fleet, he has made no progress due to the strong resistance of the Axis forces. On Sunday, the Axis forces destroyed a total of 73 British and American tanks. At the same time, the German and Italian air forces also bombed and destroyed 21 British and American trucks in concentrated attacks. Since October 1, 1942, the anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 3,117 tanks on the North African battlefield.

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) Although the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are small in number, they continue to resist bravely and maintain key positions. The intensity of the fighting in Mejez el Bab and Pont du Fahs on the western front is unprecedented since the start of the Tunisian campaign. According to reports from Algiers, the resistance of the Axis forces has increased. The main force of the British First Army in Mejez el Bab and Pont du Fahs, relying on its large troop strength, has repeatedly attacked the Axis positions. On the night of the 25th, the Axis forces carried out a strategic retreat southeast of Mejez el Bab, transferring to a new and more defensible position. The Axis forces in Bou Arada and Pont du Fahs have also abandoned their salient positions due to the joint attack of the British First Army and the rebel French forces, concentrating their forces in the main positions in that area to prevent the advance of the anti-Axis forces.

Berlin, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a military correspondent from the Havas News Agency, an unprecedented major battle is currently underway on the Tunisian front. The anti-Axis forces, with their superior manpower and material resources, are continuously dispatching troops for battle, regardless of the heavy losses, in a manner similar to the Soviet Union. The desperate attempts of the British army to break through have been met with the courageous resistance of the Axis forces. The fighting is now taking place on a shorter line. On Saturday and Sunday, the British First Army launched a fierce offensive in three routes near Mejez el Bab in the middle of the Tunisian front. The first route advanced towards Djebel Ang, the second route (the central force) advanced towards Tebourba, and the third route, the southern route, advanced towards Pont du Fahs. The troops advancing on the central route and the northern flank have been contained, but the southern route has continued to advance and has occupied the village of Koudiat. General Anderson seems to have decided to use all his preparations, especially the tanks, in the southern operation, hoping to capture Pont du Fahs or even Chaghouan at any cost. This move by the enemy threatens the rear of the Axis forces' southern flank, so the German army has launched a large-scale counter-offensive with tank units. The first wave of attacks has been repulsed to the west and northwest of Pont du Fahs, and there was still fierce tank warfare there on the morning of Monday. The British army has continued to put pressure on the Tebourba area, attempting to break through the Axis positions and rush towards Chaghouan, but has not yet succeeded. The British First Army on the left flank south of Cap Serrat in the coastal area, with the help of the American army, has made some progress, but it is strategically insignificant. The rebel French forces and a part of the American army are fighting on Anderson's right flank, but have achieved nothing. The British army's local attacks in the mountainous areas, attempting to penetrate the mountains, have also failed. There have been no major military changes in the southern Tunisian campaign. Anderson has failed to capture the small port of Feshi on the coast. It is expected that the British Eighth Army will resume its offensive in the near future.

### Soviet Offensive West of Rostov Fails

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency dispatch) The Soviet command is extremely anxious as the German summer offensive approaches. On the 26th, on the Mius front west of Rostov, they suddenly launched a large-scale offensive. After fierce artillery bombardment, they attempted to break through the German positions from the front with tank units as the vanguard. However, after being met with concentrated artillery fire from German field guns and anti-tank guns, they appeared to be overwhelmed and retreated. The Soviet forces south of Lake Ladoga and in the Leningrad area also launched small-scale offensives, but they were repelled by the German garrison. At the same time, the German air force's offensive has intensified. On the 25th, they shot down eight Soviet aircraft on the southern front and sixteen aircraft on other fronts in a single day, and inflicted great damage on the Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk and Kuban areas.

### "The Future of the Leap Forward in Policy Towards China" - Japanese Minister Tajiri Publishes Article in Japanese Newspaper

Tokyo, 26th (Central News Agency dispatch) Today's Tokyo Shimbun published an article by Japanese Minister to China, Tajiri Aiyi, entitled "The Future of the Leap Forward in Policy Towards China," explaining the vibrant trends in politics, economy, and culture of the new China with the ideals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. It strongly argues for thoroughly eliminating Anglo-American national views and Anglo-American thought. At the same time, it points out that establishing a new ideology based on the standpoint of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is an urgent task. The arguments are concise and worthy of attention. The main points are summarized as follows: "Japan's leap forward in its policy towards China is expressed in three aspects: politics, economy, and culture. However, in fact, this policy towards China is by no means a new concept. It has been fully researched and discussed and is already well known to the public. Therefore, rather than calling it a new policy, it is better to say that Japan's policy towards China has entered the practical stage, or that the practice of the policy towards China has leaped forward. The force that prevents Japan from practicing its policy towards China is Anglo-American power. Therefore, Japan can only implement its policy towards China after completely crushing Anglo-American power. From China's standpoint, China can only complete its revolution after removing the greatest obstacle since the Xinhai Revolution, Anglo-American power. At the same time, only when the removal of this obstacle and the completion of the Chinese revolution coincide can Japan begin to practice its policies in good faith, and China can reciprocate Japan's policies and build a new China with the ideals of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. As mentioned above, the so-called new policy is in fact the vigorously promoted Sino-Japanese relations today, or China's participation in the war, which coincides with the period when Japan is implementing its policy towards China. Therefore, this fundamental significance is often misunderstood by both China and Japan. This is a major issue that people in both countries should recognize anew. As for the policies that Japan is implementing in the political sphere, such as the return of concessions and embassy districts, and the transfer of enemy assets of Anglo-American countries to Chinese management, problems like these and the abolition of extraterritoriality will gradually be implemented. All of the above gives the National Government and the entire Chinese nation a great sense of goodwill and rekindles the spirit and courage of the Xinhai Revolution. This is a fact that we cannot deny. As for economic problems, they are not as simple as politics, and economic problems have a characteristic of immobility. Moreover, because economic problems require considerable equipment, they are not easy to become apparent. However, Japan's true intentions and China's enthusiasm have produced a result, which is the center for the construction and economic revival of the new China. The establishment of the National Commercial Control Association in Shanghai in early March, along with the relaxation of restrictions on the movement of materials, makes the exchange of materials between Shanghai and other places smoother. In the past, Japan carried out various measures to maintain military prices. From now on, the Chinese side will distribute materials themselves in order to promote the purchase of materials. Therefore, the three, purchase, distribution, and a certain degree of processing and manufacturing in Shanghai, are related, and only then can the economic exchange in central China begin to move again. Therefore, if this can be successful, it will make a great contribution to maintaining the price of the Central Reserve Bank notes. At the same time, the goals of the Control Association are progressing in all aspects. On the other hand, it can be seen that the establishment of the Control Association also has a major significance in politics, that is, people in the Shanghai economic community are working together for the revival of the economy and Sino-Japanese cooperation. Moreover, the directors and supervisors of the Control Association are all leading figures in the Shanghai economic community. The Control Association not only receives the guidance of the National Government but also the assistance of Japan from the sidelines. Therefore, this new organization is highly regarded by the general public. At the same time, the economic revival of central China and the strengthening of the National Government have also gained great strength. Some may think that this view seems a bit optimistic, but the economy of Shanghai and central China behind Shanghai can be said to have begun to be rebuilt and strongly promoted. From now on, it still depends on the efforts of people in the Chinese economic community, the proper guidance of the National Government, and the effective assistance of Japan to continue to promote and work harder. When this effort achieves results, and when the anti-effort continues to quickly achieve results, it will be the time when Shanghai's economic position is established throughout China. At the same time, it will not only fundamentally solve the economic problems of central China and northern China, but also have a great impact on the non-peace zone. Therefore, it is too early to be optimistic about this, but it is a fact that economic construction has already begun. As for the cultural aspect, the most noteworthy is the publishing industry in Shanghai, which is also in the process of recovery. Moreover, because the publishing industry in Shanghai accounts for 90% of the entire China, it has considerable power. The state of withering and decline after the Sino-Japanese Incident has now gradually disappeared. This is the beginning of a new emerging joint publishing business. Its goal is to improve Chinese culture and communicate with Japan, and the revival of the Chinese publishing industry in a good sense is based on cultural activities and ideological movements centered on Shanghai. Shanghai has already developed as described above, and the rise of events can also be said to be the rise of China and the strengthening of the power of the National Government. It is also the place where the Sino-Japanese problem is solved, and its future is quite optimistic. However, there is still a problem that needs to be considered carefully, that is, when Japan's new policy towards China changes the future Sino-Japanese relations, we should consider the Anglo-American power again, because although the military, political, and economic power of Anglo-American has been driven out of China and Greater East Asia today, can erroneous Anglo-American concepts be eliminated in thought? When Japanese and Chinese people consider Sino-Japanese relations, they often feel the Anglo-American national view and the Anglo-American international concept, or they may accept the Anglo-American national concept without criticism. Is it not a lack of full review of Sino-Japanese relations? I think it is not a simple problem that can be easily reached, but it is a problem that the Japanese and Chinese governments and the public should seriously study and reach a common conclusion. Therefore, I would like to point out here that the clarification of thoughts and the acquisition of new ideas are extremely necessary and urgent.

### On U.S.-Finland Relations, Hull Makes No Explicit Statement; U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Finland Remains in Position

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. Secretary of State Hull stated yesterday that Washington's attitude towards Finland remains the same as previously declared. Regarding U.S. attempts to mediate peace between Finland and the Allied nations, there is nothing to add. Mr. Hull made this statement in response to inquiries from the press regarding the situation after the partial departure of embassy personnel stationed in Finland.

Stockholm, Sweden, 27th (Central News Agency): U.S. Chargé d'Affaires in Finland, Mr. McClintock, is still in his post, but his wife arrived here yesterday, returning home with the majority of the embassy staff who left Finland earlier last week. Mr. McClintock spoke on the phone with a United Press correspondent stationed in Stockholm on Sunday evening, saying that he remains in his post but declined to comment on the future development of U.S.-Finland relations. It is noted that the U.S. Minister to Finland, Mr. Gunther, has not returned to his post after returning to his country several months ago.

### Grew Issues Another Warning to the Nation

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): Former U.S. Ambassador to Japan, Mr. Grew, delivered a speech at Schenectady yesterday, again warning of the seriousness of the Pacific war situation. He stated that if the Japanese are allowed to retain and develop the resources they have acquired in the Pacific, the attempt to conquer the American mainland will only be a matter of time. Our country's cities and homes are under the terrible threat of Japan's latent military power, which could make Japan the most potentially powerful country in the world.

### Wallace Returns Home After Traveling in South America

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency): According to news received here, U.S. Vice President Wallace returned to Washington yesterday after a five-week trip to South America. It is not yet known when he will report the results of this trip to President Roosevelt. Wallace acknowledged that the U.S. shipping situation may worsen in the coming months and said that the business, labor, and agricultural leaders he visited in various countries are eager to have more of the goods they lack shipped to them.

### Whale Caught in the Mediterranean

Madrid, 27th (Central News Agency): Spanish fishermen caught a whale weighing 2,600 kilograms, with a liver weighing 300 kilograms, in the Palma de Mallorca area. It is rare for whales to be caught in the Mediterranean, and the fish is now on public display.

### Review of Soviet War Capacity: Military Production Faces a Critical Juncture; Human Resources Have Reached Saturation

(Special Dispatch from Toyono, Stockholm, Sweden, 17th) The Axis powers' diplomatic offensive in Europe, centered on the meetings between the leaders of Germany and Italy, as well as Germany, Hungary, Germany, France, and Germany, Romania, etc., as the first step in the practical implementation of the so-called new system of total European war, has attracted great attention. Although this new system of total war includes many broad military, political, and economic issues on both the offensive and defensive fronts, its general trend remains, as Hitler said, a new plan to annihilate the Soviet Union that "determines the fate of Europe." So, when will this great offensive to annihilate the Soviet Union begin? Outsiders do not know, but Hitler naturally has a plan in mind. As for the Soviet Union, how will it respond to this attack, having already exhausted most of its military strength in the great counter-offensive this winter, and how can it complete the "war to defend the motherland"? What is the truth about its war capacity in terms of both material and spirit? What is its strategy? Regarding these questions, foreigners residing in Moscow have almost no way of knowing, and rumors abound. Based on the various information obtained locally, I will attempt to conduct a detailed review as follows:

The Dominance of the War Situation

Let us first predict the dominance in the final decisive battle between Germany and the Soviet Union, that is, which side will make the first move. There are now two completely opposite views:

(1) Disregarding the significant losses of the winter counter-offensive, the Soviet Union will use its last strength to launch an offensive before the German army is fully prepared, to secure a favorable position and allow the long-delayed opening of the second front by Britain and the United States to be realized as soon as possible.

(2) The Soviet army is already on the verge of complete collapse, even before the German army begins its future decisive attack. The actual strength of the Soviet army has recently been extremely depleted. The divisions on the front lines are not only inadequately trained but also suffer from a shortage of personnel. Some divisions even have only 1,500 soldiers per division.

It is difficult to judge which of the above two opposing views is correct. At least both views tend to be extreme.

The Red Army's Current Strength

The conclusion of these two views both leads to the question of the truth about the Red Army's current strength. Let us now look at a more concrete view on this issue. The editorial of the Pravda newspaper on March 11 stated:

"The Soviet army does not need to have any apprehensive preparations for the expected German attacks. Do not forget that the Soviet Union has now deployed sufficient troops to prepare for a head-on blow."

This editorial in Pravda did not involve any specific figures. I will now introduce the views of well-informed sources who have observed the Red Army's strength concretely from a relatively general standpoint as follows:

"The Red Army has six million well-equipped soldiers on the Eastern Front and more than 500,000 in Siberia. In addition, the Red Army is also planning to retain one-third of its pre-war strength (said to be 175 divisions). Stalin spared this force from use during both the Battle of Moscow in 1941 and the Battle of Stalingrad in 1942, to prepare for the future of the war situation. From this point of view, there is almost no major difference in terms of troop strength compared to last spring. However, the deep-seated weaknesses lurking within the Soviet Union cannot be ignored. Last spring, the Soviet Union had one-third of its troop strength to spare, but now there is no surplus at all. If it is now necessary to expand the scope of conscription, it will weaken the minimum level of military production and agricultural labor, so it is impossible. Even if the Soviet Union's human resources are vast, they have already reached the point of saturation. If it suffers significant damage again this summer, it will be impossible to recover. Moreover, compared to last spring, the quality of the current soldiers has declined alarmingly. This is an ironclad fact. Since the beginning of the war, the Red Army has continuously used non-combatants, both young and old, male and female, from the battle zones directly in military affairs? Roughly speaking, the proportion of these non-combatants within the army has increased by more than 25% this summer compared to 1941. One-tenth of the Red Army's total strength must rely on the "combat power" of these "non-combatants." The decline in their quality is accelerating, and the kind of strength mentioned by Pravda is ultimately unreliable."

Crude American Products

A recently published London weekly, The Economist, stated:

"The Soviet Union's industrial productivity decreased by more than 40% compared to pre-war levels at the end of 1941. Due to the planned migration and concentration of factory equipment in the Volga, Ural, and Siberian regions, it had recovered to more than 80% of the 1939 level by the end of last year."

This is naturally a bit exaggerated. According to the official statement of the Soviet government:

"The production of aircraft and military supplies in the fourth quarter of 1942 broke pre-war records."

Whether the productivity of the Soviet Union's production centers in the Ural and Volga regions has been fully utilized is a major question. The loss of the abundant resources of Ukraine, such as iron and coal, and the reduction of accumulated raw materials, means that even if the Ural and Siberian regions desperately increase production, they will ultimately not be able to compensate for the losses, at least at the current stage. Let us examine the production status of the Ural and western Siberia. In 1942, the iron ore production in the Ural region was twice that of 1938, amounting to 14 million tons. Steel production increased by 40%. The coal production of Kuznetsk and Karaganda in 1942 was approximately 70 million tons. (The annual coal production of the Ruhr region in Germany reaches 200 million tons.) These figures indicate that the Soviet Union's production increase is indeed significant. This is naturally due to the large-scale development after the loss of western resources. Specifically speaking, the Soviet Union has focused on this area as the main production base for weapons and ammunition since the beginning of the war. For example, the weapon production in the Ural region in 1942 was stated to be three times that of pre-war levels. However, the increase in iron and other raw materials ultimately cannot keep up with this rapid increase in weapon production. Due to the decline in quality, or the failure to achieve certain goals, a deep imbalance has occurred within the production structure.

To alleviate this difficult situation, Britain, the United States, and especially the United States, have supplied the Soviet Union with 5,000 aircraft, 10,000 cannons, and other large quantities of weapons since the outbreak of the war. However, these American-made weapons are even cruder than those made by the Soviet Union itself, and their cold resistance is even worse. In fact, the Soviet army has not yet used them to this day, only creating the opposite phenomenon of wasting domestic transportation capacity.

Regarding the Soviet Union's industrial power, judging from these fragmented reports, the Soviet Union has encountered major difficulties in military production. The crippled state of consumption and production constitutes a major loophole in the Soviet military.

Food Problem

After the Soviet Union lost the agricultural treasure trove of Ukraine, agriculture also encountered a major crisis. In order to avoid the occurrence of famine, the Moscow government has strived to expand farmland in eastern Russia, opening up 5 million acres in 1942. However, during this period, 30 million acres of farmland have been lost in the North Caucasus. During the winter offensive, the Soviet Union recovered part of the Donets Basin and the Kuban region, but the harvest in 1943 will still not be as good as a bumper year, because the crops in this area are mainly winter wheat and cannot be immediately changed to spring wheat. The British economic weekly The Economist also pointed out that the food problem is a major weakness of the Soviet Union at present. From March 1941 to the present, the United States has delivered 3 million tons of food to the Soviet Union in these two years, but the Soviet Union still considers it a drop in the bucket and of no help. Wartime food shortages are a common phenomenon throughout the world. How the Soviet Union will overcome the current predicament is a major problem.

German and Soviet Strategies

Given the many contradictions and weaknesses of the Soviet Union's wartime situation, what strategy will it adopt in the expected decisive battle? There have already been many observations on this. The view of neutral military intelligence is that the Soviet Union will still place its main defensive force in the Caucasus under the initiative of the German offensive, where it will have resolute resistance. At the same time, it will actively launch local offensives centered on the southern front or expand its offensives to the central front, attempting to disperse the German offensive forces in order to delay the war until winter and gain a favorable position. However, will Germany repeat the mistakes of 1941 and 1942 and allow the Red Army to follow its old tricks? If Hitler launches a major offensive this time, he must have already seen through the Red Army's General Winter tactics. Therefore, the outcome of the issue is how far the Red Army's field main force will be destroyed against a German major offensive that is several times larger than before. If the Soviet Union's military strength is truly as described above, then a full-scale crisis for the Soviet Union is inevitable. The only way to save the Soviet Union from this final crisis is for Britain and the United States to launch a second front in Europe. President Hitler's future major offensive against the Soviet Union, of course, takes the completion of the "Fortress Europe" to prevent the opening of the second front as an absolute prerequisite. It is believed that Germany must have a full grasp of this point before starting a major attack.

Latent Factors of Resistance

However, war, especially a major decisive battle like the one between Germany and the Soviet Union, cannot be fully understood in its final outcome by merely observing numbers and making superficial observations. There are still latent motives. The Soviet Union's stubborn resistance at the end of the three years is clear proof of this. The Soviet Union has:

(1) Latent industrial productivity;

(2) National will to fight in the defense war.

Neutral Soviet experts especially emphasize these material and spiritual motives. The current significant predicament of the Soviet military has lowered the level of exerting the power of mutual assistance in motive.

In this view, it is undeniable that the Soviet Union's military strength is facing a full-scale crisis this summer, at least. One of the keys to transforming world history can be seen in the future flames of war on the Eastern Front. (Xiang: Translated from the April 19th Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

### Public Works Department Announces 34th Period Household Grain Allocation: One and a Half Sheng of White Rice or Brown Rice, Half Sheng of Broken Rice, Half Jin of Flour

The Public Works Department recently issued a notice stating: Rice and Flour Certificate No. 33 will be valid until the 29th of this month and will expire thereafter. From May 2nd to 9th, rice shops and the rice sales outlets of the Public Works Department will only sell rice and flour based on Rice and Flour Certificate No. 34. At that time, rice shops with registration numbers noted on the certificate will exchange each rice certificate for one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and half a sheng of broken rice at a price of six yuan. Furthermore, each flour certificate will be exchanged for half a jin of Grade 2 flour at a price of one yuan and two jiao. The rice shops and the rice sales outlets of the Public Works Department will cease sales on May 1st and 10th.

### Investigation of Warehouses and Godowns Completed; Second Step of Punitive Measures to be Implemented After Reviewing Reports

The investigation of warehouses and godowns in this port, which began last week, has been completely completed as of yesterday. The authorities are currently carefully reviewing all reports in order to implement the second step of measures.

Unlawful Profiteering Will Not Be Tolerated

It is learned that the second step in the authorities' investigation of warehouses is to punish or interrogate those suspected of hoarding. The authorities have investigated the quantity, items, sources, and various inside stories of the goods stored in warehouses by these individuals. Once the authorities have completed consultations, they will take severe measures and will not tolerate unlawful profiteering.

Evasion of Inspection Has Been Noted

Hereafter, legitimate merchants in this port must store goods in accordance with the warehouse regulations promulgated by the authorities a few days ago and must submit detailed reports of all details for the authorities to check at any time. Those who violate or fail to comply will be severely punished. The authorities have also paid close attention to those shops and companies that hoard goods in hidden places in an attempt to evade inspection.

Deadline for Reporting Warehouse Inventory

The Public Works Department previously issued Bulletin No. 6326 on the 16th of this month regarding the reporting of inventory by public warehouses, ordering all warehouses to submit detailed lists of all goods stored as of the 20th of this month to the Public Works Department Office No. 624 by the 30th of this month. It is learned that when submitting the lists, warehouse companies should also attach a list indicating the various goods that were moved in or out of each warehouse between March 15th and April 20th, as well as the dates of transfer.

### The System of Distributing Oil Based on Population Should Be Thoroughly Implemented Soon

It is learned that the Shanghai Food Oil Trade Wholesale Association, which handles the procurement, transportation, and distribution of edible oil in this city, is now, in accordance with the directives of the military distribution organization, seeking to dredge the sources of edible oil from North China to supplement the shortage in the Central China region. In addition, for the sake of people's livelihood, the system of distributing oil based on population in this city will be thoroughly implemented. The edible oil panic in this city has lasted for many months without being resolved. Those in charge should make practical remedies. Empty talk is of no help. Now that the association intends to distribute oil based on population, it should be realized as soon as possible to meet the public's aspirations.

### Carrying More Than Two Dou of Rice is Not Allowed on Trams

Since the lifting of the ban on transporting rice, the number of villagers who make a living by selling rice has increased daily. These people often enter the tram in groups after selling rice in the suburbs and carrying it into the concessions, in order to sell it in the central district of the concessions. However, as a result, the tram cars are often occupied by these people, and ordinary passengers are unable to board the tram. It is now heard that the relevant authorities issued a notice yesterday prohibiting those carrying more than two dou of rice from taking the tram to avoid the tram from being unable to meet demand. At the same time, it is also learned that those carrying other bulky items will also be prohibited from boarding the tram.

### 330,000 People in the Urban Area Have Been Vaccinated Against Epidemics

Since the Municipal Health Bureau has been in charge of epidemic prevention in this city, it has been fully launched to universally vaccinate citizens. In previous years, all vaccination staff during the epidemic prevention period were handled by municipal treatment institutions, and medical staff were mostly part-time, which inevitably led to the regret of neglecting one thing or another. In view of this, the Municipal Health Bureau submitted a request to establish an epidemic prevention vaccination team before the start of epidemic prevention this year, in order to be meticulous and have a dedicated responsibility, and advertised to recruit more than 200 doctors and nurses. The entire city was divided into five general teams and 47 sub-teams, distributed throughout the urban area, to universally and freely vaccinate citizens. Since it started on April 16, in less than a week, the number of people vaccinated, according to reports from the general teams, totaled more than 260,000.

### In Order to Eliminate Malpractices of Cigarette Merchants, Implement a New System of Supervised Door-to-Door Sales, Faithfully Implement Cigarette Price Limits, and Resolutely Investigate Hoarding and Refusal to Sell

After the Central China Tobacco Allocation Association implemented unified cigarette allocation, the third batch of goods has already begun to be processed.

### The Business Hours of Pawnshops in the Urban Area are Set to End at 7:00 PM Every Day

The Municipal Police Bureau believes that there are many pawnshops in the urban area, and the bright lights at night attract business and hinder the appearance of the city.

### Spokesman of the Japanese Embassy Hirota Talks About British and American Diplomatic Conspiracies

At a regular meeting with foreign journalists yesterday, Hiroichi Hirota, spokesman for the Japanese Embassy, stated: We learned from the news from London yesterday morning that the Soviet Union has severed diplomatic relations with the Polish government in exile. And recently the news that most of the staff and families of the US Embassy in Helsinki have gone to the capital of Sweden. The sinister diplomatic policy of the anti-Axis countries, which has been shielded by the Atlantic Charter and has sacrificed small European countries, has been fully exposed. Hirota said that the above news is enough to reflect the US government's policy of complying with Soviet demands to show appeasement. In this bad environment, Britain and the United States will inevitably comply with all the Soviet Union's demands in order to win it over to fight. The severance of diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Poland also reflects the Soviet Union's determination to complete its ambition to seize land from small countries on the borders of Europe. Hirota continued, the Atlantic Charter is nothing more than bait used by the anti-Axis countries to lure weak European nations. However, the day when Britain and the United States agree to the Soviet Union's demands to achieve this goal may be the day when the countries that initiated the Atlantic Charter violate the sacredness of the Charter. Therefore, it is only a matter of time before the Charter becomes waste paper. At the same time, the small European nations, who have always relied on the Charter, will realize the unreliability and hopelessness of the Charter at that time. In short, Britain and the United States are using the Charter to enrich themselves. Not to mention the small European countries, Chongqing and India will suffer the most cruel sacrifices. The truth is obvious, so there is no need for us to waste words.

The grand parade of elite units from the Public Concession Police Headquarters, including all district police stations and auxiliary organizations under the Police Affairs Department, was originally scheduled to be held at the racecourse at 2:00 PM on the 23rd. However, due to rain that day, it was temporarily postponed to yesterday. Unfortunately, the weather did not cooperate, with torrential rain the night before. Although yesterday was sunny, the racecourse ground remained extremely muddy, so the parade was reluctantly postponed again to 2:00 PM on May 5th at the original location.

### Bicycles Must Have Receipts to Obtain Licenses - Avoid Private Sales and Purchases - To Avoid Unnecessary Trouble

Since the implementation of the new bicycle registration regulations in the Public Concession, bicycle theft cases have been significantly reduced. According to reports from the Datong News Agency, the police are still allowing new bicycle owners to obtain licenses, but they must present a receipt from the bicycle shop and bring their bicycles to the police station for registration and stamping with a number. Bicycles found without licenses will be severely punished. The authorities also hope that residents will not privately sell or purchase bicycles, as resale often results in some people buying bicycles stolen by thieves and suffering innocently.

### The Science of Victory (3)

The reason why the Japanese army and navy achieved great victories in the Greater East Asia War was not only due to the bravery and loyalty of the soldiers, but also to the aircraft, tanks, artillery, and various excellent scientific weapons, as well as food, medicine, construction materials, and so on, supplied to the battlefield. The army awarded the Second Army Technical Merit Medal to the inventors of these victorious weapons. Here, we introduce the recipients of the awards and the main inventors: (Tao: Translated from the April 17th Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

Regarding the design of military rations: Army engineers Koyama Eiji, Hashimoto Fuichi, Suzuki Takeo, and collaborators:

A hungry person cannot fight, so the important relationship between war and food cannot be ignored. At the same time, Japan's operational guidelines are not passive defense, but active offense and advance. Far from the supply lines, on isolated islands in the ocean, and in sparsely populated high mountains and ridges, the Imperial Army relies solely on portable rations to sustain itself for many days. Therefore, it is necessary to quickly and massively produce portable, highly nutritious, and delicious powdered pastes and powdered soy sauces, so as to solve and guarantee the "food" problem for the army. Food is also a weapon.

The engineers Koyama, Hashimoto, and Suzuki of the Foodstuffs General Factory collaborated and received assistance from others to invent poison water detectors, powdered soy sauce manufacturing equipment, battlefield soy sauce making methods, and rapid soy sauce making methods using damaged rice. They completed the design of the necessary military rations specific to the Japanese. Currently, these methods are actively used in both inland supply factories and battlefield supply factories, making a great contribution to improving combat effectiveness. The Japanese military soy sauce used as soy sauce "essence" after the Sino-Japanese War was not suitable for long-term storage or mass production, so the three engineers bought some German goods in 1930, and after continuous research and improvement, finally invented an excellent grain-based device. At that time, soy sauce brewing still required extensive equipment and sufficient time, and the manufacturing method was very complicated, making it unsuitable for use on the battlefield. However, future wars must be self-sufficient on the spot. After painstaking efforts to utilize local materials and simple manufacturing methods, they finally succeeded after tireless research. When they cheered for success, they actually produced soy sauce-like medicine oil. After much effort, they overcame all difficulties and completed a clever wartime manufacturing method using battlefield cooking utensils and local materials. This solved the difficult problem of self-sufficiency of food in the Greater East Asia War era. Recently, in Myanmar, using this method, they made soy sauce in less than seventeen days that was even better than the soy sauce sold on the domestic market. The soldiers did not know that it was locally produced, and worked hard to eat more in preparation for tomorrow's war. At the same time, the water absolutely necessary for on-site brewing also needed to be checked, so a poison water detector was invented. This made a great contribution to on-site self-sufficiency.

### Sports - Volleyball League Opens - Soviet Team Wins Against White Team - Women's Team Blue Wins Against West Qinghong

In the final set, the Blue Team won again 21 to 13. Overall, the Blue Team defeated West Qinghong two to one. The final match was between the White Team and the Soviet Team, which was very tense. In the first set, the White Team won 21 to 18. Unexpectedly, the Soviet team suddenly became active and won the next two sets 21 to 17 and 21 to 15, turning defeat into victory. As a result, the Soviet team won two to one against the White team.

Yesterday's newspaper was published at 7:10 PM.

### Economic World - Commentary - The Key to Stabilizing Prices

Setting official prices for goods is certainly an important task in stabilizing prices. However, it must be based on scientific methods, be fair and impartial, to gain cooperation from all parties and achieve satisfactory results. Otherwise, official prices are official prices, and the black market is the black market, often in name only, leading to a rampant black market situation. The worst phenomenon in Shanghai today is that items subject to price controls are often difficult to buy. Stores clearly have these items but refuse to sell them, claiming they are out of stock. It can be said that the stricter the price controls, the scarcer the items become. This not only affects the lives of citizens, causing consumers great pain, but also creates great difficulties for producers, which does not seem to be a way to encourage hard work in production. Therefore, many manufacturers in Shanghai claim that they cannot start work due to a shortage of raw materials, but there are also some cunning manufacturers who clearly have raw materials but are unwilling to start work. Because after the price of raw materials has skyrocketed, even if they start work, it is not as profitable as stockpiling or selling raw materials, so why should factory operators seek trouble for themselves? Therefore, in the future, if the authorities set price controls on goods, they should base them on the factory's cost accounting and all expenses. They should not raise them excessively, nor should they lower them excessively. This is the key to stabilizing prices, and it seems worthy of the authorities' research and discussion.

### Fully Promote Financial Exchange in the Co-Prosperity Sphere - Vice President of the Bank of Japan Arrives in Shanghai - Speaks to Japanese Reporters Afterwards

Mr. Shibusawa Keizo, Vice President of the Bank of Japan, recently arrived in Shanghai by plane from Japan to inspect the economic situation in China after the National Government joined the war. At 5:30 PM on the 26th, he met with Japanese reporters and gave a speech. He will stay in China for one month and is scheduled to go to Nanjing at the beginning of next month, and then return to Japan via Bengbu, Beijing, and Tianjin. The following is his speech:

This is my first time inspecting China. The purpose of my visit is to examine the actual situation in Central and Northern China and exchange opinions with those in charge of Sino-Japanese relations. Japan has great expectations for China. As for the economic aspect, the Bank of Japan is willing to make its best efforts to assist the development of the Central Reserve Bank notes.

Economic cooperation between China and Japan has also made significant progress in terms of capital. For example, the loan issue with the Yokohama Specie Bank is proof of capital cooperation. In the future, the exchange of goods within the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is expected to be promoted. At the same time, there is also the issue of foreign exchange. We should promote the financial exchange policy of the Co-Prosperity Sphere with a new ideal.

The Central Reserve Bank and the Joint Reserve Bank have extremely important tasks. Japan's wartime economic system is gradually being prepared, and the production increase and development plans for the five major core industries are progressing in the same way as the concentrated use of funds. All departments have achieved better-than-expected results. (April 27th, Continental New News)

### Lao Zha Criminal Special High Division Conducts Industry Surveys - And Convenes Rotating Discussion Meetings

Okazaki, the director of the Criminal Special High Division of the Lao Zha District Police Station in the Public Concession, is conducting basic surveys, convening discussion meetings with the heads of various shops, explaining the meaning of the basic surveys, and giving the police officers the opportunity to get to know the heads of the shops in order to build relationships with various businesses in the concession and investigate the situation of various industries. Yesterday (the 27th) was the fifth meeting, held at 9:30 AM at the Great Shanghai Theater. Director Okazaki, Deputy Director Komura, Chinese Inspector Liu Xiangzhai, and representatives from various industries, including the printing industry, lithography industry, soda and beer industry, photography industry, bookstore industry, gift industry, mahjong industry, newspaper industry, engraving industry, dried longan industry, tea industry, magazine industry, southern loan industry, and pickle industry, attended, totaling several hundred people. First, Liu Xiangzhai introduced everyone to each other, and then Director Okazaki reported on the meaning of conducting basic surveys, which is to strengthen the relationship between the police and the people, help each other, maintain local peace, and ensure social order. Then, Lu Weida reported on three points of the basic survey method. Other industries will continue to be convened in rotation today (the 28th) at the Great Shanghai Theater, starting at 9:30 AM.

### Shanghai District Income Tax - Collection Situation

Since the Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance adjusted the various types of income tax within the scope of the urban area, the collection has been very smooth. The first type of business profit income tax and the third type of various interest income tax for last year (1942) started on the first of last month. Up to recently, it has been reported that those who have declared and paid taxes have reached more than 8.6 million yuan.

Also, the bureau has recently begun collecting the second type of salary and remuneration income tax. All self-employed persons and others engaged in various industries with offices should declare their salary and remuneration income for the previous year (1942) in accordance with the provisions of the Income Tax Regulations. It is reported that the bureau has issued notices, setting a deadline for declaration, in order to assess the tax amount.

### The Deadline for the Fourth Quarter Has Arrived - Banks Handle Credit Loans

In order to carefully handle credit loans for the fourth quarter and avoid fueling speculation and hoarding, the banks of the silver industry decided to handle them in accordance with the new methods for restricting loans passed by the two industry associations. Although there are no accurate statistics on long-term credit loans due in the fourth quarter, it is estimated that they amount to at least 50 million yuan. Those that do not comply with the laws and new methods for restricting loans will be notified to be recovered before the end of the fourth quarter. However, old accounts with reputable companies and firms will be allowed to process loans. In the future, new loans will be limited to companies and firms in various industries engaged in production, and must have a reliable guarantor and a loan agreement to ensure that the principal and interest are fully repaid upon maturity. Because the deadline for the fourth quarter has arrived, various industries and banks are very busy negotiating credit loans. Because the banks are particularly strict about the use of the loans applied for and are implementing austerity measures, the number of new loans completed is small. The longest term for new soft loans in this period is six months, due at the end of October. Although the overall financial situation in the fourth quarter remains stable, the silver market is particularly tight due to the fourth-quarter tightening of loans.

### Communications Bank and Others Plan - To Provide Rural Loans

In order to cooperate with the government to promote the implementation of the agricultural production increase plan, the Communications Bank and others have decided to organize a "Rural Loan Banking Group" with the Communications Bank as the core to provide low-interest rural loans. These loans are limited to farmers borrowing for the purchase of agricultural tools, fertilizers, seeds, and other purposes. The Communications Bank's survey of rural economy has come to an end, and it is expected to begin disbursing loans at the beginning of next month (May). The bank is working with cooperatives in various cleanup areas during the disbursement of loans, and detailed plans are being drafted.

### Reader Forum - The New Stage of Shanghai's Industry and Commerce and Its Current Priorities

— Yiren

The establishment of the National General Chamber of Commerce has undoubtedly been aimed at assisting the National Government in implementing wartime economic policies. With the close cooperation between Chinese and Japanese industry and commerce on an equal and mutually beneficial basis, the goal is to first make the exchange of materials more smooth, in order to control prices, increase production, and stabilize people's livelihoods.

Therefore, the current stage is said to be a new stage of industry and commerce for the enemy. This stage is characterized by the establishment of the National Government's wartime economic policies after it joined the war, and the implementation of autonomous commercial controls.

In this new stage, Shanghai's industry and commerce are facing an urgent and important mission, which is the mission of "absorbing idle capital and engaging in increased production."

The soaring prices have already caused ordinary people to suffer from unbearable burdens. The current situation of "everything is rising, and every market is black" has made it impossible for people to live, and has further caused people to lose trust in the national currency, which is a major obstacle and impediment to the National Government's implementation of wartime economic policies. Therefore, actively and decisively suppressing prices and stabilizing people's livelihoods is the most basic and paramount task at present. As for the methods, they are nothing more than "stabilizing currency value," "increasing production," and "suppressing hoarding." Since the Japanese government has repeatedly stated its determination not to change the ratio between military tickets and reserve notes, and the promulgation of the Provisional Regulations for the Control of Wartime Material Movement, it shows that everything has already been objectively equipped with excellent conditions, and the main problem lies in subjective efforts.

There are currently two subjective drawbacks that must be corrected: first, there is an excess of purchasing power on the part of a part of the population, and a lack of purchasing power on the part of a part of the population. This part of the excess purchasing power is being used to hoard industrial raw materials and industrial products, causing prices to rise without principle. Second, the recession in Shanghai's industrial sector and the extreme contraction of production have caused the supply of industrial products to fall short of demand, which is an important factor in the soaring prices. The reason for this is nothing more than the narrow views, short-sighted perspectives, and opportunistic psychology of most industrialists and businessmen.

Therefore, now that the General Chamber of Commerce has been established, all industrial, commercial, and financial circles in Shanghai must eliminate the contradictions of interest between them and turn into harmonious and mutually beneficial cooperation. They must thoroughly correct and eliminate the narrow views, short-sighted perspectives, and opportunistic psychology of the past, and further use all remaining funds to engage in industrial and agricultural production and reproduction. For example, the recently implemented new measures to restrict and tighten loans, acceptance of drafts, and discounting of bills are all relatively passive measures, but they are still a new measure to prevent the use of funds to fuel speculation and hoarding. If the primary task of this new stage is to be completed, so that China's economy can move towards recovery and people's livelihoods can move towards stability, it still depends on the efforts of Shanghai's industrial, commercial, and financial circles.

### Li Quanshi Discusses - Eliminating the Wind of Speculation and Hoarding - Adopting Both Stopgap and Fundamental Measures - Determined to Thoroughly Investigate and Eradicate Hoarding, Tighten Currency, and Increase Production

The National Government authorities previously noted that prices in Shanghai were soaring endlessly, greatly affecting people's livelihoods. Therefore, in order to suppress prices and stabilize people's livelihoods, they specially sent Chen Zhishuo, Director of the Department of Finance, and Yuan Yuquan, Vice Minister of the Department of Industry, to Shanghai to meet with Zhao Zunyue, Secretary-General of the Municipal Government, and Chen Yunwen, Superintendent of the Commercial Regulation Committee, to investigate profiteering and hoarding merchants and severely punish them. Currently, the investigation of the amount of loans borrowed by customers of silver firms, their payment situation, and the stockpiling of goods in various warehouses is still ongoing. A reporter from the Central News Agency visited Mr. Li Quanshi of the China Economic Research Association, who gave the following opinions on eliminating speculation and hoarding:

Determined to Thoroughly Investigate Big Hoarders

Rising prices are an inevitable fact in wartime, and this state of affairs is common to wartime; however, the rapid rise is due to the asset class who have been hoarding goods in cycles, causing the supply of goods on the market to fall short of demand. The goods needed by the people have been collected and controlled by hoarders, and those in need have no choice but to buy them at high prices, thus increasing the burden of life. This is not a concern for capitalists, but it is unbearable for ordinary wage earners. Currently, not only those with huge amounts of capital are rising up to do this, but also those with a little savings in their hands are competing to buy goods. Observing this situation, the trend of rising prices will become more and more turbulent. Therefore, if we want to eliminate speculation and hoarding and suppress prices, we should adopt both stopgap and fundamental measures and work in a practical way. (1) For fundamental measures, we must be determined to thoroughly investigate hoarding merchants, so that every hoarder of goods, whether a big hoarder or a small hoarder, must be dealt with in accordance with the law, and ordered to release the goods at a fair price, to eliminate any suspicion of favoritism. We hope that the work of thoroughly investigating hoarders will continue to be carried out in the future, and we must make the greatest determination to eradicate the trend of hoarding.

Tighten Currency and Increase Production

(2) Stopgap measures are to tighten currency and increase production. Because the current trend of hoarding is that there is too much money and a lack of sources of goods. Therefore, in order to help eliminate the grand effect of speculation and hoarding, we should tighten currency, so that silver firms cannot use excessive idle funds for the purpose of hoarding goods, in order to reduce the hoarders' capital. On the one hand, the government financial institutions should guide idle funds into rural areas, handle agricultural loans, regulate the rural economy, and work hard to increase production. In rural areas, we should increase the output of rice, wheat, cotton, and miscellaneous grains. In cities and towns, we should make it easier for factories to purchase and transport raw materials, in order to increase the output of industrial products, so that the use of wartime materials is abundant and both military and civilian needs are met with a sense of balanced supply. If the above two types of stopgap and fundamental measures can be realized, then the trend of hoarding can be eliminated, and prices can also be suppressed for a long time.

### The Chinese Currency Problem (II)

— By Tadao Imamura

(III)

People generally believe that China's economy is a unique entity and extremely complex. This is due to the aforementioned differing preconditions. In reality, the trend is quite simple. This is because the Chinese people's concept of economic conditions is simple, and the Chinese people's thoughts and actions are simple. Most Japanese or Chinese, especially those with knowledge, consider delving into principles as creating unnecessary trouble. In fact, it's common for an economic undertaking to be attributed to multiple causes. However, the thought of "creating unnecessary trouble" dampens the enthusiasm for research, and the fundamental cause remains unclear. To examine China's economic undertakings, one must first analyze the differences in all preconditions, then study the simple economic laws. This makes it easier to understand. Based on these simple laws, devising policies becomes easy.

For example, regarding rising prices, Chinese people attribute price increases due to material factors to "price increases," and price increases due to currency factors to "currency devaluation." From the perspective of the result, price increases are equivalent to currency devaluation. However, when price increases originate from material factors, Chinese people say, "It's a price increase, not a currency devaluation." They differentiate between currency devaluation and price increases, adopting a so-called causal theory, believing that the external value of the currency has not decreased, and the credit of the currency is good. Therefore, the current price increases are not due to currency factors and cannot be considered currency devaluation. Today's price increases are due to a decrease in imports from overseas and the lack of recovery in production industries, leading to a gradual shortage of materials and rising prices. Therefore, this is a "price increase." This kind of view is very simplistic.

Regarding rising prices in inland cities, according to the opinions of inland residents, they often use the following simple view, believing: "This is caused by rising prices in Shanghai. If prices in Shanghai fall, prices in inland areas will also fall." Regarding the prices of local products, farmers answer: "The things we buy have become expensive, so the things we sell have also become expensive. The increase in the price of local products is for this reason, there is no other reason." This shows that farmers' views have not yet escaped the realm of barter economy. For example, if selling 100 yuan worth of production materials can obtain 100 yuan in return, and can buy 100 yuan worth of living materials, then even if prices rise, farmers will maintain this ratio. If 100 yuan worth of production materials cannot be exchanged for 100 yuan worth of living materials, they will raise the price of production materials. This clearly shows how simple the actions of the Chinese people are. For example, the explanation for shortages is that the amount of currency is not balanced with the quantity of materials. As long as the amount of currency is reduced, prices will fall. However, based on the simple idea of "materials are scarce and prices rise," only policies targeting materials will be effective immediately. Policies regarding currency will not easily lower prices.

In short, when observing China's economic situation or attempting to implement policies, it is necessary to analyze the differences in preconditions and clearly recognize them. Otherwise, it will be futile and ineffective. (Yun: Translated from the Mainland News of April 26th)

### The Spirit of Undertaking Business: Practical Work, Hard Work, Arduous Work

— By Naiwen Jia

People often want to choose easy and profitable things to do, while neglecting complex and difficult ones, leaving them for others. Sometimes, they think that very easy things are not worth doing, and they are unwilling to do them. As a result, they become empty and superficial, wandering on divergent paths, never able to move forward, becoming the laggards of the times. There are countless people like this in the world!

To eliminate this common human ailment, one must first have the spirit of practical work, hard work, and arduous work.

These three types of work are the three movements of a business, none of which can be missing. Practical work refers to doing a meaningful thing in a solid and down-to-earth manner. The opposite is empty work. When there is a meaningful and practical thing, it needs to be done bravely and diligently. Even if there are small failures, they are ignored, and the work continues with a plan, without wavering from the original intention. This is hard work. The opposite is blind work. Having practical work and hard work still requires arduous work, otherwise, all efforts will be in vain. Arduous work is the conclusion of a business, and it can also be said to be the final determining point for the success or failure of a business, because when the success or failure of a business has not reached a clear point, it often goes through a process of hardship and danger. If you work hard and struggle through hardships and dangers, grit your teeth, persevere, and bury yourself in hard work, then you are a successful entrepreneur. Otherwise, you are a failure.

Whether you are a smart, foolish, unwise or not-so-foolish person, as long as you do not give up on yourself and embrace the spirit of practical work, hard work, and arduous work, then you can achieve true success in any large or small undertaking. People like this not only create a brilliant and bright future for themselves, but also become the cutting edge of the times, the driving force for the advancement of all undertakings in the world. Especially in these turbulent times, our motherland is demanding people with practical work, hard work, and arduous work to take on the great mission of building a new China.

### Enthusiasm and Life

— By Luo Chaifu

The biggest reason for many people's unhappiness is that they lack "enthusiasm." They lack the spirit of "enthusiasm" to observe and appreciate the world outside themselves, and instead focus their attention on their own internal world, or they think they are standing in a noble position, treating everyone in the world as crude and shallow people, laughing sarcastically when they are happy, and cursing when they are unhappy. This kind of self-proclaimed clever person is no different from depriving himself of happiness and heading down the road of self-inflicted trouble.

Life is indeed short and not enough to be enthusiastic about everything, but the interests we need to cultivate must fill our entire lives, and we must seek materials outside ourselves to transform interest into experience. The more experience, the more we enjoy life's happiness. Therefore, having enthusiasm for external things can directly control life's happiness.

For example, two people take the tram. One person just sits there bored, waits until they reach their destination, and then gets off. Boredom does not bring him happiness during these few tens of minutes. The other person is different. He uses this opportunity to observe every passenger, analyze their character, and guess their personality. Perhaps he will discover interesting things, but at least those few tens of minutes have passed in activity due to "enthusiasm."

A person who has enthusiasm for friends and career is always a welcome person, because what friends need is genuine "sympathy," and what career needs is also enthusiasm with proactiveness and confidence. Otherwise, a person without sympathy will not have friends, and a person who does not actively and earnestly develop a strong interest in career will not achieve success.

I hope that when everyone comes into this world, they are like a lively cat walking into a strange house, with the surrounding environment seeming to be full of amazing things, full of enthusiasm to pursue broad knowledge, enrich our lives, and pursue the happiness that life should have.

### Casual Talk

— By Lü Xin

People all like success and dislike failure. However, they do not know that without failure, how can there be success in the world? Moreover, if a thing has not gone through failure and difficulty (that is, has not gone through struggle), may I ask if it can become a great thing? Will there be the joy of success afterward? Therefore, I hope that people in the world will look for more failures, so that in the future, when this thing is successful, there will be more joy.

People also like to get a bargain and dislike taking a loss. However, they do not know that without taking a loss, how can there be a bargain? What if oneself gets a bargain and others take a loss? Therefore, I also hope that people will look for fewer bargains, which means taking fewer losses.

Everyone also likes to have a dreamlike paradise, often sighing that the environment is not good. However, they do not know that without bad, how can there be excellent performance? For example, now that we are living such a difficult life, you can better imagine the loveliness of a world of singing and dancing, which will increase your courage to fight for it. If a person's life is lived in a world of singing and dancing, what a common life it would be! Because you simply do not know the loveliness of singing and dancing, and take it for granted. Therefore, life also becomes like a pig's laziness. "The times make heroes, and heroes make the times." This is indeed a profound saying.

People also harbor a selfish heart, hoping that others will help me, and disliking me helping others, saying: "I will not pluck a hair to benefit the world." They only want to watch others fall, and are unwilling to take one more step on a rugged road to help.

People also harbor a heart of dissatisfaction. When they have rice to eat, they want vegetables to eat. When they have vegetables to eat, they want meat to eat. However, they do not know the desire they had when they had nothing to eat. Harboring only the desire to get more after getting something, they will never be satisfied.

People also like to raise birds and fish, thinking it is a refined thing, but they do not know how sad it would be if they themselves were locked in a narrow cage to be appreciated by other animals.

### The Times and Heroes

— By Hu Ruoliu

"The times make heroes," and "heroes make the times," these are two old sayings. In the end, are the times created by heroes, or do the times produce heroes? I think the two have a close relationship. In other words, heroes can make the times, and the times can also make heroes.

First, let's talk about "the times make heroes." Heroes are the product of the times and are discovered from the real world, not descended from heaven. Therefore, when the times are surging and turbulent, and war is raging, heroes are selected from the ranks of the people.

From the above theory, it is undoubtedly certain that heroes are the product of the times. In past history, it is also easy to find.

We know that Qin Shihuang was a hero (many books say he was not, but let's not worry about that here). He unified the six kingdoms. This was because the economic foundation at the time had changed, and commercial capital had reached a considerable level of development, creating a necessary situation for unification, not just relying on Shihuang's power.

This is to say, "the times make heroes." But one-sided truth is not complete. Otherwise, heroes would be subject to the domination of history, without the ability to interfere with history in the slightest. Therefore, we will further explain the reasons for "heroes making the times."

We know that heroes are selected from the ranks of the people. Therefore, their psychology, wisdom, and vision are all one level higher than ordinary people. Especially their ability to analyze and synthesize is even more needed. Therefore, the development of society and the progress of the times all rely on the promotion of heroes. This is to say, "heroes make the times."

Heroes are admired. Do they not have the desire to be heroes themselves?

Friends, let me tell you: recognize the times, grasp the social trends, and even if you are oppressed by the times and the environment, do not be afraid of them, but create the times and conquer the environment. This is the true "hero of the times."

### Three Scenes of Selling Tickets on the Tram

— By Zhong Hui

Scene One

As the tram approaches the station, the crowd swarms forward. Children shout, adults yell, as if they are escaping for their lives, afraid of getting separated. Regardless of who they are, regardless of their status or morality, they push and shove each other, following the crowd onto the tram. Inside the tram, besides the people squeezed next to you, and the vegetables and rice sacks at your feet, there is only the awkward face of the ticket seller.

"Tickets, tickets, hey! Get your coins out!" the ticket seller shouts, demanding money from the passengers as if he is collecting debts.

One passenger pays him thirty cents, "Tongfu Road." The ticket seller takes the money, gives him a twenty-cent ticket, and says with a smile, "Sorry!" The passenger looks at the ticket and says nothing. Another young man in a suit shouts, "Hey! Ticket seller! How much is this ticket worth?"

"Thank you, sorry!" the ticket seller says with a forced smile.

"That's not okay. If one is missing, does your company have rules?"

The ticket seller's smile immediately disappears, and he curses in a low Yangzhou accent: "Damn his mother!" He exchanges the ticket for another one. Then he yells at others, "Tickets, those taking the tram must buy tickets, hurry up and get them out!" He squeezes in front of a group of women and children carrying rice sacks. He collects money from them one by one, but doesn't give them tickets.

"Hey! You didn't give me a ticket!"

The ticket seller says fiercely, "You take the tram all day long, don't you know the rules! Wait a minute, got it!" The group of poor friends rolls their eyes at him!

Scene Two

A long-gowned passenger near the tram door says, "Ticket seller! I need my change, I'm getting off."

The ticket seller says in surprise, "What? How much money did you pay?"

"Huh! Strange! I gave you a ten-dollar bill to buy a thirty-cent ticket." He waves the ticket.

"No passenger on this tram gave me a ten-dollar bill!" the ticket seller says.

"How unreasonable! Not giving me my change, is this your company's rule!"

The two argue, no one opens the tram door, and the passenger who wants to get off yells. As a result, a ticket inspector runs up.

"Yes, I saw this gentleman pay with a ten-dollar bill," one passenger says.

"I saw it too!" another passenger nearby says.

"This passenger paid as soon as he got on," a friend in a suit says.

The ticket seller's face turns red, "It's really strange!" Now that there are so many witnesses, it's hard to argue. The ticket seller has no choice but to obediently give the gentleman nine dollars and seventy cents. The passenger takes the money and gets off the tram, still grumbling under his breath. After one stop, these witnesses all get off the tram one after another.

Scene Three

The tram starts from Jing'an Temple. The people on the tram are so crowded that they can hardly breathe. This time, the ticket seller doesn't curse or yell as he desperately closes the tram door. He only says, "Those who are coming in, squeeze to the inside, squeeze tighter!" People keep squeezing in, and the small tram has already become overly full. In the end, the ticket inspector under the tram forces the tram door shut. The ticket seller squeezes back and forth through the crowd, collecting money from each person. When he sees women and children carrying rice, he doesn't say a word. When he sees some difficult people, he says, "Sorry, thank you!" As a result, no one on the tram has a ticket.

"Hey! You took the money, where are the tickets?"

"Huh! It's like collecting rent!"

Everyone says loudly like this, but the ticket seller pretends not to hear and keeps telling jokes: "Squeezing like this, I can save on dinner!" or "Squeezing like this! It would be better to build a loft in the tram tomorrow!"

When the tram arrives, the passengers swarm out like water. Unexpectedly, a Japanese gentleman in civilian clothes is standing in front of the tram, asking each passenger for their ticket. The first one doesn't have a ticket, the second one doesn't have a ticket, the third one still doesn't have a ticket... The passengers panic, and the ticket seller's face also changes. The Japanese ticket inspector immediately drags the ticket seller to the ticket office. At first, the passengers are shocked, and then they burst out laughing. It's as if everyone has just acted in a play, and now it's over.

### Collected Under the Lamp

— By Helen

Theory and fact are completely two different things. If you only have theory but don't do it in a down-to-earth manner, then theory will never become a fact. It is equal to a check that cannot be cashed, so we must cultivate the habit of "doing what we say."

Diligence and thrift are the helm of life, and they can lead us into the realm of happiness. Although there may be some pain at the beginning, it gives us permanent peace and happiness. What about laziness? On the contrary, it gives us temporary happiness and leisure, but it leads us to the realm of destruction, suffering eternal pain. Social Service

### Reducing Women's Consumption: We Should Learn to Sew Ourselves

— By Cheng Heng

These days, there are so many Gu Lüzhuang and clothing companies in Shanghai, and Chinese and Western garment shops are everywhere. Their decoration and living expenses are mostly provided by us women. Their consumption is quite considerable based on the yearly statistics. If we all did it ourselves, embroidered ourselves, sewed ourselves, and knitted ourselves, wouldn't it reduce a lot of consumption for individuals and families!

One day, I was introduced by a friend and taken to the Chinese Women's Sewing and Embroidery Training Center for a visit. As soon as I walked in, I could hear the sound of machines clattering, and I saw the sisters working hard. In a large room, there were more than a dozen new white sewing machines, occupied by more than a dozen young ladies. Under the careful calculations of the ladies, pieces of leather and yardsticks were cut into fashionable new clothes. Various colors of satin were constantly being pushed on the machines, and the beautiful and delicate patterns were completed by the skillful hands of the sisters. There was also an instructor constantly pointing out, teaching cutting, teaching sewing, and teaching embroidery in the group of sisters. I saw that their faces were all filled with happy emotions.

According to that friend, the director of the training center, Mr. Tang Aimei, saw that most of the wives who depended on their husbands even had to take small tears or shortening of clothes to the tailor, which was really too much to bear, so he advocated setting up a machine embroidery training center, so that women would have the opportunity to learn a skill. It can reduce the consumption of the family economy, and it can increase the production of individuals and society.

The first batch of recruits she recruited were mostly women in distress and abandoned wives. Under the painstaking voluntary teaching of Principal Tang, after more than six months of practice, they were able to produce things. Principal Tang then went one by one to find a way out for them and seek introductions. To this day, countless producers have been created by her hands and are serving everywhere.

The purpose of the Chinese Sewing and Embroidery Training Center is to cultivate women's applied skills, meet social needs, and promote women's production undertakings, regardless of age. Anyone who is interested in learning can register. The center specializes in teaching cutting, machinery, sewing machines, embroidery, etc. Classes are held daily (except Sundays) from 8:30 am to 11:30 am and from 1:00 pm to 4:00 pm. There is no limit to the curriculum, and it is tentatively divided into elementary and advanced levels, each lasting three months. The tuition fee is 120 yuan per term. The clothes made during the term can be taken home freely by the students. The address is No. 168 at the intersection of Guling Road and Parker Road.

### Promoting Small Hand-Operated Textile Machines

China has only used machines for weaving for fifty or sixty years. Before using machine weaving, it was hand spinning and hand weaving. This hand spinning and weaving has solved the problem of people's clothing for thousands of years. Currently, because cloth prices are expensive, hand spinning and hand weaving are popular again in rural areas.

Hand spinning has a history of thousands of years, but it adheres to the old methods and rarely improves. One person only spins one thread. Four years ago, the Chinese only had improved hand spinning machines appear. The earliest was Mr. Mu Ouchu's spinning machine. This spinning machine is foot-operated and has a relatively complex structure, but it can already spin more than ten threads. Since then, many people have made improvements. These improved hand spinning machines have been widely used in the interior. However, they are still rarely used in the Jianghuai area. The reason for this is, first, few people promote it: second, there is a lack of technical personnel to make reasonable improvements to the structure. Recently, some people in Shanghai have also manufactured simple hand spinning machines for sale. Although this hand spinning machine can spin flowers into yarn, there is still room for improvement in the actual application in rural areas and the structure. My friend Mr. Ma has a great interest in this kind of spinning machine and has been studying it carefully. He has created a hand spinning machine that is suitable for rural areas: in order to promote the widespread application of hand spinning machines, Mr. Ma is very willing to jointly study with those interested in hand spinning. If you are interested in purchasing one, you can also design it for you. Contact address: Mr. Ma, No. 491 Maitang Road. Every day after 7 pm or on Sundays. (Qu Zunyi)
