### From the Reception of the Shanghai Concessions to the Cooperative Completion of the Greater East Asia War

The glorious day we have been awaiting, a glorious day that the Chinese nation has been anticipating for a century, a glorious day in the history of the Republic of China and even the liberation history of East Asian nations, has finally arrived! From today onwards, Shanghai is restored to our national territory; from today onwards, more than four million compatriots in Shanghai enjoy the protection of our national government; from today onwards, there will be no more shameful and sinful "state within a state"—the concessions—within the territory of the Republic of China; from today onwards, the theory of mutual love, mutual assistance, coexistence, and co-prosperity among East Asian nations is proven by fact. We rejoice in today, and our descendants will forever rejoice in this historically glorious day.

For the sake of abolishing unequal treaties and reclaiming the territorial sovereignty of the concessions, we have waged struggles for more than half a century. However, today, the glorious outcome—the reception of the Shanghai concessions—is realized by our friendly nation, Japan, in order to implement its new policy towards China. From the standpoint of our friendly nation and the East Asian nations, this is a brilliant fact of mutual assistance and co-prosperity. Therefore, as we celebrate this glorious day, every Chinese person must deeply encourage themselves, and must transfer the sacrifices and struggles for reclaiming the concessions to efforts in various aspects after the reception of the concessions. Otherwise, we would be letting ourselves down, letting the nation down, and letting our friendly nation down. If we can transfer the power of reclaiming the concessions to various undertakings after the reception, then the future achievements will surely be sufficient to further glorify the nation, the people, and the history of East Asia. This is our most fundamental task today.

How can we transfer the sacrifices and struggles for reclaiming the concessions to various efforts after the reception? In view of Shanghai's position and its actual situation, and in view of the world situation and China's urgent priorities today, we believe that the direction of effort for the new Shanghai in the future has been very clearly presented to us: From Shanghai itself, under the management of imperialists for a century, it has become the largest economic center and cultural capital in the country, while at the same time becoming the biggest shackle to the normal development of China's economy and culture due to its abnormal development. From now on, on the one hand, we must thoroughly eliminate the bad and impure factors in Shanghai that hinder the normal development of the national economy and culture, and on the other hand, we must change the abnormal to the normal, forming a central area for the economic and cultural revival of the country. From the perspective of Shanghai's position in the country, based on its historical and geographical special conditions, it must gradually become a model area in the country in terms of politics, economy, and even culture, using the demonstration effect of the new Shanghai's political construction, economic construction, and cultural construction to promote the demonstration effect of the entire war-participating Chinese region, and further extend it to the whole country. From the perspective of Shanghai's position towards friendly nations and East Asia, given the huge proportion of Japanese residents in Shanghai in the national ratio of Japanese residents, the new Shanghai must become a model area for Sino-Japanese people to cooperate and get along, so that the whole country and even the whole of East Asia can take the cooperation between Chinese and Japanese people in Shanghai as a model to move towards the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Under the major significance of demonstrating for the whole country and the whole of East Asia as mentioned above, in what most urgent and important specific undertakings should the efforts of constructing the new Shanghai begin? We common people do not talk about profound political theories, nor do we make overly ideal expectations. What we urgently demand to be realized are the following points.

First of all, on the part of the common people, after the term "concession" becomes a historical term, the highest hope for the new Shanghai is only four big characters: "peaceful living and happy work." More specifically, it is the hope of realizing the two points of "suppressing and stabilizing prices" and "abundant food for the people." At present, what threatens the lives of the people of Shanghai the most is the food panic and the endless soaring of prices. After the recovery of the concessions, the authorities can implement new policies according to plan, eliminate the crisis of the national economy, and ensure the lives of the vast majority of the people. At the same time, we should also solemnly point out that only after satisfying the people's demands in terms of food and prices first, and only after making the people live and work in peace and contentment, can we talk about the promotion of all construction undertakings in the new Shanghai in the future.

Secondly, what the people demand is the enlightenment of the new Shanghai's politics. Moreover, in order to achieve the above-mentioned improvement of democracy, and to eliminate all economic crises, it is necessary to first achieve "political enlightenment." To achieve "political enlightenment," one must start with the following things: Raising the salaries of police and civil servants, especially paying attention to the real and practical "raising," guaranteeing their lives, so that they have no worries in their service and are not distracted by life. Strengthening the Baojia organization, improving the ability of general citizens to self-govern, and further promoting all people's self-government undertakings. Only after these two points are realized can officials and people work together to seek "political enlightenment."

Third, we must also especially emphasize the absolute importance of winning the people's voluntary cooperation. The above-mentioned economic and political demands cannot be expected to have satisfactory results if they do not receive the people's automatic cooperation. To demand the people's voluntary cooperation lies in the establishment of public opinion organs. The Standing Bureau had the determination to help establish genuine public opinion organs some time ago, which is something that the people are happy about. It is hoped that there will be factual manifestations in one or two months. We especially hope that the advanced figures in all circles will pay attention to this matter. Since ancient times, our Chinese people have valued courtesy and concession too much, taking asking about politics as a shame, keeping themselves clean and avoiding trouble, so that the virtuous retreat and the petty advance, often leading to the darkness of the political situation. It is hoped that they will not give way to benevolence, and come out to jointly bear the great difficulties.

The reception of the Shanghai concessions coincides with an unprecedentedly important international situation, and it has particularly significant meaning. Therefore, our above-mentioned demands are entirely for the sake of realizing the construction of the new Shanghai, so that it can be a model for the whole country and the whole of East Asia. Japan handed over the concessions in order to demonstrate the cause of coexistence and co-prosperity among East Asian nations, so we must redouble our efforts in various undertakings in the new Shanghai in order to cooperate with Japan in completing the Greater East Asia War. In today's grand celebration, we must especially emphasize that the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the success of the construction of the Co-Prosperity Sphere are based on the unity of the Axis powers, on the unity of the East Asian Axis powers, but even more on the unity and cooperation among the East Asian nations. However, looking at the current situation in China, how can we talk about cooperation? Only when the politics are sound and the economy develops in the war-participating Chinese region, and we first strengthen ourselves, can we talk about cooperating in combat. The above-mentioned efforts in the politics and economy of the new Shanghai are the model and driving force for the sound political and economic development of the war-participating China. For this reason, we cannot but demand that the whole country, from top to bottom, recognize its own position and shoulder its own task in the celebration. Redouble our efforts and move towards building a new Shanghai to cooperate in the Greater East Asia War.

The glorious day has finally arrived, and we must sacrifice and struggle for the tomorrow of achieving the final victory!

### Axis Air Force Active in the Skies over Sicily: No Large-Scale Warfare on Land

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) Due to the fact that the British Eighth Army is in difficulty in Catania, Sicily, and the US Seventh Army in the Barreilmo area has suffered heavy blows from the Axis forces since occupying Jefur, and feels that it is difficult to advance or retreat, there have been no large-scale battles recently. Moreover, due to the large-scale activity of the Axis air force, the anti-Axis forces' actions have been further delayed. According to a dispatch from a front-line special correspondent of the Re-National News Agency, the ground warfare on the Sicilian front has not changed much at the moment, but the Axis air force has become increasingly active. On the 29th, an enemy 8,000-ton transport ship was sunk in the waters off the port of Gila, and the enemy air force base in the port of Gila was severely damaged, destroying many aircraft parked on the ground. In addition, enemy convoys anchored in the Gulf of Guunta were bombed, severely damaging three ships, totaling 14,000 tons. In addition, an Axis mobile team drove to the port of Bizerte in North Africa and inflicted heavy damage. At present, the ground battle in Sicily is only a artillery battle and reconnaissance battle. The anti-Axis forces' operations on the northeast and north sides have all been severely damaged.

### Soviet Offensive Frustrated North of Orel

Berlin, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) Colonel Hama, a military reporter accompanying the German News Agency on the Eastern Front, said that the battles in the Kuban bridgehead, Mius and the central Donets River, and the Belgorod area seem to have become more active, but the center of the Eastern Front's summer battle is still in the Orel bend. Although the Soviet army continues to transfer reinforcements, and the tank corps and infantry teams supplemented by Jie are added to the battle, attempting to gain some success in military strategy, the German army firmly defends its positions, remains motionless, and continues to inflict the most serious losses on the Soviet army. In this battle, the Soviet army lost 105 tanks on Thursday, 99 of which were destroyed in the Orel area. Since July 5, the total number of Soviet tanks lost has exceeded 7,000. On Thursday, the Soviet army launched an attack on the south side of the Orel bend, mostly by infantry operations, but these attacks ultimately collapsed in the face of the German army's fierce defensive artillery fire. When Soviet tanks approached the German line, they stood in groups, one after the other, as in previous times. Their main purpose was to insert into the north side of the Orel salient. The Soviet army successively dispatched tank divisions, totaling about 200 vehicles, but were repelled in fierce and intermittent battles. The Soviet army suffered heavy losses in manpower and material. The Soviet tank units that penetrated several strongholds in the German line were annihilated by reserve soldiers. German ground troops received effective support from Stuga aircraft and military aircraft, which bombed enemy concentrations and deployment points, and crushed enemy infantry units with bombs and accurately targeted machine gun fire. A German air force unit destroyed 18 Soviet tanks. German military aircraft bombed Soviet artillery positions, silencing 23 heavy howitzers. The German army carried out powerful counter-offensives in the Kuban bridgehead and between the Sea of Azov and Belgorod, resulting in considerable improvements in the German positions. Many enemy prisoners and a large number of war implements fell into the hands of the German army. In the Leningrad area, the Soviet army repeatedly launched attacks on the German positions under the cover of artillery and aircraft, but were repelled with heavy losses.

### Britain, America, and the Soviet Union Issue Warnings to Neutral Countries

Lisbon, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from London, European neutral countries and Argentina have recently received a notice warning from Britain that they should not provide any assistance to the leaders of the belligerent countries. It is said that Britain will regard such assistance as an action that undermines the principles of the anti-Axis powers' operations. A Reuters diplomatic reporter said that the wording of the British notice is the same as the notices from the Soviet Union to Sweden and Turkey, and said that the British government is now taking the same steps to send the communiqué on the theme published by President Roosevelt yesterday to various neutral countries.

### British Cabinet Convenes Emergency Meeting

Sweden, 　City, 31st (Central News Agency dispatch) According to a dispatch from London, the British government convened an emergency cabinet meeting at 0:30 a.m. on the 30th, which lasted for two hours. The content of the meeting is unknown. It is said that the cabinet meeting was very sudden, and most of the cabinet ministers were awakened from their dreams to attend.

### Regarding the Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Residents, the Japanese Embassy Issues a Statement

Central News Agency, Kyoto dispatch The Japanese Embassy in China issued a statement on July 31 regarding the points to note on the Treaty on the Taxation of Japanese Residents in China as follows:

The "Treaty on Taxation of Japanese Residents in China" concluded between China and Japan is the first step since the Treaty of Nanjing in 1842 and the Sino-Japanese Commercial Treaty of July 5, 1843 for Japan to abolish extraterritorial rights that bound China's sovereignty. It first recognizes China's taxation rights, assists the independent development of the Republic of China, and jointly moves towards the path of liberating Greater East Asia and building a new East Asian order. Regarding the provisions of this treaty, the points to note for Japanese residents are as follows. It is hoped that Japanese residents will pay attention to the issued treaty, subsidiary agreement, and points of understanding.

(1) Compliance with the Tax Laws of the Republic of China: According to Articles 1 and 2 of this treaty, Japanese residents in the territory of the Republic of China from August 1 of this year onwards shall fully comply with the tax laws of China. This also applies to legal persons. However, Japanese residents should not be treated disadvantageously compared to nationals of the Republic of China under any circumstances. Articles 1 and 2 of the treaty. The provisions of this treaty are not only aimed at the regulations of the Republic of China, but also at the preparation of the tax system and the completion of various facilities through the active efforts of the National Government. The Japanese side hopes that the provisions of Article 1 of this treaty can be applied as soon as possible, but the current situation in the Republic of China has not yet reached this stage, and there are certain restrictions on implementation. Therefore, there are the provisions of the "Provisional Measures" in the first and second items of the Points of Understanding.

(2) Notification Regarding the Scope and Application Status of Laws: (A) Meaning of Notification: According to the provisions of Article 1 of the treaty, the scope of the laws of the Republic of China that Japanese residents should comply with and the status of application shall be notified by the Minister of Foreign Affairs of the National Government to the Japanese Embassy in China (Article 1 of the Subsidiary Agreement). Based on this formal notification, the tax laws that Japanese residents should comply with are specifically determined. In other words, there is no obligation to serve without notification. (B) Publication of the Notification: The content of the notification will be published in the official gazettes of both the Japanese and Republic of China governments. In addition, each consulate will issue necessary instructions on tax payment in accordance with the provisions of the treaty. It is hoped that Japanese residents will pay attention to the notification and instructions and will not misunderstand (Article 5 of the Subsidiary Agreement). In addition, there should be a period of hesitation between the notification and the actual start of delivery. (C) Order and Timing of Notification: The tax rights, tax laws, and the status of their implementation that the Government of the Republic of China should notify the Japanese Ambassador to China are currently being studied and will always exist and will be explained at the beginning. The Japanese people, standing on a broad perspective, deeply hope that they can meet the requirements of the Chinese side, pay taxes, and cooperate with them. To be more specific, for example, Chinese officials may temporarily not implement forced execution such as inspections, seals, auctions, and confiscations. However, inspections of account books and other inspections that are indispensable for tax collection technology, and notifications or declarations by taxpayers are intended to be adapted by Chinese officials.

(4) Transitional Measures by the Japanese Government Regarding Tax Payment: In item 3 of the Points of Understanding, the Japanese government will separately stipulate necessary measures to enable Japanese nationals to pay taxes based on this treaty. That is, when Japanese nationals violate tax laws and have facts such as tax evasion, the Japanese government will consider announcing penalties or taking de facto administrative actions. For the sake of the reputation of Japanese nationals, attention should be paid to these special measures.

(5) Measures for Correcting Dissatisfaction: Based on the fact that Japanese nationals should comply with the laws of the Republic of China, if Japanese nationals are dissatisfied with the administrative actions of Chinese officials (temporarily without the use of force), the Government of the Republic of China may take appropriate corrective measures. The specific methods will be studied separately.

(6) Improvement of the Tax System: Article 4 of the Subsidiary Agreement stipulates that the current tax system center of the Republic of China needs to be improved, and it should be improved as soon as possible. According to the aforementioned Japan, the reason why it set up Points of Understanding and agreed on a certain degree of restriction on China's taxation rights is due to the imperfection of the tax system. Therefore, it is deeply hoped that it will be improved as soon as possible. Regarding the transit tax and other taxes that are deemed inappropriate, the National Government is currently planning to abolish them.

(7) Judicial Measures for Violations of Laws: The consular jurisdiction and other extraterritorial rights regarding justice have not yet been abolished. Under this situation, the applicable laws of the Republic of China are applied in accordance with the general principles of consular jurisdiction and are subject to the judgment of Japanese consular officials. The fines, etc., issued in this situation should belong to the Chinese government (Article 2 of the Subsidiary Agreement). However, if the penalties, etc., in the tax law are still unclear, or if the types and enforcement of criminal penalties differ from those in Japan, it will be difficult to immediately implement judicial actions, and they will be temporarily reserved before an agreement is reached (Item 2 of the Points of Understanding). Regarding this point, the Japanese government does not need to take special measures and hopes that Japanese nationals will pay attention.

(8) Republic of China Taxes, Republic of China levies, etc.: The recognition of China's taxation rights this time has nothing to do with the taxes and levies collected by the Republic of China National Assembly, etc., and will continue to exist. In order to adapt to the progress of taxation in China, the issue of reducing the burden on Japanese residents in China arises. Regarding this point, the Japanese side will consider it separately. Based on the above points, the purpose of this treaty can be generally understood. It is hoped that Japanese residents in China will provide assistance and self-respect.

### Commemorating the Reception of Shanghai Concessions: Compiling Two Great Works

The Shanghai concessions have now become a historical term. After a hundred years of restraint, once it is lifted, it is worth celebrating by the Chinese people. In order to permanently commemorate this and for the 72nd anniversary of the founding of this newspaper, we plan to compile and print a book on the History of the Shanghai Concessions immediately, collect historical materials on the evolution of the concessions, and hire Mr. Zhang Yipeng Yunbo to preside over the compilation affairs, hoping to publish it on New Year's Day next year. In addition, under the same intention, we will compile and print a book on the "Shanghai Industrial and Commercial Directory", investigate the content of industry and commerce, and record it in detail, and hire Quan Shi and Pan Jiyao to preside over the compilation affairs.

Similar books on industrial and commercial directories have not been compiled in recent years, which is very inconvenient for industrial and commercial reference. Therefore, we plan to compile it into a special book to meet the needs. However, this work is extremely heavy, and we rely on people from all walks of life to provide assistance, or provide historical materials, or provide opinions. If you have any advice, please send it to the editorial office of this newspaper.

The seventh issue was published yesterday. It contains an article by Jitian Dongyou on the possibility of a comprehensive solution to the Sino-Japanese problem, which has unique insights into the crux of the Sino-Japanese problem and is a must-read for Chinese and Japanese people.

Economic Commentary

### The Challenges Ahead

The Shanghai Public Concession was also received by our government today! Today's mood can be compared to a school being taken over and run by itself, with the school buildings decorated with lanterns and streamers, and the teachers and students celebrating. However, in the midst of joy and excitement, everyone must not forget the challenges ahead.

The challenges ahead for Shanghai can be said to have been answered very thoroughly at the reception given by Mayor Chen to Chinese and foreign journalists the day before yesterday. Among the various questions answered by Mayor Chen, the economic issue was the core of the answer, in addition to administrative facilities, the baojia system, and educational plans. It can also be said that 90% of the challenges ahead are related to Shanghai's economy.

Among the economic challenges ahead, the price issue is the core of the questions and answers. Mayor Chen's answer to this main issue is that it is the key to the stability of citizens' lives and the reasonable prosperity of society. He especially did not shy away from being verbose and repeatedly clarified it. He first said: "The price issue has been discussed in detail between China and Japan. I deeply believe that it will be implemented soon. I am the executor and will work hard to achieve this goal." Later, he said: "Recently, China and Japan have internally decided on measures to stabilize prices, but I cannot announce them here." This shows that Mayor Chen has already made up his mind on this issue, and it has reached the point where "governing is not about talking too much, but about working hard."

We believe that the main key to this challenge is still inseparable from the two sentences that Mayor Chen repeatedly reminded: "I hope that both sides will stabilize finance" and "First, we must see if there is a way to manage currency", because other measures to suppress and stabilize prices, no matter how effective they are, are only superficial.

### Various Industry Associations Implement Emergency Measures to Manage the Industry to Assist the Authorities in Suppressing the Rising Prices

Since the reorganization of the various industry associations under the Business Coordination Association, after several weeks of rectification, almost all of them have entered the right track as of yesterday. According to reporters from Datong News Agency who inquired from various industry associations, from today onwards, emergency measures will be implemented to manage the prices of the same industry, so as to assist the municipal authorities in suppressing the rising prices and maintaining the stability of people's livelihoods.

Eliminate Barriers and Gain Understanding

According to reports, the authorities of the various industry associations felt that they did not have a good understanding of the business conditions of the same industry, so there were inevitably barriers between the industry associations and their members. After active investigation last month, as of now, they have a deep understanding and have discussed strict measures to implement emergency measures to manage the prices of the same industry.

Emergency Measures to Suppress Prices

According to reporters from Datong News Agency, the measures include the following: (1) Establish an investigation team to thoroughly investigate illegal trade in the same industry. (2) The industry association will start direct contact with the authorities controlling materials. The content of the contact will not be revealed, but suppressing prices will be inevitable. (3) After the unification of the authorities' agencies in the various districts of this city, the prices of the stores operated by the members of the same industry will be unified as much as possible. (4) The distribution situation of materials will be made public every time. (5) The quantity of inventory, transaction scope, and the names of the parties involved of the members of the same industry will be reported to the authorities by the industry association.

### Establishment of Japanese Cotton Association

The Jiangbei Cotton Association, reorganized from the Japanese Cotton Collection Association, held an establishment meeting at the Japanese Club at 2 pm on the 30th. Fourteen related companies attended. In addition to passing the articles of association, responsible personnel were elected on the spot.

Content of the Articles of Association

The reporter from Guofeng News Agency specially selected the main contents of the association's articles of association as follows: (1) The association's business includes the purchase and transportation of Jiangbei cotton, the cultivation and production increase and quality improvement of cotton, and the statistical investigation and research on cotton. (2) The association is composed of 14 cotton companies that are members of the Shanghai Japanese Cotton Traders Association. (3) The total amount of funds is 100 million yuan, and capital may be increased if necessary.

List of Directors and Supervisors

The elected directors and supervisors of the association are as follows: (1) Standing Director, Mori Goro, (2) Directors, Ryogawa Takashi, Okabayashi Hiroshi, Akiyama Takeo, Fujii Shinjirou, Kurimoto Toraji, Uematsu, (3) Supervisors, Kodama Choijirou, Noguchi Masahiro.

### Purchase of Stamp Duty by Stores Promoted by Various Industry Associations

The Jiangsu Provincial Stamp Tax Bureau of Tobacco and Alcohol believes that the stamp tax administration in the two special districts of Shanghai has been adjusted and the promotion system has been adjusted repeatedly, but it has not been promoted smoothly due to the special administrative relations of the concessions. There are countless cases of compliance and violation, or failure to purchase and affix stamp tax tickets in accordance with regulations, which has greatly affected the sales volume. Now that the two concessions have been returned and received one after another, the merchants should be strictly ordered to purchase and affix them in accordance with regulations. In order to unify the sale of flowers and prevent the malpractice of missed stickers, it is specifically stipulated that from August 1, the stamp promotion system will be changed to be promoted collectively by the various industry associations. The bureau also ordered the various industry associations to list the total amount required by the member stores of each industry from August 1, and report it to the Bureau. It is said that in the past, the stamp sales volume in the two concession areas reached about 400,000 yuan per month. After this change in the promotion system, the sales volume can still be increased.

### Materials Adjustment Committee Denies Checking Finance

The Materials Investigation Committee has now reported the materials of each warehouse that have been investigated and are under review. Plans for strengthening the investigation work in the future are also being studied. Regarding the implementation of financial inspection, the person in charge of the committee said: On the 26th of this month, the Japanese-language Continental News published a message about the Materials Investigation Committee, which, in addition to recording the proceedings of the second committee meeting, also suggested "the implementation of financial inspection" and cited past facts as a kind of hope. However, when the Chinese newspapers reprinted the message the next day, the title "The Materials Investigation Committee will implement financial inspection" was quite different from the original meaning, and the financial inspection has its own competent authority responsible for handling it, which is not within the scope of the committee's functions. When it is necessary to conduct an investigation, measures such as checking the company or warehouse accounts cannot be equated with financial inspection. The number of inventory quantities in each warehouse that has been checked is still under review, and the numbers provided by the counties are not credible. The powers of the investigators have now been clearly stipulated in the Investigator Service Regulations, and all measures are based on the law, which is also the basic belief of the committee.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose in a volatile manner, and many new highs appeared again. The goals of all parties were concentrated, old investors held on, and new buyers increased day by day. The trend was easy to rise and difficult to fall. According to the hearts of all parties, they are still mostly prosperous. Although it was Saturday, the transaction was strong. Wing On Co. in the department store industry stood out among the eight, and Sincere and China Emporium also followed suit. The increase in underwear was even greater, and two consecutive leaps were made. Jingfu Shirts and Socks saw a new high price again, but Jinglun was relatively stable. The buying momentum of Kwong Wah and China Emporium has not diminished. Wing On Textile in the textile industry finally leveled with the previous day after fatigue. Small ticket textiles such as New China, Hong Sheng, Kwok Kwong, Kwok Sun, Chun Fung, Yan Fung, Da Chung Hwa, Mei Lun, Wing Fung, and Sincere all made progress. The rise of Dasheng Factory One and Three was even more amazing. There were very few sellers in the cultural industry, and there was a lack of transactions. Commercial Press, Chung Hwa, and World Book Co. each rose by dozens of dollars, all seeing high prices. New Asia in the new medicine industry rose by several yuan compared with the previous day. Five Continents, Sino-Foreign, and Sincere Pharmacy were called for even higher prices. The price of Shanghai North Water and Electricity and China Electric Company in the public utility industry was stable, while the latter suddenly knocked on three levels. Investors poured into industrial stocks. Kiu On Industrial stood out among the eight levels. The rising momentum of Da Chung Hwa Industrial was intensified, and the buying price of China Investment was getting higher day by day. San Lok Industrial, which had no color, was also gradually being asked about by investors. The price exceeded 50% of the ticket price. New Asia Construction rose by several yuan again. The pulling momentum of Lien Hwa and Sin Yick Real Estate did not stop. Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company was stable. Da Chung Hwa Matches suddenly reported flatness and fatigue. Hong Yuan Biscuit soared and saw speed. Standard Wei Jing. Fuk Man Dairy and Gee Mei Food all crossed the border in the buying momentum. There were also many entries for Standard Paper. Jin Hua Paper knocked on three levels again. Da Hwa Pulp had news of increased capital, and it was also the focus of buyers. Shanghai Rickshaws rose by 60% over the ticket price. China United Shipbuilding, China Bricks and Tiles, Wah Fung Enamelware, and Chung Hing Timber were all strong and lasting. The price of China Transport Film rose again.

### Business Summary

Gold and Silver: Yesterday, the Dasing Tongxing Jewelry Firm in Shanghai was still at a standstill. There were few transactions outside the industry, and the hearts of the people were bewildered, so the price was also uncertain. At noon, it was slightly smaller than the previous day, and silver exceeded the customs.

Public Bonds: The transaction of unified public bonds was not strong, and both buyers and sellers were watching. A, B, D, and E all rose slightly, and only C was flattened.

Yarn and Cloth: The market was still weak due to the hearts of the people, and because the supply exceeded the demand, the price gradually fell. As a result, it was lower than yesterday.

### Talking About Suppressing Speculation and Stabilizing Prices

— Shu Ren

(2) Restrict the use of telephones: In the era of controlled economy, all material resources must be saved as much as possible. Since the development of the speculative market in Shanghai, the use of telephones has increased alarmingly. Just listen, the price of a telephone secretly sold is 5,000 to 10,000, which can be seen in general. The authorities have banned publications from publishing news about prices. Why can't they restrict the use of telephones, so that speculators lose their sight and hearing and slightly restrain their actions, which saves material resources and severely hits speculators. Some say that this method hinders the development of industry and commerce, but picking up the phone and waiting for 10 or 20 minutes without getting through, is it the blessing of the industry and commerce circles?

(3) Freeze materials: Regarding material control, the authorities have various concrete methods. I advocate further sanctioning private hoarding. Check the warehouses for private hoarding, order the companies to investigate the truth to prevent individuals from borrowing names; restrict the transfer of stack slips to prevent private transactions; reward reporting; prohibit manufacturers from selling huge amounts of goods to individuals. Manufacturers hoarding non-business goods are prohibited. The raw material inventory of factories and stores is frozen uniformly, and strictly handled to prevent evasion. Factories need to apply for approval to use materials, depending on whether the products they produce are necessary. If the products do not have a retail department for sale, the factory must immediately allocate them to another seller for public consumption. Factories are not allowed to deliberately stop work in order to maintain raw materials. If some manufacturers lack raw materials, the authorities can requisition them from other places and supply them at a fair price. Stores sell goods, and the authorities approve a certain amount every day to save consumption and eliminate back-door transactions, so that they cannot refuse to sell. The profit of buying and selling is in the store, and the right to sell is in the authorities, so the strange phenomena such as exceeding the price limit and having prices but no goods can be eliminated.

Before the implementation of full rationing of all daily necessities, the above three points can be used as a temporary solution. (End)

### Supplementing the Lack of People's Food, Miscellaneous Grains Continue to Arrive in Shanghai

Recently, in order to supplement the shortage of people's food in this city, the military distribution combination has been purchasing miscellaneous grains from various producing areas and transporting them to Shanghai. Thousands of packages of beans have been shipped from Chongming Wangdian and other places, and have been handed over to miscellaneous grain companies for public sale at fair prices. The price is 450 yuan per 100 catties for the first class, 420 yuan for the second class, 400 yuan for the third class, and 380 yuan for the fourth class. All the actual sales households and miscellaneous grain firms in this city can go to purchase them.

### Thoughts and Hopes on the Return of the Shanghai Concessions

We are publishing a special issue to celebrate the return of the Shanghai concessions, and we solicited insightful articles under the title "Thoughts and Hopes." We are extremely pleased to have received contributions from both Chinese and Japanese individuals. We are now publishing the first four articles, namely those by (1) Mr. Bodo, (2) Mr. Akahoshi Tamemitsu, (3) Mr. Wu Kaisheng, and (4) Mr. Li Quanshi. We would like to express our gratitude to the authors.

—Editor's Note

Article 1: Bodo

The Shanghai International Settlement was a key port for Anglo-American aggression against China. What kind of impression it gave the Chinese people over the past century, and how Chinese people and patriots planned to recover it with painstaking efforts, need not be elaborated upon. In short, once this stronghold, which they relied on, is returned, China's sovereignty will be complete, which is indeed a cause for celebration. It is important to be wary of recklessly speculating on the Japanese side's intention to return the concessions or of harboring excessive concern about the international situation. This war has reached a point of no return and is tied to the survival of the nation. Past peace conferences will not be repeated. Everything will depend on victory, and this war must be won. Victory is now being achieved step by step. The Chongqing side has long lost its reason to stubbornly resist the war due to these new facts. It is puzzling why they are still resisting Japan for the sake of peace!

What I most fervently hope for is the economy of Shanghai after the return of the concessions. If the return of the concessions is used as an opportunity to pursue and protect one's own interests, disregarding national prestige and the welfare of the people, it should be unanimously condemned by the Chinese people. It would also undermine credibility with friendly nations and ultimately benefit the enemy. While celebrating the return of the concessions, I secretly hope that the Shanghai concessions, which have long been under the influence of British and American powers, will redouble their efforts and achieve several times the development, transforming it into a region where people from all nations can live and work in peace and contentment, once it is returned to Chinese rule.

Looking back, Britain launched the Opium War against China a century ago, culminating in the forced signing of the Treaty of Nanjing. This treaty was the beginning of the infringement upon China's territorial sovereignty. It was followed by the cession of Hong Kong Island, the opening of Shanghai and other five ports for trade, and the establishment of concessions, which led to China's subjugation to foreign powers. This was the root cause. Over the next century, various movements arose in China, such as the Boxer Rebellion, the Reform Movement led by Kang Youwei and Liang Qichao, the Xinhai Revolution, and Dr. Sun Yat-sen's Pan-Asianism. All of them firmly advocated overthrowing imperialism and abolishing unequal treaties. In the subsequent National Revolution, this advocacy was even more intense, and it served as a rallying cry for the rise of southern China, ultimately unifying the country. This was an unprecedented event in Chinese history. Unfortunately, as the years passed, the National Government gradually erased its original advocacy and willingly submitted to the protection of British and American imperialism, which led to the Sino-Japanese Incident.

When the Sino-Japanese Incident occurred, the anti-Japanese faction supporting Chiang Kai-shek shouted for the preservation of territorial sovereignty and the independence of the nation, stubbornly resisting Japan to this day. As a result, vast territories in North China, Central China, and South China have been lost, and no cultural and industrial areas remain. They can only flee to the frontier and remain in Sichuan to survive. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the so-called Chongqing regime lost its reason for existence and its rationale for resisting Japan. Their resistance can no longer be said to be for the protection of China's territory and nation, but has become an appendage of Britain and the United States, ultimately sacrificing itself for their interests. On the other hand, Japan has swept away British and American forces from China and other regions of Greater East Asia, where they had been entrenched for nearly a century, and is looking forward to the awakening and rise of the East Asian nations to jointly achieve the goal of this war. The Nanjing National Government, in order to implement the spirit of living and dying together, and to achieve sincere cooperation with Japan, resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States. All of this is inevitable and justified. In addition, Japan, in order to share the responsibility of jointly defending East Asia, and to assist in China's autonomy and independence, and to make it more prosperous, returned the Japanese exclusive concessions in the North and South and the Beijing Legation Quarter and the Xiamen Gulangyu Concession one by one. Now, the most advanced bridgehead of British and American aggression against our East Asia, namely the Shanghai International Settlement, has also been officially returned on August 1, which also shows Japan's sincerity in Sino-Japanese relations.

Article 2: Akahoshi Tamemitsu

On January 9 of this year, when the National Government declared its participation in the war, the Japanese government announced on the same day the return of the Shanghai International Settlement. After half a year, on June 30, detailed agreements were announced, and preparations for the transfer were carried out between the Municipal Government and the Public Works Bureau. It has been decided that on August 1, the International Settlement will be taken back by the National Government, truly restoring it to Chinese sovereignty. Furthermore, the French government also declared on February 23 of this year that it would relinquish its privileges in China and implement the return of the three French exclusive concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Subsequently, on July 21, the Chinese and French authorities decided on the detailed terms for the return of the Shanghai French Concession, and it was decided that the National Government would take it back on July 30. Considering that a century ago, the Opium War led to the conclusion of the Treaty of Nanjing, which gave rise to the British and American base for exploiting China—the International Settlement—and the French Concession, which France obtained in 1849 based on the Sino-French Treaty by imitating the British and Americans, these will no longer exist within Chinese territory. From August 1, a new municipal administration will be implemented under the sovereignty of the National Government. This glory is the result of the four hundred million Chinese people's efforts to realize this long-cherished wish by enduring hardship and humiliation, sweeping away a century of shame from China, and restoring China's complete independence. This is truly a joyous event of the century. It adds a glorious page to China's four thousand years of history. For example, when parents lose a beloved child, only parents can know the sorrow. Only Japanese people who have suffered from foreign extraterritoriality and land leases can understand the joy of the Chinese people today. Even I, the author, feel "extremely happy" and cannot help but feel infinite gratitude and excitement in my heart.

The China Incident occurred due to misunderstandings between China and Japan, which is certainly unfortunate for both countries and for East Asia as a whole. Both China and Japan must bear the responsibility for this misunderstanding. However, the misunderstanding has been dispelled between China and Japan after the Konoe Statement and Chairman Wang's response to the Konoe Statement's Yan telegram. This misunderstanding eliminated the reason for China's resistance against Japan. Subsequently, Chairman Wang advocated and formed a relationship based on the idea of ​​common existence and common death, with equality and mutual benefit between China and Japan. The Japanese National Government participated in the Greater East Asia War, taking Britain and the United States as enemies, and allied with Japan to fight together for the liberation of East Asia. However, the Chongqing regime still relies on Britain and the United States, continuing its unreasonable resistance. In short, this contradiction is because the Chongqing regime is located in the interior of Sichuan, and Japan's true intentions cannot be conveyed. There is no opportunity to face the new situation in which China and Japan are connected to morality. Therefore, it is still misunderstood. Chairman Wang is Chinese, and Chiang Kai-shek is also Chinese. Both are from Eastern morality. One day, this misunderstanding will also disappear. It is believed that on this day, both Nanjing and Chongqing will treat this joyous event of the century for China, no, it must be a joyous event for the entire East Asia. From the perspective of Japanese feelings, I cannot help but express my deep sympathy for this great event in Chinese history, namely the so-called recovery of the concessions, which occurred at the most unfortunate time for China. This is because I have a deep understanding of his joy, not as someone else's business, but as my own business and rejoice.

Recently, I saw a lot of writing about new policies toward China. This is really a mistake of true policy. The return of concessions and the abolition of extraterritorial rights were decided as early as the Konoe Statement. This can be considered the basic policy of Japan's true policy toward China. Therefore, the new policy should be called the true policy. According to the three principles of Konoe, it is the most obvious expression of Japan's true policy toward China. Understanding the so-called sacred decree of the Eight Corners of the World is the belief and concept of the Japanese people. Today, it can be said that we have reached the opportunity to specifically implement its policies. In the past, Japan had to confront the British and American forces in order to protect East Asia. When Britain and the United States invaded China and East Asia became active, Japan's national power had not yet reached the youth stage. Instead of being unable to use force to resist these powerful countries, it is better to cultivate its own national power and reserve it for future use. Due to the need to confront the British and American forces, the means of cultivating national power is of course. If the great powers acquired concessions in China, Japan would naturally want them too. This means of confrontation by Japan is outwardly taking the form of aggression, and in fact it should frankly admit that it contains the content of aggression against China. However, the purpose has always been to confront Britain and the United States. It is nothing more than a means to enhance its own national power, and its essence is very different from that of Britain and the United States. However, China's misunderstanding of Japan arose from this, which is undeniable. The growth of Japan's national power led to war with Britain and the United States. Now Japan and its allies are devoting all their national power to the liberation of East Asia and the establishment of the East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere, and are advancing toward the completion of the Greater East Asia War. The power of Britain and the United States in East Asia has been destroyed. Now Japan has been able to sweep away the opposing forces of Britain and the United States in China. Moreover, Japan has reached the prime of its national power. It does not need to imitate the piracy of the British and Americans in occupying concessions. Even for the occupied areas of Burma and the Philippines, which the loyal Japanese soldiers exchanged for blood, it declared its assistance to its independence in the status of friendly countries. This is the most powerful proof.

Japan's policy toward China, to put it realistically, is a policy toward Britain and the United States. Compared with the past policy toward China, the goal has been completely transformed due to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and it is rushing toward the real goal. Therefore, the policy toward China has been reduced from the means of confronting Britain and the United States to Japan's original moral policy. This is a natural result. Japan's original way is to restore the new policy toward China. The return of concessions, which has the greatest significance, is the first step in its concrete realization. The abolition of extraterritorial rights is also of course. Only in this way can it be regarded as the original face of Japan's true policy toward China, in which there is no strategy, no plan, and no intention to plan for oneself. China's recovery of this concession, Japan has no conditions or requirements for the National Government. The reason why it is resolutely implemented is nothing more than to express the original face of Japan's true policy toward China. However, there is still a little regret that this opportunity happened to be at a time when the Greater East Asia War was more intense. I hope that everyone will not be misled by the enemy's counter-propaganda that provokes relations between China and Japan, and distort the judgment of Japan's true intentions, and insults the efforts of the 400 million Chinese people for many years. Japan's true policy toward China, from the abstract theory to the realization stage today, people who have only seen and heard Japan's policy toward China in the past, I am afraid that no one will believe it; it has developed so fast, perhaps some Japanese people will doubt it. Perhaps it is Japan's policy of retreat, or it may be a policy of giving up the name in exchange for profit. These are all critical misunderstandings. We must know that Japan is now independent and can win the Greater East Asia War, possessing abundant combat power and having the determination of iron and stone. This fact has been repeatedly explained by the leaders of Japan, and there are concrete facts to prove it. In any part, there is absolutely no need to express a policy of retreat. The purpose is still to ensure the sovereignty, independence, and territorial integrity of the National Government, and to eliminate the concessions and extraterritorial rights that have hindered its national strength and domestic unity, so as to help it strengthen itself and achieve the purpose of participating in the war. The Japanese government has overcome all difficulties and expressed this true policy toward China with facts. This is a major test for China and the Chinese people. The way China and the Chinese people respond to this sincerity with a Japanese attitude can be regarded as a major key to maintaining Sino-Japanese relations in the future.

I am neither an archaeologist nor a lover of statistics, and because I am too busy with my affairs. So I don't want to collect any writing materials from ancient books, I just write this article as a reflection of what I thought about in advance. Neither intentional nor malicious, I will leave it here. (Translated by Yunpeng)

Article 3: Wu Kaisheng

Since our country was tempted by British and American imperialism and implemented the Open Door Policy, the national power has declined day by day. Especially after the defeat in the Sino-British Opium War in 1843, Britain, the United States and other countries successively imposed various unequal treaties on our country, making our bright and great history stained with mottled shameful bloodstains, and the vast territory was dotted with the nests of great powers invading our country's sovereignty—concessions. The poison has lasted for a hundred years, causing our country to become a semi-colony.

Seeing that the existence of the abnormal concession system is a huge disaster that invades our country's sovereignty and hinders the survival and development of the nation, the founding father Sun Yat-sen had long been determined to abolish unequal treaties in order to seek China's freedom and liberation. After the Revolution of 1911 was completed, the Manchu Qing Dynasty was overthrown and the Republic of China was established. However, British and American imperialism still used some exiled politicians and remnants of warlords to take advantage of the situation, using the concessions as a talisman, creating troubles, harming the country and the people, and doing all kinds of evil. For thirty years, internal strife has been frequent, and the country is almost not a country. Although people with lofty ideals in the country have repeatedly thought about working hard to recover the concessions, they have failed to achieve their goals due to the obstruction of Britain and the United States.

Since the National Government declared its participation in the Greater East Asia War on January 9 this year, the friendly country Japan first declared its abolition of extraterritorial rights in China with a spirit of morality, and successively returned the Japanese-exclusive concessions in various places to the National Government. This sincere expression has deeply moved people all over the country. Later, the French government also did not give way, and automatically declared on February 23 that it would return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights. On March 29 this year, it exchanged notes with our Ministry of Foreign Affairs to abandon administrative power in the Beijing Legation District. On April 8 this year, they exchanged notes on abandoning the administrative power of the Gulangyu Public Concession, and on May 18 this year, they signed an agreement on the implementation details of the return of the administrative power of the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangdong, and officially took over on June 5. On June 30, after China and Japan signed the return of the Shanghai Public Concession, at the same time, representatives of China and France, under the mediation of friendly countries, devoted themselves to the return of the Shanghai French Concession. After repeated consultations and the best efforts of friendly countries, it was successfully completed and officially signed in the capital on July 22.

It was decided to hold the handover ceremony on July 30. This move and the recovery of the Public Concession can be realized within the same period, which makes the people of the whole country feel infinitely gratified and cheer for the future of China's liberation. At this time of the recovery of the concessions, we cherish the struggle of the revolutionary martyrs and look forward to the future of the free and liberated new China, and we have deep feelings. Now we will briefly express our thoughts and hopes, and we should encourage each other with the people of the country.

(1) After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States have been defeated, but the poison planted by Britain and the United States in their minds has not been completely eliminated. Because the Shanghai Concession is the most deeply rooted base of British and American toxins, this time the authorities will take over the Public Concession, which is a thorough elimination of the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States. From now on, the place where the poisons and dirt are hidden will be washed clean, and the original face of our Chinese territory will be restored. The wrong concept of blindly believing in Britain and the United States will also become a great psychology of relying on our own government.

(2) The wise measures of the French government were indeed inspired by the moral spirit of the friendly country Japan, but their expression of goodwill was based on mutual understanding between the two countries. During this war, China and France were both countries deceived by Britain and the United States, so China has a special and deep sympathy for the French experience. We are very grateful for France's sincere friendship with our country. After the return of the Shanghai French Concession, the moral relationship between China and France will inevitably enter a new stage and become more and more friendly, which is beyond doubt.

(3) The friendly country Japan's sincerity in assisting us this time can be foreseen in Ambassador Gu's recent speech on the "Realization of the True Policy toward China" at the welcome meeting of the Chinese National Diplomacy Promotion Association. We should strive forward. We must know that China will not obtain a truly independent and free status as long as there is a concession in China. Thinking that Shanghai after the recovery of the concession will surely become a center for Sino-Japanese cooperation to defeat British and American imperialism, the so-called international city will never have the shadow of Britain and the United States, but only the glory of the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity and Co-enjoyment. The Chinese territory will forever become a free paradise. In order to repay the friendly country's sincerity in assisting our country's independence and liberation, the whole country should unite and cooperate closely with the friendly country to jointly complete the Greater East Asia War. Only the overall victory of the Greater East Asia War can liberate the entire East Asian nation and enable them to enjoy a peaceful and happy life forever.

Shanghai occupies an important position in both China and the international community. It is the economic center of China. Therefore, the development of domestic politics, culture, etc. is deeply affected by it. It is also an international city, which is a arena for international competition. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the old view has been changed, which has a great impact on international audio-visual. Its benefits to our country's sovereignty are also very great. A hundred years of long-cherished wish has been realized in one day. It all depends on the Supreme Leader Chairman Wang's lofty personality and arduous struggle, so that he can win the sympathy of friendly countries and achieve the great cause of revival. The author has four hopes for the future:

(1) Expand municipal institutions and unify administrative efficiency. —In the past, due to the existence of the abnormal concession system, the country's sovereignty was often exercised in the concession. Shanghai became a "country within a country." Not only were administrative, judicial, and military affairs not subject to orders from the central government, but also municipal affairs such as police and taxation were established separately. Now all the concessions in the country have been recovered, and the sovereignty is independent and the territory is complete. Shanghai is one of the major cities in East Asia and a bond of the Co-prosperity Sphere. In the future, the municipal facilities will inevitably be greatly rectified. Not only will the institutions be expanded and the powers increased, but also the personnel issues must be carefully selected. From now on, we should follow the central government's policies and actively build a new "Greater Shanghai" city. As Foreign Minister Chu said: "The Chinese government will do its best to develop it into a city that the world admires." This is not only my personal hope, but also the hope of the people of the whole country.

(2) Stabilize people's livelihood and suppress prices. —Shanghai is located on the front line of the rear of the Greater East Asia War. It should implement the wartime system, and stabilizing people's livelihood is also one of the important measures of the wartime system. Before the official recovery of the concessions, Shanghai's prices soared again. If this continues, it will have a great impact on the psychology of the people, and indirectly have a considerable hindrance to the country's administration. Although the authorities have tried their best to investigate the factors of hoarding and hoarding, and strictly punish unscrupulous merchants and suppress prices, the effect of treatment is not great. Now that the concessions have been recovered and a new municipality has been established, I hope that the authorities will deeply understand the people's livelihood and study the fundamental measures to stabilize the people's livelihood, such as improving the supply system, increasing production, thoroughly eliminating the practice of hoarding and speculation, and actively cracking down on rumors that disturb people's minds. Once the wind of speculation is curbed, prices will naturally be stabilized, and residents will be able to live and work in peace, and their trust in the government will be strengthened. This is an inevitable trend.

(3) Rectify customs and advocate thrift. —Shanghai residents have always been fascinated by "Westernization" and advocate luxury. In this time of war, thrift should be advocated. After the recovery of the concessions, the poisoned thoughts of Britain and the United States will be completely eliminated, and the New National Movement will become the creed of life worshiped by the people. Public officials must develop a spirit of integrity and dedication to public service, and work hard. All false and extravagant entertainment can be saved. The common people should also advocate thrift and simplicity, have a spirit of self-reproach, and work hard in their respective positions. Reduce all unnecessary social interactions at ordinary times. The new Greater Shanghai must become a model city for the universal implementation of the New National Movement.

(4) Establish public security and strive for construction. —The Baojia system organized by the former Public Concession and the French Concession was indeed a long-term strategy to maintain public security. Now that the concessions have been recovered. Municipal facilities have also been reformed, and the Baojia system is very admirable, but it still needs to be improved. I deeply hope that the police authorities responsible for ensuring public security in the future must know that Shanghai's position is very important to both China and the international community. The establishment of public security at ordinary times is one of the important issues after the takeover of the concessions. I deeply hope that the people and the authorities will cooperate to maintain it. With the establishment of public security and the stability of people's livelihood, we can then immerse ourselves in productive work. It is expected that the full recovery of the concessions this time will have a greater development. I deeply hope that the whole country will unite as one, under the leadership of Chairman Wang, we will work harder, cooperate with the allied countries to move forward, and complete the historical mission of restoring China and defending East Asia, so as not to disappoint the kindness of the allied countries to us. All my compatriots should encourage each other.

Article 4: Li Quanshi

On August 29, 1842, China and Britain signed the Treaty of Nanjing, ending the Opium War. The treaty stipulated that five ports would be opened for trade, and the Shanghai Concession began at that time. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War the year before last, the British and American forces have been driven out of the Far East. Today, we are grateful to friendly countries for completely returning the Shanghai Concession to Chinese administration in terms of jurisprudence, 100 full years minus 28 days from its legal beginning, which is really worthy of special writing and special celebration.

Some say that the return of the Shanghai International Settlement and other settlements in North China and South China by friendly countries is nothing more than being generous with other people's property; but then, a few months ago, the British and American governments also stated to Chongqing that they would abolish extraterritorial rights and cancel the concessions along the rivers and coasts in China. Isn't this also being generous with other people's property? In short, the world situation has evolved to the current stage, and whether friendly or hostile, they have to change their plans in order to win back public opinion, and help the unprecedented war end in their own country's favor. Therefore, no matter what changes there will be in the world situation in the future, the concessions in various parts of China—including the Shanghai Concession—will permanently remain in the arms of the motherland, and there will no longer be any danger of being seized by the clutches of imperialist countries again. This is what the reporter dares to assert.

At this time when the last bastion of the concession system—the Shanghai International Settlement and the French Concession—is being dismantled under the heavy pressure of the times, the reporter, as one of hundreds of millions of Chinese people, cannot help but want to float a big white with the people.

After the celebration, I hope for it. First, I hope that the Rong country's administrative authorities will manage the concessions with honesty and dedication to the public, so that they will not only live up to the expectations of friendly countries, but also provide a clear solution to the pessimists, cynics, and even schadenfreudeists among the Chinese people. The gifts sent by friendly countries will not only not be wasted and trampled on, but will also be icing on the cake and strive for excellence. Second, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession, that is, the last concession, is recovered, China's internal strife will not be as frequent as it has been in the past few decades, so that military and political figures who oppose the central government will no longer have a safe source of conspiracy. Third, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession is returned, the people of Shanghai will no longer be "new Jews," who only know how to protect their own lives and interests, speculate and take chances, regardless of the outcome of the country's economy and people's livelihood, and resolutely assume the responsibilities assigned to us by this great era. With a clean heart, we will change and become "new Chinese," and restore our national self-esteem that has been lost for more than a hundred years. Fourth, I hope that after the Shanghai Concession is recovered, the national floating capital will no longer be concentrated in Shanghai, and the national industry will not tend to gather in Shanghai. There must be a rational plan for the decentralization of industry throughout the country, but Shanghai's position as the second trading port in East Asia, with its superior geographical location, may always be maintained and not easily be taken by other ports. Fifth, after the Shanghai Concession is recovered, the taxation power of our country's central government can freely enter and exit the concessions where tax evaders gather. Then, direct capacity taxes such as land value tax, land appreciation tax, income tax, inheritance tax, and excessive profit tax during extraordinary periods (according to the special name of excessive profit during extraordinary periods, that is, war profiteering or national disaster wealth. After national disaster wealth is made, a large amount of tax must be paid, so it is better not to make national disaster wealth, because this tax has a great effect on suppressing the psychology of illegal merchants who want to make national disaster wealth at will.) and other taxes will be implemented in Shanghai. Not only will the national government's finances gain a new force, but after taxation, it will be able to recover part of the currency and stabilize prices to a considerable extent. Hope is the mother of facts. I hope that the above five hopes will be realized soon to comfort the millions of Shanghai citizens and the hundreds of millions of people across the country.

### Some Opinions on the Return of Concessions

— Yoshida Tosuke

Speaking Honestly

Recently, many Japanese have asked me, how are the general Chinese people rejoicing over the return of concessions this time? Answering this inquiry is a difficult matter. Because to answer this inquiry correctly, one must write several large books. Of course, some Chinese, especially those who can think about the political significance of the return of concessions, can immediately answer this inquiry by saying that the return of concessions is the first step in the liberation of China and the foundation of peace in East Asia. But it is not permissible to think that all the Chinese in Shanghai are happy about the return of concessions just after hearing these people's words. Those who have no time or money to participate in politics—in fact, most of the population of Shanghai is composed of such people—before understanding the political significance of the return of concessions, they first consider the impact of the return of concessions on their own lives. Therefore, in the eyes of such people, what will be the general price of rice after the return of concessions? Or will the rationed rice be reduced compared to now? This question is more important than the political significance of the return of concessions to the future of Greater East Asia. Whether these people like the return of concessions depends on the quality of concession administration after the return of concessions. If the concession administration after the return of concessions is good, then everyone except the Chongqing faction of Chinese in the concessions will surely be overjoyed and happy about the return of concessions. However, if the concession administration tends to deteriorate after the return of concessions, then even if the ideals and purposes of the return of concessions are ever so lofty, most of the Chinese in the concessions will be indifferent. Therefore, I think it is still too early to raise the question of whether people like the return of concessions.

Let's not talk about practical problems for the time being, but only from a theoretical point of view. Of course, the return of concessions should be something to be happy about from the Chinese standpoint. However, in the current situation, this is ultimately a "should be" Sollen question, and not a "is" Sein question. Since this is the case, where exactly does the political significance of the return of concessions lie? I think that the return of concessions is an expression of Japan's intention to rapidly achieve the ideal of "should be" from the backward reality. Whether the National Government is better at handling concession administration than before at this stage is, to be honest, truly a question. Nevertheless, Japan is handing over the administration of Shanghai, the central city of the geographically Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, to the National Government. This is a policy implemented by Japan based on its political beliefs about China. Japan hopes to rapidly bring reality in line with ideals by satisfying Chinese ideals that are several steps ahead of the original Chinese reality.

Whether the National Government can rapidly bring reality in line with ideals should be the National Government's greatest task. Shanghai is different from Nanjing, and Shanghai is international. The residents of Shanghai include British and American imperialists, as well as people of fifty-three countries from all over the world mixed together. To put it bluntly, the residents of Shanghai are reckless. To put it more nicely, they are like a crowd of knights galloping in the midst of a thousand troops and ten thousand horses. If the National Government can make this group of Shanghai residents sincerely submit, it can prove its administrative ability in front of the world. Chen Youren once said: "What Shanghai thinks today, the whole of China will think tomorrow." If the Nanjing government can convince the Shanghai people today, then it will not be difficult to convince the people of the whole of China tomorrow, I think. Conversely, if the Nanjing government fails in its administration of Shanghai, its failure will be a failure in front of the world. At the same time, it will also be a major blow to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, Japan cannot remain silent and say coolly, "It has nothing to do with me." From this point of view, the return of the Shanghai concessions, in a sense, can also be said to be a serious test imposed on the National Government. But this is not simply a test for the National Government, but also a serious test imposed on the citizens of Shanghai, because politics is a relative relationship between the government and the people. Good politics is impossible without the good assistance of the people. Furthermore, it is also a serious test imposed on Japan, because from the perspective of the reality of Shanghai, good politics in Shanghai is impossible without the good assistance of Japan. From this standpoint, I hope everyone will pay attention to the following three tendencies that should not exist.

First, let's talk about a tendency within the National Government. It is said that some people in the Nanjing government are so excited about the return of the Shanghai concessions that they are overjoyed, just like a student who has passed the entrance examination receiving a notification of passing the entrance examination. However, they usually dislike exams very much. Passing an exam is because they know that the entrance examination is a difficult hurdle that can only be passed through extraordinary hard work. Those who do not know that the entrance examination is a difficult hurdle and think that it can be passed without hard work will mostly fail. Today, people in the National Government must know that the concession administration after the return of concessions is a major hurdle that can only be passed through the National Government's extraordinary hard work. The return of concessions is the entrance examination for the National Government. But it is truly regrettable to only know how to be happy about the return of concessions and not know how to face this major event with a tragic determination. The exam has not yet been passed, and now they are already happy, which is inevitably too optimistic. I hope they should have this awareness.

Second, let's talk about a tendency in some Japanese, namely the extreme left interpretation of the so-called "new policy." Strictly speaking, the so-called "new policy" is by no means that everything can be left alone after handing everything over to China. The result of the return of concessions to China is that the administrative power of the concessions is transferred to the National Government. Therefore, the quality of the concession administration is China's own business. If there are people in Japan who think this way, they completely do not understand the meaning of the return of concessions. Regarding whether the future concession administration can be good, if there is no sufficient insight, but only relying on the ideal of returning it to the National Government, even if the National Government is happy, the Shanghai citizens will not be happy in the end. Of course, Japan foresaw the possibility of full development of Shanghai's administration under the jurisdiction of the National Government after the return of concessions, and that is why it wanted to do this. Therefore, in fact, when Shanghai's administration does not proceed smoothly, Japan also has a great responsibility. Shanghai is the frontline of the ideological war against Chongqing. If Shanghai's administration is not implemented well and the lives of Shanghai citizens become more difficult, it will become an excuse for Chongqing and the United States and Britain to attack. Therefore, even though Japan says it is returning the concessions to the National Government, it still needs to pay close attention to Shanghai's administration as a guardian, especially to the material distribution agencies (the most important of which is household rice) and inspection agencies that have a significant impact on the actual lives of citizens. Here I want to say frankly that there is a certain degree of fear among Shanghai citizens about the future police agencies. Shanghai citizens still remember very clearly that not long ago, the "second type of pro-Japanese" gang hid in the name of special police in Huxi and committed many heinous crimes. They arrested people for money, which was really a kind of political kidnapping. Although these political kidnapping bandits were severely punished by law, Shanghai citizens still believe that there are remnants of such scum and that they will come back to Shanghai and put on a good show of doing evil again, which is really "unbearable." Therefore, within the Shanghai police agencies, there should no longer be people who cause Shanghai citizens to have the terror of expecting political kidnapping.

Third, now I will describe a tendency among Shanghai citizens. In certain situations, people sometimes have to call a stag a horse. Biologists call it "individual preservation instinct," and the Chinese euphemistically call it "self-preservation tactics," but the general Shanghai citizens' situation of calling a stag a horse seems to be too much. Even regarding the feelings about the return of concessions, it is really not easy to judge which part heard from the mouths of Shanghai citizens is a sincere expression and which part is a perfunctory remark of "self-preservation tactics." In this respect, I think it is indeed difficult for those in power to handle. Therefore, if they do not reveal their true feelings and work together with those in power, there will be no good politics in Shanghai. The place most directly affected by the return of concessions is the lives of Shanghai citizens. If Shanghai citizens hold the same negative views on politics as always, the future of concession administration will never be simply bright. When the future concession administration becomes a dark scene, part of the responsibility will fall on the Shanghai citizens who are negligent in assisting. Therefore, Shanghai citizens should reduce the attitude of calling a stag a horse and restore a little the attitude of saying horse is horse and stag is stag. I hope that Shanghai citizens will often offer the government their true feelings and words. Without the assistance of Shanghai citizens, the Shanghai administration after the return of concessions will never grow smoothly. Will Shanghai develop into a world-famous metropolis in China? Or will it quickly wither and decline like a rubber boat with its mooring rope untied? This depends on the attitude of Shanghai citizens towards politics. It is a cowardly act for Shanghai citizens to not provide any assistance to the concession administration and only know how to criticize the administrators who have messed up the concession administration.

Shanghai citizens should take this opportunity to organize public opinion organs, that is, for the sake of the smooth development of Shanghai's administration, they should also actively provide public opinion to the authorities.

The above is my opinion on the return of concessions. Simply exploring the significance of the return of concessions in history can be said to be incompatible with the reality of the extremely fierce Greater East Asia War. Therefore, simply being intoxicated with happy words such as "The concessions have been returned, thank God" will not easily solve the various countless difficult problems after the return of concessions. At the same time, I think it is also unfair to the urgent emotions of the three million citizens who are worried about their future lives after the return of concessions. Before I talk about celebrating the return of concessions, let me remind everyone that this is the most difficult entrance exam imposed on the people of China and Japan. (Han)

### Receiving the Shanghai Concessions and Future Operation

— Matsuda Tsuneo

(1) The National Government's reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement is scheduled to be realized on August 1. For a hundred years, the Shanghai International Settlement, which was occupied by the British and Americans as a stronghold of the policy of colonizing China, is truly a joyous event for China, Japan, and the entire East Asia.

The National Government's restoration of sovereignty over Shanghai and its control over Shanghai's politics and economy will undoubtedly rapidly enrich and strengthen the National Government's political power in the future. Before the China Incident, the reason why the Chiang regime was able to rapidly become strong was that Chiang Kai-shek abandoned the so-called policy of alliance with the Soviet Union and tolerance of the Communists in the Republic of China in 1927 and implemented a 180-degree turnaround in Shanghai on April 12, compromising with the wealthy class in Shanghai. In fact, most of China's wealth, centered on the Zhejiang financial group, is concentrated in Shanghai, accounting for about 50% of China's foreign trade. The Shanghai concessions enjoyed a special political status, "in China but not owned by China."

For about five years from the China Incident to the Greater East Asia War, this particularity was used by the British and American policy of aiding Chiang. The Shanghai concessions became a stronghold for resisting Japan, and they often expressed blatant hostility towards Japan. However, after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the situation changed completely. The rights and interests of the British and Americans were completely taken over and managed by the Japanese army. The strongholds for invading East Asia were all destroyed, and the Shanghai economy, which depended on British and American capital, was cut off from British and American influence. The Shanghai financial circles, which had always taken a cold and ambiguous attitude towards the peace movement of the National Government, could not but change their views on the new situation in Greater East Asia from the perspective of self-interest. On January 9 of this year, after the National Government's participation in the war and Japan's unfolding of the new policy towards China, the National Commercial Control Association was organized. Twenty Shanghai financial giants served as directors and supervisors of the association. This is proof of the Shanghai financial circles' change of attitude and their assistance in the National Government's policies. Since the Japanese army entered the concessions and made the security police of the concessions under the guidance of the Japanese side, there have been Baojia organizations among the Chinese residents of the concessions, and they have achieved good results. Previously, they were the "loose sand" mentioned by Mr. Sun Yat-sen, and they lived in what could be called a state of anarchy. It cannot be said that living this kind of orderly and organized life now is an unexpected change.

(2) Here, we need to look back at the origin of the Shanghai concessions' prosperity before today, with the special character of "in China but owned by China."

Regarding the prosperity of Shanghai, the reports of Li Que Te and Fei Da Mu pointed out:

"The concentration of wealth and commercial activity in the concessions is due to the fact that the concessions are a safe island, free from external harassment. Within their scope, order is maintained, and individual rights and property rights are respected and protected."

Indeed, the Shanghai concessions were protected by the navies of the countries concerned and the volunteer corps of the Municipal Council. They often maintained neutrality in the face of China's internal strife and refused to allow Chinese troops to enter the concessions. The Shanghai concessions were politically isolated from China itself because of this military force, and they were not affected by the political chaos and instability of China, avoiding the monopolistic control of Chinese warlords and factions. This matter hindered the integrity of China's sovereignty, and at the same time, the key to Shanghai's prosperity also lies in this.

However, the prosperity of Shanghai achieved in this way was by no means for China itself.

Those who benefited from Shanghai's prosperity were British and American capital and Chinese comprador capital that was subservient to British and American capital. Although China is an agricultural country, it is constantly plagued by chronic food shortages and cannot import foreign rice every year to supplement it. The biggest reason for this is of course the abandonment of China's own agricultural productivity, but at the same time, foreign agricultural products are dumped on China through the Shanghai market, and foreign industrial products and Chinese agricultural products are forcibly exchanged at unequal prices. The ruthless exploitation and aggression of British and American capitalism undoubtedly also hinders the development of Chinese agriculture.

Although there are suitable cotton-growing areas in North China and Central China, the Chinese textile industry in Shanghai does not rely on Chinese-produced cotton, but often relies on the import of American cotton and Indian cotton.

Similarly, China's flour millers have no relationship with wheat cultivation in the interior, but are inextricably linked to Australian wheat. In this way, British and American capitalism, which stepped in with the Shanghai concessions as its base, cut off the connection between Shanghai and the Chinese countryside, and exploited the Chinese economy through the Shanghai economy, making it a sacrifice for its colonial policy. The prosperity of the Shanghai concessions can be said to be built on the poverty of the entire China, and the more cunning Chinese comprador capital is only a running dog of British and American capital to enrich itself.

Therefore, if Shanghai prospers with the special character of "in China but not owned by China," it contains two meanings. First, the Shanghai concessions therefore often expressed how to protect themselves from the political corruption and chaos of China itself. Second, as a result, Britain and the United States used the Shanghai concessions as a base for invading China, trampling on China's sovereignty, and exploiting China's economy.

(3) The question here is how the National Government will operate Shanghai's politics and economy after restoring the administrative power of the Shanghai concessions. Chairman Wang once said: Because of the National Government's participation in the war, the task that China should bear is to "build the rear base." This is of course the fundamental principle in Shanghai's economy in the future. Shanghai is located at the mouth of the Yangtze River, which winds for more than three thousand miles and has a long history. Behind it is the most fertile land and densely populated river basin in China. No matter how you say it, this geographical situation is always Shanghai's greatest advantage. This advantage must be fully utilized.

In the context of the Chinese economy, in order to increase production, stabilize people's livelihoods, improve people's livelihoods, and maintain currency in order to achieve the effect of price countermeasures, it is difficult to solve the problem unless the circulation of goods is facilitated first. After the China Incident, the stagnation of industrial production in China, centered on Shanghai, and the consequent shortage of essential supplies for rural life and high prices, made the inland rural economy, which had always relied on industrial production in Shanghai, self-sufficient. The Shanghai economy and the inland economy showed a tendency to separate rapidly, which deepened the insecurity of people's lives. This is an undeniable fact. This has also contributed to the speculative nature of Chinese national capital concentrated in the Shanghai concessions, increased the evils of barter fever and hoarding, and stimulated price increases.

In order to open up this situation, Japan's new economic policy towards China first opened up and eased the economic blockade of the lower Yangtze River region. On March 16, all restrictions on the movement of goods by the local army were abolished. Except for the movement of some goods in and out of the Shanghai area, the movement of goods in the entire peaceful area has been liberalized, restoring the connection between Shanghai and the rural areas behind it. At the same time, based on the concept of so-called "division of labor and cooperation," the purchase and distribution of Chinese goods in Central China was entrusted to the Chinese side in order to promote its commercial activities. On the one hand, the return of various enemy properties, old and new, was continued to mobilize Shanghai's idle funds for production in the agricultural and industrial sectors, opening the way for the transformation and revival of Chinese national capital into production capital.

In addition to the above-mentioned new situation, the current reception of the administrative power of the Shanghai International Settlement has been added. The connection and cooperation between the National Government and the Shanghai economic circles is becoming closer. With Shanghai's economic power as its support, the National Government will be able to powerfully exert its political power, significantly promote the revival of the Chinese economy, and further contribute to China's cooperation in completing the Greater East Asia War.

(4) The future operation of Shanghai's politics and economy should naturally be implemented based on the fundamental requirement of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Here, first, we hope to not only cultivate Shanghai as the center of the Chinese economy, but also as the most important economic link in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Shanghai should not exist only for China. Building Greater East Asia is a new "China problem" and "Shanghai problem."

Dr. Sugimura Takeshi advocated making Shanghai the economic capital of East Asia in his book "Economic Status of Shanghai, China." Indeed, the future of Shanghai should be operated from the viewpoint of the overall economic concept of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the basis for reorganizing Shanghai's economy must lie here.

In the past, the structure of Shanghai's trade completely reflected the British and American capital's policy of exploiting China. The increase in the import of foreign cotton to foreign rice, foreign wheat, foreign coal, and tobacco, and the fact that China's industrial production cannot be increased without this excess of imports, and the importance of relying on remittances from overseas Chinese, these facts illustrate how the British and American exploitation policy has hindered the normal development of the Chinese economy and made the Shanghai economy take a distorted path.

With the progress of the China Incident, this dependence of Shanghai's trade on the British and Americans not only did not decrease, but increased, which shows how Shanghai was used by the British and Americans as a base for the British and American anti-Japanese hostile policy.

Now that Shanghai's dependence on the British and Americans has been eradicated from the root, there is no other way to revive it than to integrate it into the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Moreover, Shanghai's geographical location in Greater East Asia, with a vast area behind it as a production area for raw materials and a consumption area for goods, and its possession of various conditions that can serve as a cultivation base for light industry in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the fact that 20 million tons of ships enter and leave it every year, make Shanghai's future revival extremely promising.

Dr. Sugimura once pointed out: "Connecting Shanghai's industry with Southern resources is an important event that cannot be ignored in the economic plan of the entire East Asia."

He also said:

"If Shanghai is used as an economic base and the Southern economy is placed under the guidance of the Japanese side, then, whether in the intermittent development of the Chinese mainland or in enriching the economy of Manchuria, it is more advantageous than other places in terms of geographical advantages."

This also means that the future operation of Shanghai's politics and economy should not be left to the arbitrary control of the National Government. In other words, the National Government, based on the fundamental requirement of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, should expand the nature of Shanghai as a new international city under the guidance and cooperation of Japan. Chairman Wang keenly believes that the protection and revival of the entire East Asia is a prerequisite for the protection and revival of China. The independence of China's sovereignty, based on the fundamental requirements of a broad-area circle of politics, cannot but be subject to new regulations. This is a fundamental concept that the National Government cannot forget when operating Shanghai in the future.

(5) Second, we hope that the National Government will carefully implement various policies to transform Shanghai's national capital from idle funds into production capital. For example, Shanghai will regard itself as a huge source of wealth for the National Government in the future.

However, the National Government seems to never dare to be harsh and demand excessive taxes for financial reasons alone, so as to dry up Shanghai's economic power. Japan's opening of the economic blockade of the lower Yangtze River region and its attempt to smoothly exchange goods with Shanghai as the center are based on the so-called "

The following turns to the third edition

## Page 7

Transferred from the second edition of the concept of division of labor and cooperation" to promote the commercial production activities of Chinese national capital. If the National Government grasps Shanghai's political economy too hastily and makes the activities of Shanghai's capital shrink, it will cause a major obstacle to the revival of the Chinese economy itself and even to the construction of the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

Here, we also recall Fei Da Mu's remarks on the issue of returning the Shanghai concessions, saying that "The return of the concessions should not be implemented until the following conditions are met." He cited four conditions:

1. The state of the country should be improved to the point that the concessions no longer have to worry about being affected by internal strife and other external dangers.

2. The concept of "politics is more important than law" is deeply rooted in China and is actually manifested in Chinese society. Therefore, constitutional politics should be developed to the point that the National Government formulates an organizational law for the future self-governing concession politics and grants it permanent and complete regulations and guarantees that the rights granted by its organizational law are inviolable.

3. The political state of China should be improved to the point that the local autonomous organs enjoy complete independence and freedom within their own concessions, obey the orders of the National Government, but are not controlled by powerful political parties such as the current Kuomintang.

4. The operation of the representative organs should have sufficient experience so that the Chinese society within the concessions can be responsible for the concession politics.

Of course, this is the conclusion of Mr. Fei Da Mu more than ten years ago, and we do not fully adopt it today. But we should consider it in the future operation of Shanghai, and we cannot deny the truth of his words.

At the same time, the British and American character of the Shanghai financial circles and "Shanghai people" must also be reformed at this time. However, at the same time, they have no experience in material control and no psychological preparation. The instinct of Shanghai and Shanghai people translates "control" into the complete opposite of anarchic freedom, and "politics" into the completely opposite "artificial" combined "pseudo-character." However, the most important thing in Shanghai's reorganization in the future is "control," and the fundamental difficulty lies in this.

The Huazhong material control centered on the National Commercial Control Association is implemented on the basis of the self-governing organization of the guilds, which implies the direction of solving this problem. In the same sense in the future, we must also review the utilization of Shanghai Gangbang industry from a new perspective! The purpose is as urgent as sparks, but the method cannot but be detoured.

In short, the Shanghai re-organization problem can be said to be a central and extremely important task in building the economy of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The results of this are not only being paid attention to by various places in the Southern Circle, but also by the United States, Britain, and Chongqing.

The Chinese side should fully recognize what Japan expects and requires of Shanghai in the future. Wu Zhenxiu said frankly: "Since there is no precedent or experience in controlled economy in China, although the Chinese side is entrusted with the responsibility, it still hopes that Japan will assist in every way."

Japan's active guidance and cooperation should be fully accepted. (Translated by Song Hongxiang from "World Weekly Report" No. 1216 of the Dentsu News Agency)

### Tentative Suggestions for New Shanghai Municipal Facilities: A Letter of Recommendation from the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association to the Mayor

In order to recover the concessions, which is of utmost importance to the nation's interests and the people's welfare, the association has held public discussions and reached a consensus. We respectfully present the following key recommendations, hoping for your review. The recovery of the British and French concessions in Shanghai is truly a joyous occasion for the government and the people, a moment of celebration and jubilation. After the recovery, how should we grasp the key points and innovate? The government must have a grand plan to meet the people's expectations. Considering that even the wisest can make mistakes, the association, as a group residing outside the government, has experienced the hardships of the people and humbly presents what we have seen and heard to the Mayor.

Dividing Lines Between Old and New Laws

First, clear dividing lines should be established between old and new laws. All previous agreements, such as the Yangjingbang Regulations of Daoguang 25 (1845), the Council Regulations of Tongzhi 7 (1868), the Court Agreements established in the 19th and 20th years of the Republic of China (1930-1931), and other contracts signed between the local government and the concession authorities, should be declared null and void. Simultaneously, new laws, such as zoning regulations and tax collection methods, should be implemented. These should be submitted to the central government or issued by the city government in the shortest possible time. This will give the people a fresh perspective, and prosperity will naturally follow. It is advisable to establish a Law Compilation and Review Committee, composed of senior officials from various bureaus of the municipal government, to complete this task.

Ensuring Security and Communication

Second, security should be ensured and communication maintained. Police are responsible for maintaining order in normal times, with the assistance of local volunteer corps. In serious situations, military assistance should be sought, as is common practice. The local volunteer corps, though lacking in power and bravery, are full of vigor and can deter minor disturbances. By guiding them appropriately, they can be of daily use. Military assistance is indispensable, and reliance should be placed on friendly foreign troops for temporary deployment. With such coordination, like the limbs and fingers working together, more than half of the major security concerns will be addressed.

Unifying Revenue and Expenditure

Third, revenue and expenditure should be unified. The annual tax revenue from the concessions exceeds 300 million yuan (approximately 200 million from the Public Concession and an estimated but unreported amount of at least 100 million from the French Concession). However, the expenditures of both concessions have not been announced, and final accounts are available only a year later. Now that the separation between the Chinese and concession areas has been eliminated, and Shanghai has become a single unit, a unified budget should be compiled. However, the income from the Western and Southern Districts may be far less than that of the two concessions. Overly subsidizing one area at the expense of another would be unfair. Consideration should be given to increasing taxes in the Western and Southern Districts, specifically earmarked for police salary increases and not used for other purposes.

Reducing the Price of Essential Goods

Fourth, the price of essential goods should be reduced. People suffer from high prices. Imported goods and luxuries can be dispensed with, but necessities such as firewood, rice, oil, and salt cannot be lacking for even a day. The true purpose of government control is to stabilize prices, yet the tighter the control, the higher the prices rise. This paradoxical situation is truly incomprehensible. Every effort should be made, such as facilitating supply sources, expediting transportation, streamlining import and export procedures, and lowering tax rates. With the government's efforts, the people will have a chance to survive. This is not only related to the political system but also to the lifeline of the nation.

Respecting Public Opinion

Fifth, public opinion should be respected. Although public opinion is scattered among the common people, there must be organized bodies to collect it. Article 112 of the draft constitution promulgated on May 18, 1937, states, "A municipal council shall be established in the city, with councilors elected by the citizens' assembly." This follows Dr. Sun Yat-sen's teachings. Although it has not yet been implemented, it should be carried out as soon as possible when the concessions are recovered and the political system is renewed to build a foundation for construction. Furthermore, the restrictions on news censorship, publication control, and supervision of people's organizations, which are all reflections of public opinion, should be relaxed somewhat to gather the collective wisdom of the people. The above five points are fundamental and essential plans. Other aspects such as promoting industrial and commercial production, popularizing education and culture, and improving social customs rely on the Mayor's collective wisdom and long-term vision. We humbly offer these suggestions, hoping that they will be adopted and implemented, not only for the benefit of the region but also for the good of the nation. Respectfully submitted to Chen, the Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality.

### Old Shanghai Stories: Interviews with Four Elders

On this day of taking over the concessions, everyone is happily celebrating. Perhaps everything feels exciting. Recalling the fragments and trivial matters heard and seen about the concessions decades ago and writing them down to add to today's celebratory mood is not without significance. Therefore, we specially interviewed four elders who have lived in Shanghai for many years: Mr. Shen Xinqing, Mr. Lin Kanghou, Mr. Yuan Ludeng, and Mr. Gao Hanqing (in order of stroke count of their surnames) to recall old Shanghai stories. The four elders were extremely happy and recounted the past in detail. The notes are recorded as follows:

Mr. Shen Xinqing

I came to Shanghai in the eleventh year of Tongzhi (1872, when I was nine years old). I soon returned to my ancestral home in Jiading, but after a few months, I moved back to Shanghai. At that time, the means of transportation were like those in rural towns, with only handcarts and sedan chairs. Foreigners in Shanghai also used these for transportation. Soon, horse-drawn carriages and rickshaws appeared one after another. At that time, Xian'gua Street was the main thoroughfare for north-south traffic. People traveling west to the county town and the Little East Gate all passed through here. Crossing West Street, one could reach the Huangpu River to the east. Further south, one relied on the Yidu Ferry. To the north was the Shiliupu Wharf, especially the area near the Three-Story Building Wharf, which was the most bustling. Thousands of sand boats were often docked there, with masts crowding together. Warehouses were lined up, and opium dens, brothels, teahouses, and taverns were all present. Those arriving by waterway disembarked from the Huangpu River and had to pass through this street, making it an extremely prosperous area. Later, due to the government's lack of protection, ruffians caused all kinds of disturbances, and people moved elsewhere, causing the cloth surface to become desolate. Recalling the past, I suddenly feel a sense of vast changes.

The current Edward Road was formerly known as Yangjingbang, which ran from outside the Old North Gate to Rihui Port. There was a Sanmaoguan Bridge on the bank of the river, located at the intersection of Henan Road. The bridge was built over the river to facilitate transportation in the concession area. I heard my father say that during the Taiping Rebellion, the French helped Li Hongzhang reduce taxes in Sichuan, and the Sanmaoge Pavilion was destroyed in this battle. The French took this opportunity to expand the concession, which gave me a very negative impression of the French. Later, the river was filled in and roads were built, and this historically significant Sanmaoge Pavilion was buried and disappeared. In the first three years of the Republic of China (1912-1914), Yuan Shikai secretly plotted to become emperor. At that time, the strongest opposition came from the Kuomintang. They tried to eliminate party members. A member of the Hubei branch of the Kuomintang, Liu Tie, secretly manufactured bombs in the French Concession. He was mistakenly smoking a cigarette among the explosives, causing a fire. Liu Tie was also arrested as a result. Yuan Shikai sought to extradite and arrest political prisoners in the French Concession and ceded dozens of square miles of land from the Ten Pulps to Xujiahui as a condition for the extradition. His昏庸賣國, treasonous actions are evident from this. The current French Concession is actually a history of heartbreak for Mr. Liu Tie. Now, fortunately, the French Concession has been recovered by the national government, which is a great joy.

In the past, the uniforms of the French Concession police were laughable. In the summer, they wore melon-skin hats with red tassels tied to the back. They wore long gowns made of green bamboo cloth. In the winter, the melon-skin hats were replaced with Jiaozhou gold-rimmed felt hats, and the red tassels remained tied to the back. Their clothes, shoes, and socks were the same as in the summer, except that they wore a cloth棉袍 of the same color under the long gowns and a foreign overcoat over that. They carried an umbrella in their hands. Later, they changed to a sky-blue, collarless number uniform with sleeves more than two feet wide, similar to the old-fashioned mandarin jacket and the green jackets of the Green Gang. Ordinary shoes and socks were worn with no uniform pants, which the wearers could choose as they pleased. This kind of uniform was the same for all seasons and had no differences. Later, it was gradually reformed into the current uniform style, which can be said to be a multifaceted evolution.

The oldest Chinese newspaper in Shanghai was Shen Bao. Wang Tao's son-in-law, Qian Xinbo, was in charge of the editorial department of Shen Bao at that time. Wang Tao was influenced by the Taiping Rebellion and advocated revolution very strongly. His writing style was also strong. He often submitted articles to the newspaper. The most inspiring and widely recited sentences at that time were like: "The Three Emperors are not enough to be emperors, the Five Emperors are not enough to be emperors, only my Heavenly King, commands hundreds of thousands of elite soldiers, and slays the demons of eighteen provinces," etc. This shows Wang Tao's thoughts and boldness. He was eventually resented by the Qing court and fled to Hong Kong to run the newspaper. Later, he returned to Shanghai, and I still met him a few times. (Recorded by Chen Yunxi)

Mr. Lin Kanghou

A system similar to the current Baojia system (a system of collective responsibility and mutual surveillance) was also implemented in the past and was quite complete. Barriers were set up on every street and alley entrance. At night, all the barriers were closed. People entering and exiting had to be questioned first. As long as they were legitimate merchants, they could still pass through. Unlike now, when a lockdown is imposed, all traffic stops, and no one is allowed to pass. Moreover, the attitude during questioning was extremely kind and friendly. The current Baojia system is even more complete than before. However, during general martial law, it seems that some flexibility could be given to people with identification cards and those who have work missions, so that they do not have to waste time and affect their duties.

Shanghai was divided into four districts, with a total of seven city gates. Later, two more gates, the Little South Gate and the Little North Gate, were added. There was a mud city built between the current New World and the Great New Company, hence the name Mud City Bridge today. At that time, the area west of the New World was all rural farmland. Although there were also foreigners who bought land and built houses there, there were very few, so it was extremely desolate.

Regarding the organs for communicating public opinion, there were two in the past. One was the Municipal Council, and the other was the County Council. In the late Qing Dynasty, the Qing court vigorously promoted democracy and constitutionalism in order to win over the people's hearts. By the early years of the Republic of China, it had declined. I hope that after the recovery of the concessions, a truly representative body of public opinion can be established to bridge the gap between the authorities and the people. (Recorded by Chen Yunxi)

Mr. Gao Hanqing

I grew up in Hongkou. At that time, Hongkou was just a village in the suburbs of Shanghai. There were no wooden bridges across the Suzhou River. People traveled back and forth by ferry at various ferry crossings, such as the First Ferry, Second Ferry, and Third Ferry. At that time, the Suzhou River was wider than the current Huangpu River, and the Huangpu River was even wider than it is now. One could not see the opposite bank from Puxi to Pudong. In the past, both banks of the Suzhou River and the Huangpu River were sandy beaches, with reeds growing in between, which was very desolate.

Regarding transportation: Rickshaws only appeared about thirty years ago. Before that, there were only sedan chairs and horse-drawn carriages, and even those were very few. Only high-ranking officials such as daotais and county officials, as well as compradors of foreign firms, could afford to ride them. At that time, the Shanghai daotai had great power and was also in charge of foreign affairs and customs, and was also called "Customs Daotai." At that time, the most common vehicle was the "goat horn cart," which is now called a "wheelbarrow" and was used to carry people and goods. Because it was cheap, many people used it.

Regarding education: Before there were schools, there were only private schools. At that time, there was a Longmen Academy, which was run by the government and was very large in scale. Scholars gathered there to lecture and exchange ideas. This was the situation thirty-five years ago.

When I was seven or eight years old, there was a school in Chen Family Lane, about a mile past the Tilam Bridge in Hongkou's eastern countryside, more than four miles from my home. Every morning, I would bring food to school and return home in the evening. The education situation at that time was roughly like this.

Regarding roads: There was a road from the Waibaidu Bridge to the Shiliupu Wharf. At that time, there were also Great Road, Second Road, etc., but they were very short, only as long as the Bund to the Bowling Green. At that time, the roads were just leveled and widened mud roads with some gravel and coal cinders added.

Thirty or forty years ago, there was already a racetrack. At that time, there were also small residential houses and cemeteries inside. Every year during the Qingming Festival, people would bring offerings to the racetrack to sweep the tombs. Even now, there are still a few cemeteries that have not been moved, but you can no longer see people visiting the graves.

At that time, the Shanghai market was not very lively, about the same as the towns in the near suburbs of Shanghai today. Foreign shops were mostly on the Bund and near the Great Road, which were relatively lively. The market inside the city, such as the Nine Acres Field, Sanpailou, and Sipailou, was much better than in the concessions.

Regarding public utilities: I will briefly mention a few points. Shanghai had trams about twenty years ago. Public buses were five or six years later than trams. Telephones had already existed more than thirty years ago. Tap water had already existed fifty years ago, and the scale was very large. There have been no major changes to this day. At that time, gas was already available, but it was only used by large foreign businesses. After electric lights were available, gas was eliminated.

The beginning of Chinese trains was probably in Shanghai. Fifty years ago, the Shanghai to Wusong line was already open to traffic. The office in charge of train affairs was located in the Temple of the Queen of Heaven. However, at that time, the atmosphere was closed, and the public was very conservative. Coincidentally, an epidemic and famine occurred in Shanghai. Local gentry believed that the "iron dragon" destroyed the feng shui and brought disasters. They publicly requested the local officials at that time to prohibit the operation of trains, which finally caused the trains to stop operating for a period of time.

Regarding finance: At that time, the only places for silver transactions were money shops. Transactions in the market mostly used copper coins, Mexican silver dollars, and broken silver. Large transactions used silver ingots and money tickets—that is, today's bank notes. Copper coins were mostly one thousand coins per string, with nine hundred coins exchanging for one Mexican silver dollar. (Recorded by Yue Xiuliang)

Mr. Yuan Ludeng

In the twenty-fourth year of the Guangxu reign of the late Qing Dynasty (1898 AD), when I was nineteen years old, I came to Shanghai from Ningbo and entered St. John's College to study. That was more than forty years ago. Now I will briefly talk about the general situation at that time based on my memories:

At that time, Nanjing Road in Shanghai mostly consisted of ordinary Chinese-style houses, all the way from the New World to the Mud City Bridge. The roads near Nanjing Road, such as Jiujiang Road, Hankou Road, Sichuan Road, and Ningbo Road, had already been built, and there were already new-style buildings. Several roads to the west, such as Xinzha Road, Avenue Road, Connaught Road, and Hart Road, had roads but no houses. Only a few scattered洋房 houses in the格路 and安路 areas, and there were no Chinese residences yet. From the司非而路 to Caojiadu, there were only rural residences. Zhoujiazhai Road did not exist at that time.

The only public entertainment venues were Zhang Garden and Yuyuan Garden, but both of these had already been abandoned.

At that time, the market in the French Concession was only relatively lively in the area around the Big Self-Ringing Bell. There was nothing in its entirety. The Bund, Great World, and the market on Avenue Joffre and Rue Tenant de la Tour had not yet appeared.

At that time, the administrative power of the two concessions was entirely in the hands of the British and French. The judicial organ of the concessions was the Mixed Court (commonly known as New Ho-Mun), and its original site is now the New World Company.

At that time, the cost of living was very low. The price of rice was only three dollars per dan. The highest tuition fee at St. John's University, including board, was only eight dollars a month. If you were a教会子弟 (child of a Christian family), it was completely free. Therefore, I continued my studies at the school until graduation for a period of seven years. Not only did I not pay any money, but I also earned five or six hundred dollars in subsidies during this period by working as an assistant teacher.

Regarding the general major events in the Public Concession, there are many that I do not know in great detail, because there was a period of time when I was serving in Ningbo. I will talk about what I know:

First, the Boxer Rebellion in the north in the Gengzi year (1900), because of advocating the complete killing of Christians, Shanghai was filled with rumors and the situation was extremely tense. Later, because the Governor-General of Liangguang, Liu Kunyi, and the Governor-General of Huguang, Zhang Zhidong, absolutely did not respond to the measures in the north and strongly protected the southeast half of the country, Shanghai was not affected in any way.

Second, the Wuxu Coup (Hundred Days' Reform), only Jing Liansun, the director of the Shanghai Telegraph Bureau, initially supported the Kang-Liang policy. After Kang and Liang failed, the government ordered Jing to be arrested, but Jing had already escaped, so there was no impact.

Third, the revolutionary period; because patriots Zou Rong, Zhang Binglin, etc. incited revolutionary ideas in Shanghai, they were hated by the Manchu Qing government, and Zou and Zhang were detained in prison. Later, Zou Rong died of illness in prison, and Zhang Binglin was released after being detained for several years.

Fourth, the boycott of American goods. A case occurred in the Mixed Court at that time. A Cantonese woman, Huang Li, was judged unfairly by the American vice-consul, and he wanted to punish her. At the same time, a Chinese official子 being子 was publicly insulted by the American consul. This aroused public anger and launched a boycott of American goods. The first to propose this was Mr. Zeng Shaoqing, who was later mediated by the British consul. After several months of negotiation, the matter was resolved.

After that, during the time of the Republic of China Revolution, when Mr. Chen Qimei served as都督 (military governor), there is no need to talk about it anymore. After that, there was the "May Thirtieth" Massacre. After the "May Thirtieth" Massacre, the Chinese began to organize the Chinese Ratepayers Association and elected. The concession authorities gradually paid attention to the Chinese, and after the struggle of the Chinese, the Chinese had the right to speak on changing the treatment of the Chinese. Before that, the Chinese did not even have the right to speak.

In the French Concession, in the past history, there was a conflict with the Ningbo Siming Public Cemetery, because a Yizhong (public burial ground) of the Siming Public Cemetery had its outer wall collapsed. The French Concession insisted on demolishing the wall and letting the land go, and the Public Cemetery opposed it. The French authorities then used high-pressure tactics, arousing public outrage, and the Yong people (people of Ningbo) completely went on strike. This conflict was resolved after several months. (Recorded by Yu Xiunuo)

### Also Considered Old Shanghai

— Zhang Yi

The time I lived in Shanghai was sporadic, pieced together, but only a dozen years. In my small life, it only occupies one-seventh, but from the beginning I saw Shanghai until now, it has occupied a time span of sixty-four years. I remember the first time I passed through Shanghai, I was only nine years old, it was in the Gengchen year of Guangxu (1900), because in this year, my father, Shao Sheng, passed the imperial examination and was appointed as a magistrate, and assigned to Zhili Province to fill vacancies. So he returned to his hometown in Suzhou to pick up his family and went north, hiring a pair of civilian boats and traveling for three days and two nights to reach Shanghai. The boat docked on the south bank of the Suzhou River, approximately near the current Pintang Bridge. This Suzhou River was deep-rooted and lush, the river surface was extremely wide, almost unable to see the north bank. From the boat to the shore was about twenty or more zhang. Ashore was still a vast ocean, with rice fields crisscrossing, walking through the small paths, suddenly seeing a bustling street, like the Suzhou Shantang or Mudu. This is the famous Great Road. My father and mother originally wanted to wander through the roads, but my sister and I pestered them, insisting on eating Cantonese mooncakes. These Cantonese mooncakes were something my father always brought home for us every time he returned home from Shanghai, so they made a deep impression on us. As soon as we arrived in Shanghai, we remembered these four words firmly. My father had no choice but to take us to the樓盤, a Cantonese teahouse, where we drank oolong tea and ate Cantonese mooncakes. Not long after, we still returned to the boat. Around midnight, my mother woke my siblings and me up in our sleep, the boat had already left its original location. We were a total of five people, moving to a very large house. Confused, we walked through winding, short, and narrow places, and came to a very small room. We unknowingly fell asleep, and when it dawned, my sister and I were motivated by curiosity to climb up layer by layer, suddenly brightened, then turned around this big house, built on the water surface, and very quickly moving forward there. Just as we were puzzled, my father also came, and began to tell me in detail that this is called a steamboat, the "Bao Da" ship of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company, heading straight to Tianjin, and the ship fare for each person is ten taels and five qian of silver.

Nine years passed, and I was seventeen years old. My father resigned and returned home, and again arrived in Shanghai, everything was very different from nine years ago. Getting off the large steamboat, we entered a hotel on the north bank of the二涇, called "Mai An Inn". Because my father was seriously ill, we did not耽搁, and soon returned to Suzhou by boat. Five years passed, I was twenty-two years old, and in the Gui Si year Jiangnan Provincial Examination, I unexpectedly passed the examination to become a juren (a successful candidate in the provincial civil service examination). At that time, it was fashionable for jurens to print the articles of the three sessions, with the curriculum vitae attached at the beginning, into a thin book called "Shu Juan". This Shu Juan was given to people at will, and people would always send a gift in return, colloquially called "Da Chou Feng". So I brought several hundred copies of Shu Juan to Shanghai, living at a relative's house. This relative lived on the Great Road, I remember there was a large wall sign at the entrance, "Wan Kang Garden", approximately where the Wing On Company is now located, a very new three-story building, and the rent was only twenty-four yuan. He introduced me to a young, wealthy man, nicknamed Huang Baobao, the land and wharves on the Bund of the French Concession were all his father's inheritance. He received my Shu Juan and gave me twenty yuan, I was unintentionally happy. A friend also introduced me to a Commander Wu, this commander was a deputy general, leading two battalions of soldiers, stationed at the mouth of Wusong. Originally, there was a railway from Shanghai to Wusong, but last year a censor reported it, saying that railways were strange and ingenious, and that the land of Chinese etiquette could not allow them to惑民心 confuse the people. This大文 was published in "編世文"; I have forgotten the censor's surname and name. The Emperor was furious and strictly ordered the Governor-General of Liangjiang to demolish it immediately. Therefore, our country's Wusong could not take the train, and changed to horse carriages. Commander Wu treated me very well and asked the two generals to raise a hundred yuan to give me. As a result of Da Chou Feng, I received nearly three hundred yuan and returned fully loaded. But I regretted it very much, at that time the land in Mud City Bridge was a hundred yuan per mu. If I had bought more land with the money I got from Da Chou Feng, I would be 面子 very wealthy now.

In these years, some readers with new ideas gradually studied mathematics, physics (i.e. modern science), translation and other aspects privately. I am ashamed to say that I am also considered one of them. But without a teacher to teach, I often get nowhere. Our treasure trove is only a few translated books from the manufacturing bureau and the Guangxuehui, which are difficult to understand. Now it's good, Sheng Xuanhuai established a Nanyang Public School, and first recruited teachers for the normal school class, and I unexpectedly passed the entrance examination. Nanyang Public School was in the countryside of Xujiahui, the school site was a silk factory that had been shut down. The later school site is the current Jiaotong University, which was newly built three years later. At that time, the school was surrounded by fields, and there were not many foreign houses. On Sundays, running to the Concession, I couldn't sit in a rickshaw. So everyone mostly walked. In the Concession, I only visited two new bookstores, Zuoxin Society and Civilization Bookstore, to visit friends and look at new books. If I encountered heavy rain, I took off my clothes, or walked west along the current Jing'an Temple Road, or looked south from Ximen, all were muddy and载浮. I lived in Nanyang Public School for less than a year, I read English to the third book of grammar, the reader to the fourth volume, and learned algebra in mathematics, but they were only broken subjects, and then I left Shanghai again. Although this time was longer than the previous two, I did not go outside much, so my knowledge did not increase.

From then on, I wandered and wandered again, and suddenly wandered to thousands of miles of Yunnan, and encountered the Xinhai Revolution. Yunnan declared independence on September 9th, and was in chaos for two months. Although I ran back to Shanghai in a staggering state, the mission I was carrying was very important, it was to be sent by Governor Cai E to participate in the representatives' conference of various provinces to elect the first president of the Republic. I remember it was in the early part of the eleventh lunar month, passing through Hong Kong, the weather was extremely hot, and I was sweating all over. Only two days later, once passing through the mouth of Wusong, the gale was bone-piercing, and extreme cold invaded. At this time, the Concession was very different from before, because there was war and chaos everywhere in the inland, wealthy compatriots mostly ran to Shanghai, and the market was very prosperous. But like now, there were many entertainment venues such as gambling places, dance halls, and cinemas everywhere, nothing of the sort, so besides brothels, there was only one Zhang Garden, abbreviated as Zhang Garden. It stood on the west side of Mud City Bridge, although there were still rice fields on both sides, a flat road had been built in the middle, and both sides of the road were full of tall locust trees. In the shadow of the setting sun, the traffic was heavy, and it was even more noisy at night. At that time, I was the chief editor of the Shishi Xinbao, the work was complicated, how could I have the time to play. Shishi Xinbao, and Xinwenbao, Shenbao, Shenhua Daily, Shibao, Minli, were the six major newspapers at that time, mostly distributed on a street called Wangping Street. The owner of Shenbao, Xi Zipei, sold Shenbao, and I found a buyer for him, and it was sold for 100,000 yuan. The current site was moved by the new buyer.

Later, in the tenth year of the Republic of China, I went to Shanghai from Beijing to carry out my duties in Jinshi. In the twenty-sixth year, I went to Shanghai from Suzhou to treat my illness. Those are all recent events, although there have been many changes, and many people have been seen and heard, there is no need for an old monk to repeat them.

### Old Stories of the Marketplace in the Last Decade

— Abandoned Runqing

To the editor of Shen Bao, I have recently been asked to contribute on the topic of Shanghai anecdotes from the last decade. Having come to Shanghai to engage in business at the age of fourteen, I have been living and working here for fifty-three years, a length of time that can undoubtedly be considered long. However, I am constantly amidst the marketplace, and my eyes and ears are primarily focused on my own profession. Therefore, what I can recall and what I can write about is limited to old stories of the marketplace.

Discussions about Shanghai's commerce often center on the concessions, but in fact, the most prosperous commercial area was originally in the Nanshi (South City), with the so-called concessions merely being "living outside the city walls." Later, as times changed and warfare became frequent, the concessions, due to their special administrative status, became a haven for avoiding worldly troubles. As a result, various businesses, to avoid the impact of the unstable situation, moved into the concessions one after another. Taking my own industry as an example, the earliest gathering place for discussions among colleagues was in the Inner Market next to the Yu Garden in today's Nanshi. Later, colleagues moved north, gradually dividing into North and South markets, resulting in the existence of both markets. After the Incident of 1937, the Nanshi market was virtually eliminated. Today, all colleagues have gathered entirely within the concessions. The so-called concessions are no longer what they looked like when they were first established. However, the creation of the concessions as a commercial center, while due to the efforts of the Chinese people, was also undeniably due to the nation's troubles, which is regrettable!

The last decade has been a period of significant changes in Shanghai's commercial and financial landscape. Important events, such as the abolition of taels and the adoption of the yuan, as well as financial panics and currency reforms, all occurred during this time. Due to Shanghai's important position, it often served as the primary area for implementing various reforms. Therefore, various financial changes were often seen first in Shanghai.

In the past, important ports all used the silver yuan standard. The debate over abolishing taels and adopting the yuan had been going on for a long time in both official and unofficial circles. It was not until the autumn of 1932, after the floods and the resulting economic hardship, that it began to materialize. The actual date for the unification of taels and yuan was April 6, 1933. Earlier, in early March, the Ministry of Finance officially issued an order stipulating that from March 10th, the conversion rate would be fixed at one silver yuan for every 0.715 Shanghai taels, and the fixed purity of the new silver yuan was also specified. After the announcement of this measure, silver and money exchange businesses immediately complied. From March 10th, all business transactions were conducted using silver yuan, and various market prices were gradually converted to silver yuan units. Soon after, the Ministry of Finance announced that from April 6th, all public and private funds, contracts, notes, and all transactions must be converted to silver yuan and no longer use silver taels. For those originally denominated in silver taels before that date, in Shanghai, the conversion should be based on 0.715 silver taels to one silver yuan. In other locations, the conversion should be based on the Shanghai exchange rate on April 5th, and then calculated according to the above fixed rate. At that time, the silver and money exchange businesses in Shanghai also discussed and agreed on measures to convert all silver tael deposits and debts to silver yuan according to the 0.715 rate (banks used April 3rd, and money shops used April 5th). It was also stipulated that all notes should be denominated in silver yuan. This fixed rate is still in use today.

The so-called financial panic occurred between 1934 and 1935, and spread across the country. At the end of 1934, the banks that suspended operations in Shanghai included China Savings, Wuhua, China Industrial, and Huadong. The money shops included Rongkang, Yikang, Dechang, and Baodayu. In Wuhu, there was Anhui Bank. In Guangzhou, there were Jia Hua and Nanhua. In 1935, the banks that suspended operations in Shanghai included Jiangnan, Ningbo Industrial, and Shijie. The money shops included Tongtai, Yongxing, and Dingshen. In July of that year, Ningbo also experienced a financial panic, with more than a dozen money shops suspending operations.

The causes of this financial panic were varied, but general opinion attributed it to the United States' silver policy. The result of the United States buying silver was a large outflow of silver from China. At the time, the country was still using silver currency, and the outflow of silver resulted in a significant shortage of money supply. Subsequently, due to the high price of silver, foreign goods flooded the market, while domestic goods became extremely cheap. Consequently, all industries declined, and problems arose one after another. The implementation of currency reform on November 3, 1935, concentrating silver, may have been motivated by this.

Today, Shanghai is suffering from rampant speculation. This reminds me of the yarn market turmoil six years ago (1937). Earlier, the Shanghai Yarn and Cloth Exchange's 20-count Golden Rooster brand cotton yarn saw its market price rise from over 270 yuan to 80 yuan on the day before the May delivery date, and announced the suspension of trading. According to reports at the time, there were only over 28,000 bales of yarn in Shanghai, but the number of long positions in speculation reached over 40,000 bales. As a result, spot market supply could not be balanced. After June of that year, speculators continued to buy in large quantities, and the market price continued to rise. Trading was suspended on the 9th, and again after the 12th. Trading finally resumed on the 16th. The Ministry of Industry and Commerce even sent personnel to investigate the case, but upon closer examination, it was merely the result of speculators squeezing each other, both long and short. At that time, the base prices of commodities were small, so fluctuations of tens of yuan were already a noteworthy event.

After 1937, Shanghai entered a state of war, and there were many more changes in the marketplace. However, it is not far from the present, so I will not repeat them.

Shanghai is the center of commerce and finance in the country, and the concessions are a concentrated commercial area. Although this was caused by the unstable domestic situation in the last century, it also demonstrates the achievements of the Chinese people's hard work. I anticipate that under favorable conditions, allowing everything to develop freely, the commercial achievements of the Chinese people will not be limited to the past concessions. Therefore, the primary condition for all economic development in our country in the future is stability.

### Newspaper Offices on Wangping Street Over the Past Thirty Years

— Jiuyi

The area around Wangping Street had the most newspaper offices around 1912 and 1913. These short thirty-plus years can be divided into three periods: from 1912 going back to the Guangxu and Xuantong years as one period, from 1912 down to before the Incident of 1937 as another period, and then down to the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War as yet another period. There are currently three existing newspaper offices, while the rest have either been reorganized, suspended publication, resumed publication, newly established, or moved far away. Now, I will describe what I can remember, and errors and omissions may be unavoidable.

Guangxu and Xuantong Years

Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Shenzhou Daily, Yulun Bao, Shishi Bao. The latter two newspapers merged into Yulun Shishi Bao and were then reorganized into Shishi Xinbao. Zhongwai Daily, Tianduo Bao, Minli Bao, which was reorganized into Minhu Bao and then reorganized into Minxu Bao.

From 1912 to Before the Incident of 1937

Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Shenzhou Daily, Shishi Xinbao, Tianchan Bao, Minguo Daily, reorganized into Minbao, Nanfang Bao, Dagonghe Daily, Asia Daily, Xin Shenbao (not the current Xin Shenbao), Shangbao, Chenbao, Dagong Bao, Zhonghua Daily.

After the Incident of 1937 to Before the Greater East Asia War

Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Shibao, Dagong Bao, Chenbao, Zhonghua Daily, Shenzhou Daily (not the Shenzhou Daily mentioned earlier), Zhongmei Daily, Wenhui Bao, Xin Shenbao (not the Xin Shenbao mentioned earlier, and the address is not on Wangping Street, but it is included due to industry connections).

After the Greater East Asia War

Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Zhonghua Daily, Xin Shenbao, Guomin Xinwen, Xin Zhongguo Daily, Ping Bao.

Printing Aspects

During the Guangxu and Xuantong years, newspapers used flatbed printing presses, powered by gas. After the layout was completed and the proofs were checked, no paper molds were made. The original plate was directly installed on the press and printed. Every midnight, when the printing press started, the "zhálàde...zhálàde" sound of the press disturbed the neighbors' good sleep. Later, it was felt that printing was time-consuming, the newspaper was published late, and it hindered the editing time, so rotary presses, web paper, and electric power were gradually adopted. An original plate could be arbitrarily made into multiple strips of paper molds, and then the paper molds were cast into lead plates, pressed into a semi-circular shape, installed on the press, and mass printing could be done, with the newspaper coming out in a continuous stream.

Rotary presses require web paper, and web paper must be white, strong, and not easily broken. Shanghai had many foreign paper merchants, and most newspapers used Canadian products. Also, for the purpose of storing paper, the dimensions of the machines were measured, sent to the paper mill to be custom-made, and shipped to Shanghai for future use. German-made paper mold paper was considered the best. Since the outbreak of the Great War, both types of paper have been drawn from inventory. If the war continues, there will eventually be a day when they run out.

Editorial Aspects

Initially, due to the limitations of machine power, the editing deadline was set at 10:00 PM every night, the proofs were checked by 11:00 PM, and printing started at 12:00 AM. Later, with the adoption of rotary presses, the deadline was gradually extended to 12:00 AM, 1:00 AM...5:00 AM. Occasionally, when major events occurred, after reporters investigated and reported, the draft was immediately prepared and set in type, secondary news was removed, placed in a prominent position, a new paper mold was made, installed on the press, and reprinted.

The editorial policies of each newspaper also differed. Some focused on editorials, some on telegrams, some on business news, and some on social news. They spared no expense in hiring famous reporters from various places, established a telegram news network, using telegrams for important matters. For matters where telegrams could not provide details, or for secondary events, the communication method was used to record details, catering to the readers' wishes. They also included casual essays, appropriate for both ancient and modern times, both serious and humorous, as chat fodder after tea and wine. Each newspaper also published pictorials once a day, once a week, or irregularly. Initially, they used stone lithography drawn by artists, and later they collected photos from various places in China and abroad, using photogravure printing on coated paper, making the scenes lifelike, which was even more welcomed by readers.

The scope of telegrams was extensive: wired telegrams, long-distance calls, and wireless telegrams. Wired telegrams were used the earliest, but the telegram fees were more expensive, so they were used sparingly to save costs. Later, long-distance telephone lines were connected to major areas of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, and each newspaper rented telephone lines, reporting at a scheduled time every night. When wireless telegraphs became available, domestic and international telegrams could be received, with even greater effectiveness. Each newspaper spared no expense in purchasing receiving machines and hiring technicians to receive telegrams for their own use. International telegrams initially only translated a few important Reuters telegrams from foreign newspapers, just to fill a space. After the First World War, readers' attention gradually turned to foreign countries. Reuters, Havas, Associated Press, United Press, Domei News Agency, Reuter East Asia Service, TASS, successively translated and sent Chinese manuscripts, which were adopted one after another, and the telegram network was finally complete.

The editorial techniques of newspapers in the East and the West were novel and unique, clearly revealed, and most likely to attract readers' attention. When the editors of each newspaper saw new styles, they also had to change their old methods, gradually discarding the old-fashioned layout of plain narratives or "rain mixed with snow," and replacing them with new-style layouts, with various sizes of headlines, long lines, short lines, and cornered news interspersed between them. Readers were hooked and rushed to read them first.

Business Aspects

Each newspaper's business department was generally divided into two major sections: advertising and distribution. Commercial newspapers generally regard advertising as the lifeline. However, in order to achieve advertising development, it is necessary to promote distribution first. The fundamental issue is, of course, the content of the newspaper. If the editors work hard and are supported by most reporters, then distribution will naturally be common and advertising will naturally flourish. However, newspapers bear a cultural mission and cannot be compared to a purely commercial enterprise. Some newspapers are too commercialized, focusing only on advertising and not on news, which inevitably leads to the derisive label of "advertising newspapers." Alternatively, if they only focus on news and not on advertising, then how can they nurture the newspaper's own life? It depends on the appropriate handling by the person in charge.

Other Aspects

From the Guangxu and Xuantong years to before the Incident of 1937, each newspaper proportionally bore the expenses of the Daily Newspaper Association, which was a matter for the newspaper office to discuss. Although it was not a statutory organization, when a newly established newspaper was founded, it had to complete membership procedures for the sake of its own rights and interests. When important matters arose or major negotiations were conducted, meetings were held to make decisions and execute them jointly. The association also had a leisure club, which served as a gathering place for the writers of each newspaper to discuss topics. They gathered for a meal once every one or two weeks to foster friendship. Furthermore, news agencies supplied news, and advertising agencies supplied advertising, each with its own organization. Since they are not within the scope of this topic, I will not elaborate on them.

### The Earliest Electricity, Tram, and Telephone Businesses in the French Concession

— Gu Jiaxi

The prosperity of a city is mostly built on public utilities, so the underdevelopment of a city is also due to the imperfection of public utilities. The reason why the concessions can have a prosperous urban landscape is precisely this reason. The public utilities of the Shanghai French Concession, such as electricity, trams, and telephones, have undergone many twists, turns, obstacles, and reorganizations before reaching their current state of perfection. Now, I will only briefly discuss their initial situation:

As for the electricity business in the Shanghai French Concession, in July of Guangxu 8 (August 1882 in the Western calendar), the Shanghai Electric Light Company set up transmission lines in the concession to supply private use. By Guangxu 19 (early 1894 in the Western calendar, the power of the Electrical Department of the Public Concession Public Works Department also came in, and a part of the electric business rights was taken away.)

In March of Guangxu 21 (April 1895 in the Western calendar), the Board of Directors had already decided to build its own electric light plant on the open space behind the bureau, according to the design report of engineer Junlu, to supply electric light to public institutions and roads within the concession. Later, on March 28 (April 22 in the Western calendar), Lauden, the French custodian of lighting materials from the Ministry of Construction, was commissioned to order machines in France and hire electricians.

The contract between the French Concession Board of Directors and the British-owned Zilaihuo Company originally expired on March 18 of Guangxu 22 (March 31, 1896 in the Western calendar), but because the bureau's electrical equipment was not yet available, it was decided on July 21 of Guangxu 21 (September 9, 1895 in the Western calendar) to extend the original contract by one year.

In February of Guangxu 22 (March 1896 in the Western calendar), the Board of Directors selected the manufacturer to supply the generators, and the factory building in Shanghai was also contracted for construction. In January 1897, the French electrician Bujiye arrived in Shanghai, and the equipment of the electric light plant was completed at the end of May, and officially lit up on June 1, and the official opening ceremony was held on July 14.

After the French Board of Directors established the Electricity Department, in addition to the streetlights and internal electricity used by the institutions, it could also supply electricity to private individuals within the concession, so it cancelled the electricity business rights of the British companies and monopolized it themselves.

### Me and Shanghai

— Bao Tianxiao

Shanghai, a metropolis of world civilization!

That Chinese land is governed by foreigners is truly a disgrace to all Chinese people. Now, as the date of the return of the concessions approaches, Shen Bao has put out a special issue, and asked me to write an article. If I am to write about Shanghai's past, Shanghai has a magnificent history, and I fear that even a million words would not suffice. I remember there was a time when the Shanghai Municipal Government specially established a Shanghai Gazetteer Office to handle this matter, and if I am to write about Shanghai's future, for the sake of revitalizing Greater Shanghai, with thousands of threads and countless strands, I am also afraid that even a million books would not suffice. Gentlemen of the world will surely be able to shoulder these two arduous tasks, but as I am aged and frail, I can only write a little essay about my contact with Shanghai, with trivial details, based on what little I can recall.

My first time in Shanghai, I think I was eight years old! That was exactly sixty years ago from now. That year, my father went to Shanghai to visit a friend and suddenly fell ill at Mr. Bei's home. Because his illness was severe, Mr. Bei telegraphed our home in Suzhou. My grandmother and mother were greatly alarmed upon receiving the telegram, because unless there was something very important, they would never send a telegram, so they thought my father was sure to die. Therefore, our whole family went to Shanghai.

At that time, there were neither trains nor inland river steamers from Suzhou to Shanghai, only hired civilian boats, which took three days and three nights to reach Shanghai, because they traveled during the day and moored at night. (If it were a rowboat, it could travel day and night, and arrive in one day and one night.) My grandmother and mother couldn't eat on the boat, and just kept crying. They thought my father was surely out of luck, but who knew that when we arrived in Shanghai, my father's illness had already mostly healed, and the family was happy, which is self-explanatory.

Since my father had recovered, Mr. Bei invited us to stay at his house for a few days, and also invited us to visit various places. I don't remember the places we visited very well. I only remember that once, we took a carriage to the Huangpu Bund to see the steamships. We also went to a "General Assembly" (that was the name at the time; its location was near the present-day World Book Company) on the Fourth Avenue to have tea. The front half of that place was a teahouse, and the back half was an opium den. In the middle, there were many glass display cases, displaying all kinds of animal models, like a museum.

What children like are food and toys. The next time I came to Shanghai, what I liked to eat was a kind of melon-shaped steamed bun, and large almond crisps and candied winter melon from Guangdong stores. The toys were all Japanese goods. One dollar could buy a wooden box, and a wooden box contained more than twenty items, all very small and exquisite. I also had an impression at the time: the rickshaw pullers (they were not called "yellow package cars" there, only "Eastern cars," because rickshaws were introduced from Japan) wore hats that were conical in shape and made of bamboo, very much like our family's sauce jars. I would burst out laughing when I saw them.

After that, I didn't go to Shanghai again. After my father passed away when I was seventeen, I went to Shanghai once when I was eighteen or nineteen. By then, inland river steamers had become available, but I returned hastily and there was nothing much to remember.

Later, some friends and I opened a bookstore on Guanqian Street in Suzhou, called Donglai Bookstore. Because some of our classmates had gone to study in Japan, Japanese maps (alas, China at that time didn't even have slightly well-printed maps), stationery, and paper products were very exquisite and popular with Chinese people. We all mailed them from Japan in small packages for sale. At the same time, we also went to Shanghai to sell new books, in order to promote new ideas. (In fact, Shanghai was also very poor at that time, except for Liang Qichao's Shiwu Bao [Current Affairs Newspaper].) Therefore, I often ran to the Japanese stationery merchants in Hongkou to buy goods. I also went to various bookstores to search for books, because they elected me as the manager of Donglai Bookstore. (At that time, Zhang Yunbo also opened a bookstore, which seemed to be called Qiuzhi Bookstore. We were rivals.)

At that time, I went to Shanghai and took the entrance exam for the Nanyang Public School's normal school program, but was not admitted. Later, I went to Shanghai with a relative, Mr. So-and-so, to seek employment, but was unsuccessful. My family was poor and my parents were old, so I made a living by teaching (I stepped out of the school gate and became a teacher after my father died at seventeen), and took the civil service exams as a side job. Later, my friend Dai Menghu introduced me to Mr. Kuai Kuai in Nanjing, who was very capable of supporting younger generations, and I was deeply valued by him. At that time, he was in Shanghai preparing to establish the Jinsu Qi Printing Office, so I came to Shanghai with Mr. Wang Xiaoxu, Wang Youzhong, and others.

That was when I officially started living in Shanghai. That year, I met many people in Shanghai's new intellectual circles. Because the Jinsu Qi Printing Office was rented in Dengbao Lane on Baker Road, behind our window was Yan Fu's residence, and Zhang Taiyan lived in his home. We spent time with each other day and night. To the east was Ms. Xue Jinqin's residence, and Zhang Xingyan sometimes came as well. Later, Yan Fu's daughter, Wu Yanan, married Zhang Xingyan.

Among the newspaper people, we knew Wang Songge, the owner of the Zhongwai Ribao [China-Foreign Daily], Songge was the younger brother of Wang Rangqing (Kangnian), and although he was deaf, he was very energetic in running the newspaper. The first revolution in Shanghai's newspapers was started by the Zhongwai Ribao. Because before that, Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] and Xinwen Bao [News] were both printed on one side of glossy paper, but from the Zhongwai Ribao onwards, they used the current newsprint and began printing on both sides. Also, Shen Bao and Xinwen Bao used long lines that ran to the bottom, but from the Zhongwai Ribao onwards, they started using short lines. (At that time, the Shibao [Eastern Times] had not yet opened.) The Western translator of the Zhongwai Ribao was Mr. Wen Zongyao (also known as Qinpu, the current President of the Judicial Yuan), and the Eastern translator was Mr. Ye Haowu. They sat at a large table, facing each other.

I also met Mr. Xia Ruifang of the Commercial Press at this time, because the books of the Jinsu Qi Printing Office were urgent to publish, and there were not many Chinese-run printing houses in Shanghai. We separately submitted them to the Commercial Press and Wu Yunshao's Printing House for typesetting and printing. And we had to personally proofread them every day. Why? Because some of our books were translated by Mr. Yan Youling, such as Müller's "Science of Names" and "The Original Chapter," which were philosophical books that ordinary proofreaders could not handle. Therefore, we had to personally proofread them.

At that time, the scale of the Commercial Press was very small, and its address was at the corner of Beijing Road and Henan Road. According to Mr. Xia, when it was first established, the capital was only three thousand dollars. When I went to print books, there were fewer than thirty typesetting and printing workers. What kind of business did they do? They mainly reprinted English textbooks. At that time, the Chinese in Shanghai translated English, and the textbooks were also imported. The British used the same English textbooks to teach us Chinese as they used to teach Indians. The British originally regarded Chinese people as the future Indians! However, those books did not have translations. At that time, the Commercial Press added Chinese translations, so there were Chinese-English comparisons, which were the so-called Chinese-English Primers and Chinese-English Advanced books.

At this time, the editing industry in Shanghai gradually developed, and there were also many Japanese students who printed books in Japan and sent them to Shanghai for distribution. Therefore, Mr. Xia Ruifang wanted to expand, but he was a layman, so he often asked me, "What books can be printed?" I often encouraged him, "You can increase capital and set up an editorial office, and invite a celebrity to preside over it. There will be many books to be published in the future." He agreed but was undecided. Later, the Commercial Press burned down. Presumably, he had taken out insurance. There is a saying in Shanghai that "burning makes you rich." Sure enough, he added capital and invited Mr. Zhang Jusheng as the director of the translation and compilation office, and jumped to become a giant in Shanghai's book industry.

Shanghai had a Zhang's Garden, which was also a product of the times. On ordinary Sundays, it was crowded with men and women, chatting and strolling, and was always a place where famous people and guests would sip tea and talk about love. It became a meeting place. Because at that time, Ankai Lane was such an old and dilapidated place. The owner of the garden, Zhang Shuhe, was a Daoist official who had lost his position in the late Qing Dynasty. He often entertained guests there himself. Just like Mr. Chen Gongbo said in "Ancient and Modern" magazine, he was a "first-class Modan." During the Imperial Protection Era, Mr. Zhong Hui gave a speech at Zhang's Garden about military affairs. Don't think that Mr. Wu Zhihui looks old and frail now. At that time, one punch could break through the lectern and a pair of parallel bars. On that day, countless young students broke the chairs, but the owner of Zhang's Garden didn't say a word about compensation.

After the Jinsu Qi Printing Office dissolved, I also assisted Mr. Jiang Xingzai (named Zhiyou, respectfully called General Jiang Baqi) in the translation work at the Zhushu Garden Printing Office. I also assisted in the affairs of the Qixiu Bookstore run by Mr. Ye Haowu. These printing offices were not long-lived. First, the people who ran the translation and printing offices did not run their own printing houses, and they didn't pay much attention to distribution either. Scholars being unable to manage money was one drawback. Second, the purpose of running translation and printing offices at that time was to promote new ideas, and they didn't intend to make money. Once the money ran out, they couldn't sustain themselves and immediately closed down.

At that time, I returned to Suzhou, because my grandmother was old and I was her only grandson, so I didn't want to leave her. However, my grandmother soon passed away. My fellow townsman Peng Songtian introduced me to the Shandong Qingzhou Prefectural Middle School as a supervisor, through Prefect Cao Gensen of Qingzhou Prefecture, who was also from my hometown. The following year, my family moved with me. I stayed at Qingzhou Prefectural Middle School for more than two years. When Cao Gensen was transferred, I also resigned. At that time, Shanghai's Mr. Qiu Chuqing introduced me to the Shibao [Eastern Times] and Mr. Zeng Mengpu invited me to the Xiaoshuo Lin [Fiction Forest], and my lifelong writing career was set at this time.

I originally wanted my family to stay in Suzhou and I would stay in Shanghai alone, but many friends advised me that my family didn't need to stay in Suzhou, because the family economy was difficult and Shanghai's rent was more expensive, and they would help in other ways. I listened to them. That's when my family started living in Shanghai. I first lived on Avenue Road, then briefly lived in the Old West Gate, and then moved to Avenue Edward VII, and now I live on Avenue Foch. People say that I am a "three-Avenue" person, because the roads I live on must start with the word "Avenue."

When I first joined the Shibao [Eastern Times], my salary was eighty dollars a month, which was very generous. Thinking back to my friend Sun Qiyuan, who joined the Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] two years before me, his salary was only twenty-eight dollars a month, and even the chief editor, Mr. Zhang Yunhe, only earned more than thirty dollars a month. I earned forty dollars in the Xiaoshuo Lin [Fiction Forest] for only half a day's work. At that time, the cost of living was low, and my monthly income was one hundred and twenty dollars, which was more than enough. Moreover, I could still write novels in my spare time. However, I saved nothing. My biggest problem was that I liked to indulge in gambling and pleasure. All the hard-earned money was spent on prostitution. Therefore, my friends' advice to keep my family in Shanghai was very meaningful. Otherwise, I don't know what my family would be like now. The elders in my hometown often refuse to send young people to Shanghai alone, which shows that they are not without foresight.

Shanghai's prosperity is entirely due to China's internal strife. Every time there is internal strife in China, Shanghai becomes more prosperous. The earliest was during the Taiping Rebellion, when everyone fled to Shanghai to avoid the war. At that time, transportation was not very convenient. After the Xinhai Revolution, many Qing loyalists also moved to Shanghai, emptying their official coffers to buy Western houses, purchase calligraphy and paintings, and lead a life of luxury with fine wine and women. Compared to Boyi and Shuqi, who withered away in the mountains, they were naturally much more dissolute. Later, there were more and more civil wars, and more and more people fled to Shanghai to escape the war. Once they arrived in Shanghai, they settled down there and refused to go back. As a result, Shanghai's population grew more and more, and now it has a population of five million.

The reason why Shanghai's evil forces have grown so much is entirely due to the foreign backers. Gangsters oppress the citizens. Everyone gnashes their teeth, but they dare to be angry but dare not speak out. But half of it is also due to the Shanghai citizens themselves. Some try to become naturalized citizens. It is clear that they are Chinese people, so why do they want to obtain Western nationality? It is clear that the shops are opened by Chinese people, so why do they want to hang foreign merchants' flags? It is clear that the houses are their own, so why do they want foreign companies to collect rent? Needless to say, they originally wanted to use the power of foreigners to oppress their compatriots. At a lower level, they want to rely on the underworld gangsters. I remember there was a time when you couldn't win a lawsuit without the help of a gangster. Judges and lawyers would handle everything. There was a famous saying at the time called "a lawsuit is only half fought." They would collude with each other, sharing the profits, and what the parties involved got was still minimal. I don't know if those evils still exist after the concessions are recovered.

I lived on Avenue Edward VII for the longest time, for more than twenty years. That alley was called Qingxiang Lane. One end was Avenue Edward VII, and the other end was Boundary Road. Beyond Boundary Road was the North Railway Station. The area was the northernmost part of the French Concession. The entrance to Avenue Edward VII was a small marketplace, and the iron gate leading out of Boundary Road was the railway station. Because of the convenient transportation, I lived there for a long time. However, when I went back from the newspaper office on Wangping Street at night, Avenue Edward VII didn't feel very "near" to me. One year, I was robbed of my overcoat three times when I went back late at night. (Shanghai people call it "peeling a pig's hide.") The first time, after I was robbed, two days later, he mailed the pawn ticket back to the newspaper office, and also wrote a very polite letter. (This letter was published in Jing Bao [Crystal Daily].) It turned out that in the pocket of my overcoat, there was a letter someone had written to me, with a name and address on it. He could follow the map and send it to the newspaper office. I redeemed the overcoat, put it on, and in less than a month, it was robbed again. The third time, there was no letter in the overcoat pocket, and he didn't mail the pawn ticket back. Fortunately, with the help of the patrolmen of the French Concession Police Station, I was able to redeem it from the pawnshop. Before two months had passed, it was robbed again. Every time I was robbed, he pointed a gun at me, and I obediently took off my overcoat and handed it to him. I was a "non-resistance" person, because he had a gun and I didn't!

The patrolmen of the French Concession Police Station were very familiar with me. Because of the overcoat being robbed, I visited the police station many times. He advised me: Apply for a handgun from the police station for self-defense (there was such a regulation at the time). We'll teach you how to shoot a handgun. I didn't dare to apply. First, my eyesight is poor. By the time I take out the handgun, he would have already shot first. Second, I have many young children at home and don't want to have a handgun. Third, he only wants to rob an overcoat. I'll just give it to him and that's it. He has no intention of harming me, so why shoot him to death? But the third time I was robbed was very serious. He took off the overcoat and also wanted to take off the robe inside. Fortunately, a car came from afar, and they ran away empty-handed. However, a gold watch in my inner pocket, also of the Avenue Edward VII brand, had already been snatched away by him. In the past, every time I went home from the Shen Bao [Shanghai Daily News] late at night, the road seemed very long. I once wrote a poem at the rickshaw stand: "Avenue Edward VII is near, yet as far as the horizon." But the next line was not completed. After the gold watch of the Avenue Edward VII brand was snatched away, I finally completed the next line: "I miss you twelve hours a day."

After the third time I was robbed, the overcoat was gone forever. At that time, the Qi Chubei troops were stationed there, and the police station was busy guarding the border and no longer paid attention to this. After each robbery, the robbers would put it on themselves. To avoid being recognized, my wife is a bit superstitious. She said, "This overcoat has been tainted by thieves, so let's not keep it!" That overcoat was made of fox fur, with thick and warm fur. It cost more than a hundred dollars to make, but after wearing it for seven or eight years, it was only worth forty or fifty dollars when it was redeemed from the pawnshop. The Jianyang unrest was endless, and there were many robberies on the roads of Shanghai. It is said that they all came out of gambling dens. After losing money, they would come out and rob once, and then go back to the gambling dens to gamble. Therefore, gambling dens and thieves are causally related. The harm of gambling dens is not only that they create thieves, but also that they create poverty, suicide, and all kinds of tragedies. I hope that after the concessions are recovered, the first thing to do is to eliminate this stain.

During my ten years or so at the Shibao [Eastern Times], I didn't encounter any major disasters, but minor disasters were inevitable. Fortunately, after the Xinhai Revolution, a military officer from Jiangxi brought a handgun to the newspaper office to see me. Because the newspaper offices at that time were humble and small, everyone could run over to ask questions. Unlike the recent newspaper offices, which are towering buildings with strict gatekeepers. Among my colleagues at the Shibao [Eastern Times], there were Chen Jingzhuan, Lei Jixing, Bing Ziying, and Lin Kanghou in the past, and Wu Jian, Liu Yuting, Ge Gongzhui, and Xia Qifeng in the later years, and we all respected each other. If there were lawsuits in the newspaper office and we had to go to court, then our manager, Mr. Di Pingzi, would come forward.

During this period, I went to Japan once to see their newspaper offices. It was truly a case of a small witch seeing a big witch, and I was deeply ashamed. After returning to Shanghai, I wrote a book called "A Brief Account of the Inspection of Japanese News," which was published by the Commercial Press. (It has been out of print for twenty years.) However, I realized that without China being able to make its own paper, the news industry would never be able to develop. I had always been very tired of the news industry, so I left the Shibao [Eastern Times]. In less than a few years, Mr. Di Chuqing also expressed his weariness with the news industry, sold the Shibao [Eastern Times] to others, and also left the news industry.

It probably takes a bit of courage to get rid of a job. I see that many colleagues, after getting rid of it, never ask about it again. They all have this kind of courage. Why can't I? This is my lack of courage, and also my lack of talent. I thought that after taking the first step of leaving the news industry, the second step would be to leave Shanghai, but what was the result? I was either dealing with Shanghai publishers or dealing with the Shanghai news industry. Is this my habit or is it my destiny? Is it really like a snake-charming beggar, who has no snake to charm? There was a time when I suddenly had the urge to dust off my hat and go to Nanjing's political circles for more than two years (ten years ago). It was even more meaningless. I still came back to Shanghai to be a citizen.

I thought that I would never see the day when the concessions were recovered in my lifetime. But that day has actually come. Just imagine how happy and excited I am! This is not only my happiness and excitement, but also the happiness and excitement of all the citizens. I hope that the ruling class in the future, in governing this great Shanghai, will at least be better than when there were concessions, in order to be worthy of the people who recovered the concessions, and to be worthy of all the citizens who live in Shanghai. As a small citizen of Shanghai, I deeply hope that I can eat a little more, live a little more peacefully, and my wishes will be fulfilled. Confucius said: "A gentleman does not seek to be full when eating, nor does he seek to be comfortable when living." The ancients said: "My ambition in life is not to be well-fed and clothed." But I dare not be a gentleman, and I have no great ambitions. I feel that this is enough. If this can be done, I will endure death for a moment and watch with anticipation the virtuous governance of you gentlemen.

### Old Tales of the Songhu Railway

— Shen Xiang

The proposal to build a railway in our country originated with foreigners. In May of the second year of the Tongzhi reign of the Qing dynasty, during the Taiping Rebellion, the British assisted the Qing government. General Gordon led the Ever Victorious Army to conquer Kunshan. In December of the same year, as they were occupying Suzhou, 27 British and American merchants from Shanghai jointly petitioned Jiangsu Governor Li Hongzhang, wanting to build a 54-mile railway between Shanghai and Suzhou. Li did not approve. At the same time, British railway entrepreneur Stephenson lobbied the Qing court with a "National Railway Trunk Line Plan for China." The Qing court did not adopt it because the matter was too novel. Few Chinese people responded to it either. The following year, British merchants in Shanghai once again proposed the construction. They began building a railway of about ten miles between Shanghai and Wusong, but due to difficulty in raising funds, they stopped after buying land.

The implementation of the railway occurred in the first year of the Guangxu reign. The Jardine Matheson trading company considered that the business between Shanghai and Jiangwan was becoming increasingly prosperous. They built a narrow-gauge railway with a width of two feet six inches from near Old Parade Ground Road, passing through Jiangwan to the Wusong mouth. In January of the following year, the chief engineer, Mr. Marry, arrived from England with materials and four technicians. They started leveling the ground and building bridges. The construction progressed very quickly. On January 20th, they performed the ceremony of driving in the first spike. It was driven in by Mrs. Marry. The government did not prevent this. On February 14th, the laying of the tracks reached one-third of a mile, and the company hung out a small engine with the name Pioneer. When the first train ran, thousands of Chinese people went to watch. This was the beginning of the realization of the railway in our country. At the time, officials and commoners were superstitious and very alarmed by such novel things. They called it a kind of magic. The Shanghai Daotai (circuit intendant) forced the company to stop the train for a month, waiting for instructions from the Beijing government. The company was allowed to reopen the railway, but opposition arose again. When Jardine Matheson built the railway, they agreed with Chinese officials and commoners that they would not use steam power. Jardine Matheson did not keep its promise and used locomotives for power, which aroused public anger. After the trains were running, many workers were disturbed by the constant whistling of the steam whistle, and the opposition became more intense. Local officials also opposed the railway, and the situation became very serious. The company continued to push forward with the railway construction. The section from Shanghai to Jiangwan was completed and tested on June 30th. On July 1st, foreigners were invited to ride the train. On July 3rd, the railway was officially opened to traffic. There were six round trips a day. The fare was divided into first, second, and third class. There were as many as seven passenger cars. Residents of Shanghai found the matter very novel, and many went back and forth to ride the train. However, the general public thought that the train was a nuisance and had no good feelings about it. Once, the train company, together with its workers, used bamboo fences to occupy a piece of vacant land near Jiangwan belonging to a certain person, which aroused public anger. The dilapidated straw huts there were beaten down. On August 3rd, the train was testing back and forth on the north side of Jiangwan when it ran over a soldier on the road. The villagers were very frightened. Therefore, Shanghai Daotai Taiwan Shao-guang, following the instructions from Beijing, informed the British consul and asked the company to stop the train. The British consul refused. At the same time, Jiangnan Governor Shen Baozhen also informed the British consul to stop the train, but the British consul ignored him. As a result, officials and commoners hated the train even more. After much debate, the British consul replied: "Temporarily suspend operations and wait for the British minister in Yantai to discuss with Governor-General Li Hongzhang."

As for the current Songhu Railway, in September of the 22nd year of Guangxu (early October 1896), Liangjiang Governor and Nanyang Minister Zhang Zhidong cited the example of the Beiyang Military Railway and proposed to build the Wusong-Nanjing Railway. That month, the Jiangnan Governor again joined forces with Hubei Governor Wang Wenshao to request the construction of the Songhu line first. The imperial court approved it and appointed Sheng Xuanhuai as the director-general. The project began on the 16th day of the first month of the 23rd year of Guangxu (February 17, 1897) and was completed on the 18th day of the sixth month (August 5th) of the following year. The opening ceremony was held the next day, and the railway was opened to traffic on the 16th day of the seventh month (September 1st). From demolition to reconstruction, twenty-one years had passed, which can be said to have been a long and arduous journey.

### The Origin of the Shanghai British Concession

— Le Xiuliang

In 1685 (the 24th year of the Kangxi reign), China opened its maritime borders, and Shanghai established the Jianghai Customs, allowing foreign trade. However, in 1723 (the first year of the Yongzheng reign), an order was issued restricting foreign merchants to trade only in Guangzhou. Consequently, Shanghai was closed again. At that time, British merchants were very dissatisfied with the narrow market in Guangzhou and repeatedly sent people to Shanghai to investigate and ascertain the opinions of Chinese officials, but without any results. In 1793 and 1806, the British government specifically sent special envoys to China, repeatedly requesting the opening of a port, but they were all rejected. In 1832, the East India Company also sent Lin Tese, accompanied by an interpreter, northward from Macau, heading towards Shanghai. On June 21st, Lin Tese, with great effort, finally met with officials at the Tianhou Temple and presented a request. Two weeks later, he was forced to leave Shanghai and head north. After returning home, in his report, he claimed that Shanghai was the best trading port. As a result, the British became even more determined to open up Shanghai as a hub for their country's goods in the North China market.

In 1840 (the 20th year of the Daoguang reign), Britain started the so-called Opium War in Guangzhou. Naval Commander Parker and Officer Gough led warships, steamers, and 4,000 ground troops to invade the coast northward. In 1842 (April of the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign), Zhapu was captured. On June 9th, British troops arrived at the Wusong estuary. At that time, Governor Niu Jian oversaw troops while General Doushan defended the east fort of Wusong, and Commander Chen Huacheng defended the west fort. Chen Huacheng, with his experience, calmly responded, and the British troops repeatedly failed. Then, they shifted their target, using flying cannons to attack the east fort. Halfway through, Doushan, terrified and helpless, abandoned his armor and fled into Baoshan City with the Henan Adjutant. The British troops then landed from the east fort and concentrated their forces to fiercely attack the west fort. Chen Huacheng bravely resisted but unfortunately was hit by a bullet and died. The west fort ultimately fell. The British troops, taking advantage of their victory, attacked Baoshan. Niu Jian abandoned the city and fled again, and Baoshan was taken by the British troops.

When Shanghai received the alarm, officials such as the Sub-Prefect secretly fled, and merchants and residents evacuated. On the 19th, British troops took Shanghai directly by land and water, encountering no resistance along the way. They entered the city through Jingmen and stationed at the City God Temple. A few days later, a large contingent of British troops arrived from Hong Kong. At that time, the Qing government wanted to negotiate peace with Britain, willing to redeem Shanghai for 30 million yuan, but it was rejected. On the 23rd, British troops again departed from Shanghai to participate in the war in the upper reaches of the Yangtze River, bombarding Zhenjiang and approaching Nanjing. On August 9th, the Chinese side announced a ceasefire and negotiated peace with Britain.

On August 29th, Chinese Imperial Commissioner Ili Bu and British plenipotentiary Pottinger signed the Treaty of Nanjing on the HMS Cornwallis, stipulating the opening of five ports for trade, marking the beginning of the first unequal treaty between China and foreign countries. On November 17th of the same year, Shanghai formally announced the opening of the port. The first consul was Balfour, and the consulate was located in the large residence of the Gu family in Xijiazhai.

On October 8th of the following year, both parties signed the Supplementary Treaty of Commerce and Navigation, also known as the Treaty of Humen, at Humen, which had even further provisions than the Treaty of Nanjing. The treaty only stated that British people could rent houses to live in and lease land to build houses in Shanghai and other five ports. This needed to be deliberated and decided by the local officials of each place and the British consul, taking into account the local conditions, and foreigners could not overstep these boundaries to prevent misunderstandings with the local people...

Later, on June 26, 1858, China and Britain signed the Treaty of Tianjin, which also only meant "unimpeded trade."

The term "concession" first appeared in a formal treaty in the Yantai Treaty signed between China and Britain on September 13, 1876 (the second year of the Guangxu reign). The second paragraph of its third article states: "In the old and new ports, except for the established foreign concessions, there is no need to discuss them. In places where concessions have not been established, the British consulate should consult with the consuls of various countries and discuss with the local officials to demarcate the boundaries of the places where foreigners reside." This recognized the existence of concessions, but the so-called concession was originally just a designated area where foreigners were allowed to reside, equivalent to a foreign residential area.

Since Shanghai was opened as a British trading port, there would inevitably be lawsuits between British merchants and between British merchants and Chinese people. Regarding the handling of such lawsuits, there were provisions for so-called consular jurisdiction. The Treaty of Humen stated that "the method of punishing British merchants shall be determined by British regulations and laws, issued to the supervisors for implementation, and the method of punishing Chinese people shall be based on Chinese law..." Although this article did not specifically stipulate consular jurisdiction, it clearly stipulated the duties of consuls in handling lawsuits. Article 16 of the Treaty of Tianjin stipulated that "British people who commit crimes shall be punished by Britain, and Chinese people who bully or disturb British people shall be punished by Chinese local officials. In cases involving the two countries, both parties must jointly and fairly investigate and judge." By this time, British consular jurisdiction in China was clearly stipulated in detail.

Shortly after the British consul arrived in Shanghai, he set his sights on establishing a concession. Because the treaty did not clearly stipulate the method of leasing land, the British consul made an unreasonable demand for land, which was not allowed under Chinese law, and no agreement was reached. Later, the British consul and the Shanghai Circuit Intendant negotiated several times. Finally, on November 29, 1845, Circuit Intendant Gong Muyuan published a public notice in his own name. He and the British consul "agreed upon in accordance with the treaty." The notice stated: "Now, considering the sentiments of the people and taking into account the local conditions of Shanghai, the land north of the Yangjingbang and south of Lijiazhuang is designated to be leased to British merchants for the construction of houses and residences. All agreed-upon regulations are hereby promulgated as follows, and all must abide by them without violation."

Although the name Yangjingbang still exists, it was filled in 1915 and is now known as Edward Road. Lijiazhuang is now the area of Beijing Road. The eastern boundary was recognized as the Huangpu River, and the western boundary was not clearly defined. This area was mostly cultivated farmland, with some lower-lying wetlands, crisscrossed by streams and covered with reeds in summer. At that time, the land price was approximately 15,000 to 35,000 cash coins per mu.

Following the above notice, 23 land regulations were also promulgated. The most significant point was the confirmation and repeated recognition of the Chinese people as the "owners of the land," that is, China's sovereignty over the land. The Chinese government collected a small amount of land tax annually, and the land deeds needed to be stamped by the Chinese government to have legal effect.

On September 24, 1846, the four boundaries of the concession were defined: east to the Huangpu River, south to the Yangjingbang, west to Jielu (now Henan Road), and north to Lijiazhuang (now Beijing Road). The total area was 830 mu.

On November 27, 1848, British Consul Alcock and Shanghai Circuit Intendant Lin Gui signed an agreement, revising the boundaries. The southeastern boundary was the Yangjingbang Bridge, the northeastern boundary was the first ferry at Suzhou Road, the southwestern boundary was the Zhoujingbang, and the northwestern boundary was the Su residence on the Suzhou Creek. The total area increased to 2,820 mu.

### The Origin of the Shanghai French Concession

— Yu Xiuru

(1) The Process of Creation

Since the end of the Opium War in 1842 (the 22nd year of the Daoguang reign), when China and Britain signed the so-called "Treaty of Nanjing," the great powers, taking advantage of China's open door, came to sign trade treaties. France naturally "did not want to lag behind." Subsequently, on December 12, 1843, it specially sent Plenipotentiary Minister Lagrené, accompanied by staff and three warships, to China. On August 13, 1844, they arrived in Macau. After Lagrené arrived, he negotiated with China. After two months, on October 24th of the same year, the Treaty of Whampoa was signed. On August 25th of the following year, the instruments of ratification were formally exchanged in Macau.

The Treaty of Whampoa had a total of 36 articles. Article 2 stated: "All French people residing in the five ports according to Article 2, regardless of the number of people, shall be allowed to rent houses and warehouses for storing goods, or lease land to build their own houses and businesses... Local officials of various places shall consult with the consular officials to determine the land suitable for French people to live and build on... Chinese officials shall prevent inland people from raising rents excessively, and French consular officials shall also carefully prevent their own nationals from forcibly suppressing rents."

The first French Consul, Montigny, formally presented a note to the Chinese Daotai, first citing the provisions of Article 22 of the Treaty of Whampoa, and then explaining that "due to the requests of nationals to lease land, according to the treaty, and after studying the location that should be leased, it is the right bank of the Yangjingbang, from the village on the edge of the city to the location needed in the future. Please give the same treatment as other countries, immediately designate the scope of the Shanghai French Concession, and send a notary to estimate the value of the land to be purchased by the Rémi trading house for French merchants, and immediately send someone to inspect the place with Rémi to demarcate the four boundaries."

Daotai Lin could not withstand his pressure and urgently sent people to contact Montigny, coercing Chinese landlords to cede their land. Finally, on January 8, 1849, they succeeded, leasing a total of 2 mu, 3 fen, 8 li, and 5 hao of land, totaling 457 yuan and 3,758 cash coins. This land leasing negotiation took eight months. Thus, the first foundation had been laid, and the basic form of the French Concession was already in place.

This land lease notice was signed and exchanged by China and France on April 6, 1849. Daotai Lin issued the official posting, and the determined land boundaries were: south to the city moat outside the North Gate of Shanghai, north to the Yangjingbang, west to the Guandi Temple at Zhujia Bridge, and east to the Guangdong Chaozhou Guild Hall along the river to the eastern corner of the Yangjingbang.

In this way, the French Concession was established. At this time, the total number of French people in Shanghai by the beginning of 1850 was only ten. On June 10, 1852, Montigny, the founder of the Shanghai French Concession, was finally recalled to his country. Now, there is a Montigny Embankment Road in the French Concession from Nanyang Bridge to the Great World, which is to commemorate him.

(2) The First Expansion

On May 25, 1861, French Consul Étienne received instructions from the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs, stipulating that the French Royal Mail Steamship Company had agreed with the Ministry of Finance to exclusively operate the transportation of mail in Vietnam. Because there was a major route, it was necessary to connect with Shanghai. The Steamship Company needed to set aside 30 mu of land along the river in the Shanghai French Concession for its use, and Étienne was ordered to proceed immediately. After receiving the order, Étienne thought of the opportunity to expand the concession, so on September 11, 1861, he reported to the French Minister Bourboulon in Beijing, meaning: "The plan to expand the concession has reached the time for implementation... It is best to proceed through Prince Gong in Beijing, asking him to issue an edict to execute the cession of the land outside the Xiaodongmen."

Minister Bourboulon approved Étienne's request and immediately contacted Prince Gong. On August 1st, he directly sent a note to the Zongli Yamen, requesting that the Shanghai local officials be instructed to designate a piece of land of about 34 mu along the river and that the Shanghai Daotai should immediately issue a notice to the people, stating that the land that France could lease was from the Xiaodongmen adjacent to the county seat, directly connecting the small river along the Huangpu River as the southern boundary.... Three days after the note was issued, the Zongli Yamen replied that it had sent a letter to the Governor of Jiangsu to deliberate and handle the matter quickly. Then, on October 17th, Minister Bourboulon ordered Étienne, saying, "The south side of the French Concession can be extended to the river outside the Xiaodongmen, all the way to the land along the Huangpu River." At the same time, he attached the edict issued by Prince Gong to the Governor of Jiangsu, asking Étienne to hand it to the Daotai in person for immediate execution.

Étienne further sent a note to Daotai Wu on October 29, 1861, asking him to faithfully execute it. Daotai Wu, after receiving the note, immediately issued a notice the next day, acknowledging the expansion of the French Concession.

The purchase of land by the French Steamship Company was thus successful, with a total of 34 mu purchased. Another 6 mu were purchased at the old French naval dock in Wusong. Later, the Steamship Company abandoned this land, which was then respectively taken over by the Banque de Paris et des Pays-Bas and the Banque de l'Indochine. This expansion extended the shoreline of the French Concession along the Bund by 650 meters, and the concession area also expanded to 59 hectares.

(3) The Second Expansion

Before the second bloodbath at the Siming Public Cemetery, the French Concession authorities had the ambition to expand the concession. On March 4, 1898, French Consul General Basset sent an official document to Daotai Cai Jun, proposing negotiations to expand the French Concession, but there were no results at the time.

On May 12, 1898, French Consul General Basset telegraphed General Manager Boullard, stating that he intended to establish a French Concession in Wusong, and asked all directors to express their opinions. The French Board of Directors unanimously approved Basset's proposal at the regular meeting on June 1, 1898. At the regular meeting on June 22, 1898, it was also decided to send a letter to Consul Basset, asking him to expedite the negotiations to expand the concession.

After the second bloodbath at the Siming Public Cemetery, the French took the opportunity to present the desire to expand the concession as a specific request. At that time, the scope of expansion requested by the French side included the area of Sixteen Pulis, the area outside the West Gate of Shanghai County, the area of Baxianqiao west of the French Concession, a part of Pudong, and a part of Wusong. The Chinese authorities actually agreed to this proposal in principle on July 24, 1898. In June 1899, French Consul General Basset and the Chinese Governor-General of Liangjiang secretly agreed on the boundaries of the concessions to be expanded and made a memorandum for record.

At this time, Britain and France in Europe were in conflict over various rights issues, so the opposition to the expansion of the French Concession was not from the owner, China. Britain repeatedly protested to the French side about France's request to expand the concession and issued warning notes to the Chinese government. The Chinese side could not stand the trouble, so it instructed the Chinese Minister to Britain to request the British Foreign Office to transfer the case to direct negotiations between Britain and France.

Britain repeatedly dealt with the issue with a tough attitude, and France finally conceded. However, the French diplomatic means were very clever. When the environment was unfavorable, it did not hesitate to suspend the expansion plan that had been negotiated in order to ease the atmosphere with the British. After efforts from all sides, the expansion of the French Concession finally succeeded.

In June 1899, Basset was actually able to agree with the commissioners sent by the Governor-General of Liangjiang on the new site for the French Concession to be expanded and made a memorandum for record. According to the contents of this memorandum, the new boundaries of the French Concession were: "North to Beichangbang (now Section 4 of Avenue Édouard VII), west to Guandi Temple at Gujiazhai (now the northern section of Rue Lupan and Route Boileau), south to Datiebang (now Route Paul Beau, Route Boileau, and Route Pichon), and east to Chenghebang (now the southwestern section of Minquan Road)."

On December 28, 1899, the French Minister to China sent a note to the Zongli Yamen, requesting that the Governor-General of Liangjiang and the Shanghai Daotai be quickly instructed to comply. The Governor-General of Liangjiang then sent Commissioner Yu Mou and foreign advisor Ferguson to Shanghai to assist Daotai Yu Lianyuan in demarcating the boundaries. After receiving the order, Daotai Yu, together with Advisor Ferguson and others, negotiated various conditions for the newly expanded concession with French Consul Basset. Afterwards, at the request of Consul General Basset, Daotai Yu issued a notice on January 27, 1900, announcing the expanded boundaries of the French Concession, which were: east to Chenghebang, west to Guandi Temple at Gujiazhai, south to Dinggong Bridge, Yangong Temple, and Datiebang, and north to Beichangbang.

The second expansion of the French Concession was successful.

In 1900, the total area of the French Concession was only 1,023 mu, approximately 69 hectares. The newly added area was 1,112 mu, approximately 75 hectares. The combined area of the old and new concessions was 2,135 mu, approximately 144 hectares. At this time, the French Concession had more than doubled in size compared to before.

On July 30, 1943, the entire French Concession was returned, and this part of the land returned to the embrace of our country.

### The Past Chinese Ratepayers Associations in the Two Concessions

— Yang Nianmu

On January 9th of this year, our country automatically joined the war, and our friendly nation, Japan, immediately announced its moral stance of returning the concessions in China and abolishing extraterritoriality. Other friendly nations, such as France and Italy, were not far behind and made similar expressions. These statements were subsequently put into practice one by one. Recently, the governments of Japan, France, and Italy have successively concluded agreements with our authorities to return the administrative rights of the Shanghai International Settlement, the French Concession, and the Tianjin Italian Concession. From today onwards, China will no longer have the shameful name of "concession" and will regain its original face of independence and autonomy. This is something to be celebrated! At the same time, the Chinese Ratepayers Associations of the two concessions, which have strived for more than 20 years to "develop concession autonomy, seek common interests, and equal treatment," have also honorably retired after successfully completing their missions. Here, in addition to expressing our deep respect to the past leaders of the association, we would like to briefly describe the past history of the association, hoping to be a glimpse into the clamor for the return of concessions and to serve as a mirror for the future political participation of the people, "continuing what is good and changing what is not good."

International Settlement

The participation of Chinese people in the Shanghai Municipal Council did not start with the Chinese Ratepayers Association. As early as 1866, Chinese commercial organizations and others had elected three representatives as advisory bodies for matters relating to Chinese residents, but they were purely advisory in nature. The issue of Chinese political participation was first formally raised in 1906 by Mr. Yu Qiaqing, who proposed to organize a Chinese Merchants Advisory Committee to represent the interests of various guilds. Although the board of directors of the Municipal Council expressed their approval, it was opposed by the foreign Ratepayers Meeting and did not materialize. The second time was in the fourth year of the Republic of China (1915), when the Chinese government and the consular corps discussed the draft treaty for the extension of the International Settlement, hoping to establish an advisory committee before the addition of Chinese directors to the Municipal Council, which would be organized by five representatives elected by officials and civilians. Although this draft treaty was accepted by the ratepayers, it was never approved, and the advisory committee's plan was never implemented.

In the eighth year of the Republic of China, the Chinese Ratepayers Association shouted the slogan "No Representation, No Taxation" in opposition to tax increases. As a result, the foreign Ratepayers Meeting allowed the establishment of a Chinese Ratepayers Association and formed a "Chinese Advisory Committee" in the following year. The committee had five members, who were elected by the Chinese Ratepayers Association, but they had no real power and were only for advisory purposes.

In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, the "May Thirtieth" Massacre occurred, and the entire Chinese Advisory Committee resigned on June 6th to show their protest. During the negotiations, the Chinese government also raised the demand for the Municipal Council to accommodate Chinese directors. After years of compromise, foreigners began to change their long-standing attitude of ignoring Chinese public opinion, and opinions gradually converged. In the fifteenth year, the foreign Ratepayers Meeting passed a proposal to establish three Chinese directors and six Chinese committee members. These directors and committee members officially took office in March of the seventeenth year. In the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, the number of Chinese directors increased to five, and the number of Chinese committee members also increased to nine, and so on until today.

The Ratepayers Association had very strict restrictions on membership qualifications (must have resided in the International Settlement for five years, have assets of 500 taels, and pay more than 10 taels in taxes annually). Its power organ was the General Assembly of Representatives, which had a total of 81 representatives, including 27 members of the Ratepayers Association and 27 members each from fellow-villager industrial groups. The Chinese directors and committee members were elected from these 81 people. According to a survey in the nineteenth year of the Republic of China, there were more than 10,000 qualified ratepayers in the International Settlement, but only about 3,000 members of the two ratepayers associations. Moreover, these 3,000 members could only elect 27 representatives to participate in the 81-member General Assembly of Representatives, which greatly deviated from the original intention of ratepayers participating in politics. No wonder some people said that the Ratepayers Association, at best, only represented the anger of a small number of the bourgeoisie.

French Concession

As for the French Concession, although the "French Concession Organizational Law" stipulated that "the Consul General, in consultation with the Daotai, shall appoint one or several Chinese leaders, who, after being approved by the Conseil d'Administration Municipale, may attend meetings and express opinions, but shall not have the right to vote," before the Republic of China used 800 hectares of land-rights to obtain two directors who could not attend the board meetings in the third year of the Republic of China, there had never been a Chinese representative participating in the administrative affairs of the Conseil d'Administration Municipale.

In the fifteenth year of the Republic of China, when the prestige of the National Revolutionary Army had not yet reached Shanghai, the General Manager of the French Concession, in accordance with the provisions of the Sino-French Agreement of the third year of the Republic of China, added two Chinese directors to the board of directors, which was the beginning of the political participation of Chinese people in the French Concession. The Chinese Ratepayers Association was created in response to this. The membership qualifications were slightly more reasonable than those in the International Settlement, and there were provisions that those who were illiterate, engaged in improper occupations, had been criminally punished, or had been deprived of their civil rights could not participate.

As a result of the continuous efforts of the Ratepayers Association, the number of Chinese directors was increased to five in the following year (the sixteenth year of the Republic of China), and six advisors were added to the Conseil d'Administration Municipale. From the nineteenth year of the Republic of China onwards, the number of advisors was increased to nine, and thereafter, the Chinese Ratepayers Association became the sole organ representing the Chinese people within the concession.

In summary, it can be seen that the Chinese Ratepayers Associations in the two concessions in the past had already possessed a rudimentary form of popular political participation. However, the power could not be fully exerted, and they only represented a small part of the citizens. This was their shortcoming. In recent times, the call for the establishment of public opinion organs in Shanghai has been increasing. We sincerely hope that those in charge will think from multiple perspectives and expand the powers granted to them as much as possible, so that they can truly live up to their name and fulfill their mission. Millions of citizens in the city have high hopes for this.
