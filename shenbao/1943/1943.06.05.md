### Re-Examination of the Merits and Demerits of Coeducation

The reason for raising this question of "Re-examination of the merits and demerits of coeducation" today is that coeducation is already practiced in universities, middle schools, and primary schools. Naturally, it is believed that coeducation has more advantages than disadvantages. Therefore, by raising this question, even before we point out the merits and demerits, some people, or perhaps most people, may say that it is extremely inappropriate, and even accuse us of going against the tide, turning back the clock, restoring feudal ideas, and destroying gender equality. However, everything, from theoretical verification to facts, often fails to achieve the same theoretical results due to differences in environmental conditions. Therefore, the theory that coeducation is extremely beneficial may not yield results as advantageous as predicted due to the lack of coordination with environmental conditions. In other words, the coeducation system is not extremely beneficial and still has its drawbacks, at least in China, especially in Shanghai, which has a unique social structure.

The coeducation system originated in North America in the mid-19th century and became popular. Subsequently, the trend gradually spread to countries around the world. According to Ms. Wu Shuban (Ph.D. in Educational Philosophy from Ohio State University in the United States), "There are three key factors why coeducation can be practiced in North America without hindrance: Firstly, the newly established republic lacks the vestiges of ancient customs; Secondly, the development of 'democracy' awakened the consciousness of women; Thirdly, the industrial revolution, the development of science, and the affluence of the country allowed everyone to have the opportunity to receive education. With these three major reasons, it was possible to eliminate the traditions of the past, open up new paths in education, and initiate the trend of coeducation. Since its implementation, it has achieved considerable results. As for its disadvantages, they have been eliminated by improving school facilities, teaching methods, and various activities. As a result, it enhances the morality of young men and women, clarifies the responsibilities of life, promotes mutual respect and encouragement, and greatly benefits their physical and mental well-being and academic performance." Based on this, the benefits of coeducation have reached their peak, developing to the point of "clarifying the responsibilities of life, mutual respect, and mutual encouragement," and its effectiveness lies in the above-mentioned three major reasons.

Looking back at our country's imitation of the coeducation system, it has been in place for many years. Has it reached the stage of "mutual respect and mutual encouragement," and "enhancing the morality of young men and women, and clarifying the responsibilities of life"? If this stage has not been reached, and even the opposite is achieved, then does it mean that China's social environment is different from that of North America and does not possess the three major reasons for success mentioned above? We do not have a deep understanding of this issue and will leave it to the school authorities and the young people in coeducation to answer.

Shanghai is the place with the most secondary schools in the country, and the problems of coeducation are most likely to occur in secondary schools. Recently, we often receive letters from parents of both boys and girls regarding this issue, and their expressions of regret are unanimous. Some say that their sons are distracted and do not focus on their studies, go to movies and dances with girls, secretly take money from home, often have photos of the opposite sex and corny love letters in their pockets, and fail their report cards at the end of the semester. Some say that their daughters love to dress up, wear makeup, act strangely, are immune to discipline, talk about freedom, and indulge in love, etc. Who doesn't have children, and who doesn't want them to succeed? As parents, their expectations for coeducation lie in "mutual respect and mutual encouragement, enhancing the morality of young men and women, and clarifying the responsibilities of life." If, because of the opportunity of coeducation, they talk excessively about freedom, indulge in reckless love, do not seek advancement in their studies, but use it as a competitive arena, the drawbacks will not only make parents wary of sending their children to coeducation, but will also affect the future of education. Although we cannot immediately say that this phenomenon is general and widespread, we cannot ignore the development of this fact.

It is undeniable that Shanghai's social structure is a trap of extravagance and debauchery, which is everywhere and easily lures youths with weak wills to fall. Although it can be said that young men and women do not necessarily indulge in reckless love because of coeducation, as there are opportunities to fall everywhere in society. However, we must admit that due to the inherent relationship between male and female students, it is easier to indulge in reckless love by taking advantage of this social environment. Therefore, the fact that young men and women do not focus on their studies but indulge in reckless love is not an absolute drawback of coeducation, but it cannot be said that there is absolutely no relationship. In other words, the extremely favorable theory of coeducation may not yield results as advantageous as predicted due to the lack of coordination with environmental conditions.

Is the coeducation system absolutely suitable in China? The entire theory of its benefits involves at least the content of education, sociology, and psychology. We frankly say that we do not have in-depth research on this and dare not make a definitive conclusion. However, the reality we can hear and see is that in the current social environment of Shanghai, coeducation is, in most people's opinions, a fact that has more disadvantages than advantages. We do not make any special claims because of this, such as fundamentally abolishing the coeducation system, or that coeducation is absolutely disadvantageous. However, we sincerely raise this question, hoping that the education authorities and school authorities, especially teachers responsible for discipline, will pay close attention to the development of the facts and jointly discuss remedial measures.

Finally, we take this opportunity to sincerely advise the young students in coeducation in middle schools and universities: The country is seeking survival from death, and the future depends on you to be the pillars in the torrent and the backbone of revival. The responsibility is of utmost importance. Pursue your studies, work hard to accumulate talent, respect and encourage each other, value reason and suppress emotions, comfort your parents, and repay the country. This is the only great path.

### Marshal Yamamoto's State Funeral Held Today; President Wang Broadcasts Condolences Yesterday; Heads of State of China, Manchukuo, Thailand, and Axis Powers Express Condolences in Rotational Broadcast Last Night

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - In order to express condolences to Marshal Yamamoto of Japan, the Axis powers broadcast eulogies from their respective radio stations at 9 p.m. on the 4th. In order, the broadcast was first delivered by Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo, followed by President Wang, concurrently President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of China, Prime Minister Pibulsonggram of Thailand, and representatives of other countries in Greater East Asia. Subsequently, Naval Commander-in-Chief Admiral Karl Dönitz of Germany and Deputy Secretary of the Navy Count Emilio Barbarich of Italy broadcast their messages, concluding around 10 p.m.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Marshal Isoroku Yamamoto, Admiral of the Japanese Navy, died heroically in defense of East Asia. The Japanese government has posthumously granted him a state funeral, which will be held in Tokyo today (5th). Our government, recognizing Yamamoto's contributions to East Asia, has not only awarded him a special-class medal but also had the President of the Executive Yuan broadcast a eulogy on the 4th. The original text is recorded as follows: "Our friendly nation Japan is holding a state funeral for Marshal Yamamoto, Commander-in-Chief of the Combined Fleet, who died heroically on the front lines. Our government and people, standing on the same front, mourn this unparalleled hero for East Asia and, at the same time, feel boundless hope for the future of the Greater East Asia War. We feel that having such a great figure standing on the front lines, eternally commanding and encouraging the emerging East Asian comrades to advance courageously, the Greater East Asia War will surely receive the guarantee of victory and achieve its goal. In addition to mourning, we are also overwhelmed with excitement. The Japanese Navy has long been the Great Wall at sea in East Asia. For a century, the continuous attacks by Britain and the United States towards East Asia have been blocked by this Great Wall at sea. When the Greater East Asia War broke out, the Japanese Navy displayed its bravery, shattered the U.S. naval base attacking East Asia at Pearl Harbor, and swept away the British fleet attacking East Asia near Singapore. As for the remnants across the East Pacific, South Seas, and even the Indian Ocean, the power of Britain and the United States was like fallen leaves meeting the autumn wind. The Japanese Navy, in cooperation with the Army and Air Force, laid the foundation for the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Marshal Yamamoto was the one in the Japanese Navy who assumed the highest command mission and established world-shaking achievements. His glory is the glory of Greater East Asia and is as immortal as heaven and earth. What is even more admirable is that Marshal Yamamoto, in the position of Commander-in-Chief, boarded a plane to go to the front lines and command operations, and was killed by enemy fire while calm. This spirit has further increased the admiration of the East Asian comrades. Recently, the isolated troops on Attu Island resisted ten times their number, and after killing and wounding many enemies, all died for their country without a single survivor, demonstrating the same spirit of Japanese generals and soldiers, and the same spirit of the Japanese Navy, Army, and Air Force. This spirit is what the East Asian nations must follow in order to win this war. Our country has already participated in the Greater East Asia War and has gone from sharing weal and woe with our friendly nation Japan to sharing life and death. Our government and people have long been determined to exert all their efforts for the Greater East Asia War. While reverently mourning Marshal Yamamoto, we wish to reaffirm this determination and continue Marshal Yamamoto's immortal spirit in order to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War."

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - After Marshal Yamamoto of Japan heroically sacrificed himself for his country, the Japanese government scheduled a state funeral for him today (June 5th). From 9:30 to 9:40 tonight, Minister Lin of the Propaganda Department will broadcast a message entitled "Mourning Marshal Yamamoto."

Beijing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Zhu Shen, Chairman of the North China Political Affairs Commission, issued a statement on the 4th, before the day of Marshal Yamamoto's state funeral, expressing his condolences.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Today is the day of the state funeral for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan. All government agencies, organizations, schools, and merchants in the city will lower their flags to half-mast to express their condolences.

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - The state funeral for the late Marshal Yamamoto of Japan is scheduled to be held today (5th). Mr. Lu Ronghuan, Ambassador of Manchukuo to China, issued a statement expressing his condolences.

Statement by Naval Attaché Maeda

Nanjing, 4th (Central News Agency) - Our friendly nation Japan will hold a grand state funeral for Marshal Yamamoto at Hibiya Park in Tokyo on the 5th. Rear Admiral Maeda, Japanese Naval Attaché to China, issued the following statement to the Japanese people: "Today is the day of Marshal Yamamoto's state funeral. As we recall Marshal Yamamoto's outstanding and unparalleled talent and his illustrious and immortal military achievements, we are filled with heartfelt sorrow and respect. At the same time, I personally feel infinitely moved by the various kindnesses I received from Marshal Yamamoto during his lifetime. Marshal Yamamoto gave the soldiers at the front and the people in the rear a strong sense of faith during his lifetime, and the enemy was terrified and frightened by this famous general. Now, as the war progresses, the people's trust in the marshal has deepened. Especially during this great war, there is no one in the navy who does not know the prestige of Commander-in-Chief Yamamoto, who enjoys the same fame as Commander Togo in the Russo-Japanese War. It is a pity to lose this famous general halfway through the war, but his death on the battlefield is heroic and unparalleled. As for a marshal, it is also the supreme glory of a warrior. Although the marshal sacrificed himself for the country, from now on, the marshal's heroic spirit will be deeply imprinted in the hearts of 100 million Japanese people. Although Marshal Yamamoto sacrificed only one person, this sacrifice gave birth to the souls of 100 million Yamamotos. The so-called protracted war is also a war of souls. The Japanese people all have the spirit of sacrificing themselves for the country to engage in the Greater East Asia War, so they can attack without fail and win every battle, and give full play to the Japanese people's traditional spirit and national patriotism, and the fighting spirit of the soldiers. Marshal Yamamoto's death in battle and the recent heroic sacrifice of the Japanese army on Attu Island are both prominent examples. Recalling the Russo-Japanese War, Marshal Togo said that there is a so-called honorable surrender, which is actually an attempt to cover up. Our soldiers will never confuse the words honor and surrender in any difficult situation. If we do not win, we will sacrifice ourselves. This is what our soldiers should strictly adhere to. There is no other way. There was a way to escape from Attu Island, but only by sacrificing in this way can the true essence of the Japanese army be fully displayed. In this great era, the Yamato spirit that surpasses the world has radiated brilliantly everywhere. Because 100 million people have risen up, the belief in victory has become stronger. Although Marshal Yamamoto is dead, his loyal soul is still concerned about the battlefield and us at all times. The spirit of command and the courage of heroic sacrifice during his lifetime are all the result of his usual cultivation. Our people should all remember this. On the occasion of the marshal's state funeral, we should especially learn from the marshal's loyalty and bravery and continue to work hard."

### German Side Sends Out Thousands of Aircraft to Heavily Bomb Key Points in the Central Section of the Eastern Front; German Troops in the Kalinin Region Break Through Soviet Positions; Fierce Battles Unfold Day and Night at the Kuban Bridgehead

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) The German military communique stated yesterday: "The Soviet army's large gathering ground in Kursk and the Soviet army's supply centers in the areas between Belgorod and Orel were all heavily bombed by the German Air Force."

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) Thousands of German aircraft heavily bombed the key city of Kursk in the central region of the Eastern Front on the 2nd, inflicting heavy damage on the city's military supply depots, ammunition depots, barracks, and stations, turning these targets into a sea of fire, and dropping a large number of bombs on the city. This air raid by the Air Force was the largest and most effective air raid in months. A total of 78 Soviet aircraft were shot down, and only 16 German aircraft were lost.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to Moscow reports, German troops launched a major offensive in the Kalinin region northwest of Moscow on the 3rd. After fierce fighting, they broke through Soviet positions. In addition, the Soviet army launched a local offensive in the Kursk region, and the fighting in the central and southern regions was also extremely active.

Stockholm, 4th (Central News Agency) Soviet troops launched fierce battles with German troops day and night in order to recapture the Kuban bridgehead. The Soviet offensive target is still the Krymskaya region, especially the narrow area from this place to Moldavanskaya, which they are determined to capture. On the morning of the 3rd, Soviet strong infantry units, covered by tanks, artillery, and air force, attempted to break through German positions. The German army immediately counterattacked and eventually crushed the joint attempt. In addition, although 15 Soviet tanks broke through the German front line, they were eventually surrounded and destroyed by the German army. According to the German authorities, although the Soviet army in the Kuban region has suffered heavy losses in recent days, it has not stopped attacking. The Soviet army is eager to capture the area because it believes that it is likely to form a weakness for the Soviet army after the large-scale operations are launched in the future.

### Japanese Aircraft Fly to New Guinea to Bomb Anti-Axis Positions; Australian Prime Minister Acknowledges Strength of Japanese Forces

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Melbourne, the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Command announced that Japanese air units attacked the Anti-Axis forces' positions at Coutante, 70 kilometers northwest of Port Moresby, on the 2nd. It was also learned that Japanese air units bombed Balde near Wau on New Guinea Island, causing considerable damage.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) According to news from Melbourne today, General MacArthur's headquarters announced that Japanese aircraft flew over New Guinea again on Tuesday and bombed the area known as "Dog Kennel." Official details of the air raid have not yet been disclosed.

Buenos Aires, 4th (Central News Agency) According to a report from Canberra, Australian Prime Minister Curtin explained the threat of the Japanese army on the 3rd as follows: "As a result of the Anti-Axis forces' consistent focus on the European front and the errors in propaganda methods, the people of the Anti-Axis countries have mistakenly regarded the Japanese as incompetent and weak. They are unaware of the vast territory occupied by the Japanese army. If the Anti-Axis forces continue to focus on the European front, they will enable the Japanese army to establish an absolutely invincible posture in a vast area, which will inevitably lead the Anti-Axis forces into extreme danger." In addition, General Blamey, Commander of the Southwest Pacific Anti-Axis Forces, also strongly cautioned Australians not to listen to American propaganda again or be overly optimistic about the prospects of the Pacific War. He said, "Because the Japanese army has increased its forces on the outer perimeter of the Pacific defense line on the Australian side and built solid bases, it is dangerous to underestimate the Japanese army's combat power. Even if we want to recapture New Guinea Island, the Anti-Axis forces must be prepared to go through a long and difficult battle."

Therefore, the progress of the national movement in Japan will become even more active.

### Roosevelt Issues Order - Limits Coal Miners to Return to Work - Plans to Exercise Commander-in-Chief Powers - Conscript All Coal Miners into Military Service

Lisbon, 4th (Central News) - According to a Washington dispatch, U.S. President Roosevelt issued an order on the 3rd to the nation's more than 500,000 striking coal miners, requiring them to return to work by the 7th of this month. Otherwise, the President is prepared to take even more severe action. It is said that the President's plan will involve exercising his powers as Commander-in-Chief during wartime and the authority under the Selective Service Act to the greatest extent possible. The possibility of employing miners in the military is currently being considered. The President's advisors believe that a show of military force would be sufficient to effectively end the strike. Chairman of the War Production Board Nelson pointed out two days ago that work at military factories has been gradually reduced due to a lack of fuel. At the same time, the House of Representatives is discussing a bill to crack down on strikes, but many amendments have been proposed, so a vote is unlikely before today. Representatives of major industries yesterday requested that complete blackout be implemented throughout the United States in cities and rural areas. They said that there is no indication that the strike will end soon, so blackout measures could extend the coal supply.

Argentina, Capital City, 4th (Central News Agency) - As the U.S. coal mine strike enters its third day, there is no sign of a solution. It is widely expected that U.S. government authorities may use military force to suppress the striking groups. If a solution is still not reached, the final measures may be taken. Whether coercive methods will be used is unknown, but one possibility is to directly conscript all coal miners into military service, allowing them to continue working as soldiers.

### Algiers Officially Announces - Establishment of "National Liberation Committee" - Three Senior Subordinates of Giraud Dismissed - Catroux Appointed Governor-General of Algeria

Lisbon, 4th (Central News) - It was officially announced in Algiers last night that after two and a half hours of negotiations between de Gaulle and Giraud yesterday morning, an agreement was reached to establish a "National Liberation Committee" consisting of seven members. However, the issue of Giraud's status as commander-in-chief of the French rebel forces remains to be resolved. de Gaulle declared to the press last night that the new committee will be chaired by Giraud and de Gaulle, with Catroux, Massigli, Philip, Georges, and Monnet as members. Three of Giraud's senior subordinates have been dismissed: Governor-General of Morocco Noguès, Commander of the North African Air Force Mendigal, and Commander of the West African Air Force Bergeret. Catroux has been appointed to succeed Peyrouton as Governor-General of Algeria, concurrently serving as Coordinator of Islamic Affairs. The position of Governor-General of Morocco will be succeeded by former High Commissioner of Syria Puaux. The positions of Commander of the North African Air Force and Commander of the West African Air Force will be concurrently held by Pousgault. The committee will be expanded in the future to increase the number of members. According to political circles in London, judging from the selected committee members, it can be presumed that de Gaulle clearly emerged victorious in yesterday's talks.

### Martial Law in Various Parts of Iraq

Erzurum, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to German news agencies, in view of the revolutionary movements in Sulaymaniyah and Kirkuk, Baghdad and several other provinces in Iraq have declared martial law.

### The German Air Force Returns with Renewed Vigor

(Special Correspondent Kehler, Berlin, 28th) - Since the withdrawal of the German-Italian Air Force from Tunisia, the situation on the African front no longer appears in the daily war reports released by the German military authorities. On the Eastern Front, there have only been skirmishes, local battles, and bombings of rear supply lines. Both Germany and the Soviet Union are on high alert, with tensions rising. Therefore, current interest is concentrated on the air war on the Western Front. The air war situation, in which Britain and the United States are on the offensive and Germany is on the defensive, may be about to change!

The British and American Air Forces Cannot Be Ignored

The indiscriminate bombing of Germany by the British and American air forces began this year. One after another, they carried out concentrated bombings of the western industrial zone, the northern German coast, and major German cities. During this period, the bombing of Berlin on March 1st was the largest since the start of the war, and the German people's concern about the skies gradually increased. The number of enemy planes shot down ranges from 15 to 20 on the low end to 30 on the high end. If the downing rate is said to be 5 to 10 percent, then at least 200 to 500 enemy planes are bombing Germany and its western territories every day. Therefore, the strength of the British and American air forces cannot be ignored. The amount of enemy bombs dropped on German soil has increased annually, averaging 2,600 tons per month in 1940, 4,200 tons in 1942, and reaching 10,000 tons in February 1943.

Damage Caused by Bombing

According to German reports, 482 enemy planes were shot down in Germany and the western occupied territories in April this year. Therefore, it can be estimated that at least 4,000 to 10,000 enemy planes attacked in April. From January to May, the daily number of enemy planes shot down, as announced, was over 30. Thus, at least 1,000 enemy planes were shot down in May, and the estimated number of enemy planes attacking reached at least 10,000 to 20,000. As such, the German Air Force, which once continuously bombed London for 57 days without interruption, causing enemy planes to disappear, must now devote all its strength to defending its own country. However, the German Air Force's current position is temporary. The British Air Force believes that the German Air Force suffered considerable blows in the war against the Soviet Union and in North Africa. Therefore, with the industrial power of the United States as its background, it has suddenly shifted to an active offensive. Britain and the United States believe that it is still difficult to open a second front on the European continent with a large landing force to reduce the burden on the Soviet Union. Therefore, they are concentrating all their efforts on heavy bombing as a substitute for the second front. What is the burden of this air offensive on Germany? To counter the British and American air forces on the Western Front, the number of pilots, ground personnel, anti-aircraft gun crews, and other personnel adds up to 750,000 troops. In addition, approximately 700,000 men and women are needed for communications, liaison, fire prevention, and rescue work. Germany has to spend so much manpower for domestic air defense, which is a burden it cannot avoid. In addition, Germany's military industrial cities, especially the military industrial zone in the west, have suffered considerable damage from the continuous indiscriminate bombing. However, the recent British and American air raids have not achieved the same effects as the initial attacks due to the progress of German air defense equipment and the increase in aviation personnel.

It is said that the damage caused to Germany by the British and American air raids is not as great as the damage inflicted on Britain by the German Air Force's bombing of London at the beginning of the war. According to British reports, the German Air Force dropped 36,000 bombs on London in the three months from September 1940, killing 12,669 people and destroying 500,000 homes in the British Isles, with one in five homes being destroyed. Compared to the damage suffered by Britain, the damage suffered by Germany is extremely minor.

The Air Fortress Has Lost Its Effectiveness

The British and American air raids on Germany will inevitably become more intense in the future. The morale and awareness of the German people in the face of air raids everywhere demonstrate the calm attitude of a great nation, which is enough to prove that the air war is not the decisive factor in determining the outcome of the war. Moreover, according to reports of British and American planes shot down by German planes, the power of the American Boeing B-17 four-engine heavy bomber (Air Fortress) is not as great as Britain and the United States claim. U.S. Air Force expert Major General Miguel wrote a book entitled "Recent European Air War," stating: "The era of Air Fortresses and other four-engine heavy bombers has passed. Germany is strengthening its air defenses with anti-aircraft guns and fighters. In air combat, the Air Fortress shows a loss rate of 20 to 1 against German planes. It was previously said that the Air Fortress was the result of revolutionary military aircraft improvement, but this is completely contrary to the facts." According to recent German reports, the downing rate of British and American planes has gradually increased recently. Initially, only about 5 percent of the attacking enemy planes were shot down, but recently it has reached about 10 percent. According to recent reports from the German military authorities, in the bombing of Dortmund on May 24, 44 of the approximately 300 attacking enemy planes were shot down by anti-aircraft guns and night fighters, or about 15 percent. The loss of British and American pilots, estimated at about 10,000 based on the loss of about 400 aircraft in April and 1,000 aircraft in May, is also a difficult problem to replenish. The German army, which has temporarily halted the war against Britain and concentrated all its efforts on the war against the Soviet Union, has recently shown a tendency to shift its focus back to the air war against Britain. In addition to strengthening its defenses to counter the attacks of British and American planes, the German Air Force will also actively bomb London and the British Isles as it did in the past, or even more intensely.

The German Air Force, Resting and Gathering Strength

Recently, new bombs with extremely powerful new capabilities, which have become a topic of discussion, will play an important role in the new German air offensive. Recently, the German Air Force used very few attack aircraft to attack London, but the destructive power caused the British to tremble. The bombs used destroyed all buildings within a diameter of 700 to 800 meters, surpassing the British's boasted four-ton bombs. The German Air Force has also recently begun mass-producing four-engine large bombers similar to the American "Air Fortress," and the required fuel has been accumulated, enough for major operations this year. Factories are gradually moving from the bombed areas in the west to safe areas, and new factories are being actively built. The power consumed in the war against the Soviet Union for the past two years has been accumulated again. The German Air Force is eyeing the summer situation on the Eastern Front with new formations and new weapons, preparing to return with renewed vigor and regain a major air offensive. Whether the target is in the East or the West cannot be judged at this time, but it seems more likely that it will bomb London and the British Isles again in order to counter the British and American bombing war.

Drama Performance to Raise Funds

Colleagues from small newspapers have organized the "North China Disaster Relief Association Sponsored by Small Newspaper Colleagues" to handle North China disaster relief matters. Ten newspapers, including Shanghai Daily, Li Bao, Hai Bao, Society Daily, Oriental Daily, Ji Bao, Robin Hood, Opera Daily, Opera World, and Prosperity Daily, are the natural initiators. Thirty-two preparatory committee members, fifteen drama committee members, and twelve publicity committee members have been appointed to be responsible for handling the charity drama performance.

Letters from Various Sectors

Mr. Chen Hongquan of China Cloth Industry Bank is enthusiastic about disaster relief and has donated twice. Yesterday, we received a letter from him saying, "I have received your letter and fully understand its contents. The drought in North China has caused widespread starvation and unprecedented suffering, urgently in need of relief. Your newspaper has written articles appealing to various sectors to raise relief funds, sparing no effort, and I deeply admire your enthusiasm for public welfare and effective leadership. Upon hearing the news, my colleagues at the bank expressed deep sympathy and remitted 2,000 yuan of national currency yesterday, requesting your newspaper to transfer it. I have now received your kind instructions, and I further admire your compassion for others. I am hereby sending another 2,000 yuan of national currency, hoping to make a small contribution and fulfill your kind request." Mr. Qian Shiqing and Mr. Yuan Qiyuan are willing to auction their family's collection of calligraphy and paintings for charity. A letter reads, "A friend from the north came to Shanghai and talked about the severe disaster situation in Hebei, Shandong, and Henan, where tree bark and grass roots have been eaten, and I have repeatedly seen your newspaper's fundraising for the northern disaster area. Your compassionate efforts are truly admirable. Although I am troubled by economic difficulties, everyone has a heart of compassion. I intend to auction a large center scroll of ink peonies painted by Li Di, with a limited price of 3,000 yuan, and 20 copies of "Complete Works of Shiqing," priced at 100 yuan each, totaling 2,000 yuan, and donate all the proceeds to North China disaster relief. Donors can directly obtain books and indirectly relieve disaster victims, achieving both goals. Qian Shiqing." "I recently saw in the newspaper that the disaster in North China has left the land filled with sorrowful cries, and the people are starving and waiting to be fed, a truly tragic situation. We are all of the same race, how can we bear to hear of it? Your newspaper is making every effort to appeal to the public to open their purses and help the disaster victims. I work at the post office and my income is very meager, making it difficult to fulfill my desire to help. However, I remember that my ancestors left behind a manuscript of Yun Shouping's boneless painting and a true work of Dong Qichang's calligraphy scroll. Since I do not have the means to have them properly framed and carefully preserved, I intend to entrust your newspaper with these humble items, with a minimum auction price of 2,000 yuan, and remit half of the proceeds for disaster relief, contributing a small token of my intent. I am sending this letter in advance. Yuan Qiyuan."

Buddhist Association Relief

In view of the severe disaster situation in North China, the Municipal Buddhist Association, in conjunction with temples and Buddhist Pure Land Societies, Buddhist laypersons' organizations, and other groups throughout the city, has initiated the organization of the Shanghai Buddhist Disaster Relief Association for North China, which will be established soon. It will make a significant contribution to disaster relief efforts.

### French Concession Authorities - Deny Discovery of Cholera

According to the Epidemic Prevention Department of the French Concession Health Office, rumors that true cholera cases have recently occurred in the French Concession are inaccurate. The French Concession has spared no effort in promoting epidemic prevention in recent months. Once cholera cases are discovered, the authorities will pay close attention to them. The current epidemic prevention authorities have heard nothing about cholera incidents. Therefore, the external rumors are unfounded. The police stations in the French Concession's Xiafei and other districts have largely announced the end of vaccination programs. Residents from the Southern City are subject to strict inspections of their vaccination certificates.

### French Concession to Test Air Raid Siren Today

According to an announcement by the French Concession authorities, the French Concession will test the air raid siren between 11:00 AM and 12:00 PM today.

### Three Japanese Authorities in Shanghai Jointly Host Press Corps Yesterday; Minister Hirota Discusses Significance of Japan's Extraordinary Diet Session: Leading the War Effort and Streamlining Japan's Domestic System

The three Japanese authorities in Shanghai—Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs—in order to focus on regular reports, specially held a joint reception for the Chinese press corps of this city, starting yesterday (the 4th). It was held at 5:00 PM at the Cathay Hotel on the Bund, Nanjing Road. First, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, delivered a speech on the significance of the three-day extraordinary Diet session to be held on the 15th of this month, and the connection between China's participation in the war and Sino-Japanese cooperation in the Greater East Asia War. Subsequently, spokespersons from the Army and Navy authorities gave brief reports one after another, and it was not until 7:30 PM that the meeting concluded.

Hirota's Speech: At the regular meeting of the joint reception held yesterday afternoon by the three Japanese authorities in Shanghai—Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs—for the Chinese press corps of this city, Hirota, the Information Minister of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, spoke on the significance of the extraordinary Diet session to be convened by the Japanese government on the 15th of this month, stating in brief: The Japanese government will hold a three-day extraordinary Diet session starting on the 15th of this month. At this stage of certain victory in the Greater East Asia War, this 82nd session is particularly significant in two respects: first, in order to complete this war, a policy of thoroughly leading the war effort will be further pursued; second, in order to implement the above work, the Japanese domestic system will be streamlined during this period.

Utilizing Resources: He also stated that regarding the policy of leading the war effort, since the beginning of the Greater East Asia War a year ago, the results of the operations during this period have established Japan's position of certain victory and invincibility. Determined to suppress the Anglo-Americans and transform Greater East Asia, Japan is sparing no effort in the construction of Greater East Asia. Currently, the operational areas are progressing in all directions, east, south, west, and north, covering an area of several thousand kilometers. At the same time, Japan is ensuring that Southern resources can be utilized, possessing truly immense operational power. Therefore, this kind of work and implementation of utilizing resources is a large-scale undertaking, or in other words, a large-scale industry. Since last year, Japan has been striving for comprehensive increased production. Therefore, although the Greater East Asia War has been ongoing for a year and a half, further reorganization of industrial issues will be necessary in the future.

Expanding Production

Currently, Japan's national endeavors have been changing rapidly since the Manchurian Incident ten years ago. Therefore, all organizations within Japan have been completely renewed. Now, a new national organization has been completed, and it can be said that since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, all organizations of manpower and material resources have been extraordinarily enriched, established, and consolidated. For example, according to last year's material statistics, commodity prices rose by only 3%, while the situation in the United States is very different. Due to the imbalance of commodity prices, there has recently been a major strike by 600,000 workers. In Japan, the people, from top to bottom, are united in their efforts, burying themselves in hard work to contribute to the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, they are planning domestic production in order to enrich their strength. Therefore, the government and the public are determined to expand production. This time, the government has decided to submit an industrial bill to the Diet, the main points of which were first announced on the 1st of this month, in order to ensure Southern resources and all domestic resources of Japan, so as to strengthen the operational power to adapt to the operational system. Therefore, Japan attaches even greater importance to the development of five industries: iron, coal, light metals, aircraft, and ships. In addition to the above-mentioned total mobilization of material resources, the total mobilization of manpower is also being carried out simultaneously. Due to the implementation of the total mobilization of manpower and material resources, the war will become more profound and prolonged than before. We must ensure that we maintain the Greater East Asia War until final victory. Finally, he spoke in great detail on the issues of China's participation in the war.

### Household Oil and Sugar Sales in the City Today and Tomorrow; Sugar Certificates for Western Shanghai to be Issued Soon

Buddhist Community Opposes Superstition Donation: Recently, the collection office for banning superstitious businesses and articles announced its scope of collection, involving Buddhist religious rituals. It even regarded Buddhists as organizers of superstitious businesses and temples as places for promoting superstitious businesses. After receiving repeated orders from the office to issue application registration forms, the temples and lecture halls in this city have successively reported to the Buddhist Association for dispute. The association recently convened Buddhists from all over the city and unanimously expressed their opposition. They immediately submitted a report to the Municipal Government for correction. It is also reported that Mr. Takada Gimitsu, Minister of the Greater East Asia Religious Federation of Central China, has also gone to Beijing to negotiate this matter.

### Authorities Prevent Manipulation; Will Re-Control Gunny Sacks

Before the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association, gunny sacks were strictly controlled by the Japanese authorities. After the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association and the lifting of the daily authorities' control, the gunny sacks in this city were again controlled and manipulated by a few hoarders who bought and hoarded them, resulting in continuous price increases. Recently, the Materials Control Review Committee of the National Commercial Control Association has decided to include jute and jute products (including gunny sacks) in the list of controlled materials. The authorities, in view of the fact that gunny sacks are an important wartime material, will not allow speculative merchants to freely buy and sell or hoard them. Therefore, it is decided to actively establish a control mechanism on one hand, and on the other hand, to consider re-investigating and registering the gunny sacks stored by merchants in this city and other places, and to re-limit prices, so that those who hoard gunny sacks will have no way to use their tricks.

### Central Savings Association Issues Special Savings Lottery Tickets; Total Amount of 10 Million Yuan

Since the Central Savings Association was relieved of military management, the Central Reserve Bank raised funds to inherit the management and was reorganized and established on March 19th of this year to continue operations. In addition to the original savings accounts that have been able to continue their rights and interests through legal procedures, the number of new savings customers has seen a sharp increase. It is understood that in order to encourage national savings, utilize idle funds, and develop legitimate businesses, the association plans to hold special savings lottery tickets and welfare lottery tickets. All draft articles of association, except for the Provisional Regulations on Welfare Lottery Tickets, which have been passed by the Central Political Committee and sent to the National Government for promulgation and to the Legislative Yuan for review, the Provisional Articles of Association on Special Savings Lottery Tickets have also been passed by the Central Political Committee. It is understood that the association will issue the first special savings lottery ticket with a total amount of 10 million yuan, 50 yuan per household (two tickets of 25 yuan each), and an interest rate of 5%. The lottery will be drawn once a year, and these lottery tickets will be issued in the shortest possible time.

### Ministry of Food Orders All Guilds to Fairly Review Qualifications

The Ministry of Food has organized industry guilds for various major items of food sales, and in order to adapt to the wartime system, each guild has organized a review committee to be responsible for reviewing the qualifications of members. However, in order to effectively protect legitimate merchants, all reviewers are ordered to handle matters fairly and must not abuse their powers or engage in favoritism. If such behavior is verified, it will be severely punished.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Government Bonds: Yesterday morning, the dark market for unified government bonds showed mixed ups and downs. Category A and Category E both fell slightly, while Category B, Category C, and Category D saw increases.

Gold and Silver: Yesterday morning, the retail price of gold jewelry in the city's silver shops was still sold at the limited price of two hundred yuan per tael, and the handling fee increased to two hundred yuan. Transactions within and outside the industry were not active, and prices rose slightly. The market for silver ingots remained unchanged.

Yarn and Cloth: The cotton yarn market was slightly more active because the Dragon Boat Festival was approaching, and some hoarders were eager to sell off their stock. Buyers with strength took the opportunity to drag in, so prices remained stable. The cloth market was initially stable and then firm. It was initially heard that the market was stable at the beginning of the morning, but because foreign merchants and customers had a strong appetite, the market price rose tortuously. People were very confident, and as a result, the price was generally raised, especially for Four Gentlemen broadcloth.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks were stable with a firm undertone. Although there was a tight money situation, there was no shortage of investors taking advantage of the pre-holiday dip to absorb stocks, and the recent decline had been significant, so it seemed that the sellers were willing to look back. Transactions were still not active, and people from all walks of life remained dazed. The Sino-French Pharmacy in the new pharmaceutical industry was the focus of investment attention and rose the most sharply. The transaction prices of New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory, China-West Pharmacy, and Xinyi Pharmaceutical Factory also saw higher prices. The department store industry was the most stable and firm, with the Wing On, Sun Sun, and National Goods companies all rising by only one yuan or more. Underwear was flat, and the price of Jingfu shirts and socks jumped again. There were still buyers after the afternoon close. In the textile industry, Wing On Textile also turned prosperous. Stocks such as Mayar Silk Factory, You Sheng Dyeing and Weaving, and Xin Feng Printing and Dyeing were all progressing upwards. In the public utilities industry, China Electric Power was flat and weak, and Zhabei Water and Electricity suddenly rose due to a certain household raising prices. In the cultural industry, the World Book and Business Book Bureau were stable, while the China Book Bureau fell again to Guan Nei. Nanyang Tobacco Company regained its strength; Dahua Match was flat and stagnant. Various miscellaneous stocks, such as Tongyi Trust, Zhongxing Timber, Baoan Glass, Gongxing Electrical Appliances, Jiuan Industrial, and Xinyi Real Estate, were actively traded and generally showed firmness.

### Outline of the Central Reserve Bank Taking Over the Clearing of Silver Union Drafts

The Central Reserve Bank will be responsible for clearing the exchange difference of the exchange banks of the Bankers Association's Clearing House every day from June 1st, which was reported in yesterday's newspaper. The following is an excerpt from the implementation outline of the bank's receipt and handling:

(A) After the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee completes the exchange clearing on May 31, it will list all the remaining balances of all exchange banks' deposits, whether cash or remittances, and transfer them to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will enter them into each bank's "Exchange Clearing Account". The Joint Reserve Committee itself should also open an "Exchange Clearing Account" at the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The deposits of non-exchange banks do not need to be transferred and remain at the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee. (Explanation) The funds in the current account of each exchange bank deposited in the reserve committee, whether cash or drafts, should be transferred to the Central Reserve Bank by the reserve committee according to the balance on May 31. The Central Reserve Bank will open a "Exchange Clearing Account" for each bank and issue a remittance receipt, which will be sent to each bank by the reserve committee. When each bank receives the above receipt, it should issue a transfer application based on the balance of the original current account deposited in the reserve committee as of May 31, separately stating "cash" and "drafts", and submit it to the reserve committee for safekeeping. After May 31, before each bank receives the above remittance receipt from the Central Reserve Bank, any withdrawal slips that have been issued for the original funds deposited in the reserve committee will still be accepted by the reserve committee first, and the reserve committee will add the words "Central Reserve Bank" to the heading of the withdrawal slip and send it to the Central Reserve Bank for payment. (B) From June 1st, after each day's exchange at the Clearing House is completed, a copy of the exchange difference summary statement will be sent to the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank will pay or receive the exchange difference for each exchange bank's "Exchange Clearing Account" according to the difference listed on the statement. (Explanation) After the exchange is completed each day, the exchange bank still needs to issue an "Exchange Difference Transfer Application" and send it to the reserve committee for verification, and then send it to the Central Reserve Bank as a transfer voucher. After the exchange bank exchanges, the returned checks will still be sent by each bank to the original presenting bank using the original "Deposit Counterparty List", and the reserve committee will stamp the counterparty list to certify it, with one copy kept for record, and the other copy sent by the returned check bank to the Central Reserve Bank to credit the corresponding amount to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. The exchange bank should issue a Central Reserve Bank check to the reserve committee to return the amount of the returned check to the exchange bank. The reserve committee will deposit the Central Reserve Bank check received from the exchange bank for the return of the amount of the returned check into the Central Reserve Bank. (C) The Central Reserve Bank may give interest to each bank's "Exchange Clearing Account". In the future, the current deposit reserve account of the exchange bank may be included in the "Exchange Clearing Account" for calculation. (D) If the deposit balance of each exchange bank is insufficient to pay the difference that the bank should pay that day due to exchange clearing, and needs to supplement funds, it can either borrow from the Central Reserve Bank, or borrow from the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee according to the usual practice, whichever is convenient for the exchange bank. (E) The Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee, up to now, handles the collection business of each bank. For those entrusted by non-exchange banks, the methods are still the same. For those entrusted by exchange banks, a Central Reserve Bank check should be issued after receiving the loan amount and handed over to the entrusting bank. On the side of the Clearing House, there should no longer be the opening of a deposit account for the exchange bank. (Explanation) If the exchange bank entrusts the reserve committee to collect the bill, temporarily use the original "Deposit Count List", and send it to the reserve committee. The reserve committee will stamp the counterparty list to certify it, with one copy kept for record, and the other copy sent by the exchange bank to the Central Reserve Bank to credit the corresponding amount to the "Exchange Clearing Account" of each bank. (F) The withdrawal slips of the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee obtained by each exchange bank will still be used temporarily, but with the heading stamp of the Shanghai Branch of the Central Reserve Bank added. (Explanation) After the implementation of this outline, the exchange bank will no longer issue withdrawal slips and transfer applications for the reserve committee. All Central Reserve Bank clearing account checks mentioned in the above explanations can be temporarily replaced by the above withdrawal slips with the added stamp. Exchange banks that receive this withdrawal slip, except for those directly deposited into the Central Reserve Bank, can submit it to the Central Reserve Bank for exchange within the Clearing House. (G) The various regulations of the Clearing House of the Joint Reserve Committee regarding the exchange, clearing, and return of bills are still applicable for the time being. Matters not covered in these measures shall be handled in accordance with the articles of association of the Clearing House. (Explanation) In the future, the exchange bank's check for the Central Reserve Bank's clearing account shall still be based on the balance of the current day's funds, that is, the deposit balance at the end of the night.

### The Zhang Jinhai Tragic Death Case: Court Reopens for Trial Yesterday Morning; Prosecutor's Office Indicts Guo Shiyuan and Others; Further Trial Scheduled for 9 AM on the 7th

The case of the illegal abuse and murder of youth Zhang Jinhai by the French Concession Police, which has drawn nationwide public attention, saw the reopening of court proceedings for the Chinese suspects yesterday morning at the Second Special District Court of this city. A large number of representatives from various community organizations and the general public attended the hearing, demonstrating the broad concern across all sectors of the city regarding this case. The chief culprit, Guo Shiyuan, and two others were not prosecuted by the French Concession Police. Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie of the Second Special District Court Prosecutor's Office, based on the results of the investigation, filed a public indictment against them independently in court. Details of the situation are recorded below.

Police Personnel Separately Indicted

At 9:30 AM, Qian Sen, Presiding Judge of the Criminal Division of the Second Special District Court, along with Judges Tang Youqi and Wang Yisheng, and Chief Clerk Li Tingfan, convened the court session with Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie. Attorney Xu Wufang, representing the French Concession Administration, presented the public indictment against four defendants from the French Concession Police: interpreter Li Hongda, Chinese Constable No. 233 Zhu Songcheng, Chinese Detective No. 417 Zai Shu, and Chinese Detective No. 436 Zhang Guiqing. The indictment stated that, following the investigation into the joint assault case, the above defendants were deemed to have assisted their superiors, Beckley (West Constable No. 23) and Mire, in the commission of violent acts (details can be found in the compiled testimonies of all witnesses). They were indicted under Article 278, Section 2 of the Criminal Code for assault. The indictment also stated that the chief culprits, Guo Shiyuan, Li Xiuying, and Feng Quansheng, would not be prosecuted.

District Court Chief Independently Files Indictment

At this point, Chief Prosecutor Shen Wenjie rose in court and independently filed a public indictment against the three defendants, Guo, and others, reading the indictment aloud. The original text is as follows:

"Defendant Li Xiuying, female, 26 years old, from Tongzhou, residing at 766 Malan Road.

Feng Quansheng, male, 26 years old, from Chuansha, residing at No. 1, Lane 37, Leimi Road, merchant.

Guo Shiyuan, male, 34 years old, from Beiping, residing at 454 Xiafei Road.

The above defendants are being indicted for cases of false accusation, etc., following the conclusion of the investigation. The facts of the crime and the legal articles violated are described as follows: Defendant Li Xiuying went to Chengji Sock Factory on the afternoon of April 28th to buy socks. She claimed to be planning to collect two wool coats and a velvet robe from the Yi Xi Hua Clothing Store, so she had hidden the laundry receipt in her bag but lost it somewhere. The next day, she reported the loss to the laundry store, and the store clerk, Feng Quansheng, told her that someone had already collected the items. Subsequently, she invited Feng Quansheng to Chengji Sock Factory to identify the factory apprentice, Peng Shuanglong, as the person who had collected the clothes. Because the factory owner, Zhang Yuebo, denied this, Li Xiuying and Feng Quansheng reported the matter to the French Concession Police. The police dispatched Detective Zhu Songcheng to arrest Peng Shuanglong. Peng Shuanglong was interrogated and tortured by Beckley and Mire. Unable to withstand the torture, he falsely claimed that the clothes were in the upper floor of the store and that his accomplice, Zhang Jinhai, had picked up a piece of paper from the ground. The original detective led Peng Shuanglong to search the store but found nothing. Subsequently, Zhang Jinhai was also detained in the police station and subjected to torture and coercion by Mire, including beatings, kicking, and waterboarding, resulting in serious injuries and death that night. During Mire's interrogation and torture of Zhang and Peng, the defendant Guo Shiyuan received a phone call from Feng Quansheng and rushed to the police station. After acting as Mire's interpreter, he entered and exited the interrogation room for half an hour. According to witness Zhang Yuebo, Guo Shiyuan said to him, "Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong are old hands; they will be sent to court tomorrow." He also reportedly deceived Zhang Jinhai and Peng Shuanglong, saying, "Your boss has already admitted it." Peng Shuanglong has repeatedly testified that Guo Shiyuan slapped him twice. Based on the mutual corroboration of these facts, the fact that Defendant Li Xiuying lost the laundry receipt and whether the location of the loss was at Chengji Sock Factory have not been proven. Defendant Feng Quansheng also failed to positively identify Peng Shuanglong as the person who impersonated the laundry collector. They then went together to the police station to report the matter, leading to the tragic deaths and injuries. Tracing the origin of the disaster, the responsibility lies with them. Guo Shiyuan is the owner of Yi Hua Laundry, fluent in French. On that day, he rushed to the police station and served as Mire's interpreter during the interrogation (Mire originally had three interpreters, none of whom were used that day), entering and exiting the interrogation room (i.e., the torture room) for half an hour. According to the statements of the victims Peng Shuanglong and witness Zhang Yuebo, it is clear that he intended to make Zhang and Peng admit to the appropriation and be subjected to punishment for the lost items, and it was not simply a matter of bailing out his employee, Feng Quansheng. Judging from the facts, this is obvious. In summary, the actions of Defendants Li Xiuying, Feng Quansheng, and Guo Shiyuan constitute a criminal offense under Article 169, Section 1 of the Criminal Code, and a public indictment should be filed in accordance with Article 4 of the Agreement on the Establishment of Chinese Courts in the Shanghai French Concession and Article 230, Section 1 of the Criminal Procedure Law."

Guo Shiyuan Testifies About the Beatings

Guo Shiyuan was then called to testify. He stated that the laundry had receipts and stubs, and clothes were collected based on the receipt, not the person. On April 28th, he was not at home as he worked at the tram company. The 29th was the Emperor's Birthday, and he had a holiday from the company. He did not know Li Xiuying. Li and others came to the store to report the loss and argued for about twenty minutes, strongly urging a store employee to go and identify the person. Finally, Feng went with them. After dinner, he went to a friend's house to play cards and received two phone calls, urging him to bail out the store employee. When he arrived at the police station, the interrogation was underway. He did not know Mire previously. After waiting for about five or six minutes, Mire led Feng to him and asked him to ask Feng to identify the person, but Feng did not make a positive identification, only saying he looked similar. Mire then turned around and went inside. He, at the request of Feng, entered a small room in the detective's office to ask Mire to release Feng. He saw Peng Shuanglong being held on a bench while Mire was waterboarding him, speaking in Chinese, repeatedly asking if he had the laundry receipt and rubbing Peng's ribs with his fists. Peng screamed in pain and pointed to Zhang Jinhai as the one who had picked it up. Mire then brought Zhang to the bench, slapped him first, and then tied him to the bench in the same way, administering waterboarding. Zhang was in so much pain that he could barely speak. Mire also repeatedly asked if he had the laundry receipt. While waterboarding, Wang Shu sat on Peng's lower body, and Chinese Detective No. 436 Zhang Guiqing sat on Zhang Jinhai's lower body. After being untied, Zhang was unable to stand up, his speech was unclear, and he leaned against the wall and sat on the ground. Mire ordered Zhang to drink a glass of liquor; when Zhang refused slightly, Mire punched Zhang in the stomach and kicked him in the chest. The second glass of liquor was forcibly poured down his throat, and Wang Shu and others helped Zhang into another small room. Guo, at this point, made a defense, saying that Zhang Yuebo and others' testimonies were fabricated. He was at the police station for no more than twenty minutes. Peng's claim that he helped with the beatings was pure nonsense. Zhang Jinhai had been falsely accused and died, and his testimony was clearly colluded to frame him, etc.

Just as the court was about to announce the adjournment, Guo and Wang Shu both applied for bail, which was not approved. Guo also requested to have his shackles removed, which was not granted. Then, Guo further testified that Chinese Detective Zai Shu suddenly came to his store at around 10 PM on April 30th and delivered a note with a phone number, urging him to call and talk. When he made the call, he realized that the person on the other end was Mire. Mire told him on the phone that Zhang Jinhai had died and that he could not testify; otherwise, he would take drastic measures. But now, he could not help but speak out. Zhang's family members, including his young wife, stepped forward in court, pleading for justice and punishment of the murderers. After the court's mediation, they withdrew, and the court formally announced the adjournment.

Economic Circles' Commentary

### Further Discussion on Economic Circles and Emergency Relief for North China

Yesterday's discussion on economic circles and emergency relief for North China argued that people in our industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are in a relatively better position, with more resources at hand. Therefore, they feel more obliged and duty-bound towards this tragic disaster. Thus, among the several things we proposed that the economic circles should do currently, we first suggested that everyone implement frugality in all the industrial and commercial organizations they run, donating all possible savings, such as from reducing spending on alcohol and gifts, to emergency relief for North China.

People in economic circles, especially those in leadership positions, are undoubtedly among the wealthy and propertied classes in society. They have the money to spend and the resources to use. Therefore, promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief" should start with these people, without a doubt.

Since influential people in the industrial, commercial, and financial sectors are at the center of promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief," we are willing to sincerely contribute two reasonable steps for promoting "frugality to aid disaster relief": First, judge oneself with the heart of judging others, meaning that before others are able to vigorously practice frugality, we ourselves should start practicing frugality to set an example for others. Second, judge others with the heart of judging oneself, meaning that after we have practiced frugality ourselves, we must also persuade others to do the same, so as to achieve the goal of accumulating small contributions into a large sum.

Therefore, the most important point is still that economic leaders and the general public work together sincerely and cooperate to plan. Relying solely on a small number of wealthy people to cut back on food and clothing to provide relief is not enough. All the "gentlemen" and young masters who frequent luxurious restaurants, hotels, dance halls, brothels, and gambling dens must, under the example and promotion of leaders in Shanghai's industrial, commercial, and financial sectors, show great compassion and contribute generously. This will not only greatly help our fellow compatriots in North China who are suffering in the midst of a crisis but will also be sufficient to atone for their own extravagance and licentiousness. Only the gentleman class should contribute more, and only social leaders can particularly call for this type of contribution. In this regard, a social leader presiding over disaster relief can, at the opening ceremony of a garden dance hall, theater, or cafe, give a loud call to action and speak passionately, the effect of which need not be said. In particular, it is hoped that they can take advantage of this opportunity to propose practical and concrete methods for entertainment venues and the public to continuously and automatically aid disaster relief, because automatic aid relief is the moral responsibility of our fellow compatriots, especially the moral responsibility of our fellow compatriots in the entertainment industry.

### Regret

— Shengquan

When people do things against their conscience, and when they fail, a reaction arises in their minds: they should not have done it that way, and they will never do it again.

A person walks out of a gambling den, crestfallen. Of course, he has lost, and lost everything. So, after returning home, he "regrets" it (of course, an honest person first "regrets" that he should not have continued "playing" when he was winning; but, thinking further about what he could have bought with all that money...the gambling den lives off of this...so he fundamentally discovers and "regrets" it): he will not go there next time. The next day, his friend strongly pulls him to go again. There is no way to refuse, for the sake of friendship. Looking around, he initially decides not to "play," but he cannot resist. The result? The same as yesterday...

Is this regret? No. In the face of reality, his will wavers again. This is just a temporary discovery of his nature and "regret," a valueless "regret."

A person has even more "regrets" at the moment of death. He regrets his sins, asking for forgiveness from the living. Fortunately, these are all sincere words. So, Mencius also said, "When a man is about to die, his words are good." Most people praise the behavior of the deceased; everyone who dies is mostly a sage (or, perhaps, they are afraid of being haunted by the ghost?). However, the deceased is just, in the moment before death, venting all his "regrets," seeking a little peace of mind before dying. This kind of "regret" is not to be trusted! If the life of the deceased were extended by ten years, the result would be that, encountering unpleasant things again, he would be led to do what he had regretted.

Isn't this the same as the former? Except that, in the former case, after "regretting," the reality does not come again.

In this world, I do not know how many people have lost their lives in failure because of unreal "regret," because, at the time of regret, they completely forgot reality.

Therefore, true "regret" is smoothing the path of life's experiences and traumas, allowing us to walk smoothly along this path. "Regret" can cultivate character and indicate the path of life, so we must "regret."

However, we must not forget reality, and we must not make the same mistake again and again.

### Current Life of Postal Workers

— Tan Changde

Indeed, in the past, the profession of postal worker was regarded as an "iron rice bowl," a superior position that many envied and sought. However, in recent years, the post office has also suffered misfortune, and this "iron rice bowl" is worse than even a "cat's rice bowl."

Nowadays, it is impossible for a postal worker to support his family solely with his monthly salary, allowances, and rice subsidies, even at a minimum. Looking back on the past, I deeply sigh.

After the recent incident, the post office's biggest lifeline—the parcel business—plummeted, coupled with inconvenient transportation, exchange restrictions, and huge expenses (not including the salaries of Chinese staff), and various other factors. As a result, income has decreased, and the salaries and allowances on which postal workers rely to support their families have been greatly affected.

To this day, our postal workers' salaries are still the same as before the incident and have never been increased. Postal workers earn an average of only six or seven hundred yuan per month, including salary and allowances. Think about it, these six or seven hundred yuan have to cover rent, utilities, daily necessities, family and friends' weddings and funerals, children's education, and so on. Even with the most frugal spending, it is difficult to cope, and of course, expenses exceed income. Unfortunately, since the end of last year, things have become even more difficult. Monthly salaries and allowances are never paid in full at once, sometimes paid in two installments, sometimes in three, sometimes in five, in bits and pieces. Each time a salary or allowance is received, it is only one hundred and something yuan. One does not know whether to buy rice for the family, or buy coal briquettes, or pay the rent first, causing confusion and helplessness. The dates of issuing salaries and allowances are also irregular and cannot be predicted for budgeting purposes. Sometimes one-third is issued at the end of the month, another one-third is issued on the 5th or 6th of the following month, and another one-third is issued on the 12th or 13th. There is no fixed schedule, depending entirely on the authorities' discretion. But we postal workers are suffering. But this suffering is not the worst. This April, a new trick has started: all Chinese employees, regardless of rank or gender, are placed "on standby at home" in shifts, with each employee having one month "on standby at home" every five months, receiving only half of their salary, allowances, and rice subsidies...sacrificing the other half to subsidize the bureau's expenditures... In other words, every Chinese employee has their salary halved for one month out of every five months and can only take half. Think about it, the original salary was already pitifully small, and now it is halved, how are we supposed to live, how are we supposed to survive? Although in the current wartime, everyone should suffer, especially public officials, but in any case, there must be a limit to suffering! The stomach always needs to be filled... It is impossible to "want the horse to run fast, but not want the horse to eat grass."

We postal workers also cannot hold other jobs. The work has three shifts: early, middle, and late, which are rotated. Even if there are opportunities, we cannot take them, and furthermore, holding another job violates postal regulations, and if discovered, we will be suspended.

After our postal workers pass the exam and join the bureau, they treat the post office as a lifelong career. All the knowledge from school has long been abandoned, and we are completely ignorant of other businesses. Therefore, it is now impossible to change careers, and positions are difficult to find. In the end, if the authorities do not find a way to help us postal workers, we postal workers will only starve to death (without pay).

### Courtesy and Life

— Wei

Some people say, "Courtesy is a hypocritical facade; people should be straightforward and casual with others." However, I believe that he has misinterpreted "courtesy." "Courtesy" is an expression of respect for others. When we see a figure we admire appear before us, we will involuntarily pay our respects to them. Otherwise, "respecting" inwardly but "despising" outwardly is deceiving oneself; "despising" inwardly but "respecting" outwardly is what is called "hypocrisy." This absolutely cannot be called genuine "courtesy."

That one should have "courtesy" towards teachers and elders is something every child knows, so there is no need to elaborate. But is it courtesy to be extremely respectful in front of teachers and elders but to scold them behind their backs? I believe that the aforementioned so-called "respect" in person is actually "hypocrisy." From this, it can be seen that courtesy is not only "external" but also "internal." No wonder some people, when they see the above situation, would say that "courtesy" is "hypocritical."

Living in this world, one must interact with people every day; having "courtesy" towards "life" is a very important matter. However, looking back at the real world, does "courtesy" truly exist between people? What we encounter daily are mostly the hypocritical, perfunctory, two-faced...tactics. Only in the cultivation of true friendship can we see the expression of "courtesy." It can truly be called "rare and precious."

As the saying goes, "Courtesy demands reciprocity." It can be seen that "courtesy" requires both parties to maintain it. If one party fails to show respect for others, then courtesy is completely destroyed. Therefore, we need to pay extra attention when dealing with people; if we are negligent, it will cause endless harm.

The so-called "courtesy" in real society is merely a tactic of humans. We should abandon it and express genuine "courtesy"; then, our short "life" will be straightforward, honest, and bright. Do you agree?

### Critical Views

— Zhen Diaoge

In this "world of confused right and wrong," criticism is necessary because, although it may not be able to "correct the wrongs," it can at least distinguish "suspicions, clarify right and wrong, and resolve hesitations."

Because criticism is necessary, we must pay attention to it and never have the same casual attitude. But, looking only at our field of literature and art, how many people take a righteous position to criticize? Very few. Most of them are things that are neither criticisms nor praises, either just scolding or blindly praising. When scolding, they scold the work as worthless; when praising, they are all Eastern Beethovens, Eastern Shakespeares, Ibsens; the task and attitude of the critic are put out of their minds—perhaps some "masters" do not even know what the task and attitude of criticism are!

What is the task of the critic? The critic is to introduce his own views and impressions of a work to the reader, helping the reader to understand and comprehend the value of the work. Because this task is important, we hope for accurate criticism. Of course, complete objectivity is good. Faqishi once said, "We can never abandon ourselves and criticize the works of others." But, I believe that in criticizing any work, it is best to reduce the subjective component to the lowest possible level. Although you cannot forget yourself, lose yourself, the critic must still use his own doctrine and position to judge and criticize.

So, what should his attitude be? As a certain gentleman in a certain newspaper said, "It should be serious, honest, and not emotional." But, I believe that these are trivial conditions. Its main condition is that the critic should treat the work being criticized and the author with the attitude of a mother praising or belittling her children. In other words, the critic, no matter how much he points out flaws or how much he praises, all this comes from the outpouring of "love." If the critic can have this point, then problems such as "seriousness," "honesty," and "emotionality" will not arise. There is also one more point. When criticizing a certain work, although we should not inquire about who the author's father-in-law is or how many ranks his ancestors held in the Qing Dynasty, he must understand the author's motives, environment, and experience. Especially for the works of young learners, we cannot be too demanding, but we cannot be "careless" either. We must treat them with the attitude of a mother scolding her child. It is excusable to let them roll on the ground when they are four or five years old, but it is inexcusable to ignore it when they are over ten years old.

These few points from Shanghai are just my humble opinions.

### Fatalistic Human Hearts

— Ji Weiyi

It seems that there are many holders of fatalism in China. Usually, when meeting a friend, one asks, "Brother, how have you been lately?" The one who is proud and happy will answer you: "My luck is good, good, thanks to you..." The one with a worried look will answer you: "Alas! Fate is not on my side..." Putting everything into the category of "fate." Those who succeed say that their fate is prosperous, and they deserve to succeed. Those who fail say that heaven is not helping them, and it is destined in their fate. Some farmers, who work hard all day long, still cannot make ends meet every year. They think that their fate is not good and that they do not have the luck to be officials (?), and cannot live as carefree and comfortable as the gentlemen.

There are also some people whose only way is to shake their heads and sigh about "the decline of morality" and "the hearts of people are not as they used to be." They think that the only reason the world is so "messy" is that people's hearts are too bad. If everyone could be trained to have kind hearts and not do bad things, then the world would become a place of peace and prosperity. They think that the result of robbers and prostitutes is all due to their bad conscience. If they were kind by nature, they would not do this kind of despised work.

The above two kinds of arguments can be said to be different paths leading to the same goal, falling into the mud and unable to rise. In fact, when criticizing a thing, one must first think back and forth, look closely at the surrounding environment, its causes, its future trends, its inevitable results... Many facts related to this matter. The poor harvest of farmers is not caused by fate. The formation of thieves and prostitutes has many other reasons, and it is not just a matter of good or bad conscience that can achieve it. For example, the abnormal development of social economy is one of the reasons.

### Mirror

— Ma Jixian

This person thinks that person is ugly, and that person also thinks this person is ugly. They all think they are beautiful, but they have never seen their own faces.

Later, they inadvertently saw the "mirror" and discovered their true appearance; it turned out that they were both ugly.

I can see his shortcomings, and he can also see my shortcomings, but neither he nor I have ever seen our own shortcomings. Because we are still missing a "mirror."

This "mirror" is right in front of our eyes, but we have not seen it, so our shortcomings have not been discovered!

Everyone is bound to have shortcomings, what is regrettable is that we have not discovered them! We should accept the criticisms of others, we should deeply reflect on ourselves—that is our "mirror."

It is placed in front of our eyes! It is waiting for us to use it.

### Starting from the Slap in the Face: Written for the Death of Female Teacher Su Yizhi

— Qing Jun

One who receives a slap and responds with a smile is a slave.

One who is slapped and lacks the ability to retaliate is a weakling.

One who returns tooth for tooth and fist for fist is a true man.

We will not give sympathy or assistance to the first type of person. All we will bestow upon them is contempt, cold ridicule, and mockery. We will send a thorn into their spine and will never feel a twinge of sadness at the sight of their bleeding.

To the third type of person, there is only respect and admiration. We must sing of their greatness, worship their spirit, and even rise up and emulate their actions. This is a great sacrifice.

However, we give boundless pity and full sympathy to the second type of person, because they are weak. But there are two possible outcomes: one is to hold a grudge and always seek revenge; the other is "the spiritual victory of Ah Q, who says 'the son beats the father'."

Not long ago, we saw in the newspaper the news that a female teacher, Mr. Su Yizhi, actually died of depression after being slapped twice and cursed at by a shrewish parent. The writer believes this is a matter worthy of public outrage. Of course, advanced countries may treat this as a joke, but those who truly understand the situation in Chinese society may not? Although this is a failure in Chinese education, a small disgrace to the education community, it may also serve as a catalyst for improving our education community, a warning to society to respect teachers, and the perpetrator must be severely punished.

The writer is also a primary school teacher and feels quite insecure seeing this. I hope people in the community will pay attention to this and warn those who come after. In that way, although Ms. Su was sacrificed, she saved many teachers from being slapped in the future!

### A Plea for the Victims of Chaozhou

— Xiao Kangshi

Begging Fellow Chaozhou Natives to Urgently Initiate Relief Efforts

Amidst the major disaster in North China, it is unfortunate to receive news from many Chaozhou friends that Chaozhou is also suffering from drought. It has not rained for several months, and there is no grain harvest in the fields. In addition, there is no source of rice from Southeast Asia, so white rice has risen to 800 yuan per斗 (dou, a unit of dry measure, approx. 10 liters), (equivalent to 576 Shanghai dollars per dou). Other items, such as sweet potatoes, can only be bought for two ounces per yuan, so many victims are starving to death.

Taking Chaoyang County alone, there are 800 villages. Due to the high price of rice, each village has to starve to death one or two hundred people every day. Some sell their own children for food, and those girls are abandoned in the wilderness with no one to take them in.

No one outside knows about this panic. Those wealthy Chaozhou merchants in Shanghai, although aware of the severity of this disaster in their homeland, have not stepped forward to provide relief. If this continues, it will become the second North China. Because in Chaozhou, there are two harvests a year. The harvest in the first half of the year is virtually zero, and the harvest in the second half of the year must wait until 于月 (yuè yuè, another way of saying November), and moreover, the heavens absolutely do not send rain. I implore Chaozhou compatriots to provide relief to their hometown and not allow the disaster to expand.

### Mutual Aid Society Subsidizes the Families of Those Who Have Fled

It has been found that there are a large number of poor students in Shanghai, especially those whose parents have died or fled, and their whereabouts are unknown. Their situation is extremely difficult. In view of this, the Mutual Aid Society has entrusted this office to select 131 of these students from among the students receiving financial aid, and to subsidize their families with 30 yuan per month until the end of this year. The funds for this month have been received, and the students can come to this office to collect them as soon as they are notified.

### Children's Health Competition Holds Carnival

The Children's Health Competition, jointly organized by the Municipal YWCA and the Chinese Health Association, has received enthusiastic participation since registration began last month. It is reported that the physical examinations have been completed. A carnival will be held at 3 pm tomorrow at the Hongqiao Sanatorium, 990 Avenue Joffre. Mr. Xu Guanqun, Xu Xiaochu, Chen Bin, Su Pan, Yangyao Ding Fubao, Huang Jingwan, Chen Chengyin, Gong Jilan, Su Zengxiang, and Wang Shuzhen have been appointed as judges, and Mr. Lin Kanghou will present awards to the winners.

### Home Economics in Extraordinary Times

— Fang Jinying

Chinese women have never paid much attention to home economics. Therefore, household affairs are mostly handled by servants. An ignorant maid can manage the household, including hygiene, economy, child rearing, nutrition, and education. Therefore, there are few healthy families. An unhealthy family directly affects society and the country. Therefore, it is necessary for every woman to have sufficient knowledge of home economics. The Home Economics Research Society aims to increase women's knowledge and skills through mutual research, especially in these extraordinary times when everything is expensive. One should also be prepared for self-reliance in production. If one is without preparation, they will be able to cope and be competent. Therefore, I hope housewives will make good use of their spare time and not waste their precious time on meaningless activities. Even housewives who do not need research should join this society, because we can cooperate to create institutions that benefit society, such as schools, kindergartens, orphanages, and homes for the elderly and disabled. Our women bear a large part of the responsibility for the strength of the country, so I hope sisters, everyone quickly get up and do your part.
