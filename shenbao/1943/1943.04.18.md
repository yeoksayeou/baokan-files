### Speculation, Hoarding, and the Price Issue: An Urgent Suggestion

The reasons for high prices, according to economic principles, are primarily: one, the shortage or decrease of goods, leading to an imbalance in supply and demand, which drives up prices; and two, inflation, which directly reduces the purchasing power of money, also causing prices to rise. These are the natural main causes. However, the extent to which prices rise due to these causes should be in line with the degree of these main causes and should be gradual.

Therefore, most people advocate increasing production to solve the problem of goods shortages and tightening the money supply to address inflation. These are very normal and fundamental solutions, and we certainly agree with them. However, considering the current situation in Shanghai, we must first ask:

(1) Are goods truly scarce?

(2) Is there truly inflation?

(3) Even if there is a shortage of goods and inflation, does the speed of the shortage and inflation match the extent of price increases?

Regarding the first question, let's take "food," "clothing," and "daily necessities" as examples. For "food," apart from the rationed rice, additional supplies can still be obtained. There is the reality that we "change rice to porridge" and "eat two bowls instead of three," but there are still few people who starve to death due to lack of food. Some have even calculated that within the Shanghai-Hangzhou-Nanjing triangle area of Jiangsu and Zhejiang provinces, the grain production and population needs can not only be fully self-sufficient but also have surplus grain to supply for military use. As for "clothing," some have estimated that Shanghai's stock of yarn and cloth is sufficient for ten years of consumption in Central China. The item of "daily necessities" refers to daily necessities. Taking soap as an example, it is said that raw materials are the most difficult to obtain, but it is rumored that a certain bank is hoarding as many as 10,000 boxes, and in fact, middle-class families often have a considerable number of reserves of daily necessities, which is also quite substantial.

Although we cannot provide precise statistics, based on near-factual speculation, we dare to say that the shortage of goods in Shanghai, especially in "clothing" and "daily necessities," is not that serious, much better than in the areas under the rule of the Chongqing regime.

Regarding the second question, we have repeatedly heard the announcement from the financial authorities that the currency has sufficient reserves and that there is no inflation. We certainly trust the government and hope that the government will not cause inflation, so we also dare to say that the currency is not inflated.

Regarding the third question, let's take the price level when the old legal tender was abolished last June as an example. The black market price of "food" (rice) has risen fivefold (now slightly decreased), and "clothing" and "daily necessities" have risen by an average of about tenfold. Does this level of increase correspond to the degree of goods shortage and currency issuance? We dare to say even more that it absolutely does not correspond. The rise in prices has broken away from economic principles, deviated from the natural law of supply and demand, and is leaping like a "horse off the reins."

So, what caused this abnormal phenomenon of derailment? Undoubtedly, it is "artificial speculation and hoarding." With hoarding, sufficient goods become scarce; the balance of supply and demand becomes unbalanced, stimulating prices to soar. The currency has also suffered the misfortune of being unjustly accused of inflation! This crime of harming people's livelihood is truly unpardonable!

Now that we have clearly calculated that the reason for high prices is entirely due to rampant speculation and hoarding, we cannot help but believe that the government's past laissez-faire attitude, without the use of political power, has led to arrogance and an unmanageable situation. The people dare to be angry but dare not speak out, troubled by the mentality of "losing money by keeping banknotes, better to buy goods," creating a pitiful situation like the one described by Mr. Toyu Yoshida in his article on prices: "The vicious cycle formula of declining currency purchasing power and soaring prices is that the public themselves drive up prices but suffer the consequences." In this regard, the leading figures of the people have also failed to raise their arms and use social forces to impose sanctions, and they should also bear some responsibility.

Now that the government has shown concern for this issue and ordered a thorough investigation, the depth of our people's expectations cannot be expressed in words. But observing the developments in the past ten days, perhaps the government believes that there are various obstacles and will stop there. If our people continue to maintain a wait-and-see attitude, then the future of the price issue will become even more unmanageable, and the majority of ordinary people will still suffer the most.

In view of the overturned cart ahead, we can no longer procrastinate and sit idly by. We have offered our advice to the government's thorough investigation, and we no longer want to place the focus of discussion on "thorough! Not thorough!" Today, with even greater enthusiasm, we call on civil organizations to automatically exert effective social sanctions to settle accounts with speculators and hoarders.

Therefore, we suggest:

(1) Civil organizations, such as the Shanghai General Chamber of Commerce, the Shanghai Citizens' Welfare Association, and the Shanghai Economic Research Association, should also invite the Shanghai Chamber of Commerce and Industry of Japan and other friendly countries to organize an organization similar to the "Price Issue Countermeasures Research Association," inviting Chinese and Japanese economists and insightful entrepreneurs to regularly discuss countermeasures, collect public opinions at any time, and contribute them to the government for adoption and implementation.

(2) The same groups should "expose speculation and hoarding" and welcome citizens to report it. After a fair and accurate investigation, the findings should be announced to the public, and whether it is a business or an individual, the government should be requested to confiscate the goods or suspend operations, in order to achieve the effect of social sanctions.

(3) The same groups should study how to increase production, from raw materials to finished products, and have detailed, thorough, and feasible rational methods for each sector and detail to seek a fundamental solution.

Finally, we believe that cracking down on speculation and hoarding must start with Shanghai first, because it is the economic center of the country. If Shanghai does well, other cities will respond and follow suit, and will certainly be successful. Therefore, the significance of this work is very important. Civil organizations should do their best to serve the public and quickly take action.

### Mission to Manchukuo Completed: Special Envoy Zhou Fohai to Return Home. Future Relations Between China and Manchukuo to Become More Cordial, Closely Cooperating to Complete the Greater East Asia War

Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Since his arrival here on the 9th, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, has received a warm welcome from all levels of society in Manchukuo. Now that his mission is complete, he is scheduled to return home soon. Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo will make Sino-Manchukuo relations even closer, as Special Envoy Zhou visited Prime Minister Zhang, Chief of General Affairs Bu, Foreign Minister Li, and others, holding in-depth talks and discussing the strategies for China and Manchukuo to work together to complete the Greater East Asia War, enabling the two countries to achieve close contact and cooperation in the guidance of the war. He also exchanged views with the ministers of the Economic Department, Transportation Department, and Agricultural Department of Manchukuo, as well as the president and vice president of the Central Bank of Manchukuo, on strengthening the economic cooperation between China and Manchukuo to strengthen the war effort in Greater East Asia, and the two sides reached a complete consensus. Special Envoy Zhou visited Harbin, Fengtian, Fushun, Anshan, Dalian, and other places to conduct on-the-spot inspections of the development of important industries in Manchukuo, which can serve as a reference for China's economic construction. Therefore, Special Envoy Zhou's visit to Manchukuo is of great significance.

Dalian, 17th (Central News Agency) Since his visit to Manchukuo on the 9th of this month, our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, has visited various parts of Manchukuo. Now that his mission is complete, Special Envoy Zhou and his entourage arrived in Dalian at 7:15 p.m. on the 16th and stayed at the Yamato Hotel that night.

Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency) Our country's special envoy to Manchukuo, Zhou Fohai, was ordered to go to Dalian on the 9th to promote Sino-Manchukuo relations and strengthen economic cooperation. He stayed in Manchukuo for nearly ten days, visiting Xinjing and various political and economic centers, and has now completed his mission and returned home. According to reports, Zhou's visit to Manchukuo has epoch-making significance in the history of Sino-Manchukuo relations, and its implications for the promotion of future relations between the two countries and the revitalization of our country's economy are particularly profound. After arriving in Manchukuo, Zhou also inspected the economic construction of Manchukuo and held talks with the government and people of Manchukuo. It is generally believed that Zhou's trip has fully achieved its purpose. A brief description of Zhou's activities during his visit to Manchukuo is as follows: On the morning of the 10th, he met with the Emperor of Manchukuo, and in the afternoon, he held talks with Prime Minister Zhang; on the 13th, he was in Harbin; on the 14th, he held talks with officials and civilians in Fengtian, expressing his determination to strengthen the close cooperation between China and Manchukuo; on the 12th, he inspected the Fengman Dam on the Songhua River in Jilin; on the 14th, he inspected the Showa Steel Works; and on the 15th, he inspected important facilities such as the Fushun Coal Mine. The Fengman Dam is a major driving force for the industrial development of Manchukuo and one of the largest power plants in the world, a great monument to the successful industrial development of Manchukuo. The Showa Steel Works has achieved more than expected results in steel production since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, completing a glorious record of cooperation with Japan. This visit to Manchukuo by Zhou will not only have significant developments in Sino-Manchukuo relations in the future, but also a leap forward in the economic relations between the two countries, so Sino-Manchukuo relations and economic aspects are about to usher in a new era.

Lushun, 17th (Central News Agency) When our country's special envoy Zhou visited Lushun, he went to the fierce battlefields of the Russo-Japanese War, Donglakou Mountain and North Fortress, to inspect the remnants of the Japanese army's bitter fighting. He personally witnessed the steel fortress that had been destroyed by bombing and the assault tunnels that had been dug without regard for life or death within a few days, and was deeply moved. He then said in fluent Japanese: "Now that I have seen the traces of the Battle of Lushun, I deeply understand the strength of the Japanese army. Today, in order to win the Greater East Asia War, all East Asians should remember the sacred land of Lushun. The Russo-Japanese War was a beacon of liberation for the East Asian people, and this place is the birthplace of the dawn of Greater East Asia." He then went to the Lushun Museum for a visit. The curator of the museum, Mr. Imai, warmly guided him, touring various parts of the museum and explaining them at any time. Special Envoy Zhou was also deeply impressed, and finally inscribed five characters, "Essence of Cultural Relics," as a permanent souvenir.

### Chongqing's Organization on the Verge of Collapse, Lack of Human Resources, Only Industries Plunged into Difficulties, Employees Continue to Disperse

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency) According to a special dispatch from the Guangzhou office of the Asahi Shimbun, Chongqing has recently issued various laws to ensure human resources, in an effort to ensure human resources. It is still remembered that Chiang Kai-shek had unlimited manpower in the past, and no matter how long the war lasted, he could continue to resist because of the unlimited manpower. However, later, due to the Japanese army's offensive operations, the peaceful areas gradually expanded, and the transport routes were cut off, which made the Chongqing army decline in both quality and quantity. At the same time, the only industries were also plunged into collapse or depression, and the industrial workers also dispersed as a result. Moreover, because the National Government participated in the war, Chongqing lost the name of the war of resistance, and the people in various places under its control fled to the peaceful areas in increasing numbers. All these factors have made Chongqing feel increasingly short of manpower. At present, the population under Chongqing's control is a total of 150 million, accounting for one-third of the total population of China. The distribution of this population is not as dense as the cities in the peaceful areas, engaged in industries, but scattered in the vast areas of Xinjiang, Qinghai, Gansu, and other provinces, so it is almost impossible to mobilize or requisition them in practice. Under these circumstances, the human resources on which Chongqing's war of resistance relies are also in a difficult situation. What countermeasures will Chongqing take in this regard? According to recent news, Chongqing is currently busy reviewing various issues. The first is the issue of military strength. Although the Chongqing army is currently said to number 3 million, Chongqing's propaganda says that it will prepare to mobilize 5 million or even 15 million soldiers, but in the past operations against the Japanese army in central and southern China, the Chongqing army's deaths, injuries, captures, surrenders, and deserters have been extremely numerous, so it is doubtful whether it still maintains 3 million soldiers today. This is also something that the Chongqing authorities are deeply troubled by. In January of this year, Chiang Kai-shek used rice to mobilize students to engage in official propaganda in order to increase the general public's awareness of serving in the military. On March 14, he issued a new conscription order, which stipulates that all men aged 18 to 45 must serve in the military. At the same time, it stipulates that all young people who have not enlisted, from the age of 18 to 25, must receive full military education and guerrilla warfare training, and it also stipulates that women of the same age must also engage in military auxiliary services. This is also the first law of Chongqing to mobilize women, so the difficulty of Chongqing in organizing troops and replenishing soldiers can be seen from this. The second is the issue of industrial labor. Chongqing promulgated the "National General Mobilization Law" on March 29 last year to expand weapons, materials, and productivity, and to ensure manpower. In the "Twelfth Plenary Session" in January last year, the "Labor Service Proposal" was also resolved, with the aim of using labor to supplement the lack of funds and materials. In January of this year, a labor law was promulgated again, attempting to improve workers' welfare in order to encourage workers' interest in work, and a major publicity campaign was launched immediately. In early March, it ordered its subordinate "provincial governments" to implement fixed wages. The conciliatory policy implemented by the capitalists towards the labor class is nothing more than a tactic. At the same time, the Labor Service Law promulgated in mid-February stipulates that regardless of gender, everyone must serve for one hour every day, fulfilling 250 hours within one year or serving continuously for 30 days, and those who do not wish to serve can pay a cash substitute. Moreover, there is also a great shortage of technical personnel in various places under Chongqing's rule. It is learned that there are currently 300 American engineers engaged in developing industries, and universities and specialized schools are also focusing on cultivating technical talents. From this, it can be seen that Chongqing's wartime policy is already in a situation where it cannot be rebuilt in terms of technology. Although Chongqing is trying to enhance the concept of labor service, it is forcibly enlisting the able-bodied young men of overseas Chinese who fled to the mainland from Malaya and Burma after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, and the rest are also forced to serve, and no technical personnel are spared. Liang Hancao, a member of the Central Executive Committee of the Chongqing Kuomintang, recently went to the Northwest to observe. He said that he plans to move 100 million people to develop the Northwest in the future. On the one hand, the direct guidance agency for immigration is based on the decision of the administrative meeting in October last year, appointing Chen Shuren, chairman of the Overseas Chinese Affairs Commission, Liu Weizhi, minister of the Kuomintang Overseas Department, Wu Zhongxin, chairman of the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and Feng Yuxiang, vice chairman of the Military Affairs Commission, as members of the Northwest Immigration Development Committee, and ordering all provinces to implement the "Northwest Immigration Development Law," stipulating that all people aged 18 to 45 who are healthy in body and mind and who are deemed by the authorities to be unemployed must be moved to the Northwest for reclamation. All these indicate that Chongqing is greatly troubled by the most practical labor issues and future countermeasures to ensure manpower. Chongqing used to boast of having unlimited manpower, but now it has fallen into the difficult situation of having to strive to ensure manpower, which is also an important reason for its impending collapse.

### War Results of the Japanese Army in Shandong

Jinan, 17th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army units annihilated more than 400 communist bandits near Yangsongjia in northwestern Shandong Province on the 10th of this month. On the 14th, they turned to the west and besieged about 400 troops of the Chongqing army led by Li Wenkui and Long Honghai in the southern part of En County. After a fierce attack for five hours, they completely annihilated their main force. In this battle, more than 290 corpses of the Chongqing army were left behind, and the body of Li Wenkui was also among them. In addition, 58 people were captured, and a large amount of weapons and ammunition were seized.

Kaifeng, 17th (Central News Agency) General Sun Liangcheng has been participating in the peace camp since March 22 of last year, and it has been a year now. Within this one-year period, his Second Route Army has achieved the following war results in the areas north of Shangqiu on the Longhai Line and in the areas of Cao County, Shan County, and Dingtao in the southwestern part of Shandong Province: 121 engagements, 12,000 troops of the Chongqing Communist Army engaged, 3,734 corpses of the Chongqing Communist Army abandoned, and 291 captured. In addition, the seized items included 27 light machine guns, 845 rifles, 12,843 rounds of ammunition, 872 hand grenades, and a large number of other military supplies.

### Trends in the Economic Circles of North China: Shanxi Industrial Association Celebrates its First Anniversary

Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is responsible for guiding the development of Shanxi's treasures. April 1st is the anniversary of its establishment. At the beginning of its establishment, it unified 36 military-managed factories under 12 major associations and their employees, including 1,389 Japanese and 15,771 Chinese, and engaged in the development of Shanxi under a comprehensive plan. In addition to continuing to operate the original iron manufacturing, coal, flour milling, paper making, electricity, textile, cement, kiln, machinery manufacturing, leather, gunpowder manufacturing, tobacco, matches, wood harvesting, soda industry, and other industries, the company also develops resources related to these industries, undertaking the task of an industrial army in a serious situation. At the beginning of its establishment, it encountered considerable difficulties, but it finally overcame them in a short period of one year, laying a solid foundation for today. This is really due to the success of the leaders.

Shanxi's land resources are biased to one side. The Yuncheng area in the south is 300 meters above sea level, the Taiyuan area in the central part is 700 meters above sea level, and the Wutai area in the north is more than 1,000 meters above sea level. Therefore, the agricultural crops produced in the south are wheat and cotton, and the central and northern parts are mainly miscellaneous grains. In addition, two-thirds of the province is mountainous, so there are no extravagant expectations for surface resources. The current situation in the province is only enough to maintain self-sufficiency.

On the contrary, Shanxi deserves the name of treasure house for its underground resources. Coal, iron, stone bones, limestone, and other minerals have amazing reserves. Developing these inexhaustible underground resources is an urgent task in the process of traveling the war and building Greater East Asia, so expectations are very high. The production volume of various factories and mines under the jurisdiction of Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is extremely surprising, but the details are still unknown.

The total amount of coal buried in the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, Shanxi Province accounts for half of it. Some people say it reaches 1.2 trillion tons, and the general estimate is 120 billion tons. This amount is 35 times the reserves of Manchukuo. This is very promising for the future of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. When the exchange of north-south resources in the Co-Prosperity Sphere is brought into the right track, the coal and other unlimited underground resources of the Shanxi treasure house are being prepared under the grand plan of the Shanxi Industrial Bureau.

The private capital of Shanxi Industrial Co., Ltd. is 30 million yen, and the total number is 100 million yen. President Koomoto Daisaku has four executive directors, two directors, and two auditors. Executive Director Yano Nobuhiko contributed a lot to the establishment of the company and is truly a meritorious minister who should be remembered forever by this great industrial group.

### Establishment of the North China Trade Control General Association

The third regular meeting of the North China Trade Federation was held at the conference room of the association from 1:00 p.m. on the 7th. Representatives of 31 groups belonging to the association participated.

Report items: The business plan for the 17th year (ie, the 31st year), the original Tianjin and Qingdao Import and Export Allocation Union, has been reorganized, with branches in various places, and offices have been established in Tokyo, Xinjing, and Shanghai, and dispatch offices have been established in Seoul, Dalian, Zhangjiakou, and Shanhaiguan.

Deliberation items: The National Commercial Control General Association has already been established in Central China. Since this association is the central agency for trade control in North China, and in order to adapt to Japan's new policy toward China and emphasize Sino-Japanese cooperation, the North China Trade Federation should be renamed the North China Trade Control General Association.

Decision items: (1) Business plan for the 18th year (the 32nd year). (2) The budget for income and expenditure for the business plan this year, with the income mainly from the handling fees for control, and supplemented by subsidies from the government. The control handling fees originally collected in Tianjin and Qingdao will be collected by the General Association. (3) Determine the membership fees, assessed tax amounts, and collection methods of the groups in each state. (4) Elect officers after the name change. (5) Slightly increase the control handling fee.

In addition, Guan Bo, the economic minister of the Japanese Embassy in Peiping, declared at the meeting: Due to the change in Japan's policy toward China, China will be autonomous in economic terms in the future, and North China will use the North China Trade Control General Association as the center to control trade. In particular, the trade between Central China and North China should respect the autonomy of the Chinese side. In trade with Japan, some commodities should also be entrusted to the Chinese side as much as possible if possible. (Peiping Special Dispatch —— Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News of April 9.)

### Smoother Exchange of Goods between North and Central China

Wei Meibei, of the Beijing Embassy Affairs Department, who attended the Huazhong-Huabei Exchange Conference held in Nanjing and Shanghai in late March and returned to Beijing, met with a group of reporters on the 6th and announced the decisions made at the meeting as follows:

The meeting was convened by the Nanjing Embassy, and the exchange problem was discussed for two days starting on the 15th. From the 27th, the trade problem was discussed for two days. This meeting was divided into four subgroups: food, coal, cotton, and others, to hold separate meetings. A preparatory meeting was also held in Shanghai. Originally, the National Government and the North China Political Affairs Commission failed to form a whole group economically due to the relationship between the Reserve Certificates and the United Reserve Certificates, and the transaction between the two was also not smooth. As a result of the meeting, efforts will be made to open up the current situation in the future to make the exchange of materials between the two regions smoother. Therefore, Central China will supply North China with the most needed food materials such as wheat and soybean meal in large quantities. Although North China will supply coal and other materials as compensation, there is still a considerable import surplus. The settlement method has also been discussed and decided. According to the fundamental policy of material flow, the imbalance in the exchange settlement this year will be allowed to exist, and the settlement will use both the Reserve Certificate and no exchange methods. For important materials in the Reserve Certificate settlement part, half of the imbalance amount will be used as a loan from the Reserve Bank to North China as one of the settlement methods. Therefore, a leap forward in trade between Central China and North China can be expected. (Beijing Electric, Sho: Translated from the Western Daily News of April 8.)

On the first day, they toured the concessions under the guidance of the New National Movement Promotion Committee. On the second day, they visited the Municipal Government at 10:00 AM, the Consulate General of Manchuria at 2:00 PM, and were hosted at a banquet by the Municipal Government at 7:00 PM. On the third day, they visited the Japanese-Chinese-Manchurian security authorities. On the fourth morning, they returned to their country via Nanjing. On the third day, the delegation was visited at the New Asia Dormitory, and asked for their impressions of their "mission to China." Their responses were as follows:

Delegation Leader Liu Xuemao (29 years old, working at the Capital Control Department): The deepest impression I have from this visit to China is the research conference, training, and mutual provision of information resolved by the Chinese, Japanese, and Manchurian youth corps at the founding ceremony on the 31st. In short, the greatest gain seems to be the creation of substantial content from a beautiful form. I now deeply feel that China, with a great leader like Mr. Wang, who directs the youth with his enthusiasm and effort, has already risen up as a new China. China's youth are truly blessed.

Female Class Leader Kihara Kiyoko (20 years old, a first-year student in the specialized course at Xinjing Shikishima Girls' High School): Before and after arriving in Nanjing, we were quite busy. On the last day, representatives of the Japanese, Chinese, and Manchurian youth corps gathered together. Although we did not speak the same language, the harmonious atmosphere was overflowing. We will never forget this spirit. The Chinese youth are extremely fortunate to have the chairman and Mr. Lin as their guides. (Translated from the Western Daily News, April 11)

### British and American Forces in Northeast Tunisia Fail to Invade Axis Positions. Fierce Fighting Ensues, and Positions Change Hands Multiple Times. French Rebel Army Now Sends Troops to Advance Towards Bondufa.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a German News Agency report, on Wednesday and Thursday, Eisenhower's forces in northeastern Tunisia repeatedly attempted to invade the Axis line. However, due to the tenacious resistance of the German and Italian forces, the positions remained unchanged. The latest news from the British front confirms that the British First Army, commanded by General Anderson, and the North African guerrilla forces are engaged in fierce fighting. In the northern mountainous region, the German and Italian forces launched fierce counterattacks and repelled the British forces. At Gabès, the high ground has been repeatedly gained and lost. According to the latest British news last night, the high ground was still in British hands last night. In the mountains north of Béja, the anti-Axis forces launched a fierce attack on April 14th, hoping to break through the Axis line. However, by evening, the most important position was still in German hands. German grenadiers and Italian soldiers fought side by side and, on April 13th, repaired the multiple breaches made by the anti-Axis forces. In this battle, hundreds of anti-Axis soldiers were captured. Anti-Axis fighter planes and artillery were ineffective. According to anti-Axis sources, a detachment of the French rebel army is advancing towards Bondufa, aiming to reach Tunis directly. The struggle for the highway between the villages of Kairouan and Pont-du-Fahs is very intense. At the same time, British forces launched several attacks on the German vanguard in the south, but with little success. The British Eighth Army is currently establishing positions near Enfidaville. According to the army's war correspondent, General Montgomery is encountering significant difficulties there.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 17th – Combining news from the North African front, the anti-Axis forces east of Bengerdan and in the regions of Méjez el-Bab launched a general offensive on the 16th after a fierce bombardment. In the direction of Bengerdan, the Axis forces fought bravely and inflicted great damage on the British and French rebel forces, repelling them. Heavy fighting also broke out between the two armies in the Jebel Al-Rihane region, northwest of Méjez el-Bab. The Axis forces were once overwhelmed by the superior Montgomery forces and fell into a dangerous position of being surrounded. However, by employing skillful mechanized warfare, the situation turned favorable again. They began a fierce counterattack on the morning of the 16th. In conclusion, the battle on the 16th was a complete failure for the anti-Axis forces. The Axis forces seem poised to take advantage of the initiative and launch a fierce counterattack.

Central News Agency, Turin, 17th – Stefani Agency reports that Stephan is commenting from here on the war in Tunisia, saying that although it is difficult to predict who will emerge victorious in the battle, the Axis forces now have a smaller operational area but more solid positions, stronger military strength, and better equipment than the enemy. Rear transportation is maintained by a fully operational railway network. The area currently occupied by the Axis forces was seized last November, and the German and Italian forces are undoubtedly able to strengthen their defenses.

### Damage to Harbor Facilities in Various Locations Makes it Difficult for British Forces to Obtain Supplies

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – According to a maritime news military correspondent, there were no changes in the Tunisian situation in the 24 hours from noon on Thursday to noon on Friday. The British Eighth Army in the southern sector has apparently not yet completed the concentration of its artillery. Since the battle of El Alamein, General Montgomery has always initiated large-scale attacks with rapid and continuous fire, but this time it is proving difficult to accumulate a large amount of ammunition for such rapid and continuous fire. This is because the harbor facilities at Gabès, Sfax, and Sousse have been thoroughly destroyed by the Axis forces before their retreat. Therefore, all supplies for the British Eighth Army must be moved by land, along the only coastal road, which winds greatly along the eastern coast of Tunisia. The distance from the British Eighth Army's last supply base north of the Mareth Line to the area north of Sousse is over 400 kilometers. Although the British forces have a large number of motor vehicles, it will take considerable time to transport the large amount of ammunition needed to launch a new offensive. This may be the main reason why the British Eighth Army has delayed launching a large-scale attack on the Axis positions at Enfidaville. However, this delay is probably only temporary. At present, General Montgomery's troops are only conducting small-scale raids and reconnaissance strikes in the hope of probing the strength of the Axis's new line in the southern sector. On the western front of the bridgehead, there is more fighting activity, but even now, it cannot be said that there is a large-scale attack, only local battles. General Anderson's aim is obviously to tie down the German forces and to gain a favorable starting point to continue his offensive. However, Anderson's plan did not succeed on Thursday. Jebel Ouanana (northwest of Méjez el-Bab) and the heights north of Béja, which were fiercely contested by both sides, remained in German hands. At the same time, the French rebel army, fighting on the right flank of the British First Army in the southeastern region of Bou Arada, was also forced to retreat by a German counterattack. Further west on the Tunisian front, the Axis forces have not been forced to use reserves in any location.

### Fierce Fighting at Kuban Bridgehead. Soviet Forces Suffer Extremely Heavy Losses. German Forces in the Donets Region Repulse Fierce Soviet Attacks.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – It was announced here last night that in the fierce fighting at the Kuban bridgehead on Thursday, the Soviet forces lost an entire tank brigade and at least five regiments. Therefore, the Soviet losses in the past few days amounted to the equivalent of three divisions. The Soviet forces advanced with several regiments and a large number of armored vehicles against German positions in the mountains and on the dikes. However, the Soviet tanks in the front line were stopped by concentrated anti-tank guns and forced to turn back. The infantry they were covering suffered heavy losses under German machine-gun fire. The Soviet forces attacked repeatedly throughout the day, but were repulsed with heavy casualties. The German air force played a great role in defending the positions. Romanian, Slovak, and Croatian squadrons also joined the battle. In this large-scale air battle, a total of 58 Soviet planes were shot down, and another eight were shot down by anti-aircraft guns and machine guns.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – German authorities announced that German forces in the Donets region launched two fierce attacks on Soviet forces on the 16th, repulsing them, killing 770 enemy soldiers, capturing over 100 prisoners, and seizing a large number of weapons and ammunition. In the northern sector, German forces also bombarded important military factory areas and shipyard areas in Leningrad, causing several fires.

Central News Agency, Helsinki, 17th – Stefani Agency reports that the Finnish High Command announced yesterday afternoon that in the past 24 hours, Finnish assault troops had penetrated enemy positions in the eastern sector of the Karelian Isthmus and destroyed their strong defensive works. The enemy forces immediately launched a counterattack, but to no avail and retreated with losses. Another Soviet unit that rushed to the battlefield was also bombarded by Finnish artillery and retreated in disarray. In the eastern area, after more than an hour of fierce fighting, the Finnish forces repulsed a fierce attack by the Soviet assault troops.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – A correspondent for the German Popular Newspaper in Stockholm, Sweden, claimed that Finland's ability to engage in total war relies entirely on the character of its people. Once Finland enters a war, it is forced to mobilize its men, women, and children, regardless of profession, class, or age. This kind of warfare experience cannot be avoided and leaves a deep impression on its people that will never be erased. Germany is the only country that supports Finland as an ally.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 17th – German forces on the Eastern Front have now begun using the latest model of tank, named "Tiger." Soviet authorities have also acknowledged the extremely powerful offensive capabilities of this new type of tank. According to a German newspaper report on the 16th, the operational situation of this new type of tank is as follows: When the German forces were previously fighting in the Belgorod region, they used the latest model "Tiger" tank. Initially, they approached Soviet tanks to a very close distance before suddenly launching an attack. Within two or three minutes, they set the Soviet tanks on fire. When only three meters away from a Soviet tank, they used their heavy guns to attack, instantly destroying the Soviet tank's turret. Other Soviet tanks, upon seeing this tank, were about to retreat separately. The "Tiger" tank then used its maximum speed to closely pursue the Soviet tank formation and annihilate them all.

### Japanese Military Strength Increases; Australia and India Take Notice

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – As the pressure exerted by the Japanese military on the Pacific and Indian Oceans increases daily, the Australian government, the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis military headquarters, and the British Indian military headquarters have all issued appeals. They are all troubled by the Japanese offensive, and this has caused anti-Axis countries to re-evaluate Japanese military strength. London News Chronicle war correspondent Metron, in a report from a port in the South Pacific, said that although the figures for Japanese military strength from the beginning of the war were all speculation, their conclusion that Japanese military strength has increased is worth noting. His report stated that according to recent news, Japan currently has a total of 7.5 million tons of ships. The shipyards in Hong Kong, Singapore, Surabaya, and Manila were not thoroughly destroyed in the past, so recovery is easy. These shipyards have all resumed work in the past year and have achieved considerable results. Although the exact figures are not known, they must be at least 7.5 million tons. Based on this, it can be seen that we underestimated Japan's national strength at the beginning of the war, and we may have underestimated the number of ships Japan possessed. In addition, the numbers of Japanese ships sunk published since the beginning of the war, mainly by the United States, may not be accurate, and the same is true for its air force.

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th – The Australian government and the Southwest Pacific anti-Axis military headquarters have recently repeatedly issued statements about being threatened by the Japanese military. This matter has indeed become a major issue in US political circles and is gradually involving the issue of Macworth's advancement or retreat. According to a Washington dispatch, the anti-Axis military headquarters has also refuted the statements made by anti-Axis army commanders White and Macworth in the Southwest Pacific.

### Japanese Army Technology Association Holds Second Conference

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th – The second conference of the Japanese Army Technology Research Association opened here on the 14th of this month. More than 1,300 people from the military and civilian scientific personnel attended. Over the days, they presented over 300 research reports on military equipment, air defense machinery, clothing, food, hygiene, veterinary medicine, shipping materials, construction, and military supplies, fully promoting the important mission of the Japanese scientific community and contributing to enhancing combat power. The association has now concluded after completing its discussions today.

### Japanese Military Strength Increases in the Aleutian Islands

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to news from New York, reprinted from a US base in Alaska, the Japanese military in the Aleutian Islands is stronger than before. The Japanese military's artillery positions on Kiska Island and Attu Island have greatly increased since the beginning of March.

### Britain and Chongqing Blame Each Other for Failure in the Burma Campaign

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 17th – According to information obtained here, after the British and Indian forces were defeated north of the Jili River on the Indo-Burmese border, the British and Chongqing warlords blamed each other for the responsibility. The British side believes that the defeat was due to the Chongqing army failing to launch cooperative operations on the Yunnan border. The Chongqing side criticized the British and Indian forces for being unprepared for combat, resulting in a panicked retreat. A spokesperson for the Chongqing army publicly pointed out to the press corps on the 15th that it was impossible to retake Burma. Regarding the Japanese appointment of Lieutenant General Kawabe as the supreme commander in Burma, he said that the Japanese side will definitely launch new operations with this change of commanders, so the actions of the Japanese army in the future must be guarded against.

### Anti-Axis Announces US and Australian Military Casualties

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 17th – According to a dispatch from Melbourne, the Australian Anti-Axis Headquarters announced yesterday that as of April 1st, the total number of American and Australian casualties in New Guinea was 10,531, including American air force personnel and soldiers, and Australian soldiers killed, wounded, and missing.

### America's Disadvantageous Position on the Pacific Front

Central News Agency, Buenos Aires, 17th – According to a Washington dispatch, Mackworth and the Australian government have reached a state of opposition with the Washington military leadership regarding the issue of strengthening the air force on the Southwest Pacific front. The US Congress is also paying close attention to this. Senator Chandola, a Democrat, said on the 16th that he recently intended to awaken the attention of the Congress to the attention of the progress of the Pacific War. The current position of the US military on the Pacific front is not necessarily advantageous. He should not neglect the crisis in that area.

### German "Flying Divisions" Transferred to the Atlantic Coast

Central News Agency, Zurich, 17th – A special correspondent for the Swiss newspaper "Tat" reports that Hitler has transferred "flying divisions" from the Eastern Front to France. Behind the Atlantic Wall, there are now powerfully armed motorized infantry and tank units, which are highly mobile and can be used at any point where the enemy breaks through the line. Judging from the medals on the uniforms of many soldiers in these divisions, it can be seen that they are experienced soldiers from the Eastern Front. With their arrival in France, the combat power of Germany's western defenses has been greatly enhanced.

### Visit to a Japanese Industrial Aircraft Manufacturing Plant

This is a factory with a very old tradition of manufacturing wooden training aircraft. The manufacturing of wooden aircraft began around the eleventh year of the Taisho era [1922], and after twenty years of continuous effort, it has created such excellent aircraft as it does today. All profits are put aside, and only the interests of the motherland and the progress of technology are pursued. This has created true Japanese technology, and the achievement of that technology has led to today's leap forward.

"At first, what joy it was to see the aircraft we made with our own hands fly into the sky!"

Here, countless people have gathered from various prefectures and workplaces to work in the factory. A traffic volunteer corps, automatically organized by staff and workers, directs traffic with waving hands and whistling, and arranges machine parts. In the midst of this, an old gentleman with graying hair is particularly noticeable. Upon approaching him, it is learned that this is the factory owner, Director Yasuke Okada. If the director is not seen one day, the workers will be lost all day long, and if he is on sick leave, the entire factory will know about it, and the staff can be heard expressing their indignation.

"Why do the people around here all seem absent-minded?"

For the director, they would go through fire and water without hesitation. This long-standing and strong tradition of Japanese workers has planted the roots of astonishment here.

Upon entering, there is a memorial hall built after a visit from the Emperor. In front of this memorial hall, the soldiers are stepping up their efforts to advance to their duties in the workplace and engage in increased production. A row of factories plays an exciting symphony of production, and the electrical transformer roars like a lion. The achievement board for attendance rate competition, towering in the morning wind, and the job tags displayed in the factory (name and number tags) all show a state of decisive battle. Among the name tags of all those present, there are symbols in the shape of stars indicating dispatch to war.

Every time they hang up their job tags, in the depths of their hearts, they hear the sound of aircraft made with their own hands soaring in the sky on distant battle lines. After visiting the photographs of the war dead enshrined in the shrine, they cannot help but angrily strike the wooden mallet heavily, using it to vent the fighting spirit that wells up in their hearts.

The layout of the machinery, the transportation of materials and products, inspection, lighting, etc., all have the best equipment, accumulated over many years of history and experience. Not only that, but because of the shortage of fuel, working in the dark is considered the ultimate comfort by the warriors. They only abandon their work until they return to the dormitory to take a bath.

The severe cold of the morning makes their fingers feel like they are being pricked by needles, but they ignore it, and they absolutely do not allow themselves time to rub their hands for warmth. The enemy is watching intently, plotting to bomb the Japanese mainland. Aircraft bear a heavy responsibility for the safety of the motherland, and if the warriors neglect their duties, the consequences are unimaginable. This is the first line of maintenance!

However, there is no need to worry unnecessarily. The production efficiency, which tends to decline every year in the middle of February, has been rising linearly since September of last year. The situation in the first month [January] left the heads of the company speechless. February was even more shocking. Materials became increasingly scarce, and the number of apprentice workers increased, but miracles continued to occur, completely overturning past common sense. This is the reason why Japan is truly strong! It is a mysterious power!

In order to have more repetitions of miracles, we ask the warriors to use the spirit of self-sacrifice to serve the motherland. The enemy is a combination of Jewish capital, American materials, and the Anglo-Saxon race, a demonic evil.

Therefore, what I talked about with the warriors in the Third Mitsubishi Makoto Dormitory that night, sincerely and without restraint, in order to increase miracles, I will pass on to the people of the country, hoping that everyone will have a deeper understanding and cooperation with the production camp.

Emotional excitement is the driving force of the increased production movement. The warm send-off received when departing from their hometown naturally turned them into strong warriors. Authorities in various prefectures, in view of the heavy responsibilities borne by apprentice workers, don't they need greater cooperation in the selection of personnel? The apprentice workers who first enter the workplace can be regarded as a testing device for each prefecture's understanding of the current situation. If a bad element mixes in, not only will the partners be disgraced, but it will also hinder the country's desire to build more aircraft.

When a certain worker left his village, he did not receive a grand send-off or encouragement. Therefore, he did not know the importance of the work he was undertaking, so he once claimed illness and returned home. But the situation in his hometown village had changed greatly from when he was away. They had already awakened to the importance of the current situation. He returned to the factory with shame, and afterwards, he became a model worker.

In a certain village, schoolchildren from the national school often wrote letters of condolence and sent them. When the workers from that village saw the letters sent from their hometown, their work efficiency immediately increased significantly, and their savings also increased.

A brave warrior who survived the Nomonhan Incident also came to work. When he entered the workplace, he first expressed his gratitude to the predecessors who made aircraft, and then silently cleaned three rooms by himself. He silently moved towards burying himself in work with the passion of a hundred battles survived, and the performance of the squadron he joined immediately improved. Soon, he was promoted to squadron leader.

But there are certainly those who do not realize the importance of the current situation and therefore do not work hard at their duties. The warriors engaged in production enhancement wake up at five o'clock in the morning and only return to the dormitory to rest around eight or nine o'clock. Their hardships are no less than those on the front lines. The chain of production enhancement sustains such a society. The entire nation unites, encourages them, and moves them, and then miracles constantly appear.

As long as they undergo a single round of motivational speeches, their efficiency will immediately increase significantly. We hope that frontline film news will be shown to them often. Now, plays, movies, entertainment, etc., are no longer the exclusive property of idlers. After hearing words of encouragement, excitement is generated from the bottom of their hearts, and their response is increased production figures clearly placed before us. Those who doubt them, unless they are drunkards lying by the roadside, or those who are not aware of the situation, are our enemies from any point of view.

### A Glimpse of a Light Metal Factory

The work of this factory is to produce aluminum from alumina. Alumina is a raw material that comes from the South. Using alumina to make bauxite is the work of the 〇〇 factory, and the work of the 〇〇 factory is to make aluminum from bauxite. What aluminum is used for and why it is an important material is probably already known to everyone.

The aluminum industry is a very new industry, especially in Japan, where it has only recently emerged. Therefore, there is a great lack of experts in this field, and it can be said to be completely amateurish. Amateurs often make 180-degree U-turns when doing things. Pushing forward with methods that amateurs consider good allows us to see the extraordinary determination of the factory's executives.

Converting bauxite into aluminum requires removing the oxygen from the bauxite in a powerful electrolytic furnace. Apart from Factory Manager Takeda and Manufacturing Section Chief Yasuda, there is no third person who has actually seen this electrolytic furnace and has experience with it. Under the leadership of these two, they led transferees, wounded veterans, juvenile workers, and other amateur workers to begin construction. Construction had to begin at the same time as operations. The urgency of the situation was such.

Work had already begun in the factory where the roof was not yet completed. On rainy days, they worked while holding umbrellas. The construction work above was still in progress, so cement and sand debris fell sporadically, while below, the electrolytic furnace was already burning red. "When smoke first came out of the chimney, it was very joyous."

Section chiefs recalled the situation at the time, saying. "But we were also very worried. Would the thing we made actually be aluminum? It was like worrying about whether a newborn baby has a complete physical structure." This is the reflection of Factory Manager Takeda. The authorities were deeply suspicious, saying, "Will these amateurs really start working?" But the executives took it upon themselves to "do it first and then talk about it." They resolutely continued. And so they succeeded. All the staff below the executives united as one and buried themselves in hard work.

Early in the morning, when the stars were still shining, work had already begun. There were no Sundays. Nor did they borrow the order for increased production. No matter how many times they rested each month, the executives almost never rested. The current electrolysis section chiefs, etc., have reportedly not rested a single day since November of last year. As for the health of the workers, it is very good. The factory manager's belief is that if a person is busy with work, disease has no way to enter. In fact, the executives are very energetic. Manufacturing Section Chief Yasuda, who is busy with guidance, said while watching the workers working next to the scorching electrolytic furnace: "In this factory, people in administrative positions must also do this work. Therefore, at any time, everyone must be prepared to be a reserve force." In the hundreds of degrees of heat, at first, their hands and faces were burned painfully. But the factory manager took the lead, and no one had anything to say. In the 〇〇 factory, there were some obstacles at first, but after all the workers faithfully and strictly adhered to their posts, they currently have a capacity of twelve points. The section chief said: "No matter how many orders for increased production come down, there is no need to fear."

Here, Factory Manager Nishida also wears work clothes, rolls up his leggings, and labors together. Both factory managers are nearly sixty years old and are veterans of the industry, but they still have the spirit to surpass the youth, which is truly great.

In the 〇〇 factory, under the guidance of Hashimoto, the head of the work section, considerable achievements have been made in each process. Using red alumina to make white bauxite, this factory is naturally divided into red and white. Generally speaking, chemical factories are different from mechanical factories. In this place, there is no large area for hammering hot iron sheets with huge iron hammers, nor is there the noise of rapidly rotating lathes all at once, indicating the tension of work. There is only the guidance of certain chemical changes, connecting like a fixed pattern. Therefore, the number of workers is also very small, and sometimes there is not even one person in a certain place. But when you look closely, there are several workers whose eyes are paying close attention to the degree meter. In order to maintain the healthy state of the entire process and prevent minor illnesses before they occur, the workers watching over the work must not be negligent for a moment.

The workers who patiently guard their posts here are all juvenile workers.

I shared dinner with these juvenile workers in the dining hall of the 〇〇 factory's dormitory.

After finishing the meal, after talking about the Javanese military for an hour, a discussion was held with the factory's executives, and they were all lively and energetic. Among them were brave warriors who captured Palembang. A conversation was also held at the 〇〇 factory. The warden here is a brave warrior from the Tokai Brigade of the Java occupation army.

Aluminum has a wide range of uses, so the spirits of the workers are also high. Transferees are unusually serious about their work and have achieved unexpected results. This large factory has smoothly completed its assigned tasks. (Original by Asano Akira - Translated by Sho from the Tokyo Yomiuri Hochi)

### A Pilgrimage to the German Defense Line in the Strait of Dover: Unprecedented Slaughter Lurks in the Beautiful Sand

If the British and Americans were to land in Europe, where would they choose as their landing point? For political reasons, it would seem to be in the Balkans, but from a strategic point of view, it should be the French coast. This is a recent and interesting question. The rumor that the British and Americans will soon land in France is very popular, and the French generally believe it. During this period of rampant rumors, the German authorities stationed in France invited a small number of foreign journalists to inspect the French Atlantic coast and Mediterranean coast in response to the falsehoods of British and American radio propaganda. After a ten-day trip, the reporter will first report on the German army's preparations in the English Channel:

Young Soldiers Sharpened and Ready

As everyone knows, in this war, all defensive equipment is for depth operations and depth equipment.

We set out from northern France and went all the way to the Belgian border, where we saw the German army's depth equipment. Dozens of kilometers away from the coast, in unexpected places, there were tank units and anti-tank artillery units. And here we saw young new recruits who had not yet experienced actual combat, undergoing continuous training. From the occupied areas of the Netherlands, Belgium, France, and Italy, the British and Americans are heavily guarded against, and at the same time, these places are large training grounds for ever-changing strategies. Here there are many new weapons, powerful tanks, and the most efficient light machine guns, modified based on experience from the Eastern Front. The young soldiers, full of vigor and enthusiasm, are practicing all day long. Almost all of those commanding them are young officers wearing the Iron Cross for their war exploits.

Beside the fields where they are practicing are the graves of German, French, and Belgian generals and soldiers who died in the previous Great War. There are also graves of British and Canadian soldiers who died in this war. In front of these graves, they offer a beautiful flower.

The Scenic Line of the Strait of Dover

We patrolled the Belgian border in the thick fog that is unique to the English Channel by bicycle. In the twilight, German soldiers wearing steel helmets floated up. The shadows of people coming and going were leisurely and carefree, as if they were unaware of the war.

Ostend, near the French-Belgian border, was the first seaside resort in 19th-century Europe. We spent the night in a small town south of that place, ending our first day's journey. The next day, our inspection started from Dunkirk, famous for the British retreat, to Boulogne, where Napoleon prepared to land on the British mainland. This area is the coast of the Strait of Dover, which is closest to England. The reporter cannot fully describe the details of the German defense equipment in Dunkirk, Boulogne, and Dieppe. However, in the three years after defeating France, the German army has already built a defensive position that is more solid than the Maginot Line, which took France more than ten years to build. It is enough for us to know this. Because the entire coastline is a continuous line of sand dunes that have not changed their shape over the years, the so-called defensive positions are all powerful fortresses of ancient architecture. Behind the sand dunes are old port towns, with canals stretching out under the misty sky. The lament sung in Baudelaire's poem "The Temptation of Travel" is precisely the scenic line of this coast.

Mines Densely Distributed Everywhere

But now, although the rivers and mountains remain the same, the people have completely changed. Behind the scenery that poets yearn for, there is an amazing structure hidden. The undulating coastline has all become a fire net of important anti-aircraft guns and machine guns. The red tiles on the roofs of the fishing huts, which originally seemed so moving in a painting, have become machines that spew flames. Walking along the coast, for several kilometers, it seems that there is not a single defensive position or a single soldier, but the commander who guides us smiles brightly and says, "If the British soldiers come here, they will have a very lucky encounter!" When you look closely, barbed wire and tank defenses are spread everywhere between the sand dunes and the coast. A certain major led us to visit one underground fire net after another, explaining in detail, and everything we saw made us marvel. It is a pity that these facilities cannot all be described with accurate figures. The construction of defenses is not limited to the coastal area, but extends several kilometers inland, with minefields everywhere. Each of these facilities can be defended alone for several months. The soldiers have personally built clean underground hospitals and underground theaters. Wartime and peacetime life coexist here. In one corner of a fire net, amaryllis flowers planted by the soldiers are in full bloom.

Not only among the German troops can we see the vigorous human vitality, but the French residents living in the villages and towns along this coastline also have the same vigorous vitality. Many towns in Dunkirk, Calais, and Boulogne were reduced to ruins by the bombings of the German and British air forces in 1940. But the people here are reluctant to abandon their hometowns. Vegetable stalls and bakeries have been opened one after another, and the streets are extremely crowded. While passing through a certain town in Calais, we saw a dozen girls playing in a dilapidated courtyard. In the wasteland burned by wildfire, we also saw orchids sprouting.

The Activity of the Todt Organization

The German military's defensive facilities are being strengthened. Workers from Belgium are building new projects under the jurisdiction of the "Todt Organization" (Todt was the former German Director-General of Highways and a national defense engineering expert). There are also women mixed in among them. These conscripted workers also have the ability to fight with weapons when necessary. Many of the soldiers guarding the coast have experienced fierce battles with injuries on the Eastern Front.

"Night and fog are what the soldiers consider to be the most difficult things. On days when there is thick fog, the sun hides her body. When they encounter this kind of situation, the soldiers are all deployed and ready, waiting with their spears as pillows."

The major said this. But even in this constant tense atmosphere, there was no gloom on their faces.

In short, in this corner of the English Channel, the German army has exerted the greatest capability of modern defense. Standing on the sand dunes of the English Channel, the reporter looked out with deep emotion and could not help but feel a sense of vicissitude. For centuries, this channel has sustained the various destinies of England and the Continent. Napoleon had pondered for months in Boulogne, planning how to land in England. Now, it has been transformed into a place where the German army is waiting to mobilize. Unprecedented slaughter is lurking beneath this beautiful sand. The sun is gradually sinking in the distance of the gray sea. When will history repeat her fate? (Special dispatch from Paris - Translated by Sho from the Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun, April 4)

### The East Asia Medical Society Holds a General Meeting of Staff

### Burmese Political Party Holds a General Meeting: Ba Maw Attends and Gives a Speech, Urging the Burmese People to Work Together to Achieve Independence

Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency) - The Burmese Dobama Sinyetha Party held its New Year's General Meeting here today. Party leader Ba Maw gave a speech on the spot, saying in essence: "The independence that we have been praying for for many years will be realized within this year, so this year in Burma can be said to be a year of epoch-making significance. In the past few decades, we have fought with our bare hands to achieve Burmese independence. Thinking of this, I am filled with a myriad of emotions. The reason why Burma is about to become independent is entirely due to the sincerity and friendship of Japan. I, as a party member, express my deep gratitude for this. I believe that in order to repay Japan's deep friendship, the members of our party should unite with the people of the whole country and implement the following four items: (1) In order to defend our homeland, it is an urgent task to establish a defense force, so it should be organized as soon as possible and the army, navy, and air force should be strengthened to complete Burma's defense. (2) In order to realize Burmese independence, in addition to establishing a defense force, the people of the whole country should carry out labor service so that Burma, which has been turned into a waste furnace, can be restored as soon as possible. (3) Men and children who are unable to participate in the above two matters should take on other work, that is, maintain law and order in the rear and abide by the law, and be good wartime Burmese citizens. (4) The sixteen million Burmese people should unite under one order and one command, and strive together to strive for the final victory in realizing independence. The spirit of the people of Japan, Germany, Italy, and other countries to endure all sacrifices in order to win victory is our only model, and I would like to encourage you, the members of our party, to do the same."

Yangon, 17th (Central News Agency) - On April 17th, Burma's only political party, the Dobama Sinyetha Party, held a New Year's General Meeting at Luolni Han Square in Yangon at 9:30 a.m. on the 17th to express its celebration.

The German defense was quite effective, and by noon today, 51 enemy aircraft had been shot down. Experts believe that the German night fighters made the greatest contribution in this battle, especially considering the clear weather. The anti-aircraft guns were also quite effective. Last night, heavy fog covered Britain, and it is believed that many damaged British and American aircraft were unable to return safely to their bases.

### Polish Government-in-Exile Calls for Investigation into Whereabouts of Captured Soldiers Held by Soviets; Germany Announces 10,000 Polish Soldiers Massacred by Soviets

Stockholm, 17th (Central News Agency) - On April 10, German authorities invited a group of defense reporters to the front line near Smolensk, where they publicly exhumed the graves of 10,000 Polish officers and soldiers who had been secretly massacred by the Soviet secret police. After this news was released, public opinion in various countries was greatly shocked. The British government feared that relations with the anti-Axis countries would become more chaotic. Prime Minister Churchill and Foreign Secretary Eden hosted a banquet for Polish Prime Minister Sikorski on the 15th to hold earnest talks. According to a telegram from London, the Polish government-in-exile issued a statement on the 16th, calling on the International Red Cross and other impartial national government organizations to conduct a detailed investigation, and the situation is worsening. According to a telegram from Moscow, the Soviet Information Bureau issued a statement on the 16th denying the German authorities' report. However, the German government stated that it was determined to form a defense group to investigate and clarify the truth. According to a telegram from Berlin, the head of the German Red Cross, Dr. Grawitz, invited the International Red Cross on the 16th to cooperate in an on-site investigation to verify whether these corpses were indeed massacred by the Soviet secret police.

Lisbon, 17th (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from London, the Polish Minister of Defense of the government-in-exile issued the following statement on the 16th: The Soviet newspaper Red Star reported on May 17, 1940, that the Soviet army had captured 100 Polish officers and soldiers in battles on May 17, 1939. According to information obtained by the Polish government, the Soviet Union established three prisoner-of-war camps in November 1939: Kozielsk, east of Smolensk; Starobielsk, near Kharkiv; and Ostashkov, near Kalinin. The Kozielsk camp held 4,500 officers and other prisoners, totaling 5,000 people. The Starobielsk camp held 100 civilians, 5,800 officers, and 6,570 other prisoners. Between April 5 and mid-May 1940, the Soviet authorities dissolved these camps. After the establishment of a treaty and military agreement between the Soviet and Polish governments, when organizing the Polish army within Soviet territory, 7,000 lower-ranking soldiers and civilians went missing, as well as 8,300 officers. Therefore, Ambassador Kot and General Anders requested the Soviet government to investigate the whereabouts of these Polish officers and soldiers. On October 6, 1941, Ambassador Kot twice requested the Soviet government to publish a list of Polish prisoners. On December 3, 1941, General Sikorski visited Moscow and met with Chairman Stalin. During the talks, he requested the complete release of Polish prisoners of war. The Soviet government only stated that the list had not yet been compiled. Our side handed Chairman Stalin a list of 3,843 officers who had been held in one camp. At that time, Chairman Stalin stated that the amnesty for Polish people applied to both military personnel and civilians. The Soviet side also claimed that all Polish officers had been released. Subsequently, in March 1942, General Anders again handed Chairman Stalin an additional list of 800 officers. None of the Polish officers listed on that list have returned. Foreign Minister Raczynski also repeatedly informed Soviet Ambassador Bogomolov to inquire about the news of the prisoners. The Polish government has not yet received a response from the Soviet side regarding the whereabouts of these prisoners. Germany discovered the bodies of thousands of Polish officers near Smolensk. The German government's intelligence specifically stated that these officers were brutally murdered by the Soviet secret police in the spring of 1940. Therefore, the International Red Cross must investigate this discovered public cemetery and clarify the truth. The Polish government is now requesting the organization to send representatives to the locations where Polish prisoners of war were massacred to investigate and clarify the truth.

### Readers' Forum – Request the Authorities to "Comfort the People's Hearts" and "Establish National Credibility"

— Xin Ye

Since the National Government issued the order to thoroughly investigate hoarding and speculation, we, the ordinary people who are deeply affected by high prices, feel as if we have received a long-awaited sweet rain in the scorching heat, and we feel unspeakable joy and comfort. Although we are concerned about whether it is possible to "thoroughly investigate" and "handle fairly," seeing the status of those responsible for the thorough investigation and the support and encouragement from public opinion, I think there must be some sensational facts to show, and it will never be a flash in the pan, disgracing the mission, because this is related to comforting the people's hearts and maintaining credibility.

But now the person in charge of the investigation has returned to the capital to report on his mission, and what we have seen is only one bank being sealed and closed, and one hoarder being sent to the court for interrogation. Although it is said that "the investigation work is still ongoing," we can imagine the situation in the future from the first investigation. It is like a sky full of dark clouds, but in the end, the wind blows the clouds away, and not even a drop of light rain is seen. Does the government disregard public opinion and let these criminals who harm the people and disrupt society go unpunished?

The call for cracking down on hoarding and speculation has long been filled in society, and recently, friendly countries have also paid great attention to this thorough investigation. Public opinion is also unanimously supporting it. This kind of enthusiasm is a manifestation of the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows in East Asia. If the government indulges and tolerates these criminals, it will not only deeply stimulate the people, but also be despised by friendly countries. Therefore, for the sake of loving the people and thanking the enthusiasm of friendly countries, the government must severely punish the treacherous merchants who hoard and speculate in order to comfort the people's hearts internally and establish national credibility externally. We hope that our wise authorities will show this with facts.

### Economy

It is heard that the oil presses in the concession area, which have been closed for a long time, are preparing to resume work in order to increase edible oil production. Da You Yu has already signed a contract with the Japanese Sanxing Company.

### Commentary: Merging Small Banks

The way this investigation into speculation and hoarding by financial institutions in this city has ended has aroused unanimous dissatisfaction from the public, especially the media. The reason is very simple: we do not want to see the National Government's wartime economic policies failing to achieve their intended effect, thereby undermining public trust. As the Continental Daily News commented on April 11: "People believe that if this investigation ends in a half-hearted and hasty manner, the National Government's economic policy, which has painstakingly established the National Commercial Control Association to embark on the path of national capital self-mobilization, will be obstructed; there is a deep concern that, in the worst-case scenario, it will further promote political and economic antagonism between the government and the people." These words can be said to be a very clear warning, which should be universally remembered by our country, both high and low.

Yesterday's news stated that, in order to thoroughly resolve the hoarding incident, the relevant authorities have decided to take decisive action against those who violate government laws and disrupt the social economy in their business operations. At the same time, they have decided to merge some small banks. Indeed, many new banks have been established in this city in recent years, forming a separate force in the banking sector. Although many of them may not necessarily be determined to be illegitimate, at least some of them are not "not engaged in illegitimate businesses." In view of the idioms "He who touches pitch shall be defiled" and "One rotten apple spoils the barrel," we believe that, after confirming that small banks are indeed engaged in illegitimate businesses, it would be better to close them down decisively rather than merge them, which would create a comprehensive collusion.

According to Article 8, Sections 4 and 8, of the Shanghai Banking Association's articles of association, the obligations of member banks of the association are to "respond to the association's consultations and investigations" and "not engage in illegitimate businesses." Therefore, all banks belonging to the Banking Association, whether government-run or privately-run, large or small, should be uniformly instructed by the government authorities to have local banking associations be responsible for assisting in the investigation and reporting impartially on whether their member banks are engaged in illegitimate businesses. As for the responsibility for punishment, it naturally belongs to the government authorities.

### After Investigating Hoarding and Suppressing Prices: Futong Bank Suspends Operations in Compliance with Orders, Bank Strictly Handles Mortgage Loans, Implements Investigation of Godowns and Warehouses for Inventory

After the authorities investigated the loan account books of various banks and financial institutions in order to take action in response to the crackdown on hoarding and suppress prices, the Futong Commercial Bank at No. 422 Hankou Road, which was suspected of being seriously involved in hoarding materials and disrupting the market through the unregistered Zhenhua Company, was ordered to temporarily suspend operations for investigation. The bank has complied with the order, but the deposits of all depositors will still be paid as usual without restrictions.

The authorities have expressed acceptance and will consider it appropriately.

### After Strictly Cracking Down on Hoarding: Land Prices Soar

Since the government authorities strictly inspected the hoarding incidents in this city and strengthened various controls, the market situation in this city has become much more stable. In recent days, the prices of various goods have not experienced violent increases or decreases. However, real estate prices have risen instead. Since the Japanese authorities completed the procedures for lifting the disposal of enemy properties, real estate transactions in this city have become slightly more active from a state of extreme stagnation, and prices have also risen accordingly. In recent days, due to the authorities' supervision of hoarding, those with idle funds have dared not engage in hoarding again, so they have shifted their target to real estate transactions, and thus real estate prices have risen rapidly.

### Cotton Products Trade Association: Held a Meeting of Directors and Supervisors Yesterday

After the Ministry of Industry designated Feng Luzhan and other 50 people as initiators of the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Cotton Products Trade Association Joint Association, they actively prepared and convened an initiators' meeting on the 6th of this month, passed the articles of association, and selected Nie Lusheng, Cheng Jingtang, Ding Fangyuan, Tang Zhiliang, Pan Xusheng, Liu Jingji, Jiang Keding, Jiang Yaocheng, Pan Ziqi, Chen Xiping, Lu Yintang, Tang Xinghai, Guo Dihuo, Guo Qiqing, Rong Erren, Jiang Shangda, and Yu Tinghui as directors, and Wen Lanting, Chen Zhanru, Wang Diwu, Shan Zhirong, Wu Kunsheng, Tong Runfu, and Wang Qiyu as supervisors. Nie Lusheng was elected as the chairman of the board of directors, Cheng Jingtang as the vice chairman of the board of directors, Ding Fangyuan, Tang Zhiliang, Pan Xusheng, Liu Jingji, and Jiang Keding as standing directors, and Wen Lanting as the chairman of the board of supervisors.

Yesterday, the first meeting of directors and supervisors was held at the Yarn Mill Association to discuss the direction of association affairs, and the association's office was established at No. 88 Bowuyuan Road, and began operations immediately.

### Translation: Public Opinion Trends on the Hoarding Incident

The hoarding issue has become a completely political issue, giving the various levels of people in the concession a serious shock. What the various sectors of the concession hope for from the National Government was initially a partial hope and claim, "strictly punish hoarders." Now this partial hope has turned into a political request, "hoping that the National Government will renew the national guiding spirit, practice clean politics, so as to realize true Sino-Japanese cooperation and stabilize people's livelihood." After investigating hoarding, the National Government's announcement of the punishment of Zhenhua Company, Futong Bank, and the statements of Vice Ministers Chen and Yuan have been highly valued by political and economic figures in the concession. The trends in public opinion are generally as follows:

(1) Chen and Yuan issued a statement on the 14th saying: "This investigation has come to an end. The speculative merchants who hoard may not be limited to Zhenhua Company and Futong Bank. Therefore, the investigation work will continue." However, now is the time to make the order to crack down on hoarding truly authoritative. This time, only punishing small banks and small companies can be said to be catching small fish and letting go of big fish.

(2) People from all walks of life in the concession believe that political factional forces are abusing their privileges to engage in planned hoarding and speculation. Therefore, in order to dispel public doubts, the board of directors, supervisors, capital, and criminal content of Zhenhua Company and Futong Bank should be announced to show that the guiding task in the Shanghai speculative market has been completed and the unrest in the people's minds has been eliminated.

(3) Regarding the hoarding incident, it is hoped that the authorities will prevent hoarding at this time with the determination to put righteousness above personal interests.

(4) Regardless of any status, those who engage in activities that disrupt people's livelihood are hoped that the authorities will uniformly impose the death penalty to prevent bad elements from disrupting the market.

(5) The importance of this hoarding incident in politics should not be underestimated. A local operation will not be effective. It should be based on the National Government's spirit of nation-building, and courageously forge ahead to overcome difficulties. Shen Bao, which is regarded as representing general public opinion, published an editorial on the 16th entitled "Catching Small Fish," which expressed its hope that the results of the hoarding investigation would be made public. The content is as follows:

We would like to raise three inquiries regarding this hoarding investigation and request satisfactory answers from the government and the investigators to dispel public doubts.

(1) The National Government's order pointed out the original capital of the companies and banks that were found to have factual evidence of speculation, the amount of funds used for speculative hoarding, and where these funds came from.

(2) Who are the major shareholders and important directors and supervisors of these two commercial firms, and are there any government personnel involved?

(3) If it is believed that the members of these two commercial firms are all "speculative merchants" among pure merchants, then is it absolutely true that no government personnel are engaged in speculative hoarding activities? If the facts are true, but they are not reported or investigated, and are deliberately shielded and concealed, then we believe that this government's order to investigate is an absolute failure.
