### Food Supply During the China Famine

— Zhang Yipeng

Introducing an easily cultivated, high-yield, and nutritious food substitute

In last month's 24th issue of the "Weekly Forum," I wrote an article on the prerequisites for famine relief. If we can work diligently according to these principles, the results will be better than simply going through the motions or superficially embellishing things, and we may even achieve some practical gains. However, thinking about the difficulties that inevitably arise after the relief work is completed, we should prepare as early as possible. Historically, after a major disaster, displacement and migration leave most homes empty and the land barren. Even if the weather is favorable the following year, what good will it do? Therefore, attracting back displaced people is the primary virtuous act of local officials. But even if there are people to farm the land, the farming implements will have been scattered and lost due to the escape from the famine, and it will be necessary to find ways to collect and replenish them. Fortunately, if farm tools are not lacking and people are not lazy, what good is it if there are no seeds? The other day, I heard from many people in the north who wrote, "We need seeds for rice, beans, and wheat now, even more urgently than food." This is the reason. However, the sorghum, beans, and wheat in the north are usually sown around May in the lunar calendar, which is impossible this year. We have to wait a year, so how can people survive? I once saw a handwritten document by Mr. Zhu Huai about Baofeng (a plant name). If we can obtain the seeds and quickly send them to the disaster area, then all the difficulties mentioned above can be completely resolved. Now I have found the original manuscript, organized and summarized it, and introduced it to all of you readers. It would be a great blessing if we could all work together to address this issue.

Baofeng originated in South America and was originally called "Pon-feng," translated as Baofeng. Sometimes it is also called Baofen, which is a transliteration. More than a century ago, it was widely planted in Java and is a food plant in the yam family. During the European War, Germany had the richest reserves of it and later relied on it to avoid starvation. It is now said to be the main substitute for food. There are many German expatriates in China; why not inquire in detail with familiar friends?

The ease with which it can be planted and grown is truly unheard of. As long as the soil is fertile and loose, whether it is on hillsides, in mountain valleys, or even at the foot of earthen walls, it will live when planted and grow large. When planting, bury the branches left over from the previous time in the soil, using mud to cover them. The branches will then grow into bulbs in all directions in the dark. Initially, artificial irrigation is required, but once it sprouts, it is unaffected by either floods or droughts. Therefore, no management is required until harvest. Moreover, it can be planted twice a year, in spring (March-April) and autumn (July-August), which are the planting seasons. When planting, cut off the tip of the branch at an angle, leaving eight inches, and insert it into the soil, paying attention to the top and bottom. Do not turn it upside down. After three months (eighty days in Java, one hundred or one hundred and twenty days in Germany), pull it out by hand. If the bulb can be pulled out along with the roots, it is ripe.

The quantity produced is even more surprising. It is harvested twice a year, more in the spring and less in the autumn. Each bulb yields six or seven pounds, and each acre can be planted with four or five hundred branches, yielding at least twenty or thirty "dan" (a unit of weight), totaling sixty "dan" for both harvests, which is equivalent to twenty times the yield of rice and wheat. Dig a two-foot-deep pit in dry land, pile them in it, and cover them with straw or chaff. They can be preserved for more than a year, but after a flood, the skin becomes slippery and shiny, and they cannot be stored for long. It seems somewhat similar to the yams we commonly see, but yams are only harvested once a year, yielding at most twenty "dan" per acre, and are greatly affected by floods and droughts. Moreover, the starch content is too low, only 18% to 20%, and the water content is too high, so they cannot be stored for long. Comparing the two, how can they be spoken of in the same breath?

Its uses are especially broad. In Java, it is used as a common food, and in Germany during wartime, it was also used as a major item for famine relief. In addition, it can be used to make wine and alcohol, or sauces and vinegar, as well as the starch needed in industry and the paste used in textiles. It is considered a treasure not only for famine relief. Now, here is a list of its ingredients:

The various materials above were obtained by Mr. Mi Huai after much effort in research. Mr. Zhu discovered Baofeng a year ago. His motivation was that rice prices were rising higher and higher at that time. He wanted to transplant this high-yield, easy-to-sow crop to replace rice and flour, which has helped us with the important matter of famine relief. If it succeeds, it will indeed be the greatest benefit for the disaster victims. Mr. Zhu said that our friendly neighbor, Japan, is world-renowned for its research and promotion of practical applications, and he believes that Baofeng is definitely being tested there. If they are willing to share some seeds with China and send them to the disaster area before July so that they can be sown, it would truly be the realization of sharing joys and sorrows, and coexisting in prosperity. Now, the Ministry of Social Welfare and the Ministry of Food are leading the famine relief efforts in North China, and they are doing their utmost. If they can also implement a permanent plan so that millions of disaster victims can rely on it for generations, this achievement will be forever recorded in history.

Koo Hung-ming, a critic of world civilization produced by modern China, warned in 1901 about the method by which Japan should handle the Chinese problem:

### Words from a True "Japan Expert" and "China Expert"

— Yoshida Tsukasa

"Japan is the last country to grasp the key to solving the Chinese problem. Because the Chinese problem is related to the interests of Japanese national life, Japan has a greater stake in its solution than any other country. Japan's current position is that its military power alone is sufficient to exclude other countries and forcefully implement its own policies toward China. But Japan cannot observe China through foreign-made spectacles just because it can do so. If Japan holds a correct and clear view of the core of the Chinese problem, then Japan may become the 'Mark-graf' guarding the borders of East Asian civilization." (Koo Hung-ming, "The Spirit of the East," p. 77)

He warned Japan, "Do not use foreign-made spectacles to observe China." This statement sounded quite harsh to some Japanese people at the time. Before the Boxer Rebellion, the Japanese respected China as a civilized and advanced country and never looked down on China like the European and American powers. Since the Boxer Rebellion, when Japan joined the ranks of European and American countries, Japan began to develop the habit of observing Chinese people, who are also of the yellow race, through "foreign-made spectacles." Since the Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895, this habit has become increasingly entrenched among the Japanese. It sounds unpleasant to Chinese ears, but to Japanese ears, it is like calling Japanese people a humorous name, with some Japanese people thinking that Chinese people are one or two stages behind in terms of cultural development. Some people, like the British "China expert" Arthur Smith, think that Chinese people are a race with the special characteristic of having the so-called "talents of misunderstandings." Some people think that Chinese people have no patriotism or sense of shame, and are just a nation with a highly developed sense of self-interest. Therefore, countless groups of egoists are constantly causing struggles within the country. They believe that for such a nation, it may be a more appropriate political form to divide it rather than unify it.

But in this atmosphere in Japan, one should know that there is also a reform movement budding in China with the same characteristics as the Japanese Meiji Restoration. They argue that cultivating and strengthening this reform movement is the mission of Japan, an advanced country in Asia. They believe that the Republican Revolution is a Chinese patriotic movement that arose during the Japanese Meiji Restoration. Assisting this movement, ensuring China's independence and freedom, and protecting the continent from the invasion of Anglo-American capitalism will also ensure Japan's position as a strong country in the world. They believe that when the liberated Asian continent becomes Japan's backdrop, Japan will be able to gain the strength to eliminate Anglo-American pressure. Therefore, they are quite dissatisfied with Japan's diplomatic policies at the time, which tended to follow Anglo-American policies. In order to break this situation, it is necessary to ensure the success of the Chinese national revolution. Here is a quote from Kita Ikki, one of the "they," which shows how clearly he understood the relationship between the Chinese revolutionary movement and Japan:

"The spirit of Japanese patriotism is gradually revealing a glimmer of dawn in China. When the Japanese spirit of patriotism becomes familiar with their revolutionary party, and they are dealing with Japan in a certain situation, they will actually incite anti-Japanese movements. In fact, at that time, it is a lesson that we should be aware of, to know that they have not understood Japan's true intentions... Japan began to take on the task of teaching young people in neighboring countries ten years ago, without any revolutionary meaning. For the sake of Japan's interests, it also hopes that China can exist as an independent country. However, their young people are sensitive to the honor and disgrace of their country, and they are paying close attention to the gains and losses of their national rights. The hope that Japan can satisfy is not just to be the leader of Asia and act as a teacher? They are tired of hearing those stale theories of friendship, such as being of the same culture and race, and sharing the same fate. They have awakened and believe that Japan wants to treat them with the contemptuous view of those who are accustomed to oppressing the people of a subjugated country. They are full of patriotism, and based on their own reason and hope, they believe that the future of the two countries can only be based on their own rule and Japan's change of attitude, so that friendship can be expected... In short, China is no longer the China of ten years ago. Due to the preconceived notions of ten years ago, the officials and China experts who are contacted only see the surface of China, which is the rotten and decaying class of a subjugated country that can be destroyed by the Wuchang Uprising." (Kita Ikki, "An Unofficial History of the Chinese Revolution," pp. 56, 58)

He observed the Chinese revolution as a rebirth of the Japanese spirit of patriotism in China, and went on to say, "Japan's policy of preserving China is only acting as a dog for Britain's financial annexation of China, and is simply wasting a good intention. (ibid., p. 197)" He exposed the reasons for the anti-Japanese sentiment.

Kita Ikki was a close friend of Uchimura Kanzo and a true China expert who directly participated in the practical work of the Chinese revolution. Koo Hung-ming had a Japanese wife and taught at a Japanese school. He was a true Japan expert. In terms of Chinese politics, the former was a revolutionary and the latter was a royalist. Two people with different races and different political views were in complete agreement on Japan's policies toward China. The former said that Japan should "not be a dog for Britain's annexation of China," and the latter said, "Japan should not use foreign-made spectacles to observe China." Although the words are different, the intentions are the same. Both acknowledged China's independence and freedom, and explained that working with a liberated China to resist the United States and Britain was the way to make Japan a leader in Asia and a "frontier defense general."

Now, this view is becoming increasingly powerful in Japan regarding the Chinese problem. The idea of Japan "solving China by force" is definitely not supported by the Japanese people. In terms of concepts, the direction of solving the Chinese problem is completely determined by the direction indicated by this view.

The problem for the future is how Japan will faithfully fulfill the equal relationship between China and Japan guaranteed by the new policy, and how the Chinese will understand Japan's fulfillment. If Japan truly gradually realizes the equal relationship between China and Japan, then the Chinese will also know how to cooperate with Japan's war aims. Therefore, how the emotional opposition between China and Japan since the September 18th Incident is the key to solving the incident depends on what the Chinese see as Japan's true intentions in the current state of Sino-Japanese relations.

The Japanese of today are actually true Chinese who inherited the mantle of the Tang Dynasty. Due to the invasion of the Mongols (Yuan Dynasty), the essence of true Chinese civilization since the Tang Dynasty disappeared from the Chinese mainland except for Jiangsu and Zhejiang. That is still preserved as it was in Japan. And Japan is the only powerful country in East Asia that does not allow Westerners to trample on it. So why can't the relationship between Japan and China proceed smoothly? It is just like "brothers fighting over their parents' treasures," and it is also just like the relationship between the British and the French. But China is what the Japanese call the land where beautiful flowers bloom, and Japan is a perfect structure that applies the sharp tools of modern European civilization. Here, we should use the morality of the East to protect this flower and this land. (Koo Hung-ming, "The Great East Asian Culture") (June 11) (Translated by Xiang)

### Official Announcement from the Japanese Foreign Ministry: Recognition of the New Argentine Government; Rumors of Ramírez Forming a New Political Party

Tokyo, 12th – Central News Agency: Following Argentina's declaration on the 5th of this month establishing a provisional government with General Ramírez assuming the office of provisional president, Foreign Minister Storni was dispatched on the 8th with official documents to visit Ambassador Afui, the Japanese representative to Argentina, formally notifying him of the provisional government's aims. Concurrently, it was conveyed that the government intends to maintain the traditional friendly relations between Japan and Argentina. The Japanese government, after careful consideration of various aspects, has decided to recognize the new government and instructed Ambassador Tomii on the 11th to relay this intention to the Argentine provisional government. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Foreign Ministry officially announced this at 11:30 AM today.

Berlin, 12th – Central News Agency: The German Foreign Ministry revealed yesterday that before recognizing the new Argentine government, Germany had obtained assurances that Argentina would temporarily maintain neutrality. Berlin sources stated that the new Argentine government had notified the German representative that it had assumed power and would temporarily maintain neutrality, a move deemed proper. Germany's policy is to not interfere in other countries' internal affairs, and since former Argentine President Castillo and former Foreign Minister Guinis have returned to the country, Germany has no reason not to recognize the new Argentine government. Berlin sources also stated that the Argentine revolution is clearly about resolving domestic political issues.

Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: After the formation of the new Argentine cabinet, it immediately clarified Argentina's domestic and foreign policy guidelines. On the 9th, it further announced the implementation of strict control measures over the domestic economy, thus stabilizing public sentiment. The domestic opinion circles unanimously expressed their support for the new government. The main policy direction of the new government domestically is to purify the government and eliminate communism. Several communist leaders have been arrested in Buenos Aires, and corrupt party politics will be reformed. According to Argentine government sources, Argentina will organize a large-scale national party that is integrated with the government to promote its policies. Although General Ramírez has not expressed any intention to organize a new party at present, his attitude towards existing parties is quite indifferent, hence the Radical Party feels largely thwarted by the government's attitude.

Rome, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Havas report, responsible sources here stated that Rome, upon receiving news of the change of government in Argentina, immediately notified the new Argentine government of Italy's formal recognition. The Italian government also took this opportunity to express its hope that the Ramírez government would fully prioritize the interests of the Argentine people in implementing domestic and foreign policies.

Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: Yesterday, various countries continued to recognize the Argentine government. According to the list released by the Argentine government, Sweden, Hungary, the Dominican Republic, Bulgaria, and the Polish, Dutch, and Greek governments-in-exile have all recognized the new Argentine government.

Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Havas correspondent stationed in Buenos Aires, the new Argentine government may organize a large-scale political party to support its policies, but to what extent President Ramírez and his cabinet are paying attention to this plan is still unknown. In any case, the government believes that "internal purification" and the exclusion of certain party leaders are necessary. From some hints, we can assert that the new Argentine government will continue to fight against communism with the utmost determination. It is reported that several prominent leaders of illegal communist movements have been arrested. The situation in Argentina has stabilized, and the more than 6,000 troops who entered Buenos Aires with the new government are scheduled to return to the Campo de Mayo barracks, located fifteen kilometers from Buenos Aires, starting next week, and will hold a review ceremony before their departure to pay respect to President Ramírez and his cabinet. At the same time, the new Argentine government continues to announce new appointments for government restructuring, including the appointment of the original engineer Bartolini as the Minister of Public Works, Dr. Gai Ke Shu as the Foreign Minister, while the Finance Minister remains unchanged. The command headquarters of the army and navy have also been replaced with new people. Rear Admiral Cerro is now solely in charge of naval affairs, and his former position as Naval Commander has been succeeded by Colonel I Yamashi Shisireno. Shi has chosen the battleship Moreno as his flagship, and Colonel Bending has been appointed as Chief of Naval Staff, while Colonel Basriko serves as Secretary-General of the Naval Department. The national merchant fleet will continue to be under the jurisdiction of the Naval Department. Furthermore, the Post and Telegraph Bureau has notified all wireless stations that future propaganda will be limited to the prescribed extent, wireless reporters must use the Spanish language, and strive to avoid the use of local slang.

### The Sound of Scientific Victory (5)

In recent years, the number of young people in Japan suffering from nearsightedness has been increasing, so much so that foreigners have even coined the phrase, "Those wearing glasses must be Japanese," making Japan the number one nearsighted country in the world. But in today's Greater East Asia War, eyes are also excellent weapons. To achieve victory in the war, we can no longer neglect the increasingly prevalent problem of nearsightedness among young people. What are the causes of nearsightedness? Why is nearsightedness particularly common in Japan? What methods can be used to eradicate and prevent it? These questions should be posed to Dr. Ishihara Shinobu, a renowned authority in the Japanese ophthalmology field, professor emeritus at Tokyo Imperial University, and former principal of Maebashi Medical College, who has published works such as "Eradicating Nearsightedness, Curing Nearsightedness" and "The Problem of Nearsightedness in Japan."

As everyone knows, nearsightedness is when the axial length of the eye is longer than the eye's refractive power, causing parallel light rays to converge in front of the retina, failing to focus a clear image on the back of the eye, making it impossible to see clearly at a distance. From this, we can understand that nearsightedness and farsightedness are not the same thing. Ordinary people think that "nearsightedness" is all the same, but those commonly referred to as nearsightedness, there are also three types: refractive nearsightedness, pseudo-nearsightedness, and axial nearsightedness. Refractive nearsightedness is when the refractive power of the cornea or crystalline lens is stronger than normal eyes; axial nearsightedness is when the refractive power of the cornea and crystalline lens, etc., does not change, but the axial length of the eye is long, and the retina is further back than normal eyes, forming a spherical eyeball that is elongated front and back into an oval shape. This is mostly due to heredity. Pseudo-nearsightedness is when a normal eye is in a state of tension of the eye's adjustment function for a long time due to constantly looking at small things, becoming a habit. So what is the reason for this? Generally speaking, the cause of nearsightedness can be said to be "due to looking at things up close." For example, when activities such as reading and writing, etc., become habits at a close distance, it becomes the cause of nearsightedness.

However, in the same school, with the same degree of effort, some become nearsighted while others do not. Why is that? This has a lot to do with the condition of the eyes and the body. For example, those with weak constitutions often become nearsighted, and at the same time, those who lack knowledge about "eye" health, in other words, are studying refractive nearsightedness. Thus, this kind of directly imported ophthalmology not only has never been able to cure nearsightedness, but has instead increased it.

Therefore, it was thought that nearsightedness in Japan is by no means all hereditary, and there must be other reasons. As a result of diligent research, this assumption was finally broken. That is, in what is called nearsightedness in Japan, there is less hereditary axial nearsightedness, but pseudo-nearsightedness accounts for one-half of the total, in addition to other reasons. So why do Japanese people have the most nearsighted eyes among all ethnic groups in the world? In the field of ophthalmology, the special conditions of Japanese nearsightedness have always been ignored, and judged as general nearsightedness based on Western European ophthalmology.

The nearsightedness discussed in Western European ophthalmology is almost all hereditary nearsightedness, followed by refractive nearsightedness. Therefore, in the past, in Japan, as long as it was considered nearsightedness, they would put a pair of glasses on the patient, and it was later realized that this treatment method was definitely not suitable for nearsightedness other than hereditary axial nearsightedness. Therefore, because of this inappropriate treatment method, nearsightedness in Japan has not only failed to be eradicated, but has instead increased day by day.

So, how many nearsighted patients are there among the young people who will be the future masters of Japan? Let's first look at the students with the most nearsightedness. In 1935, the Ministry of Education responded to the imperial universities in various places and conducted a nearsightedness survey of 27,000 students in six prefectures including Tokyo, Kyoto, Osaka, Fukuoka, Chiba, and Ishikawa. The results were: 25.43% for male elementary school students, 28.50% for female elementary school students, 41.23% for middle school students, 44.47% for higher girls' schools, and 67.03% for higher schools. Let's also look at the increase rate of nearsightedness among students from 1913 to 1935.

Middle school 16% - 31%, higher girls' schools 10% - 30%, higher schools 42% - 52%, imperial universities 46% - 57%. This means that middle schools have doubled, higher girls' schools have tripled, and this rate of increase is truly frightening.

But as mentioned above, pseudo-nearsightedness accounts for half of the total, and refractive nearsightedness accounts for most of the rest.

So, how should this nearsightedness, which requires Japanese faces to be framed with glasses, be treated as depicted by Westerners? In other words, how can this dishonorable pair of glasses be taken off? As mentioned above, axial nearsightedness is entirely hereditary, and there is currently no treatment method found. However, if pseudo-nearsightedness and refractive nearsightedness are implemented according to the following methods, they can definitely be completely cured, and at the same time, it can also prevent ordinary eyes that are not yet nearsighted.

(1) Strengthen the body to prevent nearsightedness.

(2) Do not overwork the eyes.

(3) Maintain a proper posture when reading. For example, lying down to read or reading in bed should be prohibited. When reading, face the table properly, and the distance between the eyes and the table must be more than 30 cm.

(4) Pay attention to proper absorption of light.

(5) Choose printed materials.

The last point is a complete nearsightedness treatment method that someone once said: don't wear accurate glasses, that is, it is better for nearsighted people not to wear glasses, and it will definitely not increase the degree. Practical theory tells us that it is best not to wear glasses as much as possible, and when reading or doing other detailed work, you must take off your glasses. At the same time, always try to look into the distance. This will fully prevent nearsightedness and benefit the treatment of nearsightedness. In the near future, I hope that there will be no nearsightedness other than heredity in Japan, and we will all become "Japanese people who do not wear glasses." (Source: Tokyo Mainichi Shimbun)

### Thai Army Deputy Chief of Staff Returns Home; Expresses Impressions of His Visit to Shonan, Praising the Excellent Performance of Japanese Technology

Bangkok, 12th – Central News Agency: Major General Chote Khadikasadri, the Thai Army Deputy Chief of Staff, previously traveled to Java and Sumatra as part of the Thai-Chinese-Japanese military attaché inspection team stationed in Japan. After a two-week visit, he returned here on the 8th. He specially published his impressions of the trip yesterday, the 11th, as follows: When we were in Shonan, the local military authorities provided detailed explanations of the general situation in the occupied territories in the south, and we were able to thoroughly understand everything. When inspecting the battlefields of Bukit Mas in Borneo and other places, the intensity of the battles at that time and the bravery of the Japanese army were presented before our eyes. We also inspected the Seletar Naval Base in Shonan and the city of Shonan in detail. The speed of its recovery after only a year and a half after the war is truly unexpected. I personally visited Shonan, Sumatra, and Java before the war, but the current situation in Shonan seems even more prosperous than before the war. I feel that the area has become the center of the Japanese-occupied territories. Furthermore, the harbor facilities in Medan, etc., have been repaired perfectly. Here, I heard locals explain the valiant battles of the Japanese parachute troops in the past. In addition, oil refineries, etc., have been completely restored and are even better than before the war, which makes us admire the excellent performance of Japanese technology. The indigenous people of Java have deep confidence in the Japanese army, so the area has become a bright area. Fourteen years ago, I visited Japan as a member of a Japanese military inspection team and was able to observe army exercises and various naval ports. At that time, I already deeply felt the extraordinary bravery of the Japanese army. After this inspection, I learned that the Japanese army is not only brave in battle, but also extraordinary in construction. Therefore, I feel that the spirit of the Japanese army and the Japanese people is great. In addition, the residents of the various occupied areas have also broken away from the influence of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Netherlands that they were subjected to before the war, and are engaged in cultivating the common virtues of the people of Greater East Asia. Furthermore, thanks to the proper guidance of the Japanese military authorities, they are actively engaged in construction work.

### Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement: Signing Ceremony Held

Bangkok, 12th – Central News Agency: The signing ceremony of the Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement was held today at the Central Post Office here. Representatives from the Japanese side included the Consul-General and Secretary Yokota of the Embassy, ​​and many officials from the Communications Bureau of the Thai Ministry of Transport. After the signing ceremony, Japan and Thailand issued a joint statement as follows: In order to improve communications between Japan and Thailand, the Japanese government previously negotiated with the Thai government regarding the commencement of simplified sentence telegrams and Roman alphabet telegrams between Thailand and Japan, China, and Manchuria, as well as the commencement of Japanese telegrams between Thailand and the Japanese-occupied territories in the south. Recently, both sides have reached a consensus, so a communications agreement was signed, and on the 12th of this month, it was officially signed in Bangkok by the Head of the Overseas Affairs Section of the Japanese Ministry of Communications and the Deputy Director of the Communications Bureau of the Thai Ministry of Transport.

Bangkok, 13th – Central News Agency: The Japan-Thailand Communications Agreement was signed here today, and after active preparation, it will be implemented soon. Bangkok has only handled Roman alphabet telegrams with Japan, China, and Manchuria. Now that this agreement has been established, Japanese telegrams can also be handled. In addition, communications between Bangkok and the Japanese-occupied areas in the south have been cut off since the start of the war, and will now be restored. This is the first time that a foreign communications bureau will handle Japanese telegrams. After the establishment of this agreement, the relationship between Japan and Thailand will become closer, and the ties of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be further strengthened. Therefore, it has great significance in the political, economic, and cultural fields.

### Instructions from Philippine Patriot: The Path to Philippine Independence

Manila, 12th – Central News Agency: General Aguinaldo, a Philippine revolutionary patriot, delivered a speech at the veterans' association meeting on the 12th, pointing out the path that the people of the Philippines should take to complete their independence and build a new Philippines.

Therefore, the independence that we have awaited for a long time will soon be realized. My beloved comrades, today our motherland, thanks to the sympathy and cooperation of Japan, is about to become independent. I believe that the martyrs can also rest in peace. We Asians, who were under the shackles of the United States, are now liberated by the power of Japan, which is the will of Heaven. The purpose of Japan's war is to drive out the British, American, and Dutch forces that dominate East Asia and build an East Asia of co-existence and co-prosperity. Therefore, all of us East Asians deeply agree with this supreme goal of Japan. Therefore, you should immediately rise up together with Japan. Know that today, the old history has ended, and a new history of victory is unfolding. The 18 million people of my Philippines should unite and share the joy of independence and co-prosperity with Japan, an advanced country in East Asia."

### Burmese and Philippine Dispatch Study Groups to Japan to Observe Local Political Conditions; Both Scheduled to Stay in Japan for Two Weeks

Tokyo, 12th – Central News Agency: A Burmese study group arrived in Tokyo at 9:00 AM on the 12th. The Philippine Military Administration has also decided to dispatch a study group to Japan.

### Turkish Republican People's Party Reaffirms Neutral Policy

Istanbul, 12th – Central News Agency: According to Havas, the Turkish Republican People's Party is holding its sixth congress in Istanbul. Yesterday, it passed several resolutions, reaffirming that Turkey will abide by the neutral policy pursued by the government. According to the principles of Turkish foreign policy formulated by the Turkish Republican People's Party at its congress in 1931, "The purpose of Turkish policy is to maintain the peace of the country at home and abroad." This congress added a supplementary article, stating, "Turkey must resort to arms only when defending the security and honor of the country." Its meaning clearly reaffirms the defensive nature of Turkish foreign policy. Political figures in Istanbul also attach great importance to the party's neutral resolution. This proves that the party supports the neutral policy strictly adhered to by the Turkish government.

### Australian Foreign Minister Deeply Feels Operational Difficulties

Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to a Reuters report, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt solemnly pointed out the difficulties in the Pacific region during a radio address to the United States yesterday, stating that the Japanese army, the opponent of the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific, is truly an army that does not fear death. The terrain there is dangerous and the climate is harsh, so the losses of the anti-Axis forces are extremely heavy. For example, the number of soldiers who die from tropical diseases exceeds the number who die in combat by four or five times. Therefore, in total, the number of war-related deaths in New Guinea alone exceeds the number of casualties on the Tunisian front. Furthermore, Australia's manpower mobilization has reached its maximum limit. 68% of men and women aged 14 to 65 have been conscripted or are engaged in war production and other matters directly related to the war.

### Poor Quality and Low Speed of British Ships Built Hastily

Lisbon, 12th – Central News Agency: According to Havas, the well-known American financial daily, "The Wall Street Journal," stated that by the end of next year, the total amount of merchant ships in the world owned by the United States will account for 75%, but it admits that the bulk of the new American merchant fleet is made up of hurriedly built and slow-speed Liberty ships. These types of ships cannot be classified as first-class ships. It is also reported that the American shipbuilding tycoon Kaiser may sign a contract with Norwegian shipping companies to supply them with a certain number of Liberty ships. It is said that several oil tankers currently being built in the United States will be handed over to the Norwegian government-in-exile to compensate for the losses of various Norwegian ships serving the anti-Axis forces.

### Chilean Foreign Minister to Visit Washington at US Invitation

Buenos Aires, 12th – Central News Agency: According to news from Santiago, Chilean Foreign Minister Fernandez will not represent President Rios in his visit to the United States, but will travel to Washington at the special invitation of US Secretary of State Hull. The expected departure date will be at the end of June or in mid-July.

### The Path of Sino-Japanese Economic Cooperation (4)

Accelerate the Completion of the Wartime System to Live Up to the Ardent Expectations of Friendly Nations by Chen Weilian

China is now entering a great era. Since the late Qing Dynasty and the early Republic of China, Mr. Sun Wen and many revolutionary martyrs shed much precious blood and went through numerous fierce struggles in order to: overthrow imperialism, abolish extraterritoriality, and recover concessions. Now, because our friendly nation Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, standing on a sincere position of loving East Asia, it resolutely implements a new policy toward China. Thus, these great undertakings are being completed one by one. The new policy toward China can be said to be a further expression of the Konoe Principles, and it is also the inevitable development of the Greater East Asia War. This is indeed a major event that marks a new stage in Sino-Japanese relations. The external problem of the Chinese revolution, that is, the desire for nationalism, has now been fundamentally achieved. We Chinese compatriots should humbly and openly accept it with the utmost sincerity. And in this way, the path of China in response to the new Sino-Japanese relations will naturally unfold.

China's long-cherished national independence and national liberation have now been achieved. The task from now on is naturally a domestic problem. There are still many external problems to be dealt with in the future, but once the domestic system is strong, everything will be solved easily.

So what is the central task of domestic problems now? Needless to say, it lies in the integrity of the domestic wartime system. This has three purposes:

(1) Mobilize national capital in the private sector.

(2) Suppress the mobility of speculative manipulation.

(3) Increase agricultural productivity.

Now, the first thing that surprises all the friendly people who come to China is the soaring prices. It is not known how many times higher than before the China Incident. Compared with last year, many things have also increased fivefold, which proves the fact that prices are soaring and materials are insufficient? If we continue to take the wrong approach to dealing with the current situation, the people will suffer even more unspeakable hardships, and as a result, they may become dissatisfied with the new government and even doubt the true intentions of Japan's policy toward China. Not only that, but I am afraid that high prices, insufficient materials, and insufficient food will make it even more difficult to obtain labor. China's nascent industry is far from being mechanized and mostly relies on human labor. If it is difficult to obtain labor, it will inevitably affect the increase in production. How can we talk about creating a highly industrialized country? Indirectly, it also affects the increase in exports to Japan and the construction of new industries. If we want to solve this threat and difficulty, then we can only solve the above three problems first. There is really no other way to follow besides this.

The emergency measures are to strengthen the control of the circulating parts, quickly expand the rationing system, which is the most effective way to suppress and stabilize prices, fundamentally seek to increase industrial and agricultural production, and rationalize the reorganization of the circulation mechanism. Why do we do this? China is a country with backward industry, as everyone knows. Agriculture occupies the center of the economy. Although agriculture can be said to be the bulk of China's economy, its scale is not very large, and it is still stuck in a primitive agricultural state. Although China is an agricultural country, it cannot be self-sufficient in food. Therefore, after trade with third countries is cut off, coupled with the limited materials from Japan and Manchuria, there is a sudden shortage of materials today. Generally speaking, there is a phenomenon of currency inflation, which directly causes a food crisis. Among them, because the customs of commercialism are deeply rooted, the anarchic state of the circulating parts prevents them from reflecting, making it difficult to control, and becoming an excellent opportunity for speculation and recklessness, which stimulates prices to soar.

So what is the key to solving the problem? This is to reform the industrial, agricultural, and circulating parties. Although speculative manipulation of the circulating parts is obviously suppressed at present, it is not easy to improve the agricultural problem, which is alienated from politics. To increase agricultural productivity, technical improvements are needed. At the same time, we must stabilize the lives of farmers and give them economic surplus to improve their technology. While stabilizing the lives of farmers, we must guide and encourage farmers' side businesses. At the same time, the fundamental problem is to reduce the rent rate for farmers and adjust Langli debt. The high rent and high interest rates in Chinese rural areas are well-known facts. Many scholars and experts have said that this is an important factor hindering agricultural development. However, if you want to implement the adjustment of rent and interest or rationalize it, it will conflict with the landlords who support the Chinese countryside and the usury class, and you will immediately encounter their opposition. Whether the new government can eliminate this resistance and eradicate the root of the disaster can determine whether the problem can be reformed. Politics must be popularized, and it must be the politics of the farmers, workers, and petty citizens, and cannot become the politics of compradors, wealthy businessmen, warlords, and treacherous merchants.

I believe that society should be harmonized before trying to develop, so that it will last for a long time. The social development caused by arousing class struggle and promoting class struggle will not last long. The struggle between classes is really an exposure of social ills and cannot be regarded as having any progressive significance in itself. Therefore, the problem between landlords and tenants, and between usurers and debtors, the state can adjust the interests of both parties, and I believe that it will definitely contribute to the rational development of society. If the two sides are aroused to confront each other and use struggle to solve the problem, it will definitely not lead to social development.

Today's Chinese politics still has many urgent and major problems that have not been resolved. We must strive for the survival of the Chinese nation and be able to truly show vigorous political life. The Chinese nation has the spirit of striving for survival today. Looking at the great Chinese revolution from the late Qing Dynasty to the Northern Expedition period, it proves that the Chinese nation is determined to strive for survival. The essence of this incident has become clear. Realizing its own misunderstanding, it is now transforming itself and actively participating in the peace camp with a brand-new attitude. The China Incident has caused major political, economic, and ideological reforms on the Japanese side, and has also eliminated the anti-Japanese national consciousness on the Chinese side like at the beginning of the incident.

I deeply hope that the Chairman and the ruling officials will embrace this awareness, recognize the proper posture of China today, and quickly move forward bravely on a new path. At the same time, I believe that our friendly nation Japan and all the East Asian nations that are currently on the road to liberation will also sympathize and spare no effort to support us.

### White-Blade Battle Unfolds in Miwoke; German Troops Break Through Soviet Positions; Fierce Air Combat for Air Supremacy; This Move Is Considered the Prelude to the German Summer Offensive

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – In order to ensure the important town of Krasnodar in the northwest of the Caucasus, the Soviet army launched a large-scale offensive again on the 11th in the Matveyev Kurgan area in the middle reaches of the Miwos River. The two armies launched a heroic white-blade battle in front of the German positions. After a fierce counterattack by the German army, the Soviet army was soon severely damaged and retreated. The German army took advantage of the victory to pursue, and it seemed that it had broken through the main Soviet positions. The Soviet Intelligence Bureau also admitted this in a public statement issued on the night of the 11th, saying that the German army dispatched hundreds of tanks and a large number of aircraft on the 11th to attack the Soviet positions and once broke through them. At the same time, the air combat between the German and Soviet armies for air supremacy is still extremely fierce. The Soviet Union and the United Kingdom and the United States all believe that this is the prelude to the German army's summer decisive battle, so they feel quite uneasy. A Reuters correspondent in Moscow said on the 11th that the Soviet air force had missed a good opportunity. At present, the focus of the Eastern Front war is still on air raids as the strategic center. It is expected that air combat will become more intense in the near future. The German air force has bombed the three major industrial areas of Gorky, Volkhov, and Yaroslavl in the Soviet Union for the past eight days, while the Soviet night bomber squadrons are now changing their tactics and focusing on bombing German airfields. Lieutenant General Dietrich Riel, a German military commentator, also said in a broadcast in Berlin on the night of the 11th that the German army's summer offensive is imminent. The deployment of the German army on the Eastern Front currently has a good foothold for preparing to launch an offensive operation, which actually implies the direction of the current war situation.

### Italian Side Announces Pantelleria Battle Situation; Heroic Resistance of the Garrison Becomes a Popular Topic

Central News Agency, Berlin, 12th – According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, the British side has reported that it has occupied Pantelleria. German military officials did not comment on this last night, saying that they have not yet received news.

Central News Agency, Rome, 12th – Today's Italian wartime communiqué officially confirmed that the Italian garrison on the island of Pantelleria has surrendered to the anti-Axis forces. According to reports, Pantelleria Island has an area of 30 square miles and is located in the strait between the North African coast and Sicily. The communiqué continued that the anti-Axis forces are now concentrating their forces to attack the island of Lampedusa, which is located 80 miles southeast of Pantelleria, between Malta and Tunisia, and said that the Italian garrison on the island has refused the enemy's request to surrender.

Central News Agency, Rome, 12th – Hai Tong News Agency reported that the heroic resistance of the Pantelleria garrison has become the main topic of discussion here yesterday. Regarding the news that the island has already fallen, it has not been confirmed here as of Friday night. Officials announced that they are not aware of the island's fall. Therefore, people in Rome believe that the island's garrison, under the leadership of the heroic Commander Cadilai, is still continuing its manly resistance. The German air force's organ newspaper in the Mediterranean published the situation of the garrison's heroic resistance on Saturday, also pointing out that the island has been subjected to twelve daytime air raids every day for the past few days. Italian daily newspapers estimated that on Thursday, 1,000 anti-Axis aircraft attacked the island. Anti-Axis bombers attacked in batches, attacking 27 times within 11 hours. Before the large-scale attack with 1,000 bombers on Thursday, there was another attack with 500 bombers. Military observers in Rome are now closely watching the situation on the island of Lampedusa, whose defenses are not as strong as Pantelleria and are easier to attack. Italian daily newspapers pointed out that the island has an area of only 200,000 kilometers, and the garrison on the island recently eliminated five elite companies of anti-Axis forces who attempted to land.

### The Stalemate Between De Gaulle and Giraud Remains Unresolved

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 12th – The stalemate in the French National Liberation Committee meeting remained unresolved as of yesterday, but a Reuters correspondent stationed in Algiers said that the recent crisis in the French rebel camp has improved by the afternoon after informal talks yesterday morning. The reporter said that it has been confirmed that De Gaulle has offered to resign from the post of co-chairman of the committee, but his colleagues have unanimously retained him. There were two informal meetings yesterday morning, one held by Giraud and other committee members except De Gaulle, and the other held by De Gaulle, Giraud, Catroux, and Philip. However, the meeting date of the committee has not been set, and it does not seem likely to be held during the weekend, but in the next two or three days, the two sides will exchange ways to resolve the stalemate. Jadru and the non-military members of the committee are now drafting a method, and the solution may be to make Giraud the commander of the French rebel army, while making De Gaulle responsible for reorganizing the army, which is what De Gaulle insists on. De Gaulle believes that he was obstructed by this person before the war, and he is also being obstructed by this person now. According to Hai Tong News Agency, De Gaulle's threat to resign can only be interpreted as an attempt to put pressure on Giraud and the committee. The news from Tangul of the agency said that De Gaulle has no intention of giving up his influential position in North Africa. De Gaulle believes that he has some comments on military issues and has always been known as an expert in motorized warfare, so he hopes to implement his proposal to reorganize the North African rebel army. Therefore, the committee's request that Giraud and De Gaulle separately put forward their proposals is actually a trap for Giraud. Newspapers in Algiers have been instructed by the authorities not to mention a word about the new dispute between Giraud and De Gaulle.

### The Anti-Axis Attempt to Attack Europe Is Bound to Face Difficulties; Not Only Is There a Danger of Losing Troops, but Also Transport Ships Are Not Sufficient

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – Since the recent meeting between Roosevelt and Churchill in Washington, the propaganda organs of the United Kingdom and the United States have been spreading rumors that the anti-Axis forces will attack Europe, but due to many objective difficulties, it is questionable whether it can be realized. A correspondent of the Swedish Daily News stationed in Berlin detailed that the anti-Axis forces cannot attack the European continent. If they forcibly launch a landing operation in Western Europe, they will inevitably lose millions of troops and gain more than they lose. The correspondent detailed that when the anti-Axis forces carry out landing operations, they will use 50,000 people as a group, escorted by a large number of destroyers, and sail to the destination by transport ships. At that time, they must first bombard the coastal area with battle cruisers and cruisers, and must dispatch air force to bomb the German defense line to cover the landing troops. Then, they will divide into teams of 120 people and carry out landing operations by steel landing craft, and then transport small tanks to the land. But at this time, the German side will immediately dispatch submarines to attack the anti-Axis fleet and transport fleet. Therefore, at least half of the landing troops will be buried in the seabed. At the same time, the German air force will also participate in the battle, and the German ground forces will also shoot at the landing troops with institutions and mortars. Therefore, the damage suffered by the anti-Axis forces will inevitably increase. Assuming that the anti-Axis forces successfully land after suffering heavy losses and secure a foothold, then the 50,000 people distributed on the front line of 100 kilometers to 150 kilometers can only remain 12,300 people at most. According to German military predictions, the anti-Axis forces can be regarded as the greatest success if 23% of their total force can land across the Dover Strait, and the troops that continue to land will still lose half of them. Assuming that this landing force can gradually advance inland for 8 kilometers to 10 kilometers, it still cannot look down on the German fortress line, but the German army will launch a fierce counterattack on the third day of its landing. At that time, the anti-Axis forces will also gradually transport military supplies and strive to resist, and launch a fierce offensive and defensive war. According to German estimates, assuming that among the 150,000 anti-Axis landing troops, 55,000 people remain after 15,000 people are killed in battle by the sea and after landing, and 30,000 people are injured and missing, then they can only advance about 20 kilometers. Therefore, at that time, only these 55,000 people are not enough to resist the true offensive of the German army. If the damage suffered by the anti-Axis landing operation is as described above, then its landing force in one area is less than 10,000 people, which is definitely not enough to allocate. At least 1.5 million elite troops with excellent equipment are needed, but in this war, 13 tons of ships are required to transport one soldier. Therefore, it is easy to declare the launch of a landing operation, but the ship problem is really difficult. Therefore, it is impossible for the anti-Axis forces to launch a European landing operation in the near future.

Central News Agency, Stockholm, 12th – According to a Hai Tong News Agency report, neutral countries in London believe that the anti-Axis countries will attack Europe within ten days. June 22 is the anniversary of the German-French armistice. The anti-Axis countries will use this day as an auspicious day to attack Europe. Although officials said that the attack on Europe cannot be focused on a special day, the British press and semi-official sources openly announced that the anti-Axis countries will attack Europe within this month.

### French Cabinet Meeting

Central News Agency, Vichy, 12th – The French government convened a cabinet meeting on the 11th under the chairmanship of President Pétain, and Chief Lidel reported on the general political situation in the country and the situation of French workers in Germany.

### On the Eve of the German-Soviet Decisive Battle: A Complete Picture of Soviet Combat Power (1)

1. The German-Soviet winter offensive and defensive war, which lasted for four months and was fiercely launched under many adverse conditions, gradually subsided with the arrival of spring. Now, except for sporadic local battles in various parts of the front line, there are few battles worth recording.

No one can deny that the nature of the German-Soviet war completely shows a long-term attrition war after this winter operation. Last summer, the part of the Anglo-American anti-Axis camp, which was greatly embarrassed by the German army's amazing offensive, predicted that the Red Army's independent resistance would collapse across the board in view of the Red Army's successive defeats. The pessimistic view that the Red Army could not exert the combat power shown in the first winter offensive in this winter war gradually rose. Representatives who hold this view, such as the famous New York Times military reporter Hanson Baldwin, and even the pro-Soviet military expert Max Werner, seem to be somewhat inclined to this view.

Therefore, the combat power shown by the Red Army in this winter war is, in their opinion, "unexpected." But if we grasp the war situation in last summer's operation as a whole, rather than treating it as an individual phenomenon, it is not necessarily an accident.

The German-Soviet war is, needless to say, a turbulent and indecisive war. The German army takes the summer offensive, and the Red Army answers with the winter counteroffensive. Until today, it has been repeating as accurately as a clock. But it will still be repeated in the future. Therefore, the operational plans of the German and Soviet armies are also drawn up according to this line.

The current stage of the German-Soviet war is equivalent to the transition period from the "winter camp" to the "summer camp." The German and Soviet armies have also consumed considerable combat power in the winter war. Therefore, it still takes considerable time to replenish troops, rectify the supply lines, accumulate weapons, and other tasks. Therefore, the start of the German army's summer offensive will not be earlier than last year. The period when the German army starts its summer offensive is also a powerful material for evaluating the German army's combat power.

In addition to the Eastern Front, the German army also has the Tunisian Front, but the latter's front line is now in a major transition period and seems to have passed. Therefore, it is wrong to only comment on the combat power of the German and Soviet armies based on the Eastern Front. We are here to examine the Soviet Union's resistance force corresponding to the future summer war, and believe that the data for judging the war situation in the summer war may not be unnecessary.

When evaluating the Soviet Union's resistance force, it goes without saying that we should start from the viewpoint of the long-term attrition war, which is the basic character of the German-Soviet war. Generally speaking, when evaluating the combat power of a country, it seems that many people take the amount of human and material resources, the strength of the wartime economic and political system, the problem of transportation capacity, and the morale of the front and rear as objects. The author himself cannot be an exception and takes this as the basis for examining the Soviet Union's resistance force.

### All Future Civilian Food Supplies Will Be Distributed by the Joint Cooperative; The Method of Distributing Grain According to Population Will Continue; The Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association Handed Over Its Responsibilities

In order to adjust the overall civilian food supply, after implementing unified purchase, centralized distribution, the Ministry of Food, together with the Ministry of Finance, issued food storage coupons, type A 40 million yuan, and type B 10 million yuan, which were undertaken by the Central Reserve Bank to purchase food and build grain storage warehouses. The Rice Grain Purchase and Sales General Management Office was established, and all localities were ordered to establish rice grain joint transportation cooperatives. The rice grain agency has now been transferred. Hereafter, the supply of rice grain will be transferred from the "Central China Rice Grain Distribution Association" to the Rice Grain Joint Cooperative. However, the distribution of grain according to population in the Shanghai urban area will still be entrusted to the Public Works Bureau of the工部局, the Municipal Council, and the Rice Grain Management Bureau to continue. It is heard that the implementation will start on July 1.

The Grain Distribution Method Will Not Be Changed

As for the method of distributing grain according to population, it will not be changed due to its effectiveness since its implementation, and within the possible scope, the amount of household grain in each period will be based on the legitimate needs of the food households. The distribution of rice in Shanghai was originally the military rice and the Ministry of Food's rice grain process, and the affairs of importing southern rice were all handled by the Rice Grain Distribution Association. Hereafter, both foreign rice and local rice will be handled by the Joint Cooperative. The distribution of rice tickets will remain as before. For the Japanese residents, the Rice Grain Distribution Association will exchange foreign rice for local rice from the Joint Cooperative, and then the Association will distribute it.

Most Rice Merchants Applying to Join the Cooperative Are Approved

Since the establishment of the Rice Grain Joint Cooperative on June 1, more than 3,500 rice grain retailers, rice milling merchants, and vendors in the jurisdiction have applied to register to join the cooperative. The cooperative is now urgently reviewing the rice merchants who have applied for registration. The reporter of the Shanghai 社 received accurate news yesterday that more than 2,500 have been approved to join the cooperative, and about 100 are unqualified. It is found that the Joint Cooperative stipulates that retail merchants must have a capital of at least 20,000 yuan to join the cooperative, vendors must have a capital of at least 50,000 yuan, and rice milling merchants must have a capital of at least 20,000 yuan. This means that applicants must have official certification documents from the主管機關, otherwise they will be refused to join the cooperative. The application registration has now been closed, but if there are special circumstances, it can be handled later. Hereafter, those who have not joined the cooperative will not be allowed to operate freely.

Excess Broad Beans to Be Recalled by a Deadline

The 32nd period of household grain also includes a kind of mixed broad beans. Now, in view of the fact that there are still many leftover broad beans for sale in various retail rice stores, it is proposed to recall them, entrust the Xin Shu Fa Rice Mill to crush them, and allocate them to the prison as food for prisoners. The date of delivery of the remaining broad beans by each retail rice store will be recorded as follows: (1) Registration number 1 to 284, this month's 14th; (2) Registration number 285 to 546, this month's 16th; (3) Registration number 548 to 091, this month's 18th. All should be sent to the Xin Wei Fa Rice Mill at 896 Chengdu Road within the deadline.

### The Zhang Jinhai Case Is Rescheduled for Trial on the 15th

Regarding the case of Zhang Jinhai's tragic death due to non-criminal reasons, in addition to the French Patrol Chief Millet and Patrol Officer Beckley, the French Consul's Court has already conducted a legal hearing. A number of Chinese suspects, after being summoned twice by the Second Special District Local Court, the entire case has yet to be identified. The current court hearing was originally scheduled to continue on the morning of the 14th of this month. It is now learned that the day coincides with the Feast of Pentecost, so the police authority and the捕房 are closed for holidays as usual. Therefore, it is specially rescheduled to the morning of the 15th at 9 o'clock for a joint trial.

(1) Five baskets or four dishes and five 菜 (Chinese food)

(2) One soup, one dish, one snack (Western food)

(3) The 侍滥傾啤湣, soda, regardless of whether the guests need it or not, desperately selling, the host does not stop it, and the guests do not pay attention. This is a waste of materials and money, and selling arrogance is not in line with economic principles and should be corrected.

### Social Welfare Department Telegram Order: Emergency Relief Association to Unify Donations, Donation Registers, Receipts, etc., Must Be Stamped by the Emergency Relief Association

Regarding the urgent relief matters in North China, Mr. Ding, the Minister of the Social Welfare Department, deeply appreciates the enthusiasm and eagerness of all circles in Shanghai to raise donations, which is highly commendable. However, in order to concentrate efforts and prevent corruption, and to ensure that every penny goes to the public, all donation activities should be unified. Therefore, special regulations have been stipulated, and a telegram has been sent to the North China Emergency Relief Association to handle the matter accordingly. The main points are listed below: (1) Any fundraising activities held by all sectors in the name of North China Emergency Relief, such as plays, performances, broadcasts, and solicitations, must be reported to the North China Emergency Relief Association in advance. (2) All donation registers, receipts, tickets, etc., for fundraising for North China Emergency Relief held by all sectors must be stamped by the Emergency Relief Association. (3) All sectors may refuse to donate to fundraising activities that have not been approved by the Emergency Relief Association or have not been stamped. In order to actively raise a large sum of money, the Emergency Relief Association has also sent a letter to the United Chamber of Commerce and the Municipal Chamber of Commerce to forward the letter to various trade associations to solicit donations.

Performance Achievements

Charity Dance Initiated by the Guoqin Ballroom

It was held starting at 8 p.m. the night before. The Emergency Relief Association specially sent Chen to assist in monitoring, and the income reached more than 50,000 yuan. In addition, the Dance Industry Association held a meeting last night to discuss and decided that all dance halls would hold a charity dance for one day, and all income, after deducting expenses, would be used for relief funds.

The Henan Fellowship Association's broadcast of famous actors and opera amateurs was on its second day yesterday, and the results were even better. The current collection of Central Reserve Bank notes is 8,633 yuan, and the amount pledged but not yet collected is 74,271 yuan.

In addition, the Lihua Grand Theater held a daytime performance of "The Canary" by the China Travel Theater Troupe on June 3. The ticket sales for that performance totaled 54,650 yuan. The funds were immediately sent to the Shandong Fellowship Association and the Hebei Fellowship Association to be forwarded to the North China Emergency Relief Association. (The list will be published by the Emergency Relief Association for unification)

Charity Sale of Treasures

This newspaper received a second letter from the owner of Shimo House, Chen

Boheng yesterday, stating: "Due to the drought in North China, I have taken out the original copy of the Kaihuang Lanting, to be sold for charity to help with the relief efforts. Originally, I planned to recover the cost of 20,000 yuan to temporarily maintain my personal life, as I am also a refugee. After reading your newspaper yesterday, I learned that the number of relief funds collected is limited, which is not enough to help. Therefore, I decided to donate the entire proceeds of 50,000 yuan from the charity sale of Lanting to relief efforts, and I will no longer recover the cost, so that the funds obtained will be slightly more and can be of some help to disaster relief."

Donations from Banquets and Receptions, Also Received Letters from Kong Cixuan, Chen Mingshao,

Liu Zigang, stating: "We came to Shanghai from Tianjin this time, and we are deeply grateful for the generous gifts from our friends. We should have returned the favor with banquets, but seeing the severity of the disaster in North China and the urgent need for relief, we plan to hand over 15,000 yuan, which was originally intended for banquets and receptions, to the Hebei Fellowship Association for collection. After deducting 3,000 yuan to subsidize the Fellowship Association's broadcasting and advertising expenses, the remaining funds will be used to help refugees in the disaster area, which will also benefit our friends."

### Soliciting Donations to Repair Huang's Tomb Preface

The left text is a short travelogue written by Mr. Wu Hufan after visiting Huang's tomb. After reading it, we also admire the relics of the sages, and agree with Mr. Wu's meaning regarding the desolation of the tomb and the urgent need for repairs and renovation, and hope that those with literary talent at home and abroad can help achieve this. Therefore, the left text is disclosed, and Mr. Chen Binghe, the president of this newspaper, personally raises 1,000 yuan to advocate for it. According to a rough estimate, the repair of Huang's tomb requires 10,000 yuan. If we can get ten people with literary talent, each contributing 1,000 yuan, we can collect enough funds to complete the task. If you agree, please let us know the amount you are willing to donate and send a letter to the social service department of this newspaper so that we can handle it. Thank you very much.

### Record of Visiting the Tomb of Huang Zijiu in Yushan

— Wu Jianfan

The tomb of Huang Dachi, a Yuan Dynasty recluse, is located at the western foot of Yushan Mountain in Changshu. Ascending along the Shantang from the West Gate to Bao'an Temple, one takes the path through the main Xiaoshidong (Small Stone Cave). The mountain path is approximately two li long. Beside the path stands a stone tablet inscribed with the words: "Path to the Tomb of Huang Dachi, a Yuan Dynasty Recluse." A portion of the tablet's base is buried in the soil. The characters for "Tomb Path" are not easily discernible without close inspection. The narrow sheep path winds deeply for several hundred steps. The undulating mountainside reveals the tomb of the old recluse. Apart from a mound of earth, the site is desolate and silent, devoid of any trees. Behind the tomb stands another stele, reading: "Tomb of Huang Yifeng, a Yuan Dynasty Recluse" (the characters for "Recluse" are inscribed together). The tomb marker is not erected in front of the tomb but behind it, likely due to local customs. Arriving here, paying respects to the relics and honoring the virtuous predecessors, one cannot help but feel a mixture of reverence and sighing. Huang Dachi was a surviving subject of the late Song Dynasty and the founder of the Southern School of painting. His legacy is passed down through a few works, including the "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" scroll. (The "Dwelling in the Fuchun Mountains" scroll is preserved in the National Palace Museum; the first section of the burnt remains, known as the "Remaining Mountain Scroll," is now housed in Yu Mei Jing's study.) Yet, his tomb is so desolate. Repairing and restoring it should not be delayed. It awaits the support of like-minded individuals from across the country. Future visitors can proceed from the Half-Weng Prime Minister's Shrine of White Pigeon Mountain, which is less than a li away. On this day, my companions were Chen Xiaodie, Chen Ziqing, and my students Lu Yifei and Pan Zhiyun (both gentlemen are from Changshu). We also learned that the descendants of Huang Dachi currently reside in Dayiqiao, ten li from the city. The late Duke Kezhai wrote a "Record of the Huang Family's Charity Estate in Dayiqiao" for Mr. Huang Qiutao in the seventeenth year of the Guangxu reign (1891). June, the thirty-second year of the Republic (1943).

Today, our office and the central propaganda organs in Shanghai, together with the local press, are jointly hosting a farewell reception for Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki. Those of us engaged in propaganda work have cooperated with our friendly nation, Japan, in this area for the past two or three years and feel very pleased about it. However, both our friendly nation, Japan, and China are striving to defeat the Anglo-Americans in the Greater East Asia War, which makes our work very busy. We are constantly on the move for the sake of East Asia, and opportunities for meetings are few. Especially this year, when we bid farewell to propaganda officials from our friendly nation, Japan, we cannot help but feel a sense of parting and regret. Furthermore, all propaganda officials who have come to China from our friendly nation, Japan, have returned successfully. We have worked with Minister Iwasaki for a long time, and it is inevitable that we feel reluctant to part with him today. However, the minister has been responsible for his duties in China for a long time, having served in Hankou, Nanjing, and Shanghai for the past two years. Because of the minister's careful assistance to China, all of our Chinese compatriots are happy to work with him. Just before taking his seat, the minister told me that many of his Chinese friends whom he has met over the past two years do not want him to leave China, and he is also reluctant to leave. From these words, we can deeply understand the minister's hard work and dedication in China. Today, as we bid farewell to the minister, there are many host organizations, which is a testament to the minister's success. We can not only congratulate him on his success but also say that he has achieved great success. On the occasion of this farewell, I represent everyone in raising a glass to wish the minister a bright future." Immediately, the entire assembly raised their glasses.

Iwasaki's Reply

Subsequently, Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki delivered a speech in reply, stating briefly: "Today, I am deeply grateful for the grand farewell reception organized by the propaganda organs and the press and cultural circles of this city. For the past two and a half years that I have served as the chief of the reporting department in China, I have received your special assistance and felt your goodwill and warmth deeply. During my time in China, I served as the Nanjing Reporting Department Chief and the Shanghai Army Reporting Department Chief, and the time spent traveling back and forth was quite short, which meant fewer opportunities to meet with everyone, for which I am deeply regretful. Although I have worked in various locations, my goals have been completely consistent: to strive towards the completion of the Greater East Asia War. I deeply agree with what Director Feng said earlier. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, especially those in charge of reporting in Shanghai, have worked diligently and provided me with invaluable assistance. Everyone is working towards the Greater East Asia War, which is an extremely important task. As I take up my new post, I hope that everyone will continue to maintain close communication and assistance at all times in order to achieve victory in the Greater East Asia War. We have firm confidence in this war and will not rest until we achieve complete victory. I am deeply aware that everyone is devoting great effort to the construction of the New China, and the future of the New China is limitless." Finally, Reporting Department Chief Iwasaki raised his glass to wish everyone present farewell. The atmosphere was joyful, with toasts exchanged and the guests and hosts interacting warmly.

Economic Commentary

### Utilizing Idle Capital to Establish Factories

The proper outlet for idle capital lies in engaging in production. Currently, the most beneficial productive enterprises for national and people's welfare are undoubtedly those in industry. In this era of worldwide war, the daily necessities of the people cannot rely on imports; they must be manufactured domestically. With China's abundant resources and raw materials, if we have excellent equipment and specialized technical talent, everything needed for clothing, food, housing, and transportation can be self-sufficient. For individuals, profits are safest, and for the nation and society, the contribution is greatest. Both publicly and privately, there are great benefits. Those with idle capital, if they use it to establish factories and commence production, will not only build a foundation that lasts for centuries but also find it safer and more secure than anything else. At the same time, entrepreneurs establishing enterprises and companies is essential at present. However, the most promising and socially valued business ventures are undoubtedly those of establishing factories. Compared to hoarding goods or selling real estate, the difference between benefiting oneself and others is obvious even to the unintelligent. However, the financial sector is the backbone of industry. The funding of industrial enterprises depends entirely on banks and money houses. In the future, financiers should consider investing in and lending to industrial enterprises as the safest and most secure path, providing full support and care so that industrialists can focus on improving technology and refining their products without being distracted by financial planning and running around incessantly. This is the responsibility of financiers.

### Ministry of Finance Decides to Adjust Four Banks, Government Shares to be Taken Over by the Central Reserve Bank

In order to strengthen financial institutions, the Ministry of Finance has decided to adjust the China General Chamber of Commerce, Ningpo Commercial Bank, China Industrial, and Guohuo banks, which are jointly operated by government and private entities. A reporter from the Shanghai News Agency visited Secretary-General Lin of the Banking Association yesterday and learned that the government has already decided on the principles for adjusting the structure of these four banks and will soon announce the order. The government shares of these four banks will henceforth be taken over by the Central Reserve Bank (CRB). The chairman will be appointed by the Ministry of Finance, and government directors and supervisors will be designated by the government, while commercial directors and supervisors will be elected by the shareholders of the commercial shares. In the future, they will operate under the leadership of the CRB, with the aim of developing the national agricultural, industrial, and commercial sectors. The government has not issued any measures regarding the reorganization of small banks. However, in order to strengthen their organizations, all small banks have voluntarily increased their capital.

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee Sets Deadline for Wheat Procurement

Since its official establishment, the National Chamber of Commerce's Flour and Wheat Special Committee has been actively implementing an overall plan for wheat procurement, allocation, distribution, marketing prices, etc. In order to strengthen the procurement and manufacturing work of wheat in key producing areas of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui provinces, and the two special municipalities of Beijing and Shanghai, branch offices have been established in nine districts, including Shanghai, Suzhou, Wuxi, Changzhou, Zhenjiang, Nanjing, Wuhu, Taixian, and Bengbu. It has been learned that the committee, with the new wheat expected to enter the market around the 20th of this month, is urging the local offices to establish themselves by the 15th of this month to begin wheat procurement. It is reported that the chairman of the committee, Sun Zhongli, recently convened a discussion meeting with the directors of the local branch offices. In addition to instructing them to actively handle (1) the registration procedures for flour manufacturers, wheat commission merchants, vendors, and wheat firms in each district, (2) the detailed reporting of the local wheat production and sales situation in writing within a specified period, and (3) liaison with local government authorities and detailed explanation of the committee's mission to request their assistance, he especially clarified the committee's tasks and relationships. The list of directors and deputy directors of the local offices is recorded below. The Shanghai office is headed by Cao, the chief of the flour and bran section, concurrently, with Lin Ersan as deputy director. The directors and deputy directors of other cities are: Suzhou: Song Senqian, Koya; Wuxi: Yang Leshan, Koizumi Naoshiji; Changzhou: Yuan Zhiming, Kouchi Non; Zhenjiang: Yan Zhonghe, Maruoka Saburo (interim); Nanjing: Wang Jipu, Kitayama Kakushi; Wuhu: Zhang Boxi, Mochizuki Yoshirō (interim); Taixian: Zhang Fengsheng, Hirose Seitaro; Bengbu: Shi Dechen, Fuji Yoshiichi (interim).

### President Takashima Discusses the Policy of Developing Central China's Economy

President Takashima Uetsuna and Vice President of the Central China Development Company left Shanghai on the 11th of last month to return to Japan to discuss adjustments to the company's various subsidiaries and other matters, and returned to Shanghai by plane yesterday (11th). According to reports, they had repeated discussions with Minister of Greater East Asia Aoki, Ambassador Tani, and other relevant parties regarding various economic issues in Central China. What is most necessary in Central China at present is economic recovery. The Development Company and its subsidiaries should promote their businesses based on this policy in the future. However, in order to adapt to Japan's new policy toward China, they should strive to revitalize the Chinese economy through China. The reorganization of the various companies will also be resolved sequentially in accordance with this policy, taking into account the actual situation. It goes without saying that the Development Company, together with its subsidiaries, will make extra efforts to promote the increased production of important wartime materials. If necessary, they will also invest or lend to general Sino-Japanese joint ventures to promote the development of Central China's economy. In addition, Presidents Takashima and Uetsuna are scheduled to go to Nanjing on the 14th to hold discussions with the National Government and Japanese authorities on the reorganization issue, and then return to Shanghai around the 20th, and then contact the various companies to finalize the details before returning to Japan again on the 25th in order to participate in the Development Company's shareholders' meeting held in Tokyo on the 29th.

### Materials Investigation Committee to be Established on the 19th

In order to thoroughly investigate the hoarding and speculation of major commodities by Chinese and foreign merchants in Shanghai, suppress prices, and stabilize people's livelihoods, the Materials Investigation Committee established in Shanghai with the approval of the Supreme National Defense Council has selected sixteen Chinese and Japanese committee members and is actively preparing the organization. It was previously reported that the committee was scheduled to hold its first inaugural meeting on the 14th of this month. It is learned that due to insufficient preparation, the inaugural meeting will be convened on the 19th of this month. The investigation work is currently still underway.

### Vice Minister Zhou Talks About the Food Problem

Nanjing, 12th (Central News Agency) - In order to understand the recent food problem, a reporter from the Central News Agency visited Zhou Naiwen, Vice Minister of the Ministry of Food, to inquire about general policies. Vice Minister Zhou received the reporter and discussed the food problem on the spot. Vice Minister Zhou said: "The food problem in wartime not only concerns the people's livelihood, but also the success or failure of policy implementation can affect national policy, because the food problem is the main sector of the economic industry. Before the war, our country had no so-called control policy. After the war, due to actual needs, the government adopted control policies. After the reorganization of the Grain Commission into the Ministry of Food, it has established a concrete plan for the management and sale of food. Although food prices have not yet been suppressed due to various reasons, fortunately, it has been able to dredge sources and increase production, so food supplies have been maintained. The famine in North China this year requires the transportation of grain for relief, and we are also planning to establish and adjust the lower-level institutions to make procurement and distribution more reasonable." Vice Minister Zhou then explained the capital's food problem raised by the reporter, saying: "The capital's public county affairs are in good shape due to the cooperation between the ministry and the city authorities, and the various investigative agencies are also able to investigate to the best of their ability. As for the public rice price problem, the publicly set price of food rice in the capital is lower than that of other ports, and the original price was maintained. However, recently, the reserves in various producing areas have been exhausted, and prices have skyrocketed. Various expenses have increased, and if adjustments are not made, the source of procurement will inevitably be affected, which will hinder the entire grain policy. Therefore, rice prices were increased to 444 yuan this month, but the procurement cost of this ministry is still more than 100 yuan per shi (unit of volume), which is still the lowest compared with the rice prices in other places."

### Central Reserve Bank's Agricultural Loan to Adopt Commercial Bill Rediscount System

The Central Reserve Bank will implement agricultural loans in the form of commercial bill rediscounts, starting with loans for wheat procurement funds. The allocation of funds for the procurement of cotton and miscellaneous grains will also be carried out using this system. The implementation method is for the procuring merchants to issue bills and apply for discount to designated Chinese-owned banks, which will then submit the bills to the Central Reserve Bank for rediscount.

Wheat Loan Agreed

Regarding wheat procurement loans, due to the approaching wheat market season, the funds required by Chinese buyers must be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank as soon as possible. However, there were concerns about the form of bank loans, so after consultation between the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Central Reserve Bank, it was decided to use the commercial bill rediscount method. The bill discount rate and bill issuer are still to be determined.

Bank of Communications Actively Handles Agricultural Loans

Also, the Bank of Communications was ordered to handle agricultural loans, and added an Agricultural Economics Department to the bank on the 5th of last month. It is now aware that the financial needs of rural areas are extremely urgent, and has sent personnel to Nanjing, Wuhu, Jiaxing, and Dongtai to prepare for the establishment of agricultural economic offices, which are limited to two months for establishment and implementation of lending. At the same time, the bank's Agricultural Economics Department has responded to requests from agricultural institutions and merchants in Wuxi, northern Jiangsu, and near Shanghai, and has granted a total of 12 million yuan in various loans for cotton, cultivation, pig farming, agronomy, agricultural tool manufacturing, and farmland operation.

### Japanese Soap Industry Association Established

The Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry's Central China Soap Industry Association held its inaugural meeting at the Japanese Club on the afternoon of the 11th (previous day) and elected the responsible organizations as follows: (1) Chairman: Japan Oil & Fat; (2) Vice Chairman: Mitsubishi; (3) Accountant: Daimaru Trading; (4) Directors: Mitsui Idemitsu Trading. The association will also convene a general meeting in the near future, and the representatives attending will be determined by the Chamber of Commerce and Industry.

### Stock Market Trends

Yesterday, the Chinese stock market shifted from weakness to stability, and the price of gold and goods hardened, which stabilized the shaky confidence of all parties. However, the initial weakness in the morning was excessive, and although it rebounded later, most stocks still closed lower. Trading on Saturday was slow. Among the pharmaceutical stocks, French Chinese Pharmaceutical was firm, New Asia still stood at the checkpoint, Xinyi Pharmaceutical's Da Guan Zhu Yi persisted, and Wuzhou and Zhongxi rose slightly. In the department store sector, Wing On recovered after weakness, Sincere and China-made remained stable, China Underwear had little trading at the same price, and Jingfu Socks showed a slight improvement. In the textile sector, Wing On Cotton Mill suffered a slight setback, and Mayar Silk Mills closed flat. In the cultural sector, Yichang was depressed, and the selling prices of the Commercial Press, China Bookstore, and World Book Company fell again. In the public utilities sector, the situation of Zhabei Water and Electricity changed little, the transaction price of the Nanyang Brothers Tobacco Company suddenly increased, and the Great China Match was weak.

### Business Summary

Government Bonds: In the gray market for unified government bonds, the prices of A, B, C, D, and E bonds all fell, but the internal bond rose uniquely, and trading was not active.

Gold and Silver: Jewelry gold in silver shops is priced at the limit price, but the handling fee has increased, and the transaction price inside and outside the industry has risen again, close to the limit price. The listed price of sycee silver remained unchanged, and the doing price within and without the industry was hidden at the checkpoint.

Yarn and Cloth: Cotton yarn was quiet due to continuous rain and the weekend, the market was slightly stronger for fine yarn, and there were very few transactions. Cotton cloth was bullish, and there were still floating households buying in, and the supply from all parties was weak, and market prices hovered. Dragon Head Fine Cloth, Four Gentlemen's Serge, Peach Blossom Ladies' Fabric all rose, while White Cat Printed Cloth, Qin Liangyu Bleached Cloth prices did not change.

### Industry Association Activities

Brewing Industry: The city's Brewing Industry Association has been established and started operations. The deadline for member registration has also passed. The association believes that restaurants and pubs in the city that sell alcohol should also join the association to facilitate future distribution for business purposes. However, as these establishments have not yet joined, which is considered illegal, the association has submitted a document to the Food Bureau, based on industrial and commercial organization laws, requesting them to instruct the Restaurant and Pub Industry Association to notify all restaurants and pubs to join promptly. Otherwise, when distribution matters are implemented in the future, they will not be allocated supplies, inevitably preventing them from running related businesses.

Glass Industry: The Economic Bureau has designated individuals to be responsible for the preparatory work of the city's Glass Industry Association. A founding meeting is scheduled to be held at the City Chamber of Commerce at 2:00 PM this afternoon (the 13th) to approve the articles of association and elect directors and supervisors.

Tea Industry: The Food Bureau has designated Huang Jingqi, Xu Rongsen, Li Guozhi, and others as preparatory members for the Shanghai District Tea and Confectionery Industry Association. They have formed a preparatory committee to begin preparations and handle member registration, which will end on the 15th. All tea merchants operating in the Shanghai urban area must join the association.

Coarse and Fine Pigment Industry: After being ordered to merge with the Western Pigment Industry Association to form the Shanghai Special City Pigment Business Association, the city's Coarse and Fine Pigment Industry Miscellaneous Goods Association believed that the nature of the industry differed from that of the Western Pigment Industry, making it difficult to merge. In addition to submitting written requests to the relevant authorities for permission to organize an independent association to prevent disputes and facilitate control, it is now learned that the industry will send representatives to petition.

### Brief News

The Ningbo Road branch of the Ta Kung Bank in this port opened a branch in the French Concession at 26-28 Avenue Edward VII last month.

Examiners have been appointed to conduct the examination solemnly, and the results will be used as a reference for adjusting positions in the future based on merit.

### A General Overview of the Commercial Control Council's Work Entering a New Phase

Since the Commercial Control Council (商統會) was transferred to the Executive Yuan, it was decided to establish all lower-level organizations before June 15th. However, with the scheduled date approaching, it is currently rushing to complete all unfinished matters and promptly establish the unorganized federations. Sixteen types of federations and four types of professional committees have already been established, and the lower-level organizations are generally in place, entering a period of concrete work. The working force will inevitably become more important in the future. The current working situation of the Commercial Control Council is generally as follows:

(1) Established and Unestablished Federations

There are a total of twenty-two federations, including six federations related to the old Ministry of Food system and sixteen federations related to the old Ministry of Industry system. As of June 7th, sixteen have been established, leaving only six. These six federations are scheduled to be established by the 15th of this month. The established federations include: Miscellaneous Grain Industry Federation (hereinafter, the five characters "Industry Federation" will be omitted), Flour Industry, Animal Husbandry Industry, Egg Industry, Sugar Industry, Edible Oil Industry, Soap and Candle Industry, Match Industry, Chemical Industry, Cotton Textile Industry, Coal Industry, Department Store Industry, Silk Industry, Leather Industry, Alcohol Industry, and Tobacco Industry, totaling sixteen industries. The unestablished federations include the Metal Industry, Wool Textile Industry, Cotton Industry, Glass Industry, Rubber Industry, and Electrical Industry. As for the twenty-two federations decided by the Ministries of Industry and Food, most have been established under the guidance of the Commercial Control Council. After establishment, the focus will be placed on the most important commodity federations, and organizational preparation can also be considered complete.

(2) Professional Committees

Among the planned professional committees, the Flour and Wheat, Cotton, Sugar, and Oil and Grain committees have been established.

(3) Guidance Work for Federations

Regarding the guidance work for the federations in various industries, the Commercial Control Council has instructed senior officials of the council to work with the federations to study the following points: (1) How to delineate the industry associations in the three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui and the two cities of Beijing and Shanghai. (2) How to reorganize the organizational system of the federations. (3) Is it necessary to increase or decrease the directors and supervisors of the federations? (4) How to adjust the material procurement and distribution relationship of the federations. (5) How to determine the regulations of the federations in various industries. (6) How to handle the admission and withdrawal of members from the industry associations. (7) How to seek the rationalization of loan issues. From the above points, it can be seen that the work of the Commercial Control Council has entered a new stage, and its activities after June 15th are particularly noteworthy.
