### Smolensk Threat Eliminated - German Announcement of Withdrawal from Novorossisk

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - Official announcement states that German forces have withdrawn from Bryansk, a city in the central region of the front line, and from the port of Novorossisk on the Black Sea.

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German Party authorities announced on the 16th that the focal point of the Eastern Front battle had shifted since dawn on the 14th to the area between the Moscow-Smolensk railway and the Moscow-Roslavl highway. Soviet forces amassed large reserve units and launched a large-scale breakthrough operation against Smolensk, engaging in an unprecedented fierce battle with the defending German forces. The numerical superiority of the Soviet forces gradually pressured the German forces, causing them to retreat to new positions in some areas. However, as soon as reinforcements arrived, they immediately launched a fierce counterattack. As a result, except for a few companies, the Soviet breakthrough units were almost entirely annihilated. Fierce decisive battles also occurred in the northeast of Smolensk. On the 14th and 15th, German forces annihilated four Soviet tank brigades, eliminating the direct threat to Smolensk.

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - A German news agency war correspondent reported on the 16th about the situation on the Ukrainian front: On the 15th, Soviet forces again attempted to break through the German defense line in a vast area of the southern sector of the Eastern Front, launching a fierce attack on German positions. However, their offensive was completely repelled by the German forces with skillful tactics. West and northwest of Izyum, the Soviets, under the cover of strong artillery and fighter-bomber squadrons, heavily pressured German positions, but they were stopped by the German forces and suffered great damage. Northwest of Kharkov, Soviet forces launched a major offensive against German positions, and in several places, they briefly broke through, but later German counterattacks were successful. The Soviet army lost eighty-four tanks and was defeated. The German encirclement and annihilation operation against Soviet forces southwest of Kharkov was largely completed on the 15th. So far, the confirmed results of the battle are that 2,500 Soviet soldiers were killed, 600 were captured, and German forces destroyed 110 Soviet tanks and 84 artillery pieces. In addition, three aircraft were captured. In the Nezhin area of northern Ukraine, there have been no changes in the front line, but according to German reconnaissance, Soviet forces continue to amass strong reserve units on that front, seemingly preparing to attack Kyiv, and a large-scale offensive is expected to begin soon.

### US Forces in Salerno Area Tenaciously Defend Beachhead - British Forces Rapidly Deploying Reinforcements

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports, according to German reconnaissance aircraft reports: On Wednesday night, the main force of the British army landed at Paestum and Castellabate, including a division of mechanized troops from the British Eighth Army, attempting to advance north along the west coast of Italy to relieve the beleaguered U.S. Fifth Army at Salerno. The majority of these fresh troops are Canadians, and they took over the U.S. defense zone under the cover of darkness. Except for artillery positions, the U.S. troops have retreated to the rear to reorganize and regroup.

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - German military comments on the situation in the Salerno area: Although the enemy has a planned advantage, they still feel overwhelmed by the German offensive. General Eisenhower, relying on his large numbers, confidently believed that he could not only establish a beachhead but also quickly advance inland. Marshal Kesselring's strategy was able to quickly establish defensive positions on land and take the offensive in the air, initially cutting the Anglo-American landing forces into two desperate operational units, one driven south of Salerno, and the remnants of the U.S. Fifth Army confined to the coast west of Eboli. But according to the latest twenty-four-hour news, the U.S. military is trying to hold the Salerno beachhead at any cost, and sending large reinforcements into that hellhole, attacking under the cover of naval artillery and air force.

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports: The losses suffered by the U.S. military in the Salerno area are extremely heavy. In the past twenty-four hours, the Allied forces, under the cover of the British Navy, continued to land strong reinforcements. German forces also continued to gain victories in these twenty-four hours. U.S. forces in Alfadena and Pansana were again repelled, and the British army also retreated in Salerno. The southern flank of the U.S. military and the northern front of the British army are still cut off. The Allied forces sent paratroopers behind German lines in Pozzuoli to disrupt and attempt to improve their positions, but they also failed. The paratrooper unit was completely annihilated. The vanguard of Montgomery's forces advanced from Calabria and should have reached the port of Policastro, but it is still one hundred kilometers from Salerno. Montgomery may advance along the coast towards the southern route of the U.S. military to relieve their siege, but he may also advance towards Seton, and then head north from Lagonegro to Eboli. However, the German command is not paying attention to the fierce fighting in Salerno, but to the actions of the British army after landing in the south.

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - The Nautical News Agency reports: The village of Besano, located at the mouth of the Sele River in the Gulf of Salerno, has been occupied by German forces, and hundreds of prisoners have fallen into German hands. Seventeen U.S. tanks were destroyed or captured.

### The Story of the Daring Rescue of Mussolini in the Gran Sasso Mountains

Berlin, September 17th, Central News Agency Dispatch - According to the Xun Tong News Agency, before investigating Mussolini's whereabouts, the German security service chief disguised himself, using his fluent Italian to drink and make merry with Italian sailors. Therefore, twenty-four hours before Badoglio's surrender, he had already learned that Mussolini was imprisoned on the island of Ponza. Security Service Chief Skorzeny immediately sailed to the island in a motor torpedo boat, but Mussolini had already been taken away by seaplane to some unknown location at dawn that day, and he found nothing. He then began a new investigation, and finally obtained a clue in the Gran Sasso Mountains. According to the guards' report, the mountain railway was heavily guarded. Skorzeny then flew in a specially prepared reconnaissance plane to study the terrain and search for landing sites. At the same time, he began to select rescue personnel, choosing 18 people and a paratrooper squad to carry out the rescue. At the time, the guards were panic-stricken and did not fire a single shot, and Mussolini was safely rescued. This investigation was carried out in close cooperation with the Italian intelligence agency and was successfully completed.

### Press Conference Held by the Reporting Authorities at 7:40 PM Yesterday - Discussion of Weaknesses in Italian Naval Surrender

### The Axis Camp is Absolutely Unshaken

The regular press conference hosted by the Japanese Army, Navy, and Foreign Affairs authorities in Shanghai was held yesterday on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel. Minister Matsushima of the Navy Reporting Department attended in person, as well as Lieutenant Kanda of the department, Information Section Chief Hirota of the Japanese Embassy in Shanghai, and Vice Consul Fukuma. The meeting began with Hirota reporting on the situation in Europe over the past week, followed by Matsushima commenting on the weaknesses of the Italian naval surrender, and promoting the inherent spirit of East Asia. The meeting lasted for over two hours.

Remarks by Colonel Matsushima on the Reasons for the Surrender

Matsushima began by saying: "In the history of the world's most glorious fleets, the Spanish Armada and the Russian Baltic Fleet are well-known. The Italian Navy's capitulation this time will leave a stain on history. We have reviewed the weaknesses of the Italian fleet, which include: lack of raw materials; insufficient training; inadequate command; no aircraft carriers; no naval air force; and no fighting spirit. Furthermore, in tracing the reasons for its surrender: lack of raw materials led to the Italian Navy's retreat into British-controlled waters due to a shortage of raw materials. They were forced to surrender before completing their mission. The lack of aircraft carriers and naval air force was a major drawback in combat. Italy believed that it did not need aircraft carriers because it had flight base facilities, which was a big mistake. Because aircraft carriers are mobile bases, they are more effective than land bases. Insufficient training and inadequate command: I have learned that the Italian army was not under the direct command of Prime Minister Mussolini, so training and command were not unified. If Mr. Qianzhong had been directly in command, this shameful act of escape and surrender would never have happened. Insufficient fighting spirit is something we should pay special attention to. Looking at historical facts, exactly forty-nine years ago today, in the Sino-Japanese War, the Chinese navy was defeated by Japan. The army commander, Ding Ruchang, committed suicide after making his last efforts. Ding's courage and benevolence are truly the inherent spirit of an East Asian hero, and I deeply admire this. Comparing this to Italy's surrender, there is a world of difference. The East Asian people must establish the spirit of certain victory. Therefore, I firmly believe that the cooperation between China and Japan will make us unafraid of any powerful enemy when we fight shoulder to shoulder. This belief is further strengthened by the facts. At the same time, on this day of the Jiawu War, I especially hope that the figures in the puppet regime will recognize this historical fact, reflect on it, and consider the policies to be implemented. Finally, from the standpoint of a naval expert, Matsushima said that the Italian fleet's surrender to Britain and the United States has no effect. The Italian fleet has nothing in common with the British and American fleets. There is no equipment on the ships and no weapons that are the same as those of Britain and the United States. Even if Britain and the United States supply military supplies, it will be difficult to do so in time. Especially with the difference in training, it is even more difficult for soldiers to board ships and fight. Therefore, we do not pay attention to the Italian navy's surrender."

Further Discussion of Aviation

Matsushima also talked about the upcoming Aviation Memorial Day and gave a detailed explanation of the excellent training of the Japanese Air Force. Finally, he mentioned the American Air Force in Chongqing oppressing the Chongqing Air Force and poisoning the people in Chongqing. Matsushima first stated that the Japanese Navy Aviation Memorial Day is on the 20th of this month, and all Japanese citizens and overseas Chinese are launching enthusiastic celebrations. The Japanese Army and Navy aviation units are active in various battles in the Pacific, and their forces are excellent. They have been winning great victories and inflicting heavy blows on the enemy. He also said that he met yesterday with an official who was quite experienced in aviation. He had participated in the battles in Hawaii, the Solomon Islands, and Malaysia. He has a wealth of tactical experience and said that the soldiers in the war zone are enthusiastic about serving the country and have established the belief that they will win. Therefore, we have strengthened our belief, and our naval aviation team is always ready to fight in any battle and can achieve victories that are ten or even dozens of times greater than the enemy's. The reasons for the great effect are: concrete training; excellent materials; sufficient preparation of raw materials; and the pilots' skilled technology. We especially expect these excellent technicians to add more glorious records to history in the future. Finally, regarding the Chongqing Air Force, the current Chongqing Air Force is being oppressed by the U.S. 14th Air Force in Chongqing, and the British and American Air Forces in the Far East are poisoning Chinese cities and towns, killing innocent people, which is extremely hateful. This fact should be thoroughly recognized by the Chongqing military, and the past spirit should be used to advance the path of building East Asia, to break away from the slavery of foreign shackles, and to actively defend against foreign aggression and complete the task of Greater East Asia.

Remarks by Section Chief Hirota

British and American Fantasies

Hirota began by saying: From a diplomatic point of view, when the Italian Badoglio regime betrayed the country, Britain and the United States actually declared that they wanted to dissolve the Tripartite Pact between Japan, Germany, and Italy, and shake the spirit of the Tripartite Pact. They even had the absurd idea of splitting the relationship between Japan and Germany. However, in fact, this attempt has become a fantasy. The compromise of the Italian Badoglio regime has only made the Axis alliance stronger. On the 15th of this month, the Japanese and German political aides issued a joint statement on this issue. The statement said that although Italy committed this act of treason, we will still increase our obligations under the Tripartite Pact, and in order to achieve the purpose of the Tripartite Pact, Japan and Germany will spare no effort to continue their efforts to achieve final victory. Continuing with military affairs, the armistice agreement between Britain, the United States, and the Italian Badoglio regime stipulated that the British and American allied forces would go to central and southern Italy and land as if entering an uninhabited area, and would even assist the British and American allied forces, leading them to northern Italy to suppress the German army. But the fact is that when the British and American allied forces landed, they had no internal support, and the Italian army only automatically abandoned their weapons.

German Strength Hirota further said: "In the central and southern regions, the strength of the German garrison is huge, and it is difficult for the British and American troops to land as they wish. The landing at Salerno was frustrated by the German army, and MacArthur was forced to flee by ship. At the same time, the German army in central and southern Italy used its army to drive the British and American allied forces to southern Italy. This sharp momentum has not only established a European fortress in Italy, but also in the entire European theater. In addition, Britain and the United States originally planned to install a puppet government in Rome and sent New York Mayor La Guardia as supervisor. (La Guardia stopped in Italy and has now been naturalized in the United States.) However, this attempt failed due to the failure of the Badoglio regime, and La Guardia was unable to succeed. Furthermore, after Italian Prime Minister Mussolini was rescued by Germany on September 13, the British and American sides, especially the United States, had previously designated him as a major target, intending to overthrow Mussolini and the Fascist Party, so they used magic to promote the Badoglio regime's armistice, even intending to extradite Mussolini to Washington, and Roosevelt and Churchill made a joint political judgment and mobilized domestic newspapers, movie theaters, and all other propaganda machines to expand the hype, making it a fait accompli. However, this inhumane and despicable act by

### On the System of Studying Abroad: Reflections After Reading Japan's Decision on Guiding Policies for Students Studying in Japan

Since the Opium War, Chinese people have been shocked by the advanced science and technology of Western countries, including the functions of sound, light, chemistry, and electricity. They believed that if they could imitate these things one by one, the nation would surely become wealthy and powerful. Therefore, they strongly advocated for studying abroad. However, those in charge at the time lacked foresight and were eager for quick success. They did not have detailed plans or comprehensive considerations regarding the age and academic level of the students sent, the suitability of the subjects of study to domestic needs, or the assignment of personnel for supervision and guidance. As a result, in the beginning, they sent young children and minors abroad in droves. These people had not yet matured in their studies at home, and their wills were not yet firm. Once they entered a foreign country, the circumstances were completely different. Each country has its own unique environment and national character. With immature minds, they were easily influenced by the environment. After returning to China, many were arrogant and looked down on everything. Their lifestyle, diet, and clothing were all Europeanized. They could read Western books in the original language, but they were clueless about even the most basic Chinese newspapers. However, at the time, there was a blind belief about those who returned from studying abroad, assuming that they were ready with talent after being "gilded" overseas, and they were entrusted with important responsibilities. In reality, transforming a nation and society is not an easy task. Without a deep understanding and research into the customs, political system, and economy of their own country, bearing heavy responsibilities rashly would not only be futile but also lead to failure. This was the failure of the initial system of studying abroad.

Later, although improvements were gradually made, over the decades, there was no shortage of outstanding individuals among those who returned after studying diligently, especially in the fields of technology and science, where they achieved relatively good results. However, from the perspective of the overall policy of studying abroad, it was still a failure.

China and Japan were both countries that sent students to study in the West, and the timing was similar. However, Japan benefited from its policy of studying abroad far more than China. In terms of academic ability, Chinese students studying abroad were by no means inferior to Japanese students. However, in terms of achievements in their careers after returning home, Chinese students lagged far behind Japanese students. Upon careful examination, the reason for the difference lies in the different methods of sending students abroad. The Japanese government sent students abroad who were generally older and had "special insights and rich experience." As mentioned earlier, China sent mostly young children and youths. Chinese students only gained textbook knowledge from the classroom, while Japanese students gained both social and career experience. Because of the differences in what they gained, their achievements after returning home were also different. By comparison, Japan's method of selecting students to study abroad was far superior to China's; this is an obvious fact. Only in the last decade has China's method of selecting students to study abroad improved. For example, in the past, the students selected by Tsinghua School were all young children aged thirteen or fourteen. After a little preparation in foreign languages and general knowledge, they were sent to the United States. What they gained in the United States were graduation diplomas and master's and doctoral degrees. When it came to practical knowledge, they had no genuine understanding of either Chinese or Western society. Later, it was stipulated that only after graduating from university could one take the exam. After passing the exam, they had to stay in the country for a year to gain work experience before going abroad to study. What these students gain abroad is bound to be far greater than that of the former Tsinghua students. Therefore, the improvement in the method of selecting students to study abroad is closely related to the effectiveness of the policy of studying abroad.

Today, Japan's national power is strong, while our national power is weak. Although there are many reasons for this, it can also be seen from a comparison of the policies of studying abroad that strength and weakness are not accidental. Now, our national society needs construction and revitalization, and the urgency is no less than it was after the Opium War. We must, of course, pay close attention to the policy of studying abroad and make necessary improvements.

Our friendly neighbor Japan's technology, science, economics, politics, and law have undergone continuous experimentation and research. Not only are they far more advanced than ours, but they also hold outstanding positions compared to other countries in the world. This provides much for our students to learn. At a time when China and Japan are working together to build East Asia, cultivating talent is a matter of utmost urgency. On July 11, this newspaper published Zhang Chaojun's "Review and Discussion of the System of Studying Abroad" in its weekly commentary, which proposed a general outline for the system of studying abroad. We will not repeat it here. Today, we are specifically publishing an article titled "Japan's Decision on Guiding Policies for Students Studying in Japan" (see page 4 of this newspaper). We strongly agree with the friendly nation Japan's policies and methods for guiding students studying in China. We would like to briefly express our thoughts as follows:

In the past, Chinese students studying in Japan were the largest in number, had the longest history, were geographically closest, and had the most similar written language compared to students from other countries. Logically, there should be the most talent who could understand Japanese. However, the current reality is that the most lacking and commonly felt pain is the lack of Japanese interpreters and Japanese translation talent. Therefore, if language and writing between China and Japan cannot be freely and smoothly communicated, then to boast about cultural exchange is bound to be a case of doing twice the work for half the results.

In the past twenty years, the Chinese publishing industry has published many translations of English and American books, but fewer translations of Japanese books. This is not because Japan lacks excellent works, nor is it because the Chinese publishing industry has prejudices against Japanese works, but entirely due to the lack of talent proficient in Japanese.

Comparing the academic subjects of Chinese students studying in Japan, although there are no accurate statistics, it is generally assumed that too few study practical subjects such as industry and agriculture, while they tend towards politics and law. The concept of being an official rather than doing work can be tested here.

Chinese students have a comparatively good emotional attachment to their country of study; this is a fact. Under this fact, the difficulty of achieving unanimous understanding and even inclination towards Japanese policies in the short term is also a fact. Therefore, in order to jointly build Greater East Asia, actively cultivating key talent is essential.

We are very grateful for Japan's newly established guiding policies for students studying abroad. For the sake of cultivating talent to build East Asia ten or twenty years from now, we cannot neglect strict training today. Because the lack of talent today is the result of not paying attention to strict training ten or twenty years ago. In the past, Japan's management of Chinese students was too lenient, resulting in a scarcity of talent proficient in Japanese today. We hope that the Japanese education authorities will pay attention to this. At the same time, we hope that Japan will also send students to China to cultivate a foundation of genuine mutual understanding between Chinese and Japanese youth. This is our suggestion.

### Kurusu Speaks on Radio to Central and South America Urging Cooperation to Strive for National Liberation

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 17th ‚Äì Mr. Kurusu Saburo, the former special envoy to the United States, delivered a radio address to Central and South America at the Tokyo Central Broadcasting Station on the 17th. The main points are as follows: People of Latin America, we are now fighting for the liberation of Greater East Asia, just as your ancestors fought for the liberation of Latin America about 150 years ago. The tide of national liberation has now surged to East Asia. The one billion people of Greater East Asia are carrying out the Greater East Asia War with the same spirit that the countries of South America once fought for their independence. Britain and the United States also once fought for their liberation and freedom, but their spirit of love for freedom fossilized at the same time as they established their hegemony. Britain and the United States now claim to be freedom fighters of the world and publicize this, but as far as the East is concerned, have they ever given freedom to the peoples of Greater East Asia? The ideal of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is not to separate Greater East Asia from the world and stand aloof, but to enable each country to cooperate with the world in its proper position. The current policy towards China adopted by Japan is based on this ideal. Since China recently recovered the Shanghai Concession, it has become the master of its own home for the first time since the Opium War. The 400 million people of China are now unanimously engaged in the liberation movement. The Philippines and Burma, which were damaged in the war, have been restored, and the construction of political economy is also actively underway. Burma achieved independence on August 1, and the Philippines will soon become independent. The anti-British atmosphere in India is also surging throughout India. All these surging wills and efforts of the East Asian nations, which have been the long-accumulated desires of these nations, are now being fulfilled thanks to Japan's victory. The United States has now hung the whole world under the American gold-made cross. Those Latin American countries that can follow this policy will only become "docile servants" of the United States. Will you fight again for independence, or will you surrender unconditionally to American economic imperialism? The time for you to choose is now.

### Germany's Strategy Unchanged: Northern Italian Front Impregnable

What impact will the betrayal of the Three-Power Pact by Badoglio have on the European war situation and the world war situation? What are Germany's plans for the future war situation, fighting a strong enemy in the east? Mr. Kato, the president of the Berlin branch of Mainichi Shimbun, spoke to the head office via international long-distance call on the afternoon of the 9th as follows:

Head Office: What are Germany's views on the surrender of the Badoglio regime?

Kato: On this point, the German Foreign Ministry has already issued a statement today. The German side believes that Badoglio's defection is a deliberate criminal act. His crime is a betrayal of the fascist government led by Mussolini and the representatives of the Italian people. Therefore, Germany has been fully prepared since Mussolini's downfall and has not wavered in the slightest. The German people are extremely calm after hearing the government's announcement.

Head Office: Japan is also equally calm. I believe this is the result of the unity of the Japanese and German spirit and everyone's belief in certain victory. What is the situation regarding the establishment of a new government in northern Italy?

Kato: This point has already been announced. The German people are extremely calm after hearing about it, and they are even more strengthened after hearing Mussolini's firm rise to help complete the war against Britain and the United States. Currently, all that is known is that a new government has been established. As for its organizational structure, etc., it is not clear. How this government will cooperate to defeat Britain and the United States, and the organization of the government's core military force, etc., is also not clear. The location is a small metropolitan city in northern Italy near the German-Italian border.

Head Office: What about the future operations of the German army in Italy?

Kato: I think the enemy will still land in various parts of Italy in the future! However, the German army's strategy of defeating the enemy has not changed much. It will carry out operations in accordance with the established policy. Perhaps it will adopt a tactic of luring the enemy to the north and annihilating them in one fell swoop. Some people believe that there will be small contacts with the Southern Italian army. Perhaps such things have already happened, but such things will not have any impact on the overall war situation.

Head Office: What about the Italian army on the Eastern Front and in the Balkans?

Kato: Currently, the Italian army on the Eastern Front has been in the rear, and their numbers are not a problem.

Head Office: What is the news about the Japanese expatriates in Italy?

Kato: Because communications between Berlin and Rome have been cut off, the situation is unclear. In short, we must promote the spirit of the Three-Power Pact. Japan, Germany, and the newly reborn fascist new government must be united as one, hold a belief in certain victory, and work hard to defeat Britain and the United States. This is the most important thing. This is what the German people generally think. (Qing Qing: Translated from the Mainichi Shimbun, September 11)
