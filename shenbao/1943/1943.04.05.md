### International Situation on the Eve of a New Offensive

In the past few weeks, the general public's attention has been focused on diplomacy. On the side of the anti-Axis powers, since the Casablanca Conference between Roosevelt and Churchill, British Foreign Secretary Eden's visit to the United States and Canada, and his consultations with the U.S., Soviet Union, Chongqing, and Canada, have been aimed at resolving the contradictions between Britain, the U.S., the Soviet Union, and Chongqing in order to prepare for the upcoming international war situation. In Chongqing, in addition to Soong Mei-ling's activities in the United States for some time, Soong Tzu-wen, U.S. Ambassador to Chongqing Gauss, and Chongqing Ambassador to the United States Koo Vi-kyuin have also recently visited the United States one after another, engaging in activities. These major powers have also held a so-called Pacific War Council. Although the contradictions between the anti-Axis countries can never be completely eliminated, their maneuvers will have a significant impact on the future war situation.

In order to counter the diplomatic maneuvers of Britain, the United States, and other countries, and to gain a decisive advantage in the spring offensive, the strengthening of unity among the Axis powers is of great significance. In Europe, following the Rome Conference between Germany and Italy, the total mobilization of Europe has yielded greater results. The movement to concentrate manpower and resources in European countries under the banner of opposing "Bolshevism" and Jews is also being intensified step by step. In the future, Europe will not allow a single person or a single resource to escape the war aims under this general goal, that is undoubted. In East Asia, since the Tokyo Conference between Japan, Germany, and Italy, the visit to Japan by the head of administration of Burma, and Prime Minister Tojo's public declaration to assist the independence of Burma and the Philippines; followed by Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchuria, all these facts prove that the anti-British and anti-American combat power in East Asia is developing rapidly in strengthened unity.

The diplomatic and economic activities of the two major camps have, to this day, seemingly had obvious results, and what follows will be the spring offensive. In Europe, Moscow has already acknowledged the end of the winter counteroffensive, and the spring battle is brewing, with German and anti-communist troops from various European countries eagerly heading to the front. In the Tunisian region of Africa, the British and American offensive seems to have reached a dead end. Regardless of the ambitions of Britain and the United States, they may open a so-called "second front" towards the Balkans from the end of the Tunisian war. However, the Axis powers' operations have always been in a proactive position. We firmly believe that the necessary preparations have already been completed, and we can quietly await the new war reports. On the other hand, Britain and the United States cannot help but feel uneasy about the new situation in East Asia. The complaints issued by Chongqing and Australia against Britain and the United States these days can reveal the distress of the anti-Axis camp before the war.

Consider what Goebbels of the German Propaganda Department said yesterday: "In war, the most dangerous things are fantasy and self-deception." We must clearly recognize that a greater war is brewing and beginning, just as Goebbels said: "The number of people engaged in work after the declaration of total war and the number of people who can join the army will amaze even the greatest experts." Then we should ask ourselves, how much effort have we put into the country and into the war before this great era? Therefore, we also demand that "everyone should do their best for the total war, and no one can hope to avoid their responsibilities."

### Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka After Completing His Mission to Manchuria, Expressing Great Delight at the Realization of His Long-Held Wish, and Meets with Governor-General Koiso and Director-General Tanaka in Korea

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced at 4:00 PM on the 4th that Prime Minister and Minister of War Tojo had completed his scheduled visit to Manchuria and returned to Fukuoka at 4:00 PM on the 4th.

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo, accompanied by Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato, and secretaries Akamatsu, Shikaoka, and Hattori, flew to Xinjing on the 31st of last month. He paid respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo and offered congratulations on his well-being. He also visited Prime Minister Zhang Guowei and other important figures, holding cordial talks. He expressed his congratulations on the rapid development of Manchuria's national construction over the past ten years, and inspected the current situation of various local institutions. Now that the mission to Manchuria has been completed, he took a train from Xinjing at 6:30 AM on the 2nd to return home. At 9:55 AM on the 4th, he arrived in Keijo (Seoul), where Governor-General Koiso of Korea, along with Director-General Tanaka, welcomed him at the station. They went together to the Chosun Hotel, and from 10:10 AM at the hotel, he met with Governor-General Koiso, Director-General Tanaka, and Chief of Staff Ihara of the Korean Army, listening to Governor-General Koiso's report on all aspects of Korea for about seven hours. Chief of Staff Ihara also gave a report of about half an hour. At 1:55 PM, he departed by plane, returning to Fukuoka at 4:00 PM. Currently, cooperation between Japan and its allies Germany and Italy is becoming increasingly close. Prime Minister Tojo's visits to China and Manchuria will certainly make the relations between Japan, China, and Manchuria even closer. At the same time, the determination of the three countries to complete the Greater East Asia War is becoming increasingly clear.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Tokyo, 4th (Central News Agency) - Prime Minister Tojo delivered a speech after arriving in Fukuoka at 4:00 PM this afternoon, stating in essence that he had long wished to visit Manchuria, pay respects to His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo, express congratulations on the country's rapid development over the past decade, and express gratitude for the cooperation given to Japan since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, he could also have cordial talks with the heads of the Manchukuo government and inspect the current situation of various local institutions. He was extremely pleased that his long-held wish had been realized. He was especially honored to have had the opportunity to meet with His Majesty the Emperor of Manchukuo and receive generous hospitality, as well as to visit the Kenkoku Shrine. At the time of the founding of Manchuria, today, Manchuria has been united in mind and spirit, building a tight national defense. Now, ten years after the founding of Manchuria, there has been great progress in politics, economy, and transportation. When Japan resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, Manchuria also wholeheartedly resolved to cooperate with Japan with all its strength, engaging in guarding the north and increasing productivity, making a great contribution to directly cooperating with Japan in conducting the war. In accordance with the spirit of Japan-Manchukuo joint defense, the Manchukuo government has been making every effort to strengthen various facilities, while also conducting intense training of the national army day and night. In recent years, there has also been vigorous cooperation with Japan in the mobilization of resources such as copper, iron, and other mineral resources, and a large amount of food has also been transported to China and Japan. I was very excited to see this reality, and I am very excited about Manchuria's cooperation in carrying out the Greater East Asia War. The Kwantung Army and various local institutions, which are responsible for guarding the north, are working very hard, and they are not forgetting training and vigilance day and night. At the same time, they are cooperating closely with Manchuria, moving towards a common goal. This is not only extremely grateful to us, but also doubles our determination. When I visited the Republic of China, I witnessed the spirit of the Chinese people to live and die with Japan, and the determination to build a new China and cooperate in the Greater East Asia War, and all the facilities have made great progress. Before visiting Manchuria, I had a meeting with Dr. Ba Maw, through which I learned about Burma's ardent hope to establish an independent and free country and its intention to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War. Now, when I visit Manchuria, I can see the development of Manchuria and the firm pleasure of strengthening the unity between Japan and Manchuria, and I feel even more delighted in my heart. The future of East Asia is bright.

### Soviet Union Consolidates Central Front to Defend Against German Summer Offensive

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from the Havas News Agency, a British visitor in Moscow reported yesterday that the most difficult and urgent task of the Soviet High Command is to consolidate the Soviet front in the center. The Red Army is currently digging tank traps, setting up machine gun positions, and laying mines in military key areas. The Soviets expect the Germans to attack from the Smolensk area in the summer.

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - Havas military commentator Steel-Fret stated that because the Eastern Front has thawed everywhere, only a few battles occurred in the week of March 27 to April 2. The Soviets attempted to break through from the north, in order to cut off the German connection at the bridgehead, but were repelled by the German-Walloon coalition. There were only a few battles in the Alaft Hill area. The Germans northwest of Kursk occupied the city of Sevsk. The Soviets continued to attempt to break through to Staraia Russa south of Lake Ladoga on the northern front, but the troops used were defeated despite their large number. The intensity of the battles in March can be seen from the heavy losses of the Soviet army, which lost a total of 2,200 tanks and 1,260 aircraft.

### Quiet Situation in Tunisia, German-Italian Allied Forces Improve Positions, British and American Forces in Central and Southern Regions are Reorganizing, Fierce Fighting Could Resume at Any Time

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Havas News Agency military correspondent, the new positions of the German and Italian forces in southern and central Tunisia were not subjected to fierce attacks on Friday. General Montgomery's new artillery positions are clearly still incomplete, and the silence of the British Eighth Army has also had a considerable impact on the activities of General Patton's U.S. Fifth Army. Near El Guettar and Maknassy, the U.S. forces have not launched any further attacks in order to break through the German and Italian lines. The German forces in those two places have launched local counterattacks, which have greatly improved the positions of the Axis forces. The German forces used smaller infantry units to launch courageous attacks on numerically superior enemy forces, capturing several hill positions. The left flank of General Patton's forces, operating west of البيسون (probably a misspelling), has not made the important progress that the anti-Axis side claims. The same is true of the French rebel forces under General Giraud operating in the Bou Arada area further north. The British forces under General Anderson in northern Tunisia are still carefully advancing towards the new Axis positions south of Cape Serrat. The general lull in fighting activity throughout Tunisia at this time seems to be only a temporary phenomenon. The enemy is clearly still determined to fight to the finish. Although the U.S. forces appear to be slightly exhausted, the British forces have not yet exhausted their offensive power. Therefore, fierce fighting could resume at any time.

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Algiers, a statement issued yesterday by General Eisenhower's headquarters stated that in addition to General Patton's U.S. Fifth Army, there are at least eight British divisions operating in the Tunisian theater. The British First Army under General Anderson includes the First Armored Division and the First Infantry Division, the Ninth Division, and the Thirty-fourth Division. The British Eighth Army under General Montgomery includes one New Zealand division, one Indian division, and two British divisions (the Fiftieth and Fifty-first Divisions). The U.S. forces under General Patton have been reorganized and separated from the British First Army.

### German Tank Reserves to Join the Battle When the Time is Right

Lisbon, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to German official news agency reports last night, the British and American forces in central and southern Tunisia were prevented from launching large-scale offensives on Friday, while the German forces carried out larger military operations in adverse weather conditions to improve their positions. Generals Montgomery and Patton are clearly forced to reorganize their forces because their troops suffered heavy losses in the previous days. At the same time, according to a dispatch from Berlin, General Arnim's troops in northern Tunisia have occupied new positions in the Djebel Ahmar area. A Reuters correspondent with the U.S. forces in central Tunisia reported last night that the U.S. troops in the Fondouk area have retreated slightly and are now cooperating with the French forces under General Giraud to strengthen their new positions. The correspondent also stated that German forces constantly encountered fierce resistance from German forces as they moved along the Gabès Road. At the other end of the road, the British Eighth Army also encountered German interceptions in the mountainous terrain. The fact that the Axis command is not satisfied with defensive warfare is evidenced by a communique issued yesterday by General Giraud's headquarters, which stated that Axis tank forces launched counterattacks north of Schott el Djerid. U.S. broadcasts from Algiers last night also mentioned the difficulties encountered by British and American troops in Tunisia, saying that people in Algiers believe that General Rommel is now trying to prevent the British First and Eighth Armies from meeting. On Friday morning, Rommel attacked the anti-Axis forces east of Gafsa with 35 tanks. Rommel now has a large number of tank reserves, which will join the battle when the time is right. According to the German news agency, the Axis military operations against the U.S. forces in southeastern Tunisia are quite noteworthy. German troops captured a U.S. fortress southeast of El Guettar in a surprise attack, and an important position near Maknassy was also recaptured. The U.S. forces suffered heavy casualties in the above two positions, with more than 300 prisoners. German dive bombers and fighters assisted the land forces in the areas of Autreville and El Guettar, which was very effective. The main purpose of the bombing was to target enemy troop concentration points and artillery positions. A batch of German dive bombers destroyed a U.S. heavy artillery piece, and more than 100 motorized vehicles were also destroyed by German aircraft.

### Hungarian Foreign Minister Visits Rome, Meets with Italian Prime Minister to Review Military and Political Situation, and Has Long Conversation with the Pope

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to a Stefani news agency report, Hungarian Foreign Minister Kánya, at the invitation of Italian Prime Minister Mussolini, arrived in Italy for an official visit from April 1 to 3, and took this opportunity to meet with senior officials of the Fascist government. During Kánya's talks with Mussolini and Italian Undersecretary of State Bastianini, they conducted a detailed review of the general political and military situation and various issues related to Italy and Hungary. The talks were extremely harmonious and confirmed the consensus of opinions between the two sides. After arriving in Italy on April 1, Kánya laid wreaths at the Tomb of the Unknown Soldier and the graves of the martyrs of the Fascist Revolution. At noon, the Italian King received Kánya and his entourage and hosted a luncheon. In the afternoon, Kánya met with Mussolini again, talking for more than two hours, with the Italian Undersecretary of State also present. In the evening, the Italian Undersecretary of State hosted a banquet for Kánya, and gave a short speech after the banquet, wishing Hungary prosperity and Regent Horthy good health. Kánya also gave a reply speech. The next morning, Kánya met with Mussolini again and had lunch together. In the afternoon, he attended a reception hosted by the Governor of Rome.

Rome, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, Hungarian Prime Minister Kánya's visit to Italy was still an "open secret" on Saturday night. Only the Vatican was officially informed. The Pope received Kánya at the Vatican in the morning for an hour and fifteen minutes. Kánya presented the Pope with a letter requesting the canonization of Margaret of Hungary. Later, the Hungarian Prime Minister introduced the Hungarian Ambassador to the Holy See, Ábel, and his entourage to the Pope. The Pope addressed them in Hungarian and blessed the Hungarian people, and presented his ceremonial seal to the Hungarian Prime Minister. Later, the Hungarian Prime Minister visited Archbishop Maglione, the Secretary of State of the Holy See, and prayed at St. Peter's Basilica, leaving the Vatican at nearly 1:00 PM.

### Romanian Leader to Visit Italy Soon

Berlin, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Havas, following the announcement of the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader's headquarters, it has attracted significant attention from diplomatic circles and the foreign press here. A German Foreign Ministry spokesperson, in response to inquiries yesterday, pointed out that such visits are extremely useful. Havas's special diplomatic correspondent stated that the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader, the Hungarian Prime Minister's visit to Rome, and the Romanian leader's upcoming visit to Rome and elsewhere, mark the beginning of the annual spring activities in European international life since the outbreak of the war. The scope of this year's activities will bring European countries into closer contact to address the issues accumulated over the winter and prepare for summer actions. This activity is, of course, led by German-Italian cooperation, which has become an institution due to the close ties between the two countries. This diplomatic activity is not a vague discussion of the future shape of the world, but a practical increase in Europe's resistance. The anti-Axis side has been vigorously promoting discord among the countries of Southeastern Europe in recent months, but there is no longer talk of division between Hungary and Romania. Communist rebellions have occurred in Croatia, but have been suppressed by German, Italian, and Croatian forces. Bulgaria has also participated in suppressing Serbian rebellions and assisting in restoring order. Indeed, such restoration of order should be a collaborative effort, and efforts to strengthen the entire structure must focus not only on international relations, but also on the internal situation of each country. The stronger each country is internally, the greater its contribution to overall resistance. The British side has said that the Balkans are a convenient gateway into continental Europe, but it will soon be proven that the countries of Southeastern Europe have sufficient military strength to deal with poorly armed rebellions. In short, the Southeastern European countries fully understand the threats from the Bolsheviks and Britain and have taken appropriate measures.

### German Side Understands Bulgaria's Non-Participation in the War

Madrid, 4th (Central News Agency) - A dispatch states that the Spanish newspaper ABC, commenting on the Bulgarian King's visit to the German leader, stated that Germany has repeatedly demonstrated its understanding of the needs and characteristics of other countries. This visit demonstrates that the political and military alliance between the two countries will become more active and sincere in the future. Bulgaria's non-participation in the war against Bolshevism has proven Germany's complete understanding of the problems of other countries. The Bulgarian people, with the help of the Soviet Union, broke away from Turkish bondage, and are therefore still very pro-Soviet. Therefore, it is unrealistic to expect Bulgarians to immediately fight against the Soviet Union. However, this does not mean that Bulgaria is not a loyal ally of Germany. During the First World War, Bulgaria fought alongside Germany, and later suffered the shame of defeat together. Therefore, the two countries will never forget the armed cooperation between them. Germany has also expressed complete understanding towards Denmark. Although Denmark is under German military protection, it remains a sovereign state. Germany has not interfered in its internal affairs, and the country still follows democratic and parliamentary systems as before.

### "New Polish Government" Rumored to be Organized in the Soviet Union

Warsaw, 4th (Central News Agency) - According to Stefani news agency, reliable sources state that a "New Polish Government," as a puppet of the Polish Communist Party, will soon be established in the Soviet Union to confront the London Polish government-in-exile led by General Sikorski. It is reported that the creation of the "new government" is intended to "legitimize" the Bolsheviks' claims regarding the Soviet-Polish border issue. According to a reliable source, they may even announce the establishment of a Polish Soviet Republic.

### Impressions of the Capital

— Liu Hanru

It has been three years since the National Government returned to the capital. The various constructions in the capital have advanced rapidly. This newspaper, in order to participate in the grand celebration of the return to the capital, has specially dispatched a reporter to represent the newspaper in Nanjing. After staying in Nanjing for four days, witnessing the prosperity of the capital and the enthusiastic celebration of the grand occasion by all sectors, I have drafted this article based on my impressions.

—The author notes

On the evening of March 28th, I boarded the night train to Nanjing. The order at the North Station, after appeals from this newspaper and various sectors, has improved significantly. The mile-long lines of people are no longer seen, making travel more convenient. This shows that the authorities are willing to listen to public opinion.

The second-class carriage was divided into two sections, one for military personnel and the other for passengers. Perhaps because of the celebration of the return to the capital, the train to Nanjing that night was very crowded.

In the three years since the return to the capital, the population of Nanjing has increased dramatically. There is a shortage of hotels. Whenever there are gatherings or major ceremonies, many people from all over go to the capital. The hotel industry is particularly prosperous. This time, with the holding of the anniversary celebration of the return to the capital, representatives from various provinces and cities gathered, and Nanjing hotels were filled to capacity. Fortunately, two days earlier, I had Mr. Qian Renping, a colleague in Nanjing, reserve a room for me, avoiding sleeping in the open. Although the room was reserved two days in advance, I still had to wait until 3 pm for the "previous guest to give way to the next guest" to enter the bedroom. I heard that a day or two before, many people could not find accommodation and went to the police station to ask the police to find a solution. The police specially led the guests to various hotels to ask, or borrowed rooms in residential houses. This kind of crowding shows the enthusiasm of all parties to go to Nanjing to celebrate the return to the capital.

After arriving at the hotel, because I could not enter the room to rest for a while, I had to drag my tired body, which had not slept all night, to handle official business. I hired a rickshaw in front of the hotel and went to Miaoqian for breakfast first. The cityscape around Gongyuan Street Miaoqian is much more prosperous than a year ago, with pedestrians coming and going like weaving, and has restored the prosperity of the pre-war period.

The statue of Dr. Sun Yat-sen stands majestically in the park in the heart of XinJieKou. New colorful archways have been built at the east and west intersections, and celebratory slogans are hung under the crossing national flags. This place is the heart of Nanjing, with pedestrians and vehicles flowing like water. The area in front of the propaganda department on the west side is especially decorated with festive atmosphere. Six large red silk banners, matched with gold characters, are hung all over the outside of the building, as if celebrating a happy event.

In the propaganda department, I met Director Liu of the Guidance Division and Director Fan of the News Division. I represented this newspaper in requesting guidance. The two directors sincerely expressed words of encouragement and guidance to this newspaper and instructed on the methods of participating in various ceremonies and visiting various places in Nanjing.

The night scene of the Confucius Temple is very worth cherishing. Restaurants and theaters are crowded, and singing and dancing venues are also frequently visited. The neon lights that cannot be seen in Shanghai are almost everywhere in front of the shops here. The lively scene is said to last until 1 or 2 o'clock at night, unlike Shanghai recently, where most shops close at 6 or 7 pm.

International Cafe and New Asia Cafe are two places that are called cafes but are actually dance halls. The system of dance girls sitting and waiting for guests has been abolished. They sit and serve guests everywhere. The price is determined by the liquor. From the liquor consumed by the dance girls, you can see the amount paid by the dancers. Each glass of liquor ranges from 20 yuan to 300 yuan, but the usual range is from 50 yuan to 200 yuan. I think Shanghai may imitate this system in the near future.

Returning to my residence, it was almost midnight. I fell asleep and when I woke up, the sun outside the window was already red. Fortunately, I was not disturbed by the noise of the hotel last night.

March 30, 1943, was the third anniversary of the National Government's return to the capital. Although the weather was uncertain yesterday, it was suddenly clear and bright this morning. The weather is favorable, is it not joyful. Before nine o'clock, I took a car to the National Assembly Hall. This is a large venue that can accommodate 5,000 people. The representatives participating in the hall were already gathered, and civil and military officials and people filled the entire hall, both on and off the stage, upstairs and downstairs. All the elite within the Peace Zone have gathered here.

At nine o'clock sharp, the chairman gracefully arrived, and the entire hall stood up to pay respects. The commemorative ceremony also began. The solemn and solemn national anthem was sung from everyone's mouth. This was a 5,000-person chorus without a conductor. (To be continued)

### Symposium of Chinese and Japanese Economic Circles (3) Convened by the Continental News and This Newspaper

Mr. Xu Yiqing: It is certainly a very gratifying thing that the Japanese authorities have returned the control of materials to China, and then the Chinese government hands it over to the commercial self-governing organizations for management. Japan is an advanced country in the control of materials, and of course has good methods and a lot of experience in the control of materials. Why can't the control of materials in China achieve the expected results? The important reason is the estrangement of public sentiment. The Chinese government does not do it itself, but hands it over to the private sector, which is entirely due to this consideration. We absolutely acknowledge that the return of material control is a well-intentioned expression of Japan's help to China, which is indeed beneficial to China. However, from the perspective of Greater East Asianism, it is equally beneficial to Japan to help China is to help oneself. Therefore, I dare to assert that the Japanese side will not only return the control of materials and let China handle it on its own, but will also help China from the sidelines to achieve a complete success.

Since the government promulgated the Provisional Regulations of the National Commercial Control Federation and the Provisional Regulations on the Transfer and Suppression of Wartime Materials, many people have made unnecessary speculations. Their view is that although the Japanese military and political authorities have kindly returned the right to control materials, the attitude of the Japanese merchants is still worth considering. My personal view is exactly the opposite of the general view. I think what should be considered is not the attitude of the Japanese merchants, but the attitude of the Chinese people. Why do I say that? Japan had already implemented partial control before the incident, and the people were already accustomed to the control methods, and had already enjoyed the benefits of the control. What doubts are there about the control methods? Secondly, equal treatment for Chinese and Japanese merchants has become a creed of Sino-Japanese cooperation, and Japanese merchants have long understood this, so there is no need to worry about it. On the contrary, the Chinese people have always been accustomed to freedom and laissez-faire, and once they are suddenly restricted, they cannot help but feel all kinds of inconveniences.

Just now, I heard a Japanese business leader say that after the establishment of the Control Federation, merchants may have nothing to do in the future. I also have a different opinion. First, since the Control Federation is named the National Commercial Control Federation, the status of merchants will only be raised higher; the work of merchants will only become more important. Second, China's cooperative system is still in its infancy. It is not known how many years it will take to leave the stage of direct transactions between consumers and producers. In the middle, it all depends on merchants as intermediaries. After the restrictions on the movement of materials are eased, the circulation of goods will be particularly smooth, and the business of merchants can be particularly developed. However, after the circulation of materials, all profits will naturally no longer be as favorable as before. Regarding this point, it seems that we can refer to the regulations on profits after the implementation of control in Japan and ask the authorities to adjust it at any time.

The Control Federation is purely a commercial self-governing organization, and of course it can take into account the commercial situation in all aspects. However, I hope that the gentlemen presiding over the Control Federation will also remember the consumer's position and also take into account the public sentiment. Secondly, the Control Federation was hastily established, and many regulations are not yet complete. Moreover, the control method is an innovation in China, and it is an even greater innovation for the Chinese to handle it themselves. Although the society should not demand perfection, the officials in charge of the General Assembly must not therefore have the mentality of reducing responsibility. The good methods of all controlled countries, I hope the meeting will adopt more, and all social opinions will be heard more, and it is necessary to achieve the stage of conveying the lower situation to the upper level and the upper situation to the lower level, so that the social and people's livelihood problems can be solved.

The Control Federation is the central hub of national material control, which of course includes industry associations from all over the country, but in fact, the participation of Shanghai industrial and commercial associations will still be the focus of the association. How can we eliminate the past regional economic concepts in the future and completely achieve the ultimate goal of economic unification? First, it depends on whether the core members of the association can first abandon the concept of regional economy and use fair principles for the rational overall planning of material acquisition and distribution in various places, without focusing on the interests of Shanghai's industry and commerce as a prerequisite. Second, it depends on whether the government can use its political power to eliminate all obstacles that may affect the "national economic unification supreme policy." The government handed over the material control work to the private sector to help the government share a part of the responsibility, not that the government can be relieved of responsibility from now on. We must all understand that the success or failure of the control work can directly affect the people's livelihood, and indirectly affects the government's prestige, so the government and the people should do their best to help this matter succeed.

Whether the easing of material restrictions can achieve the effect of stabilizing prices is still a big question. Because the reasons for the rise in prices in recent years are very complicated, the failure of materials to circulate smoothly is only one of them. Other reasons, such as transportation difficulties and currency instability, cannot be eliminated, and prices may still be difficult to see small possibilities.

Finally, there is one point, that is, material control is closely related to production. Material control is only a palliative measure; increasing production is the fundamental cure. If production is insufficient, all control methods will sometimes be exhausted. Therefore, I take this opportunity to specifically propose that the government and the economic circles of the two countries pay attention to it together.

Mr. Takeuchi: Whether it is Mr. Yao's and Mr. Xu's words, or Mr. Kurimoto's words, the conclusion is that the question of stabilizing prices and how to make the exchange of materials smooth, as well as how to absorb inland materials as much as possible and utilize production, is nothing more than making Shanghai's industrial productivity revive. On this point, the opinions of all of you are consistent. Recently, the important people on the Chinese side often have the question of what is the matter with the price problem. I always find it incomprehensible. But now that prices are so soaring, it is not a matter of supply and demand, nor is it a matter of how the war is going. I think it lies in the fact that Shanghai is not talking about economics at all.

Therefore, we believe that it is necessary to make the highest degree of effort for the revival and construction of the Chinese economy, and at the same time for the completion of the Greater East Asia War, in order to achieve common goals, which is the goal of this policy conversion. As for the biggest key to achieving common goals, it all lies in the construction of "Economic Shanghai." In other words, through the construction of Economic Shanghai, the so-called economic situation is generated, and at the same time, it is transformed from "Trade Shanghai" to "Production Shanghai." With such a big goal, the common goal of Japan and China in the construction of this so-called production Shanghai is based on the cooperation between Japan and China.

From this point of view, the question of the revival and production enhancement of Shanghai's industry is the third topic to be discussed today. Furthermore, along the line of Economic Shanghai, what kind of concept should be used for the problem of Shanghai's commodity trade, and I would like to hear your opinions.

Mr. Chen Binhe: (1) Shanghai is the only economic center in the Peace Zone, and its economic trends are sufficient to determine the whole country, and even sufficient to influence the economic trends under the Chongqing regime, so both China and Japan should make the greatest efforts to seek its rational development.

(2) There are three essentials of Japan's new policy towards China: 1. To strengthen the National Government so that it can concentrate its national strength. 2. To stabilize the economic strength of the Peace Zone and reduce its dependence on Japan, that is, to reduce Japan's burden. 3. To strengthen the economic power of the Peace Zone and make a strong contribution to Japan's wartime economy. In order to realize these three points, Japan abandoned its vested interests in China, so that China and Japan can work together on a completely equal footing. We believe that only on the basis of this new policy, that is, Sino-Japanese equality and mutual assistance, can the above three major requirements be realized. Obviously, Shanghai's trends are looked forward to by the whole country, so it should set an example to promote the whole country.

(3) The motives, requirements, and positions of Sino-Japanese economic cooperation in Shanghai are as mentioned above. Attention should also be paid to several specific principles, namely: 1. The Japanese side should abandon any superior or priority rights. In any cooperation, it should express the spirit of Sino-Japanese equal cooperation; 2. The Chinese side should recognize the creative spirit and technical capabilities of the Japanese people and accept their assistance and guidance, and should not have a suspicious heart; 3. Both the Chinese and Japanese sides should have a long-term vision and should not only seek the interests of the current small scope. These three principles must be implemented.

(4) Now let's talk about the guidelines for Sino-Japanese economic cooperation: 1. All economic undertakings that are suitable for being completely presided over by China itself, that is, undertakings that can achieve greater results if they are run by China than by Japan, should be handed over to China without hesitation; 2. Economic undertakings that are most suitable for being run by China and Japan in cooperation should be carried out by both parties in good faith to complete the common mission; 3. All undertakings that are currently beyond the reach of China's financial resources, human resources, especially technology, and that are more effective if Japan operates them alone than if China operates them on its own or if China and Japan operate them jointly, may be handed over to Japan to continue to operate under the premise of recovering sovereignty. 4. Although there is the above division, there should be close agreements between China and Japan, there should be laws in the government that facilitate Sino-Japanese cooperation, and there should be a "powerful civil organization" that works for close cooperation between the Sino-Japanese economic circles.

(5) To solve the current price problem, we must first clearly recognize the crux of the problem. We believe that the most important thing is the currency value problem. If the currency value is not stabilized, then any control and price limits will not be efficient. The second is the material problem. If we do not make efforts to increase production and increase materials, then all countermeasures for the price problem will fail. The third is the problem of hoarding and speculation. On the one hand, material holders are unwilling to sell, and on the other hand, general currency holders are buying goods, which makes prices soar and forms a very serious problem in society.

(6) In addition to the two major countermeasures of stabilizing currency value and increasing production, countermeasures that are purely related to prices themselves must implement comprehensive control and comprehensive price limits.

1. The essentials of comprehensive control: (A) In view of the different price reasons, different degrees of phenomena, and the special circumstances of production, transportation, and sales of different types, natures, uses, and values of materials in each province and city, appropriate measures should be taken under the comprehensive control according to the urgency and severity. (B) The control mechanism must be unified, the powers must be clear, the personnel must be rectified, and efforts must be made to prevent any separation, restriction, and contradiction between the government and the people. (C) After the implementation of comprehensive control, in coordination with political improvement and economic production increase policies, especially financial improvement, prices can be reasonably resolved.

2. Comprehensive price limit is the first and most important step in comprehensive control. The essentials are as follows: (A) Each province, city, and county should make comprehensive price limits on the prices, transportation costs, and wages of important markets within its jurisdiction, from raw materials, labor, tools, production to transportation, sales, and distribution, without limiting the prices of producers, so as not to hinder production. (B) First, investigate the actual production, purchase, transportation, and sales of materials in the market, set planned and organized countermeasures, and focus on dredging materials in various places, improving the division of production, and adjusting the supply and demand in the market.

(7) Shanghai has always been the center of industrial production. In this wartime, it should increase the production of materials to win the victory. However, the current Shanghai industry is in a state of semi-paralysis. This contradictory phenomenon should be adjusted urgently. The main principles are: 1. Actively promote factories to resume production and step up production. 2. The production volume of Shanghai industrial products is sufficient to fully supply the needs of the Peace Zone and extend to various parts of Nanyang to exchange materials. 3. The production of Shanghai light industry and the production of Japanese heavy industry can cooperate with each other in division of labor, which has a major and decisive role in the early completion of the victory in the Greater East Asia War.

(8) The reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry in recent years must be thoroughly studied and understood before we can prescribe the right medicine. I believe that the main reasons for the decline of Shanghai's industry in recent years are: 1. Since the war, Shanghai has entered an extraordinary period, and people's minds have not yet returned to a normal state of peace, and industrial operations are regarded as risky. 2. Due to the instability of the currency value and the lack of materials, everyone regards releasing currency for speculation as a good plan, which not only fuels the trend of hoarding and speculation, but also disrupts the stability of the market. Huge profits can be obtained with a hand or a telephone call, so they are unwilling to engage in industrial production. 3. Chinese capital has no political protection in operating industry. 4. Due to the existence of extraordinary conditions, the means of industrial production—that is, raw materials, machinery, and labor—have no reliable sources, and the transportation of products is subject to limitations, plus the small stability of the sales market, all of which can hinder the development of industry. 5. Financial speculation and the high profits of commercial loans make industrial loans completely unsuccessful. 6. There is no connection between the industrial producers, and each acts on its own, unable to become a force. The government and the industrial circles do not make planned production.

(9) In order to increase Shanghai's industrial production, we must thoroughly solve the above problems and eliminate the above obstacles. The main thing is: 1. Improve the political environment and give producers psychological stability, and the main methods are: (A) Reduce production taxes and abolish heavy taxes and transit taxes. (B) Guarantee the acquisition of cheap raw materials and a full supply of power. (C) The government guarantees the principal and interest. (D) Limit freight rates, improve transportation and inspection methods. 2. Financially, do your best to provide industrial producers with financial assistance, especially rewarding medium and small industries and handicrafts. Industrial producers can form groups, and banks can provide loans to these groups to protect the interests of the banks. 3. The industrial circles should establish self-reliant organizations and then form an alliance of Sino-Japanese industrial producers, and under the guidance of the Sino-Japanese authorities, jointly seek rational development. 4. Prohibit speculation and huge profits, but support legitimate exchanges and stock markets to stabilize the market and encourage floating capital to be invested in production undertakings. (End)

### Sale of Oil in Various Joint Guarantee Districts of the French Concession Scheduled by Date and Time; Purchasing Households Should Comply with Regulations; Notice Issued in Advance by the Joint Guarantee Office

The edible oil industry wholesale office has been distributing oil to households since the 3rd [of this month]. Each person receives four ounces at a price of two yuan, five jiao, and five fen. This oil sale is of a general nature, so edible oil households do not need to compete to be first. It is also understood that the wholesale office has divided the entire city into several areas. Therefore, the sales situation can be described as good. However, within the Xiafei Road area of the French Concession, due to procedural reasons, it was not possible to issue the oil at the same time. For example, the 148th Joint Guarantee, the 135th Joint Guarantee, the 147th Joint Guarantee, and the 196th Joint Guarantee, etc., have now scheduled dates and times. The Joint Guarantee Office will first instruct the Baozhong chiefs to notify each household. Residents of each Joint Guarantee should comply with the regulations and bring their household registration certificates, etc., to arrive on time so that the oil sales office can quickly complete its work.

Oil Quantity Should Be Accurate

This time, the two concessions stipulated that each person receives four ounces of oil, purchased by the head of the household for the total number of people in the household. Heads of three-tenant families can also go to ensure fair distribution. Regarding the quantity of oil, the authorities believe that the price of oil is already extremely high. Oil shops must ensure that every drop is accounted for and sell accurately without any deductions or adulteration. If households purchasing oil find that the quantity is insufficient, they can report it immediately. Inspectors will be dispatched for random checks. Those who are found to be colluding and engaging in fraud will be punished severely.

West Shanghai Distributing Coarse Rice and Xian Rice

West Shanghai is rationing grain according to population. The first distribution for March of this year has begun. This distribution has been increased by four He. Coarse rice accounts for three-quarters, and Xian rice accounts for slightly more than one-quarter. Each person receives one Sheng and seven He of coarse rice and six He of Xian rice, sold for a total of six yuan and nine jiao in national currency. As for the third distribution in March, namely the ninth ration of rice, the West Shanghai authorities have not yet set a date for distribution. Citizens are eagerly hoping that the West Shanghai grain administration will actively find ways to improve the situation to benefit the lives of the people.

Fourth Ration of Flour Starts Tomorrow

The purchase of flour for February of this year was only yesterday (the 4th) relayed by the district authorities to each Lian chief within the boundary to be distributed to citizens household by household. Therefore, the first count of flour rations for February, namely the fourth ration, is scheduled to begin tomorrow (the 6th). Each person receives one Jin of flour, sold for four yuan and four jiao in national currency. At that time, citizens can use their fourth ration purchase certificates to purchase flour from designated stores. Whether the fifth and sixth flour rations for February can be fully allocated within this month has not yet been decided. Regarding the city's count of four ounces of oil rations, sold for two yuan, five jiao, and five fen in national currency, the deadline is set for 5:00 PM on the 9th of this month.

### Yesterday Was Children's Day

To celebrate the 12th Children's Day, various circles in the city held a joint celebration meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium at the Dahuigong Bridge at 10:00 AM yesterday (the 4th). More than 500 people attended, including Education Bureau Chief Lin Jiong'an, heads of various agencies, guests from all walks of life, and children from various schools. The presidium was composed of the Education Bureau, etc. After the meeting was conducted with due ceremony, Mayor Chen first delivered a speech, briefly stating the significance of celebrating Children's Day. The intent is to make children across the country understand that today is one of the most precious days for children, to make them aware of the greatness of their mission for the country in the future, and to promote people's love and respect for children. Children are the foundation of the country and the spirit of the nation. Therefore, we should reasonably educate and love children, so that children can obtain happiness, then the foundation of the country can be consolidated, and the nation can be revived. Otherwise, the country cannot exist, and the nation will be destroyed. Subsequently, representatives of the municipal government delivered speeches, and guests gave speeches. Then, representatives of child refugees delivered speeches. After the meeting read out a telegram of respect to the chairman, the meeting was adjourned. In the afternoon, the presidium of the meeting went to various refugee shelters in groups to distribute candy and biscuits. At 9:10 PM, Director Lin delivered a broadcast speech on behalf of Mayor Chen, titled "The Significance of Celebrating Children's Day." The Children's Day Infant Health Competition held the finals at the Nanshi Citizen Education Center at 2:00 PM in the afternoon and awarded prizes at that time.

Infant Competition Holds Awards Ceremony

The city's Infant Health Competition Awards Ceremony, sponsored by the Municipal Education Bureau, was held yesterday, the 12th Children's Day, at the Confucian Temple Park on Wenmiao Road in Nanshi. It was personally awarded by Lin Jiong'an, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau. The ceremony was grand. At the same time, the Public Education Center held an amusement fair, and the situation was enthusiastic. It was found that a total of 233 people participated in this infant health competition. After separate reviews, the winners of the first group, from six months to one year old, included Yu Runxian, Zhuang Ximing, Diao Daren, Lin Weiguo, Zhang Linsen, Zhang Jiadong, Lu Jianye, and Xue Meimei.

Mayor Chen Gongbo will personally preside over the sacrificial ceremony at that time. All agencies and schools will participate in the sacrificial ceremony.

### Improved Method for Purchasing Boat Tickets to Ningbo; Register First, Then Collect Tickets; Reward for Reporting High-Priced Resales

Recently, the number of residents traveling from this port to Ningbo has been increasing day by day, leading to overcrowding when purchasing boat tickets. Cases of squeezing for tickets, high-priced resales, and needing to pay extra fares on board due to mismatched names have occurred. A reporter from the Datong News Agency specially visited the travel agency handling ticket sales yesterday to record the proper ticket purchase methods as follows:

Register First

Passengers traveling to Ningbo, regardless of the date, can bring their citizen certificates to the travel agency selling boat tickets for advance registration. After the ticket seller copies down the citizen certificate number and name and age, they will issue a "Ship Date Certificate." The reverse side of this certificate and the citizen certificate will have a joint stamp to facilitate verification. At the same time, the listed price will be collected. However, after receiving the "Ship Date Certificate," you must pay attention to the date for exchanging the boat ticket written on it to prevent it from being invalidated if it is out of date.

Reward for Reporting

Furthermore, this certificate may not be transferred to others. When exchanging for the boat ticket, the ticket seller must check whether the citizen certificate matches the registration. If there is a discrepancy, the ship date certificate will be confiscated. Therefore, the above methods are all based on verifiable records, so it is impossible to carry out high-priced resale techniques. If passengers purchase high-priced boat tickets outside and have evidence, they can bring the ticket to the company to report it. The company will investigate the fraudulent person and refund the boat ticket fee to the reporter, allowing them to return to their hometown.

### Picking Up Lost Money; Eagerly Hoping for Claim

Mr. Weng Kairong of Lunzhong Weaving Factory picked up a stack of banknotes at the intersection of Henan Road and Guangdong Road yesterday. After waiting for a while and no one came to look for them, he immediately notified the self-defense corps at the intersection and handed over the original amount to the social service department of this newspaper. The loser can bring proper assurance within three days and come to this office to explain the time of the loss, the amount of money, and the number of bills. After everything matches, they will be allowed to reclaim the money. After the deadline, the money will be transferred to this newspaper's poverty relief fund to benefit the loser.

### Opening of the Public Works Bureau's Flood Prevention Committee's Public Works Group Meeting; Flood Prevention Project Imminent; Shantytowns Along Various Rivers to be Demolished Within a Time Limit

First, the chairman reported the purpose of the meeting and recent work progress, and then discussed proposals. The resolutions are as follows: (1) With the flood prevention project imminent, the shantytowns along various rivers should be demolished within a time limit to facilitate public works. (2) The public works group should send a letter to the Municipal Police Headquarters and the West Shanghai Police Bureau, requesting each to send two police officers from their respective jurisdictions to assist personnel dispatched by the public works group in jointly handling the matter. (3) The Fahua Port area west of the railway belongs to the jurisdiction of the Yulin Road and Xujiahui sub-bureaus. A letter should be sent to request them to instruct their respective sub-bureaus to send police to assist. (4) Regarding the demolition costs of shantytowns in Fahua Port, etc., a preliminary budget should be prepared and submitted for approval and implementation. The rest is omitted.

### Dapu Bridge Opens

### Sports; West League Football Group A Match; Donghua Lost Yesterday; Jewish Team Won 3-2

In yesterday's West League Group A match, Donghua and the Jewish team met at Jiaozhou Park. The situation was enthusiastic. Donghua's strength was weakened due to the absence of key players Zhuang Youren, Xu Wenkui, and Liang Shutang, and they were also unlucky, leading to a defeat against the Jewish team. Forty-two minutes into the game, A. Daye received the ball in the middle and passed it low to Liao Shiming. Liao then lobbed it to A. Daye, who gently kicked it, breaking the opponent's goal first. The score was 1-0. However, in less than a minute, Fafanxiao rose up in the middle, dribbled quickly, and rushed to the penalty area. Zhang Banglun came out of the goal to save it but was beaten by Fafanxiao into the empty goal. The score was 1-1. Soon, the first half ended, and the score was tied 1-1. In the second half, Donghua lost two goals in a row, and the morale of the team was indignant. Jia Youliang launched an uprising on the side line, went deep into the penalty area, and lobbed it to the center. A. Daye headed the ball into the net, making the score 2-3. Until the end of the game, Donghua lost to the Jewish team.

### Readers' Forum; A Few Hopes for Nanshi

— Xiao Ping

I was born and raised in Nanshi, studied in Nanshi. Except for five years of wandering in the concession during the August 13th Incident, I eventually returned to the embrace of Nanshi. Therefore, I love Nanshi and hope that Nanshi will recover sooner.

Living in Nanshi has the interest of finding tranquility in the midst of the hustle and bustle. Moreover, on the ancient buildings, one can reflect on everything in history, some of which are very poetic.

Of course, Nanshi has been greatly rectified and improved after the war, but I, who am overly hopeful, still feel that the authorities are not putting in enough effort.

(1) Roads: In terms of Zhonghua, Minguo, and Huancheng roads, there are many low-lying areas, and the streets in the city are also mostly dilapidated and sunken, which should be repaired as soon as possible.

(2) Drains: The drains along the roads have not been dredged for a long time, resulting in water accumulation during rain and turning into channels of filth, which should be made smooth.

(3) Garbage: Newspapers have repeatedly reported on cleaning, but it has become a habit over time, and it is only transported to nearby open spaces for accumulation (such as the section from Xiaodongmen to Dadongmen, with piles like small mounds along the road), which should be thoroughly cleaned.

(4) Transportation: There used to be a ring road bus, which was suspended due to gasoline shortages. At least this line should be restored first - whether it is a tram or a charcoal car is fine.

(5) Urination and Defecation: The more dilapidated houses and open spaces there are, the easier it is to develop the bad habit of urinating and defecating at will. Considering that nature is right in front of us and the rampant true tiger epidemic last year, can the self-defense corps and post police work together to prohibit this?

Regarding the above, residents should first conduct self-examination and pay attention to public health, but because there are many ignorant people, we have to rely on the power of the authorities to investigate and ban.

With the French Concession about to be taken over, the iron gates can be completely abolished. The number of residents in Nanshi is increasing, and if we do not plan ahead, those who intend to move to Nanshi may be deterred.

The measures of the Grain Bureau are much better than before. Following the example of the concessions, rations can now be purchased on time, which is worth reporting to friends who want to come to Nanshi.

### Economic Circle

The financial and industrial market conditions in Shanghai last week were generally stable as usual. However, because the Japanese military notes have stopped issuing new notes, the general public does not understand the truth, so they suspect the exchange problem of the Central Reserve Bank notes and the Joint Reserve Bank notes, which has caused various market conditions to fluctuate rapidly. However, except for the slightly higher prices of some goods, the market prices of food remain flat and sluggish. As for the officially set prices of gold ornaments, cotton yarn, cloth, fuel, miscellaneous grains, sugar, and oil, there has been no change so far.

### Commentary; The Problem of Rational Prices

In handling any matter, it is necessary to adhere to scientific methods and rationalize as a principle. What is the current price problem? Opinions vary. The most fundamental solution is to investigate the raw materials, payment, and all reasonable profits of the factory and calculate a fair and just value. In that case, not only will black market prices not occur, but also the bad phenomenon of hoarding and not selling, resulting in priced but unavailable goods, will not be discovered. Therefore, factory cost accounting is a matter worth paying attention to.

Running any kind of factory in difficult times is not easy to please. If the price is high, it will affect sales and even make wholesalers and retailers unwilling to promote sales. If the selling price is low, it will affect the capital. The solution lies in basing the price on the purchase price of raw materials, plus interest payments, and the due legal profits. Absolutely no concealment or intentional price increases should be allowed, causing prices to rise to unlimited levels. This is something that trade associations should pay attention to and strive to implement. If it is found that the limited price is below cost, the limited price should be raised to prevent the manufacturer from suffering excessive losses. In a word, the principle of price lies in stability, not too high, not too low, and changes should not be too rapid. Therefore, if all prices are based on scientific methods, it can be said to be the most reasonable, not only can both production and sales parties not suffer losses, but also their business can achieve a stable result.

### Various Authorities Effectively Rectify; Shanghai Industry and Commerce Gradually Get on the Right Track

Various industries in this city, such as (1) cracking down on speculative transactions and preventing hoarding; (2) limiting spot transactions and strictly prohibiting buying and selling short; (3) negotiating standard prices and ordering all industries to comply; (4) formulating buying and selling industry regulations and earnestly implementing them, whether the company buys or sells spot or futures goods, are required to issue purchase and sale orders. Therefore, all industries have rules to follow for transactions, and various illegal activities and speculative hoarding seem to have gradually disappeared. The supply of goods is actively seeking to resume work. In the future, production and consumption are expected to be balanced. Social people's livelihood will become more stable from now on.

### Caustic Soda Manufacturing Plant Established in Pudong

According to Datong News Agency, it is learned that the relevant authorities in this city intend to establish a caustic soda manufacturing plant in Pudong in order to solve the difficulty of soap raw materials. The construction of the factory can begin this month. In the future, the raw materials for manufacturing soap in this city will have no fear, and the larger-scale soap factories of Chinese merchants can also resume work. The output of soap will increase, and the price of soap will also fall back.

### The Trends of Essential Goods

Livestock

It is found that the Public Works Bureau limits the price of pork to 13 yuan and 8 jiao per catty, but merchants ignore the public order. The so-called limited price is just empty talk. In principle, general fish and meat foods have limited prices, but in fact they all exceed the limited prices. If we were to crack down on it today, then in tomorrow's meat shops, you wouldn't be able to buy a single piece of pork. However, economic control should be universal and uniform and cannot leave meat out of the equation.

So, what method should be used to control the price of meat? This still lies in thoroughly reforming the structure of the livestock market, that is, to change the current market that forms a free market price into a market under a controlled economy. The reform of the livestock market is imminent. It is said that the market authorities have already drafted a plan to reform the market structure. For the sake of detailed explanation of the current situation of the market structure and the purchase and distribution of livestock, here is a brief overview of the direction of reforming the market structure.

The livestock transported to Shanghai, both in the past and now, are mainly produced in Jiangbei, as are pigs and cattle. Only a few aquatic products and poultry are produced in Jiangnan. The products near Zhenjiang in the Taihu Lake area can be slightly more. For pigs alone, an average of 600,000 heads are transported to Shanghai every year from the three ports of Jiangbei: Xingang, Xinsheng, and Zhanghuang. The pork consumption of Shanghai citizens requires about 1 million to 1.2 million heads per year. This shows that more than half of Shanghai's annual consumption depends on the pigs from the three ports mentioned above. Xinsheng, Xingang, and Zhanghuang have become the center of the producing area market. Yellow cattle and water buffalo, a total of five or six thousand heads are transported from the above ports every year. Although it is not much, it already accounts for the first place in the north and south of the Yangtze River. As for chickens, ducks, wild ducks, etc., about five or six hundred thousand are transported from Xingang and Xinsheng to Shanghai every year. However, aquatic products and poultry are still richer in Jiangnan. Although the production in the Taihu Lake area has recently decreased, counting the chickens, ducks, and wild ducks from Xiashu Port in Zhenjiang West, about one million are transported to Shanghai every year. Livestock production around Shanghai is not prosperous. About 2,000 goats and 20,000 chickens come from Songjiang and Pudong. Animal husbandry is quite developed in Jiangbei. Looking at the production and sales map of livestock resources, it is such a situation that Jiangbei is the production area, and Jiangnan is the consumption area of livestock resources.

It is found that the central market's imports were not prosperous in the second half of last year, gradually decreasing compared with the first half of the same year and the second half of the previous year. The root cause of the surge in meat prices also lies in the smooth arrival of goods. The livestock that arrive are all traded by means of sale. Whether the sale method is suitable for the economic control system will be discussed later. Here, let's first talk about the distribution process from the market to the consumer:

The current meat distribution in Shanghai has to go through three stages: broker - meat merchant - retailer. However, large demands from large hotels and restaurants can be purchased directly from meat merchants, but the needs of ordinary people have to go through multiple twists and turns, and some merchants take advantage of this, creating a situation of rising prices step by step. In fact, controlling meat prices is not very troublesome. There is no need to consider in many ways like controlling industrial products. The focus of controlling meat prices lies in reforming the pricing mechanism of the central market. Sale is a remnant of liberalism, and it should not be allowed to exist anymore. The problem is to eliminate this long-standing malpractice.

The upper and lower livestock markets are already planning a reform draft, and Shanghai's meat prices will soon return to normal. (March 22nd, Mainland New Daily)

### Remembering My Hometown

— Hu Mingyang

Having been away from my hometown for five years, the village houses and the streams are inevitably a bit hazy in my imagination now. Yet, I unconsciously feel an infinite longing for everything about her. I remember the year I turned thirteen, I embarked on a long journey in a sudden mood, gently leaving my lovely hometown behind. At that time, I never looked back or felt any reluctance because, sadly, I didn’t understand such feelings then. But time has taken away the past, and the years have silently faded into that turbulent life, making me deeply admire and yearn for everything of the past. So, sometimes when I happen to think of the old days’ laughter, I am reminded of my beautiful hometown. I dream that I have grown two wings, flying over the wilderness, and throwing myself into her embrace again.

My hometown is in Haiyan County, Zhejiang, a village belonging to Tongyuan Town. Almost all the residents there are brothers, uncles, and cousins from the same clan. A stream meanders in front of the village, and fields surround it. Therefore, whenever spring fills the earth, the surroundings are all shades of green, as if living in a jade city. And especially during dusk, the sky is scattered with red clouds, which, from a distance, seem to connect with the green fields. Flocks of birds fly in from the horizon, suddenly sweeping across the fields and streams, heading straight for their nests. At this moment, one can often see elderly people holding a pipe, slowly returning from the field paths. They casually sit on the bluestones outside their doors, letting the evening breeze brush their beards, peacefully smoking their pipes. The muscles on their faces are so relaxed, always with a slight smile. At that time, we children would go and ask them to tell stories. Of course, what we loved to hear most were *Investiture of the Gods* and *Journey to the West*. Sometimes, when we got excited listening, we might even grab a wooden stick and call ourselves the Great Sage Equaling Heaven.

At that time, the men, women, old, and young of my hometown were immersed in the wine of joy, not knowing what sorrow was. Although they were working all day long, everyone was happy. After dinner, everyone gathered together, the elders talking about their daily lives, while the children played freely, unrestrained, just like birds flying in the sky.

But that beautiful life passed quickly. When I was thirteen, everything in my hometown suddenly changed. I couldn't see the smiling faces of my uncles and cousins, nor could I hear the exciting stories—*Investiture of the Gods* and *Journey to the West*. I only saw that everyone's face revealed a kind of tension. Before long, everyone was infected, and I myself unconsciously felt uneasy. Later, I left my hometown and embarked on that long journey, and five years have passed in the blink of an eye. I deeply long for the stream in the village, the setting sun at the corner of the house, the birds by the edge of the field, and the fragrance of rapeseed flowers in May. I hope I can relive that intoxicating life. But I don't know when I will be able to return to my beloved hometown.

### A Brief Biography of the Foolish Old Man

— Fan Zhong

In智 Village lived a Foolish Old Man (愚翁), because he never told anyone his name. Even if you asked him, he would only say, "Haha! I've forgotten." So, people assumed his surname was Foolish from his actions and assumed his given name was Old Man from his age. Even the word "Old Man" was not necessarily a term of respect, because in the group of wise people, this word often carried a satirical meaning.

The Foolish Old Man’s home only consisted of a dilapidated hut and a patch of empty ground. He had no family or friends. Every day, besides his own work, he did what people called the foolish thing of making stone mortars.

智 Village was full of智 Elder, 智 Grandma, 智 Husband, 智 Wife, 智 Older Sister, 智 Younger Sister, 智 Older Brother, 智 Younger Brother... there were quite a few of them. The Foolish Old Man lived among them, making him seem even more foolish and clumsy.

One day, someone discovered that a small corner of the riverbank outside the village had been washed away. This was a well-known thing, so they went to report it to the 智 Village Chief. The智 Village Chief immediately gathered all the 智 Villagers to discuss repair measures. The Foolish Old Man knew about this and was very anxious, but he was not qualified to participate, so he wandered outside the 智 Village Chief's house, hoping that they would come up with a good solution inside.

The sun had already set, and all the 智 Villagers poured out of the house, saying that this matter would have to be discussed further tomorrow.

The moonlight was hazy, and the early spring evening breeze made people feel a bit chilly. 智 Village was asleep quietly, without any sound. On the village street, an old man carried a load on his shoulders, moving forward with heavy steps. He was the Foolish Old Man.

He walked to the riverbank about half a kilometer away, found the damaged corner, and began his foolish work.

The next day, a 智 Husband walked past the riverbank and saw that the washed-out corner had been repaired. His wisdom sparked, and he immediately ran back to the village, shouting to the villagers:

"You can live and work in peace now! I have already repaired the riverbank."

The Foolish Old Man also jumped out and shouted to the villagers:

"Let's celebrate! Our Wise 智 has repaired the riverbank and saved our whole village."

He shouted hoarsely, and finally collapsed to the ground due to excessive excitement.

The 智 Villagers embraced the 智 Husband who had repaired the riverbank and jumped and cheered. This 智 Husband later received a bonus from the 智 Village Chief.

The 智 Village no longer saw the Foolish Old Man’s trace. The 智 Villagers clapped their hands and celebrated, and the 智 Village washed away—a stain.

### Crude Shouts

— Shi Ting

No poems, no essays,

Not even able to recite poetry,

I was originally a warrior,

Not a poet;

All along, I only knew how to clench my sword and make straightforward scoldings,

Crude struggles,

Now, the battle between light and darkness,

Has revealed the hidden side of reality,

Everything is bloody,

And so obvious.

I cannot help but feel in my soul,

A heavy burden,

Intense hatred,

Surging love,

Plucking at the strings of my heart,

Finally, unconsciously, I picked up a pen,

I will imitate the mountain wind's roar,

Shaking that gloomy pine forest;

Like surging waves,

Crashing against the firmly built embankment.

However, I began to doubt again,

Wandering without a place to stand,

Dad's bloodshot eyes,

Mom's withered face,

I dare not portray,

This is just a personal annoyance,

Reality bestows upon us,

Annoyance and pain,

Is more than just this,

Will be a million times more serious.

I still pity those abandoned bones,

In the dark corners of walls,

And the gray rats,

But I don't want to beg for them,

I know,

They are no weaker than me,

To be slaughtered and cut,

The slaves have already risen,

They have a bright future.

As for, dancing on piles of skulls,

Chewing human flesh,

Drinking human blood,

A group,

There is no need to announce their fate,

Dawn is already sparkling in the East,

The God of Love has also sown,

Righteous, sacred flowers,

Then,

When the devils disappear from the world,

Along with power and brutality,

Will it still be far away?

Across my eyes,

Is still a blank sheet of paper,

No poems, no essays,

I was originally a warrior,

Not a poet;

The Creator long ago wrote for us,

Brilliant poems,

I will still clench my sword,

And make straightforward scoldings,

Crude struggles!

Facing reality directly,

The dark side!

### Thoughts and Opinions

— Xiao Luo

Every day, I read the articles in the newspaper supplements and the creations in the magazines, and I always feel that many of them are monotonous love novels and utopian ideals that are divorced from reality. Of course, there are also many good articles, which is undeniable. But I always think that the cultural circles in Shanghai are generally too depressed.

"Literature and art have a close relationship with the times," is the first sentence in this publication's announcement. This "literature and art" of course does not refer to the two types mentioned above. Since literature and art have a close relationship with the times, then at least it must maintain a good connection with this era. The pen tip of a cultural person should be a sharp sword, which will portray the good and evil, the division between light and darkness, and leave a shadow for this turbulent era.

I feel that our articles must pay attention to these points:

It should be practical, not something that is imagined out of thin air, but a record of actual life that one has personally observed and experienced.

Efforts should be made to strive for popularization, and the level of the article should take into account readers with low levels of education.

More descriptions should be given to the realities of lower-class society, such as the various situations of workers, apprentices, dock workers, rickshaw pullers, etc. in factories. We should fully understand their personal sufferings under the persecution of the old society and the high pressure of life to arouse people's attention and sympathy.

It should be full of vigor and not be pessimistic or depressed.

It should be lively, and one should not be afraid to write everything that is being suppressed, like being afraid of threats and taking into account face-saving, etc.

Sincerely and frankly, I offer the above points of view, hoping that friends can provide supplements and corrections.

### Falling Flowers —Dedicated to Nanny Nan—

— Sha Fei

It's the season of falling flowers again!

Petals flutter down one by one with the breeze,

I lean against the tree trunk,

Contemplating past events.

It was also the season of falling flowers,

I held your little hand and strolled along the lake,

You smiled and said, "How fun, sister! I wish I could fly too, like falling flowers."

Seeing the petals on the trees by the lake fluttering down,

Having just left turbulent Shanghai, you fell ill,

The local doctor shook his head and left your ward, but you smiled and said:

"Sister! I dreamed that I flew! Flew! Flew into that clear lake, even though it's a winter without falling flowers."

"Sister! Don't cry, you'll scare away the flower fairies accompanying me."

You actually left, with a smile, completely disregarding your beloved sister,

Just like your favorite falling flowers, you flew away, only spending a short, beautiful time.

It's the season of falling flowers again,

Petals flutter down one by one with the breeze,

I lean against the tree trunk,

Contemplating past events.

### In the Boat

— Lu Yan

One year after the incident, on a deep winter evening, I followed the wriggling crowd and squeezed into the small steamboat docked in the Huangpu River. In the dark lower cabin, I found the reserved berth, put down my luggage, and leaned on the bow, casting a final glance at the city where I had lived for so long with a faint, lingering feeling. Gentlemen and ladies were happily enjoying their sumptuous Christmas dinner.

As the blurred outlines of the towering buildings completely disappeared into the darkness, the small steamboat gradually increased its speed, heading into the high tide of the Huangpu River.

This is the only small steamer currently sailing along the Zhejiang coast. The passengers are very crowded, especially in the lower cabin, where even the corners for stacking goods are full of people lying down. There are merchants transporting goods, wanderers returning home, petty politicians, workers, students, young men and women who are infatuated with the War of Resistance…

Although the ship had already set sail, people were still making a lot of noise, as if they could never finish talking. The cabin was already dark, and coupled with the smoke and water vapor exhaled by people, a small five-candlepower electric light was even weaker, emitting a yellow glow.

"Ugh! Such a small boat! This is my first time riding one! It's really killing me…" The old man, leaning against the berth and sipping green bean wine, took a bite of braised pork, shaking his shiny bald head, speaking with a sound like a missing front tooth.

"It's re… really the only way… e… extraordinary times! Old… Old man: Where are you going—going home?" A thin man lying on the upper berth spoke with his eyes always flashing, even the muscles on his cheeks twitching, looking like he was making a face at you.

"Ugh, me? To Zhenhai!" The old man put a piece of braised pork in his mouth, speaking with half a nasal sound.

"Hey! Let me tell you, in the past, no one would ride this boat even if it was free! I remember it was three years ago, right? Uh! No, it was before the war. The comprador of this boat didn't want the water money and wanted us to load goods, and we were still afraid it wasn't stable!" A young man leaning against the door and aimlessly tapping the bulkhead, looking like a shop clerk, also chimed in.

"It's re… really the only way! But there's no other boat, Old Li! What about 雷…雷斯… is it open?"

"The 克雷斯汀, I heard it's going to resume sailing!"

"That's right! 克…雷雷期汀, that boat is really good! It's a iron mast!" The man kept flashing his eyes.

"I heard that the route from Shipu to Ningbo is not very safe?" The person who said this was a sixteen or seventeen-year-old child, constantly looking at everyone's faces, waiting for an answer.

"Ugh, yes! That's where the problem happened last time!" The old man picked up another piece of braised pork, glancing at the child.

"It's re… really the only way! Extraordinary… times! Getting up early to ride a sedan chair means leaving early!" When the thin man said this, his eyes flashed even more fiercely, and his face and mouth twitched rhythmically. The child looked at him and wanted to laugh but tried hard not to.

"Hey! I say! It's better to take a sailing boat! With water police following!" The young man leaning against the door yawned, still tapping the cabin board with his hand.

"Ugh, sailing boats aren't stable either. They sail at night without lights, and they often can't see boats coming from the opposite direction. Sometimes the water police themselves start shooting each other!" The old man had braised pork in his mouth again.

"Then! What if this route can't be taken?" The child who had asked the question earlier looked at the crowd with doubtful eyes, obviously their words had not satisfied him.

"That's not true, you still have to go. But, but it's always better to have water police following!" The young man leaning against the door had already climbed onto the berth and was smoking leisurely.

"Forget it! Water police, water police, they run faster than anyone when they see bandits, afraid that their guns will be confiscated! Last time I specially asked them to protect my family early in the morning, but they refused to go!" A man in a suit sitting on a small table on the deck suddenly shouted angrily, and everyone's eyes were focused on him.

"So, I say in these times, it's best not to go out if there's nothing important. If you have to go out, you're bound to take risks and suffer. For example, every time our ship is about to reach Shipu, the lights are turned off because there's a big pirate den outside Xiangshan Port, and they often intercept and chase merchant ships. It's even more dangerous if they anchor outside the port at night!" A man who looked like a ship's steward said with a lot of experience. From his face, which was weathered and full of wrinkles, it could be seen that he was an old seafarer.

Re… really the only way! Re… only way…

"Bang!"

In the darkest corner of the cabin, someone dropped something on the ground, and everyone's eyes looked over at the same time.

"No! No! You old hag! This is not a charity organization, this is a 'foreign' merchant ship!" The crew member wearing a white hat shouted angrily, saying the word "foreign" especially loudly.

"Good sir, do a good deed! I really don't have any money! My son was killed on the battlefield! I am a homeless, miserable old woman, I beg: I beg you to do a good deed… let me…"

"It's really annoying! The ticket costs forty yuan, how can you do it with only ten yuan? And you still have to eat!"

"Great sir! I beg you to do a good deed! Take me to the countryside! Please have mercy on this poor old woman!" A white-haired old woman knelt on the cabin board, crying and begging the crew member. Her voice was trembling, and a rice bowl was broken on the ground, and rice was scattered all over the place.

"Ugh, it's really pitiful! People are all suffering from the war! Sigh!" The old man sighed and put the last piece of braised pork in his mouth. He had already finished drinking the wine.

The ship's speed was getting faster and faster, and the ship was constantly shaking due to the impact of the waves. The cabin was temporarily silent, and everyone squeezed into their bedding.

I don't know when the electric lights in the cabin went out, and people started making a lot of noise again. Men were calling for the steward, children were crying, women were cursing, it was a mess.

"Steward, what's going on? Did the electric lights break?" The old man shouted loudly.

"What's the matter? Old man!" The sixteen or seventeen-year-old child who had been sleeping soundly was also awakened, but the old man ignored him and just anxiously pounded on the bunk board.

"Coming! Sir! Don't make noise! There's a ship behind us……"

"It's re… really the only way… I'm af… afraid it's… pi… pirate…" The thin man also woke up, because there was no light, no one could see if he was blinking his eyes.

Everyone opened their eyes and lay on the bed without saying a word, their hearts beating non-stop. Silence dominated the entire cabin until the electric lights came on again, everyone breathed a sigh of relief, and the coarse snoring started up again.
