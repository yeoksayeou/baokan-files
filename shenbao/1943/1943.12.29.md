### Study Abroad and Transferring Schools

Cultural exchange is the most important work in national integration, and students studying abroad are the vanguards of cultural exchange. In view of the significant mission borne by students studying abroad, we will offer opinions on the qualifications and selection of students studying abroad, the subjects of study abroad, and so on. Because an unplanned study abroad system is only a waste for both individuals and the country. Therefore, we especially hope that the Chinese government will pay attention to the management of students studying abroad, and that allied governments will supervise from the sidelines. When Vice-Minister Yamashita of the Greater East Asia Ministry of Japan came to Shanghai last time, we expressed our opinions and requested assistance. Recently, the Propaganda Department has sent students to Japan to specialize in journalism, and the regulations and rules it has set are generally in line with our opinions. Since the Propaganda Department has taken the lead, other parties will surely respond later. We hope that students studying abroad in the future will have a new spirit when studying abroad, and that they will be able to make a new difference after returning to the country, and wash away the past shame of "staying abroad without studying" and "traveling without studying."

Studying abroad is certainly the best way to cultivate talents, but after all, only a few people can enjoy the right to study abroad. In the current and future environment where the country urgently needs talents, in order to enable the majority of Chinese students to obtain the opportunity to acquire specialized knowledge, we have to re-propose the issue of allied countries transferring schools, which we advocate, and hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will quickly design and implement it to promote its realization. Allied countries transferring schools to China can cultivate a large number of Chinese talents, which is the most economical thing in terms of money and time. In addition, in view of the current situation in China, we believe that there are the following two key points:

Years of Studying Practical Problems The allied countries have spared no effort in assisting China's various constructions, but many technical problems have often led to twice the effort with half the results because they are not practical. Allied personnel residing in China have their own duties and positions, and cannot concentrate on research. Chinese personnel are unable to do so due to incomplete equipment and insufficient resources. If this continues, both China and Japan will suffer. If the transfer of schools is successful, with relatively complete equipment and perfect teachers, Chinese students will be able to take on the task of practical research. If the research is fruitful, graduates can be assigned the responsibility of implementation. In this way, the improvement of the cause will be smooth, and the effectiveness of the cause will be enhanced.

Creating an Excellent Academic Atmosphere University students are the backbone of the next generation of the country, and their knowledge and morality determine the future of the next generation of the country. Because in the arena of modern national power competition, the existence of the country depends entirely on true talents and true learning to maintain, and there is no chance of accidental success. However, the decline in the level of university students in our country in recent years is an undeniable and widespread phenomenon, which makes people who are concerned about the future of the country feel infinite pain. The instability of the environment and the imperfection of equipment are certainly the main reasons, but the professors and students themselves should bear major responsibility for not being studious. Allied professors are known for their specialized academic studies and strict teaching. If they can transfer schools to China, establish models, and be role models, they will surely be able to lead countless future Chinese warriors to the avenue of good learning and establish a century-old foundation for China.

If the issue of transferring schools requires considerable time for planning and preparation and cannot be implemented for a while, then we further propose the simplest and most convenient method of cooperation between Chinese and Japanese universities by department. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities may wish to discuss first, stipulate that a certain department of a certain university in China cooperate with the same department of a certain university in Japan, use the existing Chinese manpower and materials, add Japanese manpower and materials, enrich the department of this university in China, so that the general students can truly learn some knowledge, and not waste money and time. At the same time, promote the realization of the transfer of schools in the shortest period of time. The plan to cultivate talents for a hundred years is today; the determination of the country's future is also today. We hope that the Chinese and Japanese authorities will pay the greatest attention.

### The Japanese Government is Sorting Out Bills to be Submitted to the Diet for Review, the Provisional Military Expenditure Budget will be Decided Next Month

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) The 84th session of the Japanese Diet has ended its year-end proceedings as of the 27th and adjourned. It will reconvene on January 20th and 21st. The Japanese government will sort out the special accounting budget案 by January 7th, the supplementary budget案 by January 14th, and the provisional military expenditure budget will also be completely decided by January 21st.

After the Diet reconvenes on January 21st, it will begin the formal review of the bills and budget案s submitted by the government.

### Taking Manpower as the Target, Japan is Increasing Food Production, and the Outline of Countermeasures has been Reviewed

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) In order to maintain a sound agricultural labor force, the Japanese government has been planning a basic policy by the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce. The specific plan has now been drafted. At the regular cabinet meeting on the 28th, the "Outline of Countermeasures to Enhance Food Self-Sufficiency" will be reviewed and decided, and the Japan Information Bureau will announce the following from 3 pm: The plan formulated this time focuses on material aspects in the second emergency countermeasure for increasing food production that was previously decided to be implemented. Now, taking manpower as the target, the emergency increase production plan is implemented. Both are very sure of helping to promote the subsequent increase in production. The main points of this outline are as follows: Considering that increasing food production is closely related to the labor problem, local officials should regard agriculturalists and agricultural technicians necessary for food production as wartime agricultural personnel. These key personnel are not within the scope of national conscription, so as to ensure a certain amount of agricultural labor. For the purpose of adjusting agricultural labor, increase production groups should be formed by villages or agricultural practice groups, and food increase production teams should be formed in the central areas of prefectures and counties. They may be dispatched to work when necessary, and the necessary expenses required shall be subsidized by the national treasury. In order to ensure agricultural land for food production, the sale and purchase of agricultural land during wartime must be approved by the administrative authorities. In addition, the Ministry of Agriculture and Commerce has adopted the following measures to promote the creation of independent farmers related to this. A. More consideration should be given to appropriate national treasury subsidies for independent farmer land. B. If the landowners who intend to create independent farmers to provide land and the purchasers of the land have disagreements, the local officials may decide on the conditions of transfer after deliberation when they submit their opinions.

### Urgent Survey of Inland Population

Tokyo, 28th (Central News Agency) In order to clarify the state of labor services such as military demand increase, food production, and transportation, and to organize the most accurate population statistics for important plans such as food and other daily necessities rationing and control, the Japanese government has urgently surveyed the inland population based on the Resources Survey Law. The Outline of the Population Survey for Showa 19 has been decided at the regular cabinet meeting on the 28th and has been officially announced. According to the population survey law, it is limited to those currently residing inland (including Karafuto) and will be implemented before February 12th of next year. The survey results will be rapidly and accurately compiled by the end of March in order to perfect the mobilization of the people in the future.

### Part of American Steelworkers Begin Strike

### Famous American Air Force Expert Discusses the Japanese-American War

Argentina's Capital, 28th (Central News Agency) The famous American Air Force commentator Seversky published an article in the Argentine newspaper La Prensa on the 25th, discussing the Japanese-American War. The main points are as follows: The challenge to the Japanese forces by the US Navy headquarters shows that they do not understand the strategic conditions of modern warfare. A decisive battle of the First Fleet cannot determine the outcome. Even if the fleet is defeated, the air force at its base can still bomb the enemy fleet within its range, give it a thorough blow, and reverse the decline. Second, Japan is now self-sufficient and will adopt a defensive strategy, so it is now working hard to strengthen its base air force. Japan has set up a new Ministry of Munitions to increase aircraft production and actively develop resources to enhance its air power, so it cannot be said that the United States is inducing the Japanese Navy to come out to fight, but that Japan is challenging the United States under the cover of its base air force. At the same time, it should be known that the Japanese Navy will never take foolish actions outside the power range of the base air force. This strategy of the Japanese Navy is by no means timid, but based on common sense. The reason why the Japanese Navy adopts this strategy is because the US Navy does not dare to break into Japanese territorial waters. Japanese inventors have also stated that the US military has the right to challenge the Japanese military, and the Japanese military also has the right to challenge the US military. Air supremacy is also an important factor in determining the outcome of modern naval warfare. If the United States wants to induce the Japanese Navy to come out to fight, it can be said that it does not recognize the tactics of the Japanese Navy, so as a result, if the US Navy wants to fight a decisive battle with the Japanese Navy, there is no other way but to sail into Japanese territorial waters. However, if the Japanese air force that controls these waters is not defeated, this attempt will never be realized.

### Germany Strengthens Western European Defenses, Now Fully Prepared, Rommel Personally Instructs Various Commanders

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) The German military authorities announced yesterday afternoon regarding Marshal Rommel's inspection of the German defenses in Western Europe: After exchanging opinions with Marshal Rundstedt in detail last week, Marshal Rommel went to inspect the German defenses in Western Europe. The results confirmed that the German army's combat preparations had reached perfection. After carefully inspecting the highly technical military facilities, the Marshal also held several talks with local commanders.

German Troops in Norway Stand Ready

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) The commander-in-chief of the German garrison in Norway, Holste, announced on the 28th: After German Marshal Rommel inspected the German defenses, Norway is ready to repel any Allied landing operations. Even if the British army attempts to invade Norway, it will repeat the mistakes of the 17th-century Scottish army's landing. At that time, all the Scottish troops were wiped out, and the commander was also captured. Therefore, the British will fall into danger sooner or later. The British army may be able to secure a beachhead and then advance along the mountain roads, but after a while, they will suffer heavy losses and know that the German army has long been prepared.

The Manner of Attacking Europe is a Matter of Conjecture

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Reuters, London: The invasion of Western Europe is in preparation, and the British are speculating on the manner and date of the invasion. Under the new commander-in-chief of the invasion of Europe, General Eisenhower, there are separate commanders-in-chief of the British and American forces, which shows that the British and American forces may land separately under the command of their respective national generals. It is generally believed that the invasion will be launched within the next 90 days, but the British also worry that the weather in the English Channel in the early months of the year will be bad and difficult to invade. "The London Observer" once said that the invasion of Western Europe will be launched at the same time as the Soviet winter offensive, but this statement is not endorsed by British military personnel, who believe that it is more likely that the invasion of Western Europe will be launched at the same time as the Soviet spring offensive.

Stockholm, Sweden, 26th (Central News Agency) According to news, Canadian Defense Minister Ralston, after returning to Ottawa from London, hinted that the Allied invasion of Western Europe is imminent, and 200,000 Canadian troops are available for Allied deployment.

Eisenhower's Inaugural Address

Lisbon, 27th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Reuters, Algiers: In his inaugural address as Commander-in-Chief of the Allied invasion of Europe, General Eisenhower refused to reveal any strategic plans and said that his main task was to seek closer cooperation between the Allied headquarters. According to Eisenhower, "My main work is the same as the work of the Allied headquarters in North Africa, that is, to strictly organize the Allied forces so as not to cause friction between them. Napoleon's victory was due to his strategy of defeating each of the Allied countries individually, so we must not allow the Germans to have this opportunity. All our people in the front and rear must do their duty and exert all their efforts. Whether I can be competent for this new task remains to be proven by future facts, but I believe that the victory of the Allied countries will not be seen before 1944." Speaking of the slow progress of the Allied forces in Italy, it is inevitable that people will be disappointed. We are encountering resolute resistance from the enemy, and the future advance of our army in Italy will depend on the quality of the German reinforcements.

Amsterdam, 28th (Central News Agency) The German News Agency quoted official London news: As a result of the discussions between Roosevelt and Churchill, the following appointments were announced: General Gort was appointed Commander-in-Chief of the Middle East, and his position was only second to General Wilson, the Supreme Commander of the Mediterranean Theater. The above two are British, and British Air Force General Tedder was appointed Deputy Supreme Commander, and his position is below General Eisenhower, the Supreme Commander of the invasion of Europe.

### Australia and New Zealand to Hold Meetings

Stockholm, Sweden, 28th (Central News Agency) According to a dispatch from Reuters, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt announced in Canberra yesterday: Australia and New Zealand are now scheduled to hold a meeting in January next year to discuss the common interests of the two countries and various policies related to the Southwest Pacific. Australia and New Zealand are both members of the British Empire and need to fulfill their important responsibilities in the Southwest Pacific. Therefore, both sides urgently need permanent cooperation and discuss policies towards the Pacific. However, the identity of the representatives from both sides who will participate in the meeting has not yet been announced.

### Soviet Army Massively Reinforces, Launches Winter Offensive, German Army Adopts Mobile Defense Warfare

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) German News Agency: Since the beginning of the winter battle, the Soviet army has focused the Eastern Front battles on the Kiev and Vitebsk areas. The battles in Crimea and the lower reaches of the Dnieper River are no longer very fierce. The Soviet high command is now trying its best to create a decisive battle result between Zhitomir and Berdichev. Therefore, the Red Army has added at least 30 infantry divisions and 8 tank divisions to the battle in this relatively narrow area. The Soviet army's large-scale offensive is mostly aimed at the German positions south of the Kiev-Zhitomir highway. When the Soviet army launched its large-scale offensive, it seemed to want to catch the German command off guard, but in fact, the German armored divisions that had already penetrated into the Soviet army's deployment area southeast of Korosten had already learned about the enemy's actions before Christmas. Therefore, the German high command seemed to know the enemy's intentions like the back of its hand. The current German army's actions are limited to mobile defense warfare. The battle experience in the two days since the offensive began has proved that the German high command has chosen appropriate tactics. Although the Soviet army has made some progress, it has failed to encircle the German army with its superior forces. It is expected that the battles in that area will continue to unfold in the future.

### Fierce Battle for Ortona

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) Reuters. The British Eighth Army has been fiercely attacking the German defense line in Ortona with a large number of troops and weapons for more than a week, but it has still failed to drive the German army back. Now, in the broken walls and ruins in the north of the city, the German paratroopers are stubbornly resisting. The street battles are very fierce. The enemy also intends to outflank the city of Ortona from the village of Tolo in the northwest, but has not succeeded. The area of the enemy's attack is no more than twelve kilometers wide, due to the restriction of the mountains on the Adriatic coast. The first goal of Montgomery seems to be to push his right wing towards Pescara, while avoiding the obstruction of Mount Majella. The mountain is 2,000 meters above sea level. The New Zealand army launched repeated fierce attacks in the first half of this month, but failed to capture it. The area of the British army's attack is very small, so it is easy to reinforce. The current development is noteworthy. On the western front, there are still only local battles, but in the mountains from Mignano to Cassino, the enemy's large forces are gradually becoming active, which shows that the enemy also intends to launch a large-scale offensive.

### The Sinking of the Scharnhorst

Berlin, 28th (Central News Agency) The German Naval Headquarters announced yesterday: The German battleship Scharnhorst encountered a British escort convoy consisting of destroyers and cruisers at 11:00 a.m. on the 26th under the command of Rear Admiral Bey, and opened fire. Later, a large warship of the British fleet joined the battle. Then, British warships gathered. At that time, the Scharnhorst did not find the attack of the British large warships. After several hours of fighting, the ship (Captain Hinze) was surrounded by the British fleet, and finally sank at 7:30 p.m. The other German warships participating in the naval battle were undamaged.

### Roosevelt Orders Seizure of National Railways

Lisbon, 28th (Central News Agency) Reuters, Washington news: President Roosevelt ordered Secretary of War Stimson to take over all important railroads in the United States yesterday afternoon.

### The Battle Results at Magas Cape

The Japanese General Headquarters announced at 4:15 p.m. on the 22nd: The Japanese naval air force attacked transport ships near Magas Cape twice on the 21st, and the battle results are as follows:

First Attack

A. Damage Inflicted on the Enemy: Sunk two large transport ships, one special transport ship (or four or five medium-sized transport ships), two cruisers (or large destroyers), and one landing craft. Destroyed one destroyer (heavily damaged and on fire), and many small boats.

B. In this operation, five Japanese aircraft self-detonated or did not return.

Second Attack

A. Damage Inflicted on the Enemy: Sunk two special transport ships, two torpedo boats, and approximately thirty landing craft. Destroyed one destroyer (heavily damaged and on fire), one submarine chaser (heavily damaged), one transport ship (heavily damaged), and many landing craft (heavily damaged).

Shot down four or more enemy aircraft.

B. In this operation, five Japanese aircraft self-detonated or did not return.

Moreover, the enemy transport ships and landing craft were fully loaded with troops and supplies in both the first and second attacks.

The enemy transport ships attempted to reinforce Magas Island with troops and supplies. Before they could land, the Japanese Navy Air Force attacked them twice and annihilated 75% of their attacking ships, as described above.

First Attack

Troop Dispatch Sunk Destroyed

Large Transport Ships 2 2
Special Transport Ships or Medium Transport Ships 7 4 or 5
Cruisers or Large Destroyers 2 2
Destroyers or Submarine Chasers and Landing Craft 2 1 Many

Second Attack

Special Transport Ships 3 2
Submarine Chasers 2 1
Sea-going Barges 4
Destroyers 1 1
Landing Craft 40+ Approximately 30 Many
Torpedo Boats Unknown 2

It is a true counterattack. Some say that the large transport ship is the bridgehead of Magas Cape, totaling 64 or more. It is not for capturing Rabaul, which is merely a foothold. The enemy attempted to land at Magas Cape, about 400 kilometers west of Rabaul on New Britain Island, which is a Japanese strategic point. The Japanese Navy Air Force attacked the enemy fleet three times, sinking nearly 90% of its ships before they could land. According to local special dispatches, around the new battlefield near Magas Cape, the enemy's landing point, the Japanese garrison launched a three-dimensional fierce battle in the land, sea, and air, bombing Magas Cape, as well as the enemy positions on Irawe Island and Arawe Island. On the 19th and 20th, approximately 90 enemy aircraft attacked Rabaul. At dawn on the 20th, Japanese naval aircraft simultaneously attacked the enemy airfields at Buna, Gona, and Trobu Islands, intensifying the southern strategic line. On December 21st, the enemy, attempting to replenish reinforcements, appeared in force in the waters off Magas Cape. The Japanese naval aircraft launched successive fierce attacks in the first and second waves. Of the 64 ships in the fleet, 48 were sunk or destroyed, approximately 75%. The troops and supplies on board sank to the bottom of the sea.

The fact that the enemy transport fleet attacking the sea off Magas Cape suffered such heavy losses twice demonstrates that within the Japanese air power sphere, enemy maritime supply cannot but pay a great price.

Enemy propaganda claims that the attacks on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands are a prelude to a major counterattack. The enemy's purpose in Magas Cape is to advance an air base, with the intention of capturing the Japanese defense line, which is a large-scale operation, progressing simultaneously with the invasion from the Solomon Islands, clearly with a pincer attack strategy.

The power of the Japanese defense line, as seen in this announcement, overwhelms the enemy. At Torokina Cape on Bougainville Island, southeast of Rabaul, the enemy has completed the construction of an airfield, but according to local telegrams, the Japanese naval aircraft have also attacked it and achieved results.

### Approved Retention of Yarn and Cloth for Sale in the Market Next Year, with Profits Not Exceeding 20%

Central News Agency Report – According to sources from the Bureau of Commerce and Trade Control, the matter of exempting interweaving fabrics from the purchase of cotton cloth was originally handled in accordance with the National Purchase Method, and it had been submitted to the Executive Yuan for approval and record.

### Siren Installations Completed in Hongkou and Yangshupu Districts, Japanese Naval Landing Forces Issue Statement

Central News Agency Report – The Japanese Shanghai Special Naval Landing Forces, in order to block enemy subversive elements attempting to disrupt Shanghai's security and to enhance Shanghai's construction, have installed general-purpose emergency alarm sirens in the guarded Hongkou and Yangshupu districts. On the 28th, the unit authorities issued a statement, hoping for full cooperation from the general public. Historically, the terror alarm sirens were installed in the former concession area south of the Suzhou Creek, which had a significant effect. However, in view of the decisive battle period and the increasing urgency of ensuring Shanghai's security, with the spontaneous cooperation of the Japanese residents, the Republic of China residents, the naval community, the Japanese Theater Association, and the telephone company, active efforts were made to complete the installations in the Hongkou district south of Yokohama Bridge and the Yangshupu district. The sounding method involves cutting off traffic and sounding a long siren for approximately two minutes. To signal the all-clear, short sirens (approximately ten seconds) are sounded, with intervals of approximately five seconds, repeated three times. In the future, if terror attacks or other incidents occur, sirens will be sounded simultaneously throughout Shanghai, creating a tightly woven security net to block the actions of subversive elements. However, the alarm sirens are solely for post-incident measures. Therefore, all Shanghai citizens, regardless of Chinese, Japanese, or foreign nationality, should pay attention to their surroundings to prevent incidents from occurring, in order to complete self-defense and other security services.

Statement by the Japanese Special Naval Landing Forces Authorities

During the current Greater East Asia War, Shanghai occupies a crucial position militarily and economically. Ensuring Shanghai's security is currently a top priority. On this point, the military and police authorities must make efforts, and it is no exaggeration to say that enhancing the self-defense capabilities of the general public residing in Shanghai is sufficient to block the instigation of enemy agents. Therefore, all residents of Shanghai, regardless of Japanese, Chinese, or foreign nationality, are urged not only to prevent personal danger but also to provide maximum cooperation in the discovery and arrest of unscrupulous elements. With the cooperation of various parties, our security authorities have specifically installed general-purpose emergency alarm sirens and air raid sirens in the Hongkou and Yangshupu districts. In the event of terror attacks and other ground incidents, the alarm sirens will be used to improve security. As for the measures that self-defense corps members and the general public should take in the event of an emergency, they should be handled as described below:

In the event of a terror attack or other incident, cooperate promptly with nearby residents, make efforts to arrest the perpetrators or prevent the situation from escalating. At the same time, quickly report to the landing forces, military police, or police authorities. The emergency telephone numbers of the various security authorities must be posted near residences and other telephone locations.

If it is deemed necessary, sound the emergency alarm sirens immediately and cut off traffic. In such cases, self-defense corps members must cooperate with the security authorities and take decisive actions to fulfill their mission. That is, the passage of the general public, except for military and police personnel, is completely prohibited. It should be known that cutting off traffic is crucial for arresting perpetrators or preventing the escalation of incidents.

If the perpetrators are not apprehended, identify their escape direction, characteristics, and clothing, and report them to the authorities as soon as possible. Furthermore, do not enter the scene of the incident, and pay attention.

Economic Commentary

### Increasing Transportation Capacity

To adapt to the needs of the wartime economic system, it is necessary to actively increase production on the one hand, and to facilitate the smooth exchange of materials on the other. Otherwise, it is like increasing the blood in the human body, but the circulation of blood vessels is not smooth, so it is futile to replenish blood every day. Transportation is the blood vessel for promoting the smooth exchange of materials, and the ways to increase transportation capacity are nothing more than increasing railway freight cars, opening up highways, using trucks to subsidize transportation, and using waterways to implement sailboat transportation, as recently expressed by Gu Rugeng, a member of the National Economic Commission, when he arrived in Beijing from Pingdi. Hong Kong can be a clear example of implementing sailboat transportation, and Chongqing is the most active in using trucks to subsidize transportation. As for increasing railway freight cars, it is easiest to promote in Central and North China because it is where the main railway lines of China are located.

On the one hand, we see the lack of fuel in Central China and the increase in coal production in North China (for example, the original Baojin and other coal mining companies in Shanxi have now merged into Shanxi Coal Company, and its production is expected to increase to 4 million tons next year). On the other hand, we see the shortage of raw cotton in North China and the promotion of cotton production in Central China (for example, cotton production management areas have been established in Nanjing, Shanghai, and Northern Jiangsu, and this year it is estimated that more than 1,200 dan of cotton seeds will be promoted, and more than 11,000 mu of cotton fields will be developed). It is even more important that the exchange of materials between the North and the South must be actively promoted in the future, and that increasing railway transport vehicles to increase the volume of transport of goods between the North and the South is a major issue that must be resolved simultaneously with increasing production. Now, the Central China Railway Company has elected Mr. Zheng Hongnian, a veteran of the transportation industry in our country, as its president, and all parties have great expectations. We believe that in the future, in addition to strengthening the passenger transportation capacity as much as possible according to the results of the joint discussion between the Ministry of Construction and relevant parties on the order of the Shanghai North Railway Station, the Central China Railway Company will also actively increase the number of railway freight vehicles to ensure the smooth flow of freight.

### Bank of Communications Decides to Expand Rural Lending

In order to regulate the rural economy, the Bank of Communications was ordered to handle strict lending.

In May of this year, it established the Agricultural Economy Department. Based on the results of the investigation, since actively handling agricultural loans, applications for loans have reached more than 70 million yuan, and those approved for issuance totaled more than 50 million yuan. In order to expand its agricultural lending business, in addition to cooperating with various banks in agricultural lending, the bank also plans to set a target of 20 million yuan for agricultural lending next spring, universally and widely expanding lending to meet the grand goal of assisting rural production increase. It is reported that loans are divided into 30 types in four major categories: agricultural production increase loans, agricultural warehouse loans, land finance loans, and rural fishery and livestock loans.

### Hua Stocks Stop Falling and Rise: Real Estate Stocks Are the Most Strong

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, translated by Hong Yang

Youth (5)

Mr. Ogata changed his tone as he said this.

"The war is over, and although our army has won a great victory, no one understands how the enemy's powder keg exploded... The gunpowder at that time was different from the gunpowder now. It does not explode at the slightest touch. Unless intentionally lit, it will not explode easily."

"Although the reason is not clear. The enemy would never light their own gunpowder. Gentlemen... I want you to think, who lit it?"

He asked from the podium. The students who were attracted by the story were just breathing silently.

"It is said that this was done by the fox fairies."

Mr. Ogata pretended to be surprised. Of course, the first-year middle school students of Showa 7 did not believe such a thing.

"It is said that it was done by three fox fairies. General Yoshihiro certainly saw two red fox fairies and one white fox fairy fly from the city to the enemy camp. Soon after, there was a big explosion.

Gentlemen, you all know that the guardian deity of the Shimadzu family is Inari, and the shrine is in Inari-cho. If you go to Shuseikan, you can see Lord's golden fox helmet. In the Battle of Sacheon, Inari also showed assistance in battle - everyone believed it to be true."

However, that was propaganda. Not foxes - it was three brave and loyal young warriors who penetrated the enemy lines, used themselves as human bombs, set fire to the powder keg, and blew themselves up together. These three heroes were Setoguchi, Satake, and Ichiki - among them, especially Setoguchi Shichiro, was only nineteen years old. Why was such a heroic deed advertised as the merit of foxes? Because at that time, the interests of the entire army were more important than personal merit. If the gods bless us, wouldn't the morale of the entire army increase a hundredfold? Even Lord Hiro himself may not have known that it was not the merit of the white foxes and red foxes, but the work of a warrior wearing a white cloth headband, and two warriors wearing red cloth headbands. Perhaps he said so deliberately! I am afraid that the souls of the three heroes are also willing to sacrifice themselves for the benefit of the entire army, rather than passing on their personal bravery to future generations. The samurai spirit at that time was really like that.

"Gentlemen, please remember the story of the Sacheon Shin-zai Three Heroes, which is no less than the Miao Hangzhen Three Heroes. Do not forget that the three human bomb heroes of the past came from our birthplace. Setoguchi Shichiro, for example, is from the vicinity of this school - the village of Shimoarata!"

Hearing Shimoarata, Makoto and Sachio slightly swallowed their saliva and stared at the teacher's face.
