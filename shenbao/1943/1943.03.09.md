### The Power to Secure National Stability

"The people are the root of the nation" – this is the core of all political theories of our country’s historical politicians. Therefore, "governing lies in winning the people." We have repeatedly said this to awaken the special attention of the authorities. But further, among all the people, which class is the main stabilizing force of our country? We know that the important stabilizing forces of modern powers are financial capital, industrial capital, and a large number of laborers. As for us, everyone knows that we "establish the nation on agriculture," and the vast majority are farmers. Then, the stabilizing force of our country should naturally be the majority of farmers. However, they do not yet play a decisive role in the fate of the country like the capitalists and laborers of the powers. In our country, there are no modern large capitalists, and there is a lack of laborers with decisive power over the country. Although the number of farmers is large, the universal phenomenon is lack of knowledge and organization, so there is no significant power. Therefore, the middle class, especially the progressive elements in the middle class, has the power to influence social and political trends. Moreover, in our country's traditional habits, politics and education are not separated. "One excels in learning and then serves as an official, and one excels as an official and then learns." Therefore, most of those in power are the intellectual class, that is, the middle class or middle-level elements in society. These people can not only influence the social and political atmosphere, but also occupy the most advanced leading position in national culture. The dynamics of the vast number of farmers follow them. Because there are extremely many illiterate people in our country, the ancient teaching of "the wind over the grass must bend" still has a practical effect. The habits, trends, and even hobbies of the general public follow the habits, trends, and hobbies of the middle class. Therefore, the middle class occupies a leading position in our society. Whether our society, politics, and culture can progress depends on the middle class or middle-level elements.

This important stabilizing force or leading class in our society includes school teachers and staff, low- and mid-level civil servants, people engaged in legitimate industry and commerce, and free professionals such as doctors, lawyers, technicians, journalists, and cultural figures. However, we must admit that for more than five years since the Incident, it is precisely these people who have suffered the most from the wartime economic situation. Experts in any field cannot but admit that, besides the working and peasant classes, the middle class, especially intellectuals or white-collar workers, suffers the most from the current high prices. Although the number of intellectuals is not large, leaders generally ridicule them by saying, "Scholars rebel and will not succeed in three years." However, in fact, given their important position in Chinese society, politics, and culture as mentioned above, the immense damage they suffer will inevitably affect the country and society. In wartime, everyone should endure hardship and abolish luxurious habits. However, the vast majority of the middle-level elements in our country have already lowered their living standards, to the point of affecting the health and spirit of their whole family, as well as their personal career and work efficiency. If this only harms them personally and their families and even their children, it is not very important. In a great era, it is right to sacrifice oneself and everything one owns for the country and the nation. However, the focus of the current problem is that the entire middle class, especially intellectuals, who have historically been the backbone of Chinese society, an important stabilizing force in society, and have always led society, may be completely on the verge of decline. To what extent this will cause loss and harm to the nation during wartime and after the war is a matter worthy of serious attention.

High prices and difficult living conditions are inevitable phenomena in wartime. However, if the damage of the wartime economy is only concentrated on an absolutely small number of people in the whole country, those with better knowledge, higher technical levels, and more complete and correct national and nationalistic ideas, thereby disrupting the normal order of the entire society and damaging the most powerful backbone force and important leading class of the country, then it should be called upon the entire country to quickly correct it. For the sake of implementing wartime policies and even more for the sake of post-war national construction, after calling for an improvement in the lives of civil servants, we sincerely call for supporting the middle class—middle-level elements, especially intellectuals—who are the important stabilizing force of the nation.

Commentary and Translation

### German-Italian Talks and Neutral Countries

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, representing Reich Chancellor Hitler, went to Rome and met with Italian Prime Minister Mussolini and others a total of four times. Regarding the Eastern Front, the recent battle of Tunisia, the major reorganization of the Italian cabinet a few days ago and the refreshing of the diplomatic ranks, as well as various military, political and economic issues between the two allied countries, the heads of the two countries gathered to discuss many things. As a result of the Rome talks, it was "confirmed that the Axis Powers (Germany and Italy) have the solid support of Japan and other allied countries, and have reached a complete consensus on ensuring the success of joint operations."

We have no doubt about the determination of Germany and Italy to fight with one heart in Europe and devote all their efforts until the final victory is achieved. It is really necessary to repeatedly clarify this point internally and externally in response to the enemy countries' malicious attempts to create discord. The positive cooperation between Germany and Italy in military and economic matters has been proven by significant facts, and no matter how the enemy countries incite propaganda, they will ultimately not be able to drive a wedge between Germany and Italy.

In addition to the strong unity of Germany and Italy in Europe, it is necessary to require France, Spain, and other Balkan countries to cooperate closely with the Axis countries during the current wartime and after the end of the war. The Rome talks "reiterated the determination of Germany and Italy to promote the activities of people of all countries in the Great European Sphere, protect mutual interests, preserve the survival of people of all European countries, and build a new order in Europe." This is vastly different from the Atlantic Charter that the United Kingdom and the United States boast about. If European countries cooperate openly and closely, the realization of a new order in Europe can be expected soon. Now, if the neutral countries only cooperate in the new order after the war, they will not be able to enjoy its rights. Therefore, for the sake of the future welfare of the whole, all countries should cooperate with Germany and Italy to the best of their ability during the war. Mere inner sympathy and empty promises of assistance are definitely not the attitude that should be taken to participate in the great cause of restoring Europe, which is easy to know but difficult to do, and to share a piece of the pie. On this point, it is hoped that Germany and Italy should step up their activities in politics and diplomacy. (Translated by Xiang from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun, March 4th)

### Nanjing to Hold Joint Sino-Japanese Offensive and Defensive Exercises Tomorrow; Celebrating Japanese Army Memorial Day

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) - The 10th of this month is Japanese Army Memorial Day. Recalling thirty-eight years ago, on this day, our friendly country Japan defeated Russia in the great Battle of Mukden in Manchuria, marking the beginning of the war of liberation for East Asia. Since then, the awareness of self-consciousness among East Asian nations has grown day by day. Therefore, the launch of the Greater East Asia War two years ago was in fact a continuation of this spirit. Now that our country is participating in the Greater East Asia War and fighting side by side with friendly countries, this year's friendly army anniversary has historical significance. For this reason, the Nanjing Japanese Army Air Defense Headquarters will hold a large-scale joint Sino-Japanese land-air offensive and defensive exercise on the morning of this day, inviting more than 1,000 students from our country's military academies to participate, and inviting senior Chinese and Japanese officers, representatives of the military and civilians, students, and members of youth groups to visit. Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States, China and Japan have fought side by side with the spirit of sharing weal and woe and the determination to live and die together under the goal of defending East Asia, thoroughly destroying Britain and the United States, and we are firmly confident of this. The foundation of this confidence was laid thirty-eight years ago. Therefore, Japanese Army Memorial Day is the first cry for the liberation of East Asia. It is not only a glorious memorial day for friendly countries, but also a glorious memorial day for the entire East Asia.

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese troops stationed in Nanjing will hold a live-fire offensive and defensive exercise at 9:30 am on the 10th, the 38th Japanese Army Memorial Day, to show their enthusiastic celebration. The air force will also assist in combat at the same time.

### Japanese Army Destroys Chongqing Communist Forces in Shanxi Province in February: Battle Situation

Taiyuan, 8th (Central News Agency) The Japanese army continues to carry out punitive expeditions in Shanxi. On February 10th, it launched a fierce attack on Wu Zhongliu's troops of the Chongqing army, who were holding the Zhongtiao Mountains in southern Shanxi, and annihilated them. On the 23rd, after annihilating the Chongqing army in a certain area, it also defeated the Chongqing army near Sanjiao Village in southwest Xinjiang, inflicting a great blow to the Chongqing army in southern Jin and completely stopping its unrest.

### National Government Proclamation

At the beginning of the Greater East Asia War on December 8th two years ago, the National Government, in accordance with the spirit of the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty, declared its determination to share weal and woe with our friendly nation, Japan. Since then, we have embarked on a new national movement, committed to ensuring public order and improving people's livelihoods, with the aim of increasing national strength and assisting in the completion of the Greater East Asia War. However, Britain, the United States, and other countries continue to use their century-old policy of dividing East Asia, and they have intensified their efforts, even colluding with Chongqing elements to participate in the so-called Anglo-American front and send troops to Burma and India to slaughter East Asians. Recently, as their violence has been gradually defeated by the friendly Japanese Army and Navy, and their bases for aggression in East Asia have also been lost, they have become even more cunning. They are jealous of the peaceful development of the National Government's ruling area, inciting Chongqing elements to constantly harass it in order to hinder the progress of various constructions, and even using their own aircraft, using Chongqing as a base, to repeatedly bomb Wuhan, Guangzhou, and other places, killing civilians. The Chongqing elements are willing to be driven by Britain and the United States, acting as traitors to East Asia, which is shameful. Britain and the United States have been scheming against East Asia for a long time, doing everything they can to sow discord in order to achieve their ultimate desire for annexation, which East Asian nations should fight against with the same hatred. The National Government hereby declares that from today onwards, it is in a state of war with Britain and the United States and will do its best to cooperate with our friendly nation Japan to sweep away the tyranny of Britain and the United States in order to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. The nations of Manchukuo and Thailand have always maintained friendly relations and share a common desire for East Asian prosperity. In the future, we should strengthen cooperation to jointly build a new East Asian order based on morality. The friendly nations of Germany and Italy have been dealing with British and American forces in the West for several years and have repeatedly won glorious victories. Our country is now participating in the Greater East Asia War and will echo each other in order to contribute to a just new order for the entire world. All our people should know that this is the only opportunity to realize the Great Asianism of our National Father. The revival of the Republic of China, the realization of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, and the achievement of justice, peace, and the integrity of the world all depend on this. Let us work together with one heart and one mind from beginning to end to carry out this great mission of this great era!

### Nanjing Economic Bureau Chief Discusses Measures to Suppress Price Increases

Nanjing, 8th (Central News Agency) Various daily necessities in the capital have recently seen another surge in prices, and underground markets are rampant, greatly affecting the lives of citizens. Yesterday, a reporter from the Central News Agency interviewed Lin Dazhong, the Director of the Nanjing Municipal Economic Bureau, to inquire about measures to suppress price increases and crack down on the black market. According to him, the Bureau is paying close attention to this issue. Considering that in order to suppress price increases and bring commerce back on track, the first step must be to reorganize the various trade associations in the city to make the association organization sound and have people in charge so that the method of material distribution can be carried out smoothly. Merchants can comply with the official price limits set by the authorities, and black market transactions can be eliminated invisibly. After the first step is completed, the first step of the plan will be implemented, such as increasing production. In short, I will do my best to ensure that merchants, under the guidance and cooperation of the government, strive to stabilize prices.

### Chongqing Asks Britain and the United States to Increase Aid

Guangzhou, 8th (Central News Agency) According to Kangqing sources, Chongqing is recently using every problem as an excuse to ask Britain and the United States to strengthen aid to Chongqing. Therefore, it is very concerned about the aid to Chongqing cases currently being discussed in the British House of Commons. A spokesperson for Chongqing explained to a press corps on the 7th that what Chongqing most hopes for from British aid is that Britain will attack Burma from India. It was generally said that if Britain and the United States want to retake Burma, then sending hundreds of planes to Chongqing is an urgent matter. If Chongqing and Britain are fully prepared, and start joint operations from Assam and Yunnan at the same time, it is possible to succeed. In addition, the Chongqing "Ministry of Foreign Affairs" newspaper "National Daily" also called on Britain and the United States to urgently aid Chongqing in an editorial on the 6th, generally saying, "We hope that Britain can work with the United States to solve the difficulties of aiding Chongqing materials.

### The Content of the German-Italian Talks: Strengthening the European Anti-Communist Front; Consolidating the Axis Unity

German Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, representing President Hitler, arrived in Rome on February 24th. He met with Prime Minister Mussolini four times to comprehensively review the current situation in Europe. Both sides reached an agreement on the common measures to advance the war and he departed for Germany on the 28th.

The German Deputy Chief of Staff and the Italian Chief of Staff also attended the meetings on behalf of their respective military departments.

Mr. Ribbentrop's decision to visit Italy had three purposes: political, military, and economic. He aimed to study common measures between the two countries and review new strategies for advancing the war. Although the specific details remain unknown, based on the current situation, the following points can be inferred:

(1) To counter the political demonstrations by the Allied powers following the Casablanca Conference. The recent German counter-offensives on the Eastern Front and the new operations in central Tunisia, along with the victories of the Axis submarines, have objectively caused panic among the British and Americans. The Allies have miscalculated the timing of opening a second front in Europe. Germany and Italy are taking this opportunity to discuss ways to eliminate the Anglo-American encirclement of Europe, reviewing all political and military options. At the same time, they will agree to strengthen the European anti-communist front in order to cope with the overall European situation created by the Soviet winter counter-offensive.

(2) To ascertain Italy's attitude towards France in order to promote cooperation between France and the Axis powers.

(3) To utilize Italy's abundant human resources, especially labor, and to strengthen the flow of materials between the Axis powers and their allies.

(4) To jointly study how to counter the Anglo-American strategic warfare led by the Vatican, and to formulate countermeasures in advance. Furthermore, in order to prevent the crisis of the entire European continent turning red, it is necessary to align the humanitarianism and traditional anti-communism of the Vatican with the anti-communist and anti-Semitic stance advocated by the Axis powers in the war.

In summary, this meeting has further strengthened the unified relationship between Germany and Italy, which will surely consolidate the situation for the decisive battle. Regarding the second point we speculated above, it is rumored that the conditions proposed by the Italian side were quite severe. Foreign Minister Ribbentrop does not have the authority to make a decision on this matter, and it must be resolved through direct negotiations between President Hitler and Prime Minister Mussolini. Therefore, it is expected that a meeting between the two leaders may take place soon. (Yun Peng: Translated from a Rome dispatch from the Mainichi Shimbun on March 3rd)

### Sandstorms Rage in Southern Tunisia; Two Armies Engage in Battle; Axis Forces Occupy Cape Sella in the North; Allied Forces in the Center Approach Gafsa

Lisbon, 8th, Allied News Agency: According to news received here from North Africa, Axis forces on the Tunisian front, responding to friendly forces on the northern front, have launched a large-scale offensive on the southern front since the 6th. The battle situation on the 7th is as follows:

In the north, Axis forces occupied Settnan on the 6th and continued to pursue the British First Army. On the 7th, they occupied Cape Sella, a key point on the Mediterranean coast northeast of Dameira. British forces are now regrouping in the Dameira area, attempting to stop the Axis advance. In the center, Allied forces launched counter-offensives in various locations. On the 7th, they launched a large-scale offensive in the Ussel Gabès area in the Mejez el Bab region. Although they briefly penetrated Axis positions, they were completely repelled after a fierce Axis counter-offensive. It is reported that Allied forces in the Gafsa area have approached a point two miles from Gafsa. In the south, Rommel's army has launched a major offensive since the 6th, intensifying the fighting on the southern front. On the 7th, a sudden sandstorm arose in the area, and the two armies engaged in a fierce battle amidst the heavy dust.

Lisbon, 8th, Allied News Agency: According to a Berlin report, the Tunisian battle is currently being conducted in two parts, north and south. In the south, General Rommel's Afrika Korps is fighting against General Montgomery's Eighth Army. It is reported that German motorized units have penetrated British positions. An Allied Supreme Headquarters correspondent with Reuters reports that the German forces advanced against the southern flank of the British forces before 7:00 AM on Saturday. An hour later, the Axis forces launched an attack from the Mareth Line, resulting in a frontal battle. An American radio reporter in Algiers stated yesterday that the German commander has reorganized his troops in southern Tunisia in preparation for another attack. "Our Supreme Headquarters is well aware that this German attack is a genuine offensive. Rommel is now planning to defeat the Eighth Army with a large number of armored vehicles. The decisive battle in Africa has begun." In northern Tunisia, General Arnim's forces are fighting against General Anderson's First Army. German forces occupied Cape Sella on Saturday. There is no major battle in central Tunisia. According to a Reuters correspondent, the area is densely filled with mines and traps. A US Army engineer told the reporter that the Axis forces had planted mines as densely as radishes, making removal quite difficult.

Geneva, Switzerland, 7th, Havas Agency: According to a battle report released by the command of the Free French Forces in North Africa, Axis patrols are very active in the Ousseltia Plain area, but they have been repelled. Allied forces in the center are currently advancing towards Gafsa. Gafsa is located on the railway to Sfax, which was recently occupied by the Axis forces. According to the latest news, the battle is taking place about two miles from Gafsa and is still in progress. Allied paratroopers have blown up a section of the railway from Gafsa to Sfax. In addition, the Germans announced that the Axis air force is very active on the Tunisian front. A squadron of Allied tanks was repelled in Medenine. In aerial combat, German aircraft shot down a total of seventeen British and American aircraft, and Italian aircraft shot down five. Several other British and American aircraft were destroyed at the airport.

### German Army Deploys Blitz Divisions; Hopes to Achieve a Surprise Victory

Berlin, 8th, Haitong News Agency: Axis armored reconnaissance vehicles penetrated deep into the concentration areas of the British Eighth Army on Saturday, obtained important intelligence and returned. German dive bombers and high-speed fighters successfully covered the reconnaissance operations of ground forces, defeating British tanks and motorized units gathered at Medenine and Métouia. The British suffered the loss of nine tanks and sixty other vehicles. Cape Sella on the northern section of the Tunisian front has been occupied by Axis forces. This location is situated one kilometer west of Bizerte. The British abandoned several tanks, trucks, and anti-tank guns when they hastily withdrew from the area. The British force's offensive against Medjez el Bab has been repelled by the Axis counter-offensive. The army was nearly annihilated. A small number of remaining enemy troops have retreated into the mountains. Enemy forces also launched attacks in the Ousseltia and Pichon areas, but were unsuccessful.

Geneva, Switzerland, 7th, Havas Agency: According to a battle report released by Allied forces in North Africa, Axis forces launched two full-scale attacks in an attempt to break through the British Eighth Army's Mareth Line. The first attack began before dawn on Saturday (the 6th). General Rommel sent armored units from the northeast of Touggene to attack the southern flank of Montgomery's forces. An hour later, Axis blitz units launched a frontal attack on the Mareth Line. However, the fighting subsided around 10:30 AM because the Axis forces failed to achieve a surprise victory. Both attacks were stopped by the British forces. Some of the Italian blitz divisions participating in the Mareth Line battle were drawn from Pichon and Sidi Bouzid. The fighting on the central and northern fronts has stalled.

### General Overview of Important Industries in Japan (2)

Non-ferrous metal industries are crucial during wartime. So we should remove every difficulty and make all-out efforts to increase production of airplanes. Airplanes industry’s basic materials are aluminum and magnesium. Those belong to light metal industries. Currently the scale and structure of Japan’s light metal industries are approximately as follows:

There are two kinds of raw materials for Aluminum. One kind is shale which contains abundant of soil buried in Manchuria and North China, also alums in Korea. The other kind is refined aluminum from Malay and other Southeast Asia areas. The first kind of raw material has very little content of Aluminum and has a lot of impurities. Compared to refined aluminum, it is technically inferior and less cost effective. The five main companies in the industry are Showa Denko, Sumitomo Aluminum, Japan Aluminum, Japan Light Metal, and Japan Soda. Each company manufactures aluminum using refined aluminum as raw material. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the assets of the United Kingdom and the Netherlands were frozen, completely cutting off the import of refined aluminum. Thus, domestic raw materials were used as a substitute. As a result of the Greater East Asia War, the highest quality and best characteristics in the world - the refined aluminum of the East Indies and Malaya - came entirely under Japan's control. After obtaining this treasure, the aluminum industry found a water source in the desert, establishing an absolutely unbeatable foundation on the raw material of refined aluminum.

Currently, there are 〇 aluminum manufacturing companies in Japan, excluding Manchuria. The Imperial Light Metal Control Company is responsible for unified distribution control. As the importance of the aluminum industry increased with the progress of the Greater East Asia War, the need for a high degree of unified control arose. As a result, the Light Metal Control Association was established on September 1st of last year based on the Important Industries Group Order. The officers of the Control Association:

Chairman: Atsushi Oya (Former Chairman of Sumitomo Aluminum). Managing Director: Sanzuro Kosobe (Former Managing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Director and General Affairs Manager: Daisuke Naka (Former Director of the Fuel Bureau of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). Planning Manager: Harunosuke Miyano (Former Managing Director of Nichiman Aluminum). Aluminum Production Manager: Tsuguji Aose (Former Director of Japan Aluminum). Magnesium Production Manager: Otokoma Shimada (Former Managing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Distribution Manager: Shoichi Shinohara (Standing Director of Imperial Light Metal). Inspection Manager: Toku Takayama (Former Head of the Dispatch Section of Japan Light Metal). Technical Manager: Seiichi Sugimura (Former Director of Imperial Light Metal). Korean Branch Manager: Masao Uchino (Former Consignee of the Ministry of Commerce and Industry). Toyozo Fukuhara (Director of Imperial Light Metal). Kiyoshi Noda (Same).

The officers of the Control Association are composed of representatives from the above five important companies, and the Imperial Light Metal Company provides economic support. To integrate with the Control Association, Chairman Oya remains Chairman of the Imperial Light Metal Company, and three directors of the company also serve as directors of the Control Association, in order to achieve unified control of the production and distribution aspects through personal connections.

Chairman Oya is from Ibaraki Prefecture, and is 59 years old this year. He graduated from the Electrical Engineering Department of Tokyo University in Meiji 43. He worked at the Ministry of Communications for several years. In Taisho 7, he transferred to Sumitomo Headquarters, and in April of Showa 15, he became a Managing Director of the company. From Showa 16, he successively served as Chairman of Sumitomo Aluminum Smelting, President of Sumitomo Chemical, and President of Imperial Light Metal. He assumed the position of Chairman of the Control Association in September of last year, and continues in that role today.

Mr. Oya received a special award during his studies at Tokyo University. He is intelligent and thoroughly researches the truth of things with a scholarly attitude. He is very diligent in his work and has devoted all his energy to increasing the production of light metals, earning the trust of people in the industry.

As mentioned above, the control of the aluminum industry is based on the Important Industries Group Order, and a Control Association is established. For important manufacturing factories, the Ministry of Commerce and Industry manages them directly based on the Factory Business Management Act of June last year. The Minister of Commerce and Industry directs and supervises the owners of various aluminum production factories. At the same time, management officials are dispatched to each factory and business site to thoroughly investigate and study the operational status of labor, materials, and power, and cooperate with the factory director to streamline operations. If obstacles are found, the Control Association and the Ministry of Commerce and Industry will consult and resolve them. For example, 〇〇 factory has been able to operate smoothly thanks to the active efforts of the management officials. Therefore, people in the industry greatly welcome the deployment of management officials. This may lead to the expansion of the management system in the future development of wartime economy.

The United States' goal for this year's aircraft production is 10,000 aircraft per month, so they are working hard to expand the aluminum industry. Japan's measures to increase production to meet this year's decisive battle posture are: first, although the abundant refined aluminum from the South can be secured, under the current circumstances, due to restrictions on shipping and other transportation, only domestic raw materials, which are technically and economically less favorable, can be used to produce aluminum.

Nichiman Aluminum, Korean Riken Metal, and Nitto already use alumina shale to produce aluminum. This time, the Chemical Research Institute succeeded in using alunite from Mt. Amagi to produce aluminum. The large-scale use of domestic raw materials is noteworthy.

Second, maximize the use of existing equipment. New construction and expansion require time and resources, which are not available in the decisive battle stage. Therefore, only existing equipment can be utilized as much as possible to maximize its effectiveness. The Industrial Equipment Corporation will supply spare materials for repairs and supplements. How to improve the imbalance between the electrolytic capacity of aluminum and the manufacturing capacity of aluminum is also an urgent matter that requires comprehensive countermeasures.

Third, is the issue of technical exchange. The aluminum manufacturing industry requires a high level of expertise. It is very important to improve quality through technical exchange. Therefore, the Control Association has recruited leading technicians in the industry to join the Technical Cooperation Committee for careful joint research. The first publicly recognized and widely adopted technology by various companies is a type of non-calcination method for processing refined aluminum at the Yokohama Factory of Showa Electric Industries. When producing aluminum from refined aluminum, the refined aluminum is usually calcined to remove its combined water. The refined aluminum produced in Johor, Penang, Borneo and other parts of Southeast Asia contains about 30% combined water. Aluminum is difficult to dissolve unless it is melted and calcined. Now, without the calcination method, it is possible to save 〇〇 million tons of coal when processing one million tons of ore per year. In addition, it can save materials used for calcination, while aluminum production can increase by 20% to 30%. Therefore, this method is an excellent technology that achieves three benefits at once.

Japan Soda has also adopted a part of this method. Nippon Light Metal is also making various preparations to adopt this method. If all other factories adopt this method, a landmark effect can be achieved in increasing aluminum production.

Finally, the tendency that the aluminum manufacturing industry should pay attention to is the plan for various companies to enter Korea. The aluminum manufacturing industry requires a large amount of electricity, so future expansion will inevitably take place in Korea and Manchuria. Showa Denko and Sumitomo Aluminum Industries have been in communication with relevant authorities and are now preparing to enter Korea. This, along with Nippon Light Metal's plan to enter Taiwan, is the second expansion of production capacity in the country's long-term plan. It is a necessary condition for establishing the Greater East Asia defense posture.

Magnesium has a lighter specific gravity than aluminum, and its alloys have strong resistance to impact. Therefore, it is an absolutely necessary material for aircraft landing wheels and an indispensable raw material for manufacturing incendiary bombs and flares. With the progress of the war, the production of magnesium must also be increased dramatically. Currently, there are ten magnesium production companies in Japan: Japan Magnesium, Japan Magnesium Metal, Toyo Metal, Okura Mining, Asahi Denka, Kanto Denka, Toa Light Metal, Mitsubishi Magnesium, Shin-Etsu Chemical, and Riken Metal. The raw materials for manufacturing are bittern, a by-product produced during salt production, and magnesite, which is abundant in Korea and Manchuria. The scale of operation is small, and the magnesium manufacturing technology is kept strictly secret by various countries around the world. Therefore, it is about ten years behind the aluminum manufacturing industry, and the production cost is also not very high. The above-mentioned Control Association controls and adjusts its appropriate selling price. To promote the increase in production, the scale of operation is increased to an appropriate level. The first measure implemented was to merge the magnesium manufacturing division of Okura Sangyo with Toa Light Metal to establish the Imperial Magnesium Manufacturing Company. The new company is currently preparing to be established. In the future, the enterprises in the magnesium manufacturing industry will be adjusted one by one.

The above-mentioned new company's magnesium manufacturing method involves mixing limestone with seawater to create magnesium hydroxide. Magnesium is then produced from magnesium hydroxide. This is Japan's most primitive method. Even though the deposits of magnesite in Korea and Manchuria are abundant, the current transportation restrictions make it absolutely advantageous to use easily obtainable seawater as a raw material as a measure to increase production. The Control Association is currently encouraging magnesium manufacturing companies in the mainland to adopt this method. This is a noteworthy trend in preparing the magnesium manufacturing industry for the decisive battle posture. (Sho: Translated from the Tokyo Asahi Shimbun on March 1st)

### U.S. Actively Expanding Military Armaments

— Di Ling

(1) Military Expansion Before Entering the War

The United States formally prepared for war more than a year and a half before the Greater East Asia War, around the early summer of 1940. By May 1940, the disastrous defeat of Britain and France against the Axis powers in Western Europe was a foregone conclusion. The humiliating defeat of British imperialism not only caused American imperialism to feel a "fox mourning its kind," but also threatened its ambition to dominate Europe, as well as its activities in the Mediterranean and West Asia. Under these concerns, the policy of aiding Britain was decided, and the plan for military expansion was launched. As a result, American finances experienced astonishing inflation. The military expenditure for the 1940-41 fiscal year was originally budgeted at $1.539 billion, but the actual expenditure was $6.463 billion. The military expenditure accounted for 18.2% of the total expenditure in the original budget, but rose to 48.9%. The increase in military expenditure was due to an increase of $3.8 billion in the 1940-41 expenditure over the previous year's $12.7 billion. The above figures are actual expenditures. The military expenditure alone passed by Congress from May to October 1940, within half a year, reached eight times the original budget, amounting to $12.699 billion.

In the summer of 1940, Britain encountered a German counter-blockade and became even more isolated. As a result, the export of military supplies from the United States to Britain began and increased. In August 1940, a new record appeared, with exports to Britain accounting for 85% of the total exports of the United States. In 1940, American exports to Britain amounted to $1.1 billion, an increase of 93.7% compared to the pre-war year of 1938. At the end of 1940, Britain again became insolvent. Therefore, the United States began to lend only physical goods to Britain, leading to the passage of the Lend-Lease Act. The Lend-Lease Act was submitted to Congress on January 10, 1941, and after two months of discussion and debate, it was finally signed into law by the President on March 11. According to this legislation, the budget established by the end of March 1941 was $7 billion, by the end of October of the same year it was $5.985 billion, and by mid-February 1942 it was $5.425 billion, totaling $18.41 billion. According to this budget, the actual military supplies shipped to Britain from March 1941 to August 1942, a period of one and a half years, amounted to $6.489 billion. However, this figure is only the amount of military supplies actually shipped from the United States to Britain. In fact, the amount spent by the United States under the Lend-Lease Act was much larger, that is, the actual expenditure in the one year from March 1941 to February 1942 was about twice the amount shipped to Britain, reaching $12.272 billion. As President Roosevelt said on June 15, 1942, the production of loaned weapons was $8 billion a year, accounting for about 15% of the total military production.

(2) Military Expansion Movement After the Greater East Asia War

After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, American military strategic bases in the Pacific, such as Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, were repeatedly damaged, and the United States further actively expanded its military armaments.

Shortly after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, in January 1942, Roosevelt submitted a message to the U.S. Congress. From the perspective of actual military production expenditures, January was $2.1 billion, February was $2.9 billion, April was $3.4 billion, and May was $4.4 billion, showing a sharp increase. The increase in expenditures in the second half of the period can be seen from the figure of $32.4 billion for the 1941-42 fiscal year (July 1941 to June 1942).

The budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year was estimated at $58.9 billion in the budget message submitted by the President to Congress in early 1942. According to a long report submitted to Congress by President Roosevelt on October 16, 1942, the budget included $74 billion in military expenditure and exceeded $80 billion. In the 77th Congress of 1942, which adjourned on December 16, 1942, a new budget of $200 billion was passed. Of course, this includes not only the supplementary budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year, but also the supplementary budget for the 1941-42 fiscal year, and the budget based on the Lend-Lease Act. This also shows the astonishing expansion of the budget passed by the U.S. Congress.

In the current fiscal year (since July 1942), the actual expenditure figures of the United States have increased at a high speed. For example, the actual expenditure in September 1942 reached $5.384 billion. The expenditure on military equipment in June 1940 was $150 million, almost less than the current daily expenditure. That is, the expenditure in September increased by 400% compared to the previous year.

As a result of this desperate military expansion, according to Donald Nelson, head of the U.S. Military and Supplies Bureau, on September 21, 1942, military expenditures in the first seven months of 1942 were equivalent to 36% of the U.S. national income. Looking back, military expenditures in 1941 accounted for only 14% of national income, in 1940 only 4%, and in 1939 even less at 2%. This shows the great increase in military production. According to Nelson's speech that day, military production during the above period accounted for 40% of the total U.S. production during the same period, and in 1942 it would reach 60%.

President Roosevelt further submitted the 1943-44 budget to the 78th U.S. Congress at the beginning of 1943. It is said to be an unprecedentedly large budget plan with a total amount of $103 billion, of which military expenditure reached $96 billion, an increase of 70% compared to the $53 billion in military expenditure in the original budget for the 1942-43 fiscal year. Such a huge military expenditure accounts for more than $8 billion per month. If the supplementary budget is added, then the monthly military expenditure will exceed the $10 billion mark.

(3) The Goals of the United States in 1943

What are the goals of such military expansion? In the first year of the Greater East Asia War, the United States put forward the slogan "Remember Pearl Harbor." The slogan for the second year was "From defensive to offensive!" The United States, which was forced to retreat from the Pacific in the first year of the Greater East Asia War, has been inspiring national morale by invading French North Africa since mid-November, greatly publicizing "The Second Army is the counter-offensive army!" So, what is the true meaning of the strategic offensive of the United States in the future?

Since the outbreak of this World War, the United States has sold 50 destroyers to Britain in the summer of 1940 in order to defend Britain. At the same time, as a condition of exchange, it obtained the right to turn the British West Indies into American naval and air force bases. Before and after this event, in August of the same year, Canada established the U.S.-Canada Joint Defense Committee, and the United States expanded its power over Canada's vast territory. In fact, American foreign policy has used this war to strengthen its control over the Western Hemisphere. Today, Americans have regarded Canada as the "49th state" newly established after the 48 states of the United States. Moreover, at that time, the United States was still in the neutral circle, and it began to extend its control from Central and South America, excluding the rights of Britain, Germany, and Italy in Latin America, supporting the rights of the United States, and ordering the countries of Central and South America to stop trading with the Axis powers. After the Greater East Asia War, almost all countries in Central and South America have successively joined the war. By August 1942, Peru, and in January 1943, Chile, had also declared war.

In May 1942, the United States invaded French Martinique in the West Indies, and from then on extended its power eastward, reaching the west coast of Africa. Since July 1942, the U.S. military has successively operated in French Equatorial Africa, Belgian Congo, British Nigeria, and Freetown. In October, it stationed troops in the Republic of Liberia, threatening all French African colonies. On November 7, the U.S. military violently invaded French North African colonies. The ambition to carry out military aggression against Africa, Europe, and even the Near East and Central Asia has begun to be exposed to the world! As for East Asia, while Japan has been driven out of important bases in the Pacific, Britain's recent abandonment of its ambition to counter-attack, and its "aid" to Chongqing and the Soviet Union, are naturally another manifestation of the U.S. attempt to restore its hegemonic ambitions in East Asia.

A military reporter for the New York Times once said that British troops are now stationed at more than 50 strategic points around the world. This is by no means a worthless statement.

In the process of the disintegration of the British Empire, all the territories under the former British Empire are successively returning to the banner of the United States, and all French colonies are also gradually being encroached upon by the American military.

### Following Napoleon's Advancement Route, the War Intensifies, German Troops Abandon Sychevka, Soviet Troops Southwest of Kharkov Annihilated

German Leader's Headquarters, Haidong News Agency, 8th. This afternoon's German military report stated that powerful German forces southwest of Kharkov yesterday defeated enemy resistance and advanced to the west of the city. Soviet forces repeatedly attacked in the Orel region but were unsuccessful. The enemy's attacks in the central sector, attempting to hinder the German army's operations, were all repelled. The German army, in accordance with its original plan, has now withdrawn from the city of Sychevka in West. South of Lake Ilmen, the fighting was extremely fierce yesterday. Soviet forces launched fierce attacks, but were heavily damaged and repelled by our defending forces. German aircraft assisted in the battle, shooting down sixty Soviet aircraft.

Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 8th. Haidong News Agency recently learned from responsible authorities that the German army has withdrawn from the city of Sychevka south of Rzhev (Sychevka is 120 miles west of Moscow) in accordance with its original plan. This plan has been prepared for some time, and its purpose is to correct the German positions in the central sector of the Eastern Front.

Somewhere on the Soviet Border, Havas News Agency, 8th. On the Eastern Front, from the city of Orel south to the Sea of Azov, the climate is mild and conducive to German military operations. Therefore, yesterday the Red Army only launched an offensive in the ice and snow area north of the city of Orel. The line from the city of Orel north to Staraia Russa, stretching for 700 miles, has extremely strong German positions. According to Berlin sources, repeated Red Army attacks have been repelled and have suffered heavy damage. On the Soviet side, it is claimed that the Red Army is advancing north from the city of Gzhatsk (south of Rzhev), occupying many towns and cities, but it also admits that the Red Army has encountered strong German resistance. The two sides are engaged in fierce battles along the road traveled by Napoleon's army in 1812, and the outcome is still undecided. The locations of the Red Army's attacks are the four cities of Velikiye Luki, Rzhev, Vyazma, and Smolensk, forming a four-sided formation. Last night, the fighting around the city of Vyazma was particularly fierce. It is reported that the German army is resolutely resisting the Red Army's attempts to approach the city. The Red Army is still thirty miles away from the city. According to the Red Army's war report, "The Red Army is still launching offensives in the previous directions." A Soviet official supplement stated that a German ship of 6,000 tons was sunk in the Barents Sea, and 129 German aircraft were shot down this week. The Soviet side also lost 76 aircraft. Finally, it was officially announced that the Red Army occupied 74 densely populated villages north and southwest of the city of Gzhatsk, but the locations were not specified. In the southern sector, especially in the Donets and Kupiansk regions, the German army has been on the offensive for the past two weeks, continuously attacking the retreating Red Army.

Berlin, Haidong News Agency, 8th. The Soviet Third Tank Army south of Kharkov was annihilated. The number of Soviet soldiers' corpses left on the battlefield has reached 28,000. The number of prisoners and captured war trophies has not yet been calculated. The Soviet army resisted fiercely, so the number of prisoners may not be very large. The German army continues to carry out mopping-up operations at the Kupiansk bridgehead, capturing hundreds more prisoners. More than 600 Soviet soldiers were killed. The Soviet 58th Army suffered extremely heavy losses. The Soviet concentration of new forces north of the bridgehead has been repelled. German tank units advanced towards the Sea of Azov, defeating a Soviet unit of about 1,200 men. West of Orel and north of Staraia Russa, the enemy continues to launch large-scale offensives. The Soviet army dispatched seven infantry divisions and three tank brigades west of Orel, launching fierce attacks but failing. The Soviet attacks west of Sukhinichi have been going on for more than two weeks, and the offensive has now subsided slightly. Fierce fighting is still taking place south of Lake Ilmen.

### Guerrilla Activities in Bosnia Renewed, German Army Carries Out Mopping-Up Operations

Berlin, Haidi News Agency, 8th. According to information received here last night, German and Croatian forces launched a mopping-up operation against guerrillas in Bosnia last month, occupying the Pihac and Vruni districts. A second large-scale offensive is now underway. A few days after launching the second offensive, German and Croatian forces captured the city of Glamoc and seized a large amount of clothing, war equipment, and food. The Bosnian Communists are now operating in small mountain villages near the Dalmatian border. (Editor's note: Bosnia is the name of a province in southwestern coastal Yugoslavia.)

### General Minami Returns to Fukuoka, Talks About His Inspection of the South

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 8th. General Jiro Minami, Privy Councilor of Japan, recently inspected various parts of the South for more than a month. He arrived in Fukuoka by plane at 1:15 p.m. today and gave a special speech, saying, in brief, that the military and political affairs in the South are on the right track and have spread to all parts of the region. Public security has almost been completely restored. There are occasional movements of a small number of enemy aircraft and submarines in Myanmar, Java, and other islands from the eastern end to New Guinea, but there is no major action. Therefore, the administration, which focuses on combat but also proceeds simultaneously, is also progressing smoothly. After the Asian residents have broken away from the shackles of countries such as Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, they are now sincerely cooperating in building a new East Asia as members of Asia. Prime Minister Tojo's statement in his speech to the Diet that he would recognize the independence of Myanmar and the Philippines has given great comfort to the residents of those places. In particular, Myanmar is even more excited because its independence can be realized this year. Moreover, the construction of Myanmar is very promising. Iron, oil, and various other underground resources are being explored. About 80% of the port facilities and the salvage work of enemy sunken ships have been completed. The residents are all cooperating with Japan with great determination to complete the construction of Greater East Asia, so the propaganda of Britain and the United States has no effect. In short, the security and resource development in various parts of the South have made great progress, and the situation of certain victory has been completely established.

### New Java's Construction Progresses Rapidly, Local Residents Are Employed as Officials, Statues of Clive and Others Have Been Removed

Jakarta, Central News Agency, 8th. The Supreme Commander of the Japanese Army in Java issued a statement on the occasion of the first anniversary of the establishment of Japanese rule in Java, saying that looking back on the past year, the elite Japanese army conquered Java and established the foundation for building a new Java. It has been one year since then. On this significant anniversary, recalling the scenes at that time makes people feel sincerely grateful, especially to the heroic spirits who died valiantly in the Java conquest. Now the security of Java has been completely established, and the government orders have been carried out throughout the island. Moreover, thanks to the sincere trust and cooperation of the residents of the entire island with the Japanese army, the progress of the construction of the new Java is truly advancing by leaps and bounds, which is what we are most pleased to see. From the perspective of the overall situation of the Greater East Asia War, Japan has established a situation of certain victory and invincibility, and its final victory must belong to us, which is beyond doubt. However, we should not be negligent because of this. We must know that there are still many hardships ahead of the war, which we must overcome. This is what we must realize. Military officers and civilians must uphold the declaration of war and clarify the imperial edict. From now on, we must work together with one heart and one mind, eliminate selfishness, and devote ourselves to public service, and advance toward the goal of all things in harmony.

Jakarta, Central News Agency, 8th. The Japanese Military Administration Department implements the military-political alliance in Java and employs indigenous officials to assist in promoting military and political affairs. This has contributed a lot to the construction of the new Java. Recently, in order to enable indigenous officials to assume the responsibility of educating the general public, to understand the true meaning of the East Asia War, and to make a firm determination to cooperate in the war, it was decided to establish a new official system on the anniversary of the first anniversary of Java's rule. Currently, a draft is being prepared. The new system is based on safeguarding the status and life of indigenous officials, so that they can dedicate themselves to the construction of the new Java system, and respecting the New Greater East Asia concept of Javanese customs. It is the first new indigenous official system formulated by Japan in the occupied territories of the South, so it is attracting much attention.

### Indian Leaders of Various Factions Convene a Meeting Today to Discuss Future Anti-British Strategies, Overseas Indian Compatriots Pledge to Continue Fighting for Independence

Istanbul, Allied News Agency, 8th. According to New Delhi news, Indian National Congress leader Mongi Ting will convene a meeting of Indian leaders of various factions on the 9th. He has requested Rajagopalachari and other politicians to attend. It is expected that the meeting will discuss future strategies for anti-British resistance in India, and will also request the Indian Governor-General to allow Gandhi, Nehru, and Azad to meet.

Tokyo, Central News Agency, 8th. Yokohama telegram, After the news of Mahatma Gandhi's safe completion of his fast, Indians living in various parts of East Asia were all extremely encouraged, which greatly increased their determination to strive for the independence of their motherland. The Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League held a "Completion of Independence Prayer Ceremony" at the Basaran Temple at 10:00 a.m. today, attended by branch director Sadani and 28 Indian compatriots. Then, at 1:00 p.m., a "Indian Independence Completion Lecture Conference" was held at the Kannai Memorial Hall, which was very lively. After the opening address by Sadani, director of the Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League, Okawa Shumei, Noguchi Yonejiro, and Kimura Nikki, authorities on Indian issues in Japan, successively gave speeches, strongly advocating that India should first overthrow Britain and the United States in order to promote the timely rise of the Indian nation. Afterwards, Sadani, director of the Yokohama branch of the Indian Independence League, told reporters that the Anglo-Saxons are indeed the common enemy of the East Asian nations. This time, they wanted to harm Gandhi, who is revered by our Indian people. All 400 million Indian people are praying for God's blessing. Fortunately, Gandhi has safely completed his fast. His fast has made us deeply feel the cruelty and injustice of Britain, and has increased our determination to strive for the independence of our motherland. We Indians are determined to do our best to continue fighting and drive the British out of East Asia. We firmly believe that this is inevitable. The Japanese government's statement that it does not regard Indians as enemies and does not apply the law freezing enemy property has dealt a deep and significant blow to the enemy, while all of us Indians are deeply grateful, and it is of infinite encouragement to the Indian independence movement.

### A Disturbance in Front of the British Consulate in New York

### Sugar Distribution Based on Population to be Implemented the Day After Tomorrow, Quantity and Price to be Announced, Uniform Method Adopted in All Districts of the City, Procedures for Cooking Oil Rationing Not Yet Determined

After the Sugar Merchants' Cooperative Business Office was approved by the military rationing authority to distribute sugar based on population, each Type A retailer for the fifth phase of purchasing sugar with house donation tickets will cease accepting house donation tickets on the 6th and 7th. The last distribution of sugar will be on these two days. Those who fail to collect within the time limit will not be able to apply for a replacement thereafter. From the 11th, sugar will be sold based on sugar certificates. After the retailers have been re-registered and merged, it has been decided that there will be (1) more than 130 retailers in the Public Concession, and (2) more than 110 retailers in the French Concession. Each retailer will be assigned a registration number. However, each registration number is not a single number, but is based on the rationed quantity. The sugar distributed to each retailer in February has been properly stored for the distribution of sugar to households in March. The validity period of the first coupon of the sugar certificate is from March 11 to March 31. The quantity is fixed at eight taels per person, regardless of whether they are adults or children. The price will be sold according to the revised price announced on March 2, which will be announced jointly by the Cooperative Business Office, the Public Works Bureau, and the Board of Directors of the Public Concession. As for the sugar distribution based on population in Nanshi, Zhabei, and West Shanghai, preparations have been made. The sugar purchase certificates have been issued by the Food Administration Bureau when distributing household food rations. They will be implemented simultaneously with the two concessions. The quantity, price, start date, and end date will be exactly the same for the sake of fairness.

The 29th Phase of Rice Rations: A Total of Two and a Half Sheng

The Public Works Bureau's Information Office announced that the Bureau had recently issued Notice No. 6286, explaining that the validity period of Coupon No. 28 of the Rice and Flour Certificate will end on the 9th of this month, and will be invalid after the deadline. From the 11th to the 19th of this month, the Bureau's rice sales offices and rice stores will only sell rice and flour based on Coupon No. 29 of the Rice and Flour Certificate. At that time, the rice stores with registered numbers marked on the coupon will sell one and a half sheng of white rice or brown rice and one sheng of broken rice for each rice purchase certificate coupon, with a total selling price of six yuan and three jiao. In addition, one and a half jin of No. 2 flour and four liang of No. 3 flour will be sold for each flour certificate coupon, with a total selling price of three yuan, eight jiao, and five fen. Furthermore, all rice stores and the Bureau's rice sales offices will suspend sales for one day on the 20th of this month.

Cooking Oil and Miscellaneous Grain Certificates: Two Days for Supplementary Issuance

The offices for issuing rice purchase certificates in the Public Concession first issued the eighth batch of rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates from the 22nd of last month, and then continued to issue cooking oil certificates and miscellaneous grain certificates from the 1st of this month. According to a report by a Datong News Agency reporter, most of the taxpayers in the Central, Northwest, East, and West districts have received the above-mentioned purchase certificates since they were issued, and they have been distributed evenly to each dependent household. Therefore, each certificate issuing office has set the 9th as the last day for issuing purchase certificates. The 11th and 12th will be specifically for the supplementary issuance of cooking oil and miscellaneous grain certificates to those who have only received rice flour purchase certificates and sugar purchase certificates.

### Coal Industry Federation: Coal Stock Registration Extended to Tomorrow

The Shanghai Coal Industry Federation, to ascertain the amount of coal stock in Shanghai, specifically sent a letter to Da Zhong Lian Coal Company last month, responsible for re-registering coal stocks. After Da Zhong Lian Coal Company forwarded the letter to the Shanghai Coal Retailers Association and the process began, nearly ten days have passed. A reporter learned yesterday that Da Zhong Lian Coal Company has decided to extend the deadline for coal stock registration to the 10th of this month. Therefore, all fellow businesses who have not registered must obtain and submit the forms before this date. Failure to do so will result in restrictions on the movement of said coal, with the authorities taking action. According to news from the coal industry, coal shipments to Shanghai have continuously arrived, mostly from North China and Korea. Therefore, the amount of coal stock in the city is increasing daily.

### Liquor Industry Adjusts Prices: Friendship Association to Formulate Comprehensive Measures

The military authorities have designated the Shanghai Special Municipal Liquor Industry Friendship Association to handle liquor rationing in the city. The Bureau of Public Works' Goods Control Department has also assessed and set price limits for various types of liquor. However, for the past two months, liquor market prices have been volatile. To stabilize valuations, the Friendship Association has drafted comprehensive measures to promote the welfare of its members. Hotel members can apply to the Association and declare their monthly requirements to facilitate readjustment.

### All Charity Organizations Plan to Relocate to the Countryside: Due to Financial Difficulties and Heavy Burden, Hoping for Donations from All Sectors to Evacuate Distressed Children from the City

The English-language *North-China Daily News* reported that a member of the China Children's Welfare Association yesterday continued to request public donations to facilitate the evacuation of more distressed children from the city, after the relocation of five charity organizations to nearby rural areas, and to prevent them from stopping due to financial difficulties.

Supporting Children Requires Public Assistance

It is stated that sending distressed children to the countryside is one of the best strategies in the charitable plan. However, in reality, without financial support, it is impossible to send more groups of children to the countryside. As for the five charities that have already moved to Suzhou and its neighboring areas, they are said to have sufficient funds and are not worried about financial difficulties. However, the Association relies on continued public support to sustain the children.

Planning to Resolve Donation Issues

Charity organizations currently remaining in Shanghai plan to relocate to the countryside to reduce their burden. However, the public often assumes that since these organizations are moving to the countryside, they are no longer relevant to Shanghai and are unwilling to donate funds for relocation expenses. The China Children's Welfare Association is devising solutions to this difficulty to smoothly send the children to the countryside.

Distributing Over a Thousand Pieces of Winter Clothing

The member also revealed that in the past three months, the China Children's Welfare Association distributed 1,379 sets of clothing to various charity organizations for distribution. At that time, 2,000 sets of clothing were made, costing 30 yuan per set, funded by public donations. Currently, 621 sets remain in the Association's possession, ready to be distributed to other needy children without clothing.

### Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Bureau Continues to Crack Cases, Levying Maximum Fines of Over 50,000 Yuan

Regarding the Jianghai Customs anti-smuggling efforts, the crackdown has been swift and decisive, with severe penalties imposed on smuggled goods seized. A reporter learned yesterday from the Jianghai Customs Anti-Smuggling Division that the Customs had recently seized a large number of smuggled goods, including: (1) a batch of Western medicine belonging to Liang Cai Gen, fined 2,962 yuan and required to pay import tax; (2) a batch of cotton cloth belonging to Lu Xiang Tai Cloth Store, all confiscated; (3) 13 items of sundries belonging to Yang Chun Shan, fined 1,500 yuan; (4) a batch of cigarettes and cigarette paper belonging to Hu Song Lan and Chen Zhu Shi, all confiscated; (5) 18 items of white rice belonging to Zhang Yao Shi and eight others, all confiscated; (6) three rickshaw tires belonging to Wang Hong Tian, fined 500 yuan; (7) four iron bars belonging to Shanghai Yu Shun Chang Factory, fined 300 yuan and required to pay transit tax; (8) 250 items of soy sauce belonging to Heng Sheng Hang, fined 54,788 yuan. If the owners of the above goods fail to pay the fines within one month, the Jianghai Customs will confiscate the goods.

### Grain Bureau Strictly Prohibits Obstruction of Rice Distribution

Zhang Xianzhi, Director of the Municipal Grain Administration, to effectively rectify its warehouses and strictly prohibit obstructing rice distribution, yesterday issued a public notice stating that warehouse responsibilities include the proper inspection, allocation, management, and storage of rice, which must be carried out diligently to meet the objectives of regulation and rationing. Hereafter, any intentional delays in opening warehouses or requests for bribes when organizations or individuals present rice withdrawal certificates during office hours will be severely punished upon investigation. All are expected to comply, etc.

### Wuding Road Soup Kitchen Resumes Operation: Supervised by Welfare Bureau Personnel

After the Shanghai Branch of the Relief Work Committee was taken over by the Municipal Social Welfare Bureau, the winter relief soup kitchen at 220 Wuding Road was suspended for several days due to the handover. The Social Welfare Bureau believes that this type of work is vital to the lives of the poor and cannot be interrupted. It has now resumed normal operations, with large numbers of poor people, both elderly and young, arriving every morning. Staff selected by the Bureau are supervising, greatly benefiting the extremely poor. The Bureau, considering the welfare and needs of the poor, has decided to continue operations even though winter has passed and spring has arrived.

### Bureau of Public Works Orders Dyeing and Weaving Industries to Report Retail Locations: To Facilitate Issuance of Goods Movement Permits; Trade Association Urges Members to Comply by Deadline

The Public Works Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council recently sent a letter to the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association, stating that all members of the Association who have established retail stores in the Settlement must report their names and locations by a specific date. Otherwise, they will not be able to apply for the issuance of permits to transport goods to these retail stores. After receiving the order, the Dyeing and Weaving Industry Association has notified its members that all those who have established storefronts or retail stores in the Settlement must truthfully report the details and submit them to the Association by the 10th of this month for forwarding to the Public Works Department. As for members whose primary business is dyeing and weaving yarn and cloth, the Association has sent a letter to the Public Works Department explaining the general situation of the members and requesting that permits be issued as usual for transporting goods to other retailers.

The Ministry has now ordered its subordinate courts that applications for reduced-price train and ship tickets for escorts of convicted criminals can henceforth be submitted directly to the General Affairs and Prison Departments of the Ministry of Judicial Administration for approval and issuance.

### Achievements of the Clean-Up Campaign in Southeastern Taihu Lake Area

Symbol of Tranquility and Security

The second phase of the Clean-Up Campaign in the southeastern Taihu Lake area covers the areas of southern Songjiang, Jinshan, Pinghu, Jiaxing, Jiashan, Haiyan, and Haining. These places were designated as new administrative districts in January of this year. The area of these seven counties is approximately 80 kilometers east to west and 30 kilometers north to south, with a total average of about 2,500 square kilometers. This area is an agricultural region, with the main products being rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains, so people consider these seven counties, like Huzhou, as the granary of Zhejiang Province.

This area is adjacent to the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line, and both land and water transportation are well-developed. However, in the past, the security was not very stable, and administrative power was not easily implemented in this area, because it was too close to Shanghai. So the kind of bad influence from Shanghai flowed into these places. These places were routes for smuggling important materials into Shanghai, so people thought that these smugglers hindered the improvement of security.

The system for smuggling goods is roughly as follows: salt produced in Yuyao and other places is smuggled in through Zhapu, Jinshanwei, and other places. Flour and miscellaneous grains produced in Wuxi and Changzhou are smuggled out through Songjiang. Rice from Jiaxing and Jiashan is smuggled through Pinghu, Minhang, and other routes. Ships traveling horizontally and vertically on the water are also effective tools for smuggling materials. Similarly, materials can also be smuggled from Shanghai to the interior. Materials from Shanghai are mostly transported to Songjiang and other places, some by boat and some by manpower, using the so-called "bee-style" method of smuggling exports. Songjiang, Jiaxing, and other places are collection and distribution points, and from there they are transferred to the interior. Most of the people who engage in smuggling are local ruffians and hooligans who depend on smuggling for a living. There is also a portion of the working class who rely on this for a living. This extremely unreasonable situation has led to the deterioration of security in this area, hindering the implementation of administrative power.

The second phase of the Clean-Up Campaign in the southeastern Taihu Lake area began in October of last year. Since its implementation, with the active efforts of the authorities and the cooperation of the people, security has improved significantly. Now, people can freely and safely enter and exit the area. The hooligans who engaged in smuggling have also been expelled, and the workers who engaged in smuggling after losing their jobs have to return to legitimate employment. The people constantly smuggling materials along the Shanghai-Hangzhou Railway Line are no longer seen.

Now, the number of people traveling between rural and urban areas has increased significantly, which is clear evidence that security has been restored. Jiaxing and Xiashi, the cities in the countryside, are crowded with people from the surrounding villages every day. Tea houses, restaurants, and theaters are always full, and the prosperity is beyond description.

Economic Revival

Before the Clean-Up Campaign, smuggling could bring in some illegal profits, so it made some contributions to the economy. Since the Clean-Up Campaign, the economy has been blockaded, and materials are managed. This illegal profit has been completely eliminated. Step by step, a legal and proper economy is being built. This area is known to all as a prosperous area. Local products are more than enough to feed the local people. Below is a comparison table of rice production and consumption in this area:

County Name Rice Production Rice Consumption

(Unit: 1,000 Stone) (Unit: 1,000 Stone)

Jiaxing and Jiashan 645 472

Pinghu 238 264

Haining 60 72

Haiyan 70 71

Jinshan 643 425

Total 1,656 1,304

The above statistics are based on the reports of the counties before the Clean-Up Campaign. Now, there may be inaccuracies, but this is not known. But looking at the above figures, there is of course a considerable surplus. Other major products include approximately 400,000 stone of wheat, 200,000 stone of broad beans, 113,000 stone of soybeans, 15,000 dan of rapeseed, 20,000 dan of orchid seeds, 60,000 dan of watermelons, and various others. Along the coast, there is also a lot of edible salt and fresh fish. Fuel (firewood) is also abundant.

The security in this clean-up area is stable, and the people can live and work in peace, which has led to an increase in production. Cultivating one more mu and harvesting one more dou is what any farmer hopes for. Now, the authorities in charge of the Clean-Up Campaign are working hard to guide production and find ways to collect fertilizer, so the increase in production in the future is worth looking at.

In the southeastern Taihu Lake clean-up area, the agricultural progress is relatively greater in Songjiang and Jiaxing, Jiashan. The cost of fertilizer used per mu is 160 yuan, and the harvest is about 2 shi to 2.5 dou of rice.

Purchasing and distribution agencies are gradually being prepared, and the results are likely to be good. The designated merchants of the rice purchase cooperatives have a close relationship with the local rice industry associations. Recently, the controlled purchase of edible oil and miscellaneous grains has also been organized, and organized purchasing work has also been extended to edible oil and miscellaneous grains. As for the distribution of materials, it is distributed by the Japanese-Chinese Commercial Association to retailers, but some believe that the quantity distributed to the Chinese side needs to be increased.

Establishment of Local Finances

In the past, these places were not very wealthy financially. The largest source of local taxes was of course land tax, but only Jiashan County had such land tax registers and land donation registers, which were not complete. It was simply impossible to find a way to collect land tax. In this situation, how could the collection of land tax be successful? Taxpayers only wanted to pay less, and tax collectors only wanted to enrich themselves. However, the provincial and county governments had no way to thoroughly investigate the cause of this tax revenue decline.

With the progress of the Clean-Up Campaign, all land relations and cultivation systems will naturally become clear. Land tax revenue has gradually improved. Last year, the total collection exceeded 22 million yuan. It is unclear how much land tax revenue was in the past, but it is estimated that it was less than one-tenth of the current amount. This 22 million yuan is entirely thanks to the Clean-Up Campaign. From this alone, it can be seen how important the Clean-Up Campaign is.

The tax rate adopted in the second phase of the Clean-Up area is the same as in Jiangsu Province, with a maximum of 20 yuan per mu. However, there are also differences depending on the grade of the fields. If it is possible to collect according to this tax rate, it is expected that this area can generate 45 million yuan. According to the Clean-Up authorities, the same tax rate will be adopted as in Jiangsu Province in the first year, but at some point, they plan to reduce the tax rate.

The southeastern Taihu Lake area was previously a desolate area in terms of politics and finance. However, since the Clean-Up Campaign began, there have been significant achievements. This is a fact that tells us that if there are other desolate areas where political power cannot penetrate the people and where finances are empty, as long as the Clean-Up Campaign is implemented, it will turn for the better and become fertile areas with considerable tax revenue.

Land Declaration and Measurement

As mentioned above, there are no land registers or tax registers in these counties. Saying this, is it possible to put it aside and ignore it? This is not possible. Now, the Clean-Up authorities have ordered the counties to send personnel to measure and report on the land situation by a specific date. The measurement teams are divided into several teams, and each team has Japanese technicians to assist in the measurement. The most advanced measurement work is in Jiaxing and Pinghu. Recently, efforts have been focused on Jiaxing, measuring urban land. The declared area and the measurement results are not much different, with an average difference of about 5%.

Future Issues

After the land is measured, the relationship of the rental of the land will be certainly affected. This area has a special problem, that is, the tendency of renting out a piece of land to multiple tenants. According to the investigation of the Clean-Up Headquarters, a great portion of farmers rent or partially rent the land. The figures in Jiaxing, Jiashan, and Jinshan are as follows:

In average, 81 percent of farmers in Jiaxing and Jiashan work for the landowners. The case is even worse in Jinshan, where 80 percent of the farmers rent the land, 15 percent rent land and work as free labors, and only 5 percent own the land. Although we may not say anything after reading the figures, we feel a sense of urgency of constructing the agricultural issues.

The future important works of the Clean-Up plan are to promote the land measurement, to sort out the tax plan, and to popularize the organization of the cooperative society. Boosting the output and establishing the economy after China joining the war are related to the above issues a great deal, and we all hope to actively construct.

Judging from the farming products in this area, the ratio of output quantity and land is still far from perfect. Even the soil is fertile in Jiaxing and Jiashan, the output per acre is still not great.

The number of farming fields and dry fields is not clear, but compared to the production of rice and the area of fields, the production of rice is not that rich, and other groats and farming products are relatively few. For what reasons? Although we can not fully trust that the figures are certain, the officials shall seriously consider the above reasons that are leading to the insufficieny of production.

### One Year of Nanshi Baojia Facilities

— Lu Ying

Baojia is a good current system and is of great importance to local security. Its meticulous and sound organization is related to our well-being and the people's. Not only is it closely related to the city's residents, but it is also linked to the evolution of the entire society. The Bureau was ordered to take over the Nanshi Baojia, and it has been a year since then. In the past year, the police and Baojia have been able to cooperate thoroughly, which has made the security forces in Nanshi more substantial. Therefore, the facilities of Nanshi Baojia in the past year are recorded below for the purpose of reviewing the past and encouraging the future, so that the police-Baojia cooperation in Nanshi will be even closer.

Nanshi Baojia: The Beginning

Since the Incident, Nanshi has suffered terribly from the ravages of war, and local security has been extremely chaotic. After I took charge of the Shanghai police administration, my first priority was to stabilize the local area so that security could be restored as soon as possible and people could live and work in peace. At that time, the Baojia system had not yet been implemented, and the maintenance of security depended entirely on the police. It was not until August of the 28th year of the Republic of China that the Nanshi Political Affairs Office began to implement the Baojia system under the order of the municipal government. This was the beginning of the Nanshi Baojia system. At that time, the entire area was divided into five districts, each with a district office and a district chief. Unfortunately, due to limited funds, the Baojia system could not be fully completed, and only a rough framework was established.

Police-Baojia Cooperation: Preventing Reaction

In January of last year, the Nanshi District Office was ordered to be abolished, and the management of Baojia in the entire district was taken over by the Bureau. At the same time, Zhan Xiyu, who was in charge of the Baojia section of the former Nanshi District Office, was appointed as the Baojia administrator of the Bureau, so that he could easily handle the work and strengthen the Baozhong, which would achieve twice the result with half the effort. The district heads of each district were also familiar with the Baojia situation and were not replaced. Considering the importance of Nanshi, I advocated police-Baojia cooperation in January of last year to eliminate the agitation of reactionary elements, maintain close contact, and work together regardless of each other to jointly maintain the security of the entire region.

Rechecking Household Registration: Handling Pledge

Nanshi is connected to the Concession and is located in an important area, but the household registration changes frequently every month, making it easy for criminals to hide and endanger the local area. After the Bureau took over the Nanshi Baojia, it first ordered a recheck of the household registration in the entire area, which was a basic and necessary measure to strengthen the Baojia in the entire area. After the rechecking of the household registration in the entire area was completed, the Baojia regulations were immediately handled, and a joint guarantee pledge was implemented. However, at that time, due to the limited level of public knowledge, it was quite difficult to promote this work. With the sincere guidance of the Bureau's Baojia administrator, it took three months to complete.

Re-electing District Heads: Entire District

After the implementation of the joint guarantee pledge in the entire Nanshi District, and at the same time, in order to further strengthen the Baojia in Nanshi, the Baojia chiefs set up in the five districts in the entire region were of mixed quality. While most of them were dutiful and law-abiding, some took the opportunity to coerce and exploit the people, which was unavoidable, which would lead to the loss of the purpose of promoting Baojia and maintaining local security. Therefore, in July of the same year, it was decided to re-elect the Baojia chiefs in the entire region. The district offices were immediately ordered to handle the re-election carefully and conscientiously. Within one month, all the Baojia chiefs in the entire district were re-elected. Since then, the Baojia system in Nanshi has gradually been put on the right track.

Preventing Abuses: Badges Must Be Issued

Although the Baojia system in the entire Nanshi District has gradually become meticulous, in order to comply with the regulations, the joint Baojia offices of each district were established. There are a total of 52 districts in the entire district, with one joint Baojia chief, one full-time Bao chief, and one clerk in each office. At the same time, in order to facilitate services, badges, service certificates, and armbands were issued to each Baojia to facilitate identification and prevent abuses. However, the Baojia funds in the entire district are insufficient, and the regular expenses of each district office are extremely difficult. In addition, after the establishment of the joint Baojia chief office, the expenses have become even greater. Therefore, the municipal government has been requested to approve the collection of Baojia funds from January of this year, stipulating that households pay one yuan per month and shops pay two yuan per month. Since then, after the Baojia funds are stipulated, the promotion of Baojia work will be smoother.

Establishing Police Corps: Consolidating the Local Area

The establishment of the police corps in the Nanshi District aims to assist the police, strengthen local security, prevent bandits from moving, and prevent problems before they occur. In addition to ordering the chiefs of the three police stations in Nanshi to be the deputy chiefs of the corps, the district chiefs of each district are the captains, and Wang Delin, the chief of the Yemiao Police Station, is appointed as the chief of the corps to achieve unity. Since its establishment in January of last year, no incidents of terror and unrest have occurred in the entire district, and local security has been consolidated. This cannot but be attributed to the effective cooperation between the police and Baojia.

### Various Parties Plan to Leverage Baojia to Promote Public Affairs and Assist the Work of the Hygiene and Fire Departments

Due to the establishment of the Baojia system, the agencies in this port that handle various local undertakings are planning to leverage this organization to work with residents to jointly promote public affairs.

Supervising at All Times: Paying Attention to Hygiene

According to inquiries, the hygiene departments of the two concessions are actively preparing to use the Baojia system to enable the public hygiene undertakings to have good development. The general method will be to order the heads of each Baojia to manage the cleaning work in their respective areas. They must supervise residents to pay attention to hygiene at all times. When necessary, the hygiene authorities will specifically launch a publicity campaign to order each Baojia chief to inform each household to cooperate in the designated hygiene work.

Self-Policing Assistance: Regulating Traffic

For the maintenance of public traffic regulations, after the safety movement was held by the Youth Department of Baozhong on the 12th of this month, the self-policing officers guarding each post will also be ordered by the authorities to assist the police in supervising pedestrians or vehicles to comply with traffic regulations. However, the method of traffic control by self-policing officers is mainly "persuasion" to ensure that residents are happy to comply.

Joint Supervision: Preventing Fires

Since the Shanghai Fire Brigade has been striving for innovation, the training of firefighters and the purchase of new fire-fighting equipment have been actively carried out. However, it is learned that the fire department authorities also have a plan to use the Baojia organization to prevent fires from occurring recently. This plan is probably to enable residents of each household to be led by the Baojia chief to make various preparations for preventing fires and to supervise each other to prevent opportunities for fires to occur. At the same time, in an emergency, each household will be ordered to help put out the fire.

### Insurance Contracts Must Be Affixed with Revenue Stamps, Effective Tomorrow

The Insurance Supervision Bureau of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce has issued an order for the implementation of the insurance revenue stamp regulations. Insurance contracts should be affixed with revenue stamps, and the insurance industry should collect the revenue stamp fee from the policyholders and affix them. The amount is 1% of the insurance premium stated on the insurance contract. The Bureau has ordered the matter to be handled. It is now stipulated that from the 10th of this month, all insurance contracts signed in this city must be affixed with revenue stamps. In the future, when policyholders receive insurance contracts, they should pay the revenue stamp fee and check whether the revenue stamps have been affixed and whether they are sufficient. Insurance managers should also check clearly when issuing insurance contracts. If there is any intentional failure to affix revenue stamps or insufficient revenue stamps, it will be handled according to law. If policyholders refuse to pay the revenue stamp fee, the insurance industry may report to the Bureau for severe punishment according to law. In addition to the Bureau's announcement of the above measures, the Insurance Industry Association of this city has also notified its member companies to comply.

### The Owner of Lianyin Bookstore Helps Students with Birthday Celebrations, and Students of Southeast Vocational School Commemorate Women's Day by Helping Students

This newspaper's student aid fund received assistance from the owner of Lianyin Bookstore, who used birthday celebrations to help students. We are deeply grateful for this care. We also received a donation from students of the Southeast Senior Vocational School's pharmacy department to commemorate Women's Day by collecting donations to help students. It is commendable to do something worth commemorating on a meaningful memorial day. The details are as follows:

A letter from the students of Southeast Senior Vocational School said, "Our school's female students, in order to commemorate this year's Women's Day and respond to your museum's student aid fund-raising campaign, specially raised 230 national currency yuan to donate to your museum for student aid. The small amount is just a token of mutual assistance, and we hope that all sectors of society will enthusiastically support it."

### Purchasing Overshoes Requires Exchanging Old Shoes, Still Limited to Rainy Days, and Must Bring House Tax Bill

In order to save materials, the rubber industry in this city has stipulated that citizens can only purchase overshoes on rainy days and must bring a house tax bill and a corresponding citizen ID card. Although this method has achieved the purpose of restriction since its implementation, the general public still purchases them even if they are not needed, and they are not used after being prepared. This phenomenon is similar to hoarding in disguise. Therefore, the rubber industry has formulated another remedy. In addition to complying with the original method of limiting purchases to rainy days, when purchasing new shoes, old shoes must be brought for exchange. New shoes will not be sold to those who do not bring old shoes. Other documents such as house tax bills and citizen ID cards must still be brought. The old shoes exchanged can still be recycled by the rubber industry.

### Special Series on Various Parts of Nanyang (6): The Emerging Burma (2)

— Qinglian

(IV) National Liberation Movement

The Burmese people's national independence movement has never stopped since the British established their colonial regime in Burma. Moreover, it is in the process of intensifying.

The non-cooperation movement against the British initiated by Mahatma Gandhi, the leader of the Indian national liberation movement that began in 1920, ignited a national wave of anger against British imperialism throughout India. The National Congress Party gained leadership of the national movement in India. This first Indian national movement, which lasted for two years, gave the Burmese people a strong anti-imperialist consciousness and promoted the Burmese national independence movement.

In 1932, following the international imperialist economic panic, Burmese national independence activists put forward the slogan of breaking away from British shackles and striving for political independence. The tide of the independence movement flooded throughout Burma. The British adopted inhumane repressive measures against them, just as they did against the Indian national liberation movement. However, due to the unexpected spirit of sacrifice of the Burmese national activists and their unwavering persistence in the struggle, the cunning British imperialists were stunned! They had to hurriedly change their colors and set up the so-called Simon Commission to conduct a survey of the political situation in India and Burma. However, this was not a sincere intention to give up privileges in the slightest. It was just a trick to temporarily ease the Burmese people's resistance and have time for further suppression. The Burmese people certainly could not fail to see this, so they "boycotted" the committee on the grounds that "there were no Indian and Burmese people's representatives in the committee." Therefore, the British rulers had to make "greater" concessions, and the Simon case became the center of the London Round Table Conference, which decided to separate India and Burma. — Although, in fact, this was again the beginning of a new deception.

Originally, Britain had reached the point of saturation in treating India as its commodity market. The Indian national liberation movement had also developed to the stage of becoming a fatal pain for Britain. In order to maintain this "crown of the British Empire," they first tried to break the unity of the Indian nation, one of which was to implement the separation of India and Burma. For Burma, on the surface, it seemed to be a "concession," and there was a prospect of "autonomy." In this way, for the Indian national movement, it was to split off a part of the force. Moreover, Britain further used the hatred of the Burmese people towards the Indians caused by the rampant usurious exploitation of Indians in Burma in the past to make the "autonomous" Burma a separate force to contain the Indian national movement. How clever and malicious are the British tactics of dividing and suppressing the anti-imperialist movements in the colonies!

Burma, which was split from India, became a directly governed colony of the British Empire. First, a two-house parliamentary system was established. The parliament was divided into upper and lower houses. The upper house was composed of members appointed by the governor, and as a result, it became an organ for protecting British rights in Burma. The lower house was composed of members elected by the Burmese people themselves, but Indians and British people in Burma also had the right to vote and be elected. The cabinet was composed of ten ministers, but its administrative power did not extend to the Federated Shan States under the jurisdiction of the Governor and the Ministry of National Defense, and the areas under the rule of chieftains in the northwest. Moreover, the cabinet had no say in the expenditure of national defense funds. In other words, the national defense budget was decided by the Ministry of National Defense without the deliberation of the parliament and the cabinet ministers, and the governor had the power to veto the resolutions of the parliament. Therefore, although Burma had the name of parliamentary politics, in reality, the British government still retained extensive powers, and the Burmese people had no real political autonomy.

This hypocritical policy naturally aroused the dissatisfaction of the entire Burmese people with the constitution and fueled the Burmese national independence movement. The light of the new era has long shone on the entire territory of the Buddhist country, and the flames of the national liberation struggle have been burning on both sides of the Irrawaddy River and in the surrounding mountains.

(V) British Exploitation

Britain actually ruled Burma from 1862 (the first year of the Qing Tongzhi reign) after the Second Anglo-Burmese War. The British appointed political officers to rule Lower Burma. This rule continued until the complete annexation in 1897 (the 23rd year of the Guangxu reign), and it was not until 1923 (the 12th year of the Republic of China) that it was officially incorporated into a province of British India, directly under the rule of the Governor-General of India.

The most prominent thing after Burma was annexed was the increase in Indian immigration to Burma. British imperialism used Indians as commercial agents, soldiers, and police, that is, the policy of "using Indians to control Burma," to control the national life of the entire Burma. At the same time, Indians gradually gained the upper hand in Burma and mastered the leadership of Burmese commerce. After the opening of the Suez Canal, Burma gradually became an international market, which promoted the development of Burmese land and brought about a fundamental change in the Burmese economy. First, the rice and other resources produced in Burma were listed as international commodities, and the Indian merchants who were good at business were used to increase the trade profits of British capitalism. Here, the rice-producing areas of Burma also shifted from Upper Burma to Lower Burma. Second, following the development of land, Indian immigrants poured in like a tide. At the same time, the so-called "Chettiar" Indian usurious capital, based in Madras, also penetrated into Burma as land finance, strangling the Burmese farmers.

The status of India and Indians in Burma gradually became an important factor sufficient to dominate Burmese national life. Among the nearly two million Indians, one-third were laborers, and two-thirds were engaged in trade and general commerce. The government offices and transportation agencies were also full of Indians. Among the more than 1,000 Burmese factory workers, Indians accounted for 75%, especially in Rangoon, where Indian laborers accounted for 95% of unskilled workers and 70% of skilled workers. Burmese workers, mainly oil workers, had a lower standard of living and quality compared to Indians. Only in Upper Burma was the original state of Burma still preserved to some extent. Most of the automobile transportation industry, household industry, printing industry, etc., were still engaged in by Burmese people. In recent years, due to the opening of the Burma Road, the power of overseas Chinese has also increased in Upper Burma.

The usurious capital that cruelly exploited the vast majority of Burmese residents—80% of farmers—was everywhere, with its blood-sucking cell network covering almost every inch of land and every Burmese person. They lent money to Burmese farmers during the busy farming season to collect high interest rates. If the farmers were unable to repay, they would confiscate their land. Due to the stimulation of land confiscation, the price of rice plummeted in 1930. According to statistics at that time, the amount of financing provided by "Chettiar" to land was more than 500 million rupees, accounting for two-thirds of the total financing amount of 750 million rupees in Burma. As a result, the self-cultivating farmers' land in Lower Burma, which was 72.1% in 1928, decreased to 54.2% in 1930; the self-cultivating farmers' land in Upper Burma decreased from 90% to 86.3%. Usurious capital swept away the land of Burmese self-cultivating farmers, causing a panic in Burmese agriculture.

In order to avoid the independence movement, Britain allowed Burma to implement autonomy in 1937 and was no longer a province of India. It used political deception and military superiority to consolidate its exploitation and plunder in Burma.

The most important resource of Burma, the petroleum industry, was founded in 1886 (the 12th year of the Qing Guangxu reign) and was exclusively occupied by the Burma Oil Company (capital of 18.5 million pounds), which maintained close relations with the British government. Its lead, silver, zinc, tin, etc. were also controlled by the Burma Chamber of Commerce with strong British power as its background. The logging of forests and the sale of rice, etc., were also monopolized by the Steel Brothers Trading Company, which was composed of British capital, and the Bombay Burma Trading Corporation, which was also a British company. The rice milling industry was also the largest under British management. Although there were only 45 out of the 640 rice mills in Burma, the number of workers they employed reached 20,000; the 300 rice mills operated by Burmese people employed only 10,000 workers; the 150 rice mills operated by Indians and overseas Chinese employed about 5,000 workers each. Therefore, from whatever angle, British capital was firmly the center of the Burmese economy, monopolizing the main sectors of rice milling, mining, and forestry. British people in Burma occupied the most important positions in Burmese politics, economy, and military, either as high officials and soldiers, or as big businessmen and entrepreneurs.

According to a report by British Under-Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs Butler in the House of Commons in 1937, British investment in Burma was 60 million to 70 million pounds, and Indians invested 70 million rupees (equivalent to 5.25 million pounds). It can be seen that British investment in Burma also accounted for an overwhelming majority. Therefore, we can say that before the Greater East Asia War, although the political position had begun to waver, the British economic superiority in Burma was still deeply rooted.

(VI) Overseas Chinese in Burma

Burma and China have had relations for at least a thousand years. From the perspective of ethnic distribution, from the perspective of economic structure and production methods, and from the perspective of geographical and cultural relations, the relationship between China and Burma is very close. In fact, a history of Burma, especially the cultural history of Burma, cannot be separated from China and India. In particular, the Chinese people and the native Burmese people have generally been the most friendly and loving nations in the past, and no one has the ambition to invade. Among the overseas Chinese in Burma, the compatriots from Yunnan, Fujian, and Guangdong are the most numerous. The most important occupations are small business and handicrafts, and there are also many farmers. Most of the workers in mining are also overseas Chinese, most of whom come from Yunnan. Because the overseas Chinese have absolutely no political ambitions, and have always stood on the side of the oppressed nations in resisting British imperialism, sympathizing with and aiding the Burmese national independence movement, they have a general and genuine good impression in Burma.

### Women's Circles Held Yesterday: March 8th Commemorative Meeting - Proceeds from Paper Flower Charity Sale Entirely for Relief of Poor Women

Yesterday was March 8th, Women's Day. The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association specially held a city-wide women's commemorative meeting at the City Chamber of Commerce auditorium in Tianhougong Bridge at 10:00 AM. Details are recorded as follows:

Attendance from Various Quarters

The venue was set up in the auditorium of the City Chamber of Commerce. A long red banner with the words "General Assembly Title" was hung high at the entrance, flanked by two national flags. The platform in the meeting hall was decorated with a high colorful dais, with various colored silk curtains crossed. Colorful slogans were posted all over the walls. Government officials and guests attending included Mayor Chen Gongbo, his wife, and Minister of Social Welfare Ding Mocun, as well as Zhang Kechang, Director of the Shanghai Office of the Ministry of Social Welfare, and Luo Shouzhang, Yu Yaoqiu, Chen Dongbai, etc. Hu Shouqi and Liu Qimin, secretaries and directors of the Municipal Bureau of Social Welfare, Principal Zhao Zhengping, Wu Jiyu representing Yuan Ludeng, Chairman of the City Chamber of Commerce, and representatives from the City Women's Association, the Chinese Women's Progressive Association, the Chinese Young Women's Christian Association, the City Women's Welfare Association, and friendly foreign women's groups, including Tokuda Aziko of the East Asian Women's Association and Ota Asako of the Shanghai Situation Women's Association, totaled no less than four hundred people.

Flower Sale Results

The Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association, in order to relieve poor women, launched a paper flower charity sale on the 7th of this month. Fifty teams were organized by the city's girl scouts to go to various important intersections, movie theaters, tea houses, coffee shops, parks, and other entertainment venues in the city to solicit donations. With the assistance of various parties, over 7,000 paper flowers were sold throughout the day. Before the commencement of yesterday morning's assembly, the donations were unsealed in public under the supervision of Social Welfare Minister Ding Mocun. After sorting, Miss Huang Yunping achieved the highest donation collection. The total donations collected throughout the day amounted to 12,081.90 National Currency yuan and 31.83 Military Scrip yuan. The Women's Association will allocate these funds to women and children relief organizations after the meeting to support this charitable cause.

Madam Chen's Speech

The original text of Mayor Chen's wife's speech at the Shanghai Special Municipality Women's Association is as follows: "Distinguished guests, sisters, I am very happy and gratified to be here today to participate in this International Women's Day and receive your guidance. However, amidst this happiness and gratification, a few thoughts arise, which I would like to share with you for your reference. I welcome your guidance if there is anything inappropriate.

Firstly, regarding the history of International Women's Day and the status of international women, I believe that all compatriots attending this conference today are aware, so there is no need for me to elaborate in this short time. What I want to talk about now is the issue of Chinese women's knowledge and morality. I advocate that Chinese women's knowledge should catch up and increase day by day. With sufficient new knowledge, we can shoulder the epoch-making mission of today's New China. However, in terms of morality, we must not be overly left-leaning. In other words, thoughts should be new, and morality should be old. This is the viewpoint I have held throughout my life. As the ancients said, 'If one is not upright, one's orders will not be followed.' I have been deeply influenced by this educational thought. Therefore, I believe that the starting point of morality is nothing more than the four virtues of propriety, justice, integrity, and shame.

Secondly, I advocate that women should engage in education and charitable work. I feel that women's physiology, psychology, and temperament are all different from men's. This is natural and difficult to change. Because of these differences, our women's work does not necessarily have to be the same as men's. For example, now that the Greater East Asia War is expanding, do we women have to go to the front lines with the soldiers to be considered patriotic and to have fulfilled our responsibilities? No, I believe that it is more important for us to assist the soldiers in the rear. I have already discussed this principle in my article 'My Family Life' published in the Women's Asahi Shimbun. I also feel that women's nature is biased towards emotion, which is a good thing for women. If she is biased towards reason and lacks emotion, she cannot maintain the family and raise children. In short, women's physiology, psychology, and temperament are all suitable for engaging in education and charitable work, especially the important responsibility of family education, which must be borne by women. Without good family education, relying solely on school education cannot achieve satisfactory results.

Thirdly, I do not advocate women's participation in politics. I have observed that women's nature is biased towards emotion and does not emphasize reason. However, political issues concern the major policies of the country, where every reform and appointment of personnel directly affects the country's lifeline. Even a slight carelessness can lead to the loss of sovereignty and humiliation. The ancients said, 'One word can make a country prosper, and one word can make a country perish.' Looking back at the past and present, how many women have participated in politics? The past is to the present as the present is to the past. We should know when to advance and when to retreat. Furthermore, women should not participate in politics until their abilities and knowledge are sufficient. Even if they have sufficient knowledge and abilities, they should still use their own skills. If they only rely on their background and attach themselves to the power of others to dabble in politics and argue for the sake of argument, it will not only harm the country and society but may even lead to disgrace and ruin, leaving no room for regret. I hope that Chinese women will have a clear understanding of this point and not act rashly.

Fourthly, I support women in promoting proper entertainment, first and foremost by cherishing and loving themselves. As the saying goes, 'Poverty and meanness cannot corrupt, wealth and honor cannot move, and power and force cannot subdue.' This is called womanhood. At all times, we must intensify our own work. After finishing our work, we should promote proper entertainment, because proper entertainment not only makes ourselves feel happy physically and mentally, but also allows us to appreciate our friends and influence our families. I believe that human nature is 'similar at birth.' When we enter a good environment, evil people gradually become good. When we enter a bad environment, good people also gradually become evil. This is the principle of 'similar at birth, but different through habit.' I hope everyone pays attention.

I have spoken for too long. Now, to summarize, I hope that all women will muster their spirits and do their jobs well. Then, the epoch-making New China will naturally prosper, and we will feel at ease and will not have spent today's Women's Day in vain. Let us work together."

Yesterday's commemorative event was very enthusiastic. The presidium of the assembly also sent a respectful telegram to Chairman Wang and Central Committee Member Chen Bijun to pay their respects.

### Japanese Staff Officer Talks About the Recent Situation in Guangzhou Bay

A staff officer of the Japanese Expeditionary Force in China, who participated in the landing in Guangzhou Bay last month and negotiated with the French Chief Administrator of the Guangzhou Bay Leased Territory, Tremanck, on the peaceful entry, has recently returned to Shanghai. According to him, the operation initially caused great agitation among the residents, but the non-interference policy towards the French administration stabilized the people's hearts, and the area has now recovered its past prosperity. The French administrative organs in Guangzhou Bay, from the Chief Administrator down to the department heads and the police captain, consist of only three people. Three hundred Guangdong people and one hundred Annamese are responsible for security. The population consists of over 230,000 Li and Guangdong people, while there are only sixty French people. The staff officer continued that the soil in the area is clay and sandy, making it unsuitable for agriculture. Most of the food supply depends on imports from the mainland. Therefore, during the entry, although the outer areas were strictly guarded, the inflow of materials was allowed freely, so there was no shortage of food or other unrest. However, due to the impact of high prices in non-peaceful areas, prices have risen sharply. A pack of ten cigarettes sells for twenty yuan. The French authorities are currently seeking countermeasures.

### Sino-Japanese Cultural Association Commemorates Participation in the War - Cash Prize for Lyrics

Since Chairman Wang of the National Government resolutely declared war on Britain and the United States, national morale has been high, and the significance of China's participation in the war has been deeply understood. The Shanghai branch of the Sino-Japanese Cultural Association, in order to arouse the public's commemoration of China's participation in the war, has published an advertisement offering a cash prize for lyrics for the Chinese Participation in the War Commemorative March. The theme must be profound and the wording concise, with simplicity and popularity as the main focus. The best works, after passing the review, will be awarded a prize of 500 yuan in currency for the first place, 200 yuan for the second place, and 100 yuan for the third place. The submission period is from now until March 25th. Entrants must write clearly in ink or pen, affix their name stamp, and indicate their detailed address. Submissions must be sent to No. 15 Jisi Feier Road before the deadline. Once all reviews are completed, a date will be set, and a special letter will be sent to notify the winners, and the results will be published in various newspapers.

### Sino-Japanese Women's Forum

The Shanghai Women's Welfare Association, in view of the past failure of thorough cooperation between Chinese and Japanese women, held the first Sino-Japanese Women's Forum at the Dakele Cafe on Nanjing Road at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 8th), which was Women's Day. Over a hundred people, including Mayor Chen's wife, attended and proposed various cooperation plans. Later, Zhao Wenyi, the president of the association, reported on the general situation of the association's work as follows: (1) Continue to hold Sino-Japanese Women's Forums every month, scheduled for the second Sunday afternoon of each month at 2:00 PM at the Xinya Restaurant on Nanjing Road. (2) Run a women's voluntary school, which can be realized on April 1st. (3) Run a Japanese language tutoring school, also starting on April 1st. (4) Raise funds to establish a nursery to serve working women.

Yesterday's newspaper was issued at 7:40 PM.

### Baojia Youth Department Intensifies Strict Training - General Review Canceled

Since its establishment, the Public Concession Baojia Youth Department has seen a daily increase in members, all of whom have undergone strict training. The aim is to cultivate young people, strengthen their physique, foster a spirit of service to society, and assist the police in maintaining local security. According to the person in charge of the department, the training is currently being intensified and has not yet been completed. In addition, the association was scheduled to hold a parade on the anniversary of the death of the Founding Father and assist the police in maintaining traffic and promoting a no-spitting campaign, and to camp out overnight at the racecourse the night before.

### Shanghai Cultural Circles Today

— Sun Yirang

For this issue of the Shen Bao Monthly, we solicited articles on the theme of "Shanghai Cultural Circles Today," and we received enthusiastic submissions from readers. Due to the limited space in the monthly, we were unable to include all of them, so we have selected a few to be reprinted in this newspaper. — Editor's Note

According to the original meaning of the word "culture," it is indeed quite broad and complex—but here we can only narrow the scope to refer to so-called "publications," that is, the literary aspect of "writing on bamboo and silk."

On the surface, "culture" seems to be an abstract term, but in practice, the germination and development of culture must be closely coordinated with material conditions; in particular, political and economic gains and losses are the most important factors determining the rise and fall of culture. Reasoning from this, the reason why the cultural circles in Shanghai were once so desolate and barren is probably no more than the fact that the political situation at that time had not yet improved. Using a more refined analogy, the "literary garden" at that time was like a wilderness a few months ago: everywhere was withered and desolate.

However, as the times changed, so did human affairs, and looking back at the "turning point" of the Shanghai cultural circles, it seems that it began after the return to the capital. Following this, various facilities and organizations gradually got on track, and in the cultural circles, there were also signs of recovery. Thus, there was vigor, and thus there was enthusiasm, even if it was not entirely satisfactory, it was not entirely unsatisfactory, and compared with the past mess, today's vigor was more obvious.

As for "Shanghai Cultural Circles Today," a common saying can be used to describe it: good and bad are mixed. In other words, there are also publications that maintain a rigorous attitude and a good standard. I happen to have a few recently published periodicals on hand, such as "Cosmos," "Ancient and Modern," and "The Magazine." Here, I will take "Ancient and Modern," which has been published for more than a year, as a concrete example.

The president of "Ancient and Modern" is Zhu Puzhi. Although he has held many important positions in the party and government, his interest is inclined towards cultural undertakings. And the rise of "Ancient and Modern" was also during the autumn of the cultural circles at that time. According to its inaugural statement, it was "wanting to do something that we think we can barely manage to do at this time when the publishing world is extremely silent." This is indeed a fact: and it can also be said that it has opened up this revival of the publishing atmosphere, and it is a praiseworthy achievement. Unlike the "Cosmos" monthly and other publications before it, it has been able to overcome various difficulties and restrictions and has continued to support itself to this day, and it has also maintained an appropriate standard. This spirit is also admirable. As for the rigor of the material selection of "Ancient and Modern" and the uniqueness of its style, in the current situation of scattered writers and empty themes, it must be said to be extremely rare. In particular, several articles by famous people can make self-criticisms on their personal lives, experiences, and personalities, which makes people feel more intimate and interesting—speaking of articles by famous people, if they are not written by highly skilled artists, they often have a defect: either they are shallow and perfunctory, or they are dry and didactic. But as far as the articles published in "Ancient and Modern" are concerned, the author's sincerity and feelings are engraved between the lines! "Seeing the big from the small," it allows readers to see their shadows and glimpse their minds, their spirit, and their talent, and naturally inspires admiration and encouragement after reading. Compared with deliberately made maxims and creeds, its effect is not the same. As for other works, although not every article is worth reading, seven or eight out of ten still have a value to read. In short, regardless of the distance in the degree of appreciation due to the reader's interest and preferences, the serious working attitude of the editors and the high standard are consistent impressions. Although some people may say that it is just moving antiques and retelling old stories, but at this time and in this place, it should be looked at differently to examine, explore, and promote meaningful historical materials, anecdotes, and admirable figures, right? In addition, "The Magazine" monthly, which belongs to the New China newspaper system, although it feels a bit too "miscellaneous" in a few places, is still worthy of the word "solid" on the whole.

This is one of the more hardworking groups in the Shanghai cultural circles today.

But on the other hand, there are many things that make people feel uncomfortable, and I just want to fulfill my humble duty to speak out, that is, the goals and attitudes of some cultural people's activities, which I think must be corrected and reflected upon. Due to the limitations of the current real conditions, it is true that there are many things that cannot be done, but it is also an undeniable shortcoming that some people in the cultural circles do not make serious and conscientious efforts in their subjective aspects—especially when paper merchants are adding fuel to the fire, if we run one more boring publication or write one more boring article, it is tantamount to increasing unnecessary consumption and meaningless waste for the country. What's more, cultural people and paper are originally tools that depend on each other, and they should have extra care and cherishing.

But naturally, such a statement is inevitably problematic. Because the boundary between so-called boring and "interesting" is where, and how is its standard chosen? Is it that besides the great articles of "managing the country and making the fields wild," everything else is not worth mentioning?

Indeed, the distinction between these two makes the responder quite hesitant. However, although the rights and wrongs of the world are said to be inconsistent, if we can decide based on the likes and dislikes of the majority of people, it will probably not be far off. One example is: when a publication is sent to the vast number of readers, at least one characteristic can be seen, that is, the editor's seriousness and carelessness, rigor and perfunctoriness. Like some publications—fortunately, they are still a minority—we can tell at a glance that they are full of gimmicks and business acumen, and they are blindly catering to the tastes of vulgar readers.

But naturally, we will never shout high-sounding slogans about how to "advance" or be "righteous." In the current situation, with the perseverance and money to run a "cultural undertaking," it seems to have become a matter of course that publishers cannot ignore "business acumen." However, I also think that even so, we still have to have a sense of proportion and moderation. When we talk, it seems that everyone can say a set of beautiful sentences about "culture" and "spiritual food," which are grand and upright, and can be written with a stroke of the pen. Therefore, when we really do it one day, we must also consider the practical effect of "culture" to some extent. Even in terms of "business acumen," we should also consider the cost of the "patrons" and readers to some extent, so that they can take back a little real food and add a little good nutrition, and not just circle around the readers' turbid tastes. We should maintain a little dignity and purity for culture. When drinking water, remember the source, we are ultimately cultural people!

But today, making this kind of "inopportune" argument will inevitably be laughed at as "the opinion of a bookworm." For example, many shortsighted people, seeing some phenomena of political corruption and overbearing, and the atmosphere of commercial speculation and manipulation, are all surrounded by the mentality of getting by and living a drunken life, so some wriggling people in the cultural circles first feel "envious," which is not enough, and then they feel "itchy." The reason is: anyway, everyone is doing this, why not fish in troubled waters! In this way, all kinds of fragrant, soft, and seductive pornographic literature have emerged under this mentality. But we still have to think rationally: the country and society, after all, have higher expectations and more preferential treatment for cultural people. Therefore, our mission and task cannot be compared with those of corruption and speculation. We don't have to complain about others not paying attention, as long as we do it rigorously, our spirit will definitely have a noble and respectable harvest, and the vast number of readers will definitely stand on the side of the rigorous workers! Let us listen to the words of those cultural people who are struggling to stay in Paris: "Their conscience tells them to stay in their wounded motherland." Today's cultural people in Shanghai, if they really want to contribute some sweat and ink for "the wounded motherland," then please set foot on the suffering land and do something practical, and at least, don't create cultural toxins anymore.

Secondly, in addition to the above-mentioned pornographic literature taking the opportunity to stir up trouble, that is, some more pure publications, in terms of quality, are still weak and uncoordinated, and besides the "Ancient and Modern" mentioned above, which can stand alone and form a unique style, there are very few, otherwise, its sales will be limited. Therefore, publishers and editors have to adopt a variety of strategies. After reading them, it can be said that everything is available, and there is nothing that is not strange; because most writers are scattered, those who remain in Shanghai feel few, and these "few" have either changed careers or put down their pens. Therefore, when we open a newly published periodical, we feel more and more monotonous and dull. And among these writers, due to the instability of life, the emptiness of materials, and the confusion of mind, it is difficult to get outstanding works. At the same time, the situation in terms of single-volume books seems even more desolate. For example, the Commercial Press, which used to be called "one book a day," has hardly published half a book in the past year or so! It cannot but be said to be a great regret that such a representative of China's largest cultural institution is living such a cold life. As for other publishing institutions below it, it is not necessary to say more. This is of course a long story, but the biggest reason is the surging price of paper. Zuo Si of the Jin Dynasty wrote the "Three Capitals Rhapsody," and there is a saying that "the paper in Luoyang is expensive," which was a compliment at that time, but it is a sharp satire now! On this point, we sincerely hope that the relevant authorities can make a grand plan as soon as possible, and should reasonably control it like other daily necessities. Then, further, for a small number of boring and vulgar publications and newspapers, whether it is elimination or merger, in short, there must be a way to regulate and distribute evenly, so that we can "take from the surplus to make up for the deficiency."

Finally, there should also be some subsidies and rewards for some cultural people who are truly buried in hard work and are poor and lonely. Although the "selling articles for a living" literati in today's world are not selling articles to die, but with their inherently weak bodies, dealing with such high prices is undoubtedly approaching "death"! And how can we expect the emergence of "great works"? And how can we stop them from lamenting poverty and complaining? Like some of the literati who have changed their ways, it is because their writing income is not enough to support a family of eight, but for the sake of the entire culture, it is a serious loss.

"Governing is not in many words, but in how to implement it"? At this time of storms and darkness, whether it is in charge of the country's politics or in charge of the pen's politics, we must keep these two sentences in mind. Then we must encourage each other and raise each other up to make the cockcrow in the faint dawn, breaking the desolate literary garden, and then waking up a corner of the East!

Economic Circles

### On the National Government's New Economic Policy

During a meeting held by the Supreme National Defense Council on March 5th, a proposal was passed regarding Minister of Industry Mei Siping's plan for the government to implement control over essential materials and manage and stabilize commodity prices. This proposal includes an important decree, which states that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic entities and should not participate in political movements. At first glance, this point may seem like a minor detail, but in reality, any government, in order to maintain public interest, should never use political power for commercial operations. As far as we know, the National Government already has statutory provisions prohibiting officials from engaging in commercial activities, which is the same idea.

According to national laws, government personnel or members of society should either be officials or merchants, and should not simultaneously be both officials and merchants. This is because in any situation, whether in peacetime or wartime, a person who is simultaneously active in both official and commercial circles cannot act in the best interests of the public. The result will inevitably be political corruption, which is contrary to the government's goal of protecting the public interest. Conversely, members of society, due to their own positions, should not be allowed to participate in political activities. This is a regulation that exists in various countries around the world. Therefore, Minister Mei's proposal should be supported by the entire public, as it is not only a characteristic of Nanjing's new economic policy but also a prerequisite for promoting public interest.

Secondly, Minister Mei's original proposal recognizes a close relationship between the prices of goods and the supply and demand of goods. From this, it is known that the price of manufactured goods is tied to the price of raw materials. Therefore, the relationship between the supply and demand of goods is of utmost importance, and strengthening wartime economic power is the central point of Minister Mei's entire proposal. (Translated from the March 8th issue of The Times)

Economic Commentary

### Further Discussion on Strengthening Trade Associations

Trade associations are important organizations in the private economy and should be given power and full authority to exercise their functions and assist the government in implementing wartime economic policies. On the 5th of this month, the National Defense Council, in order to implement government control over essential materials and manage and stabilize commodity prices, stipulated that industrial and commercial organizations should be purely economic entities so that they can concentrate on assisting the government in implementing various economic policies. The original proposal stated that stabilizing people's livelihoods and strengthening economic power are the primary urgent tasks for the government's administration under the wartime system. Now, the government should implement control over essential materials to adjust and rationalize production, distribution, and consumption. Regarding commodity prices and the supply and demand of goods, there is a close relationship between them, and management should also be implemented simultaneously to prevent speculation and hoarding, which would make it difficult to suppress prices. All kinds of industrial and commercial organizations are the main bodies for implementing commodity control and maintaining price equilibrium. Therefore, they should be designated as purely economic institutions. In the future, any political movements and training should be aimed at the Baojia system and should no longer be conducted within the scope of industrial and commercial organizations. This is to ensure the sound organization of industrial and commercial organizations, which will be conducive to the implementation of commodity control and price stabilization policies.

This regulation can not only correct the past shortcomings of industrial and commercial organizations, which only knew how to entertain officials and engage in meetings and speeches, but also strengthen the basic work within the scope of the industrial and commercial organizations themselves. The basic organization of industrial and commercial organizations is the trade association, with the chamber of commerce as its overall body. In the past, trade associations often had only a nominal existence without any practical substance, and were already equivalent to a ceremonial sheep offered without substance. With this kind of powerless and incompetent trade association, wanting it to cope with the extremely important wartime economic policy would be obviously ineffective. Now, by giving it full authority and increasing its power, allowing it to focus on the production, distribution, and adjustment of consumption of materials without involving political movements, it will be able to devote its full efforts to rationalizing the prices of materials and the supply and demand, thereby clarifying the individual's position and fulfilling the government's expectations.

However, in order for it to exert its power, all factories and firms should be forced to join the trade association, so that they have an absolute obligation to obey, and they must never resist the power of the trade association. In the future, the purchase of goods, the shipment of goods, the purchase of materials, manufacturing, and all kinds of facilities among the same industry can only be carried out under unified control and absolute compliance. Once the prices of goods are set, they must never be violated or increased or decreased privately. The association can adopt the method of joint commitment, with several families as a group, and each group provides mutual guarantee, and inspections are intensified from time to time. If violations are discovered, severe punishments will be immediately imposed. In this way, the trade association will have heavier responsibilities and more complicated work, and of course, it will have no time for activities outside its own business. Taking the Chinese stock industry as an example, if a trade association had been organized earlier, giving the industry a scope and conducting spot transactions within the framework, with normal business as the principle, and buying and selling within the regulations, how could there be so many problems from time to time, so that the industry is often in panic and fluctuating, spending its years. It can be seen that strengthening the trade association can not only assist the government in implementing economic strategies, but also, for the sake of the industry itself, it is sufficient to plan the safety of business and seek the stability of transactions. For both the public and private sectors, it is a win-win situation.

### Chinese Stock Industry Held Temporary Meeting Yesterday to Select Fifteen People as a Temporary Delegation to Discuss Resumption of Business with Relevant Authorities

Since the Chinese stock market suspended trading, the authorities have already stipulated registration methods for Chinese stock firms. In the future, any Chinese stock firms that are legally registered and approved and have a license to operate stock trading will be considered legal. Therefore, all stock companies are currently going through the procedures to prepare for resumption of business. However, before the official resumption of business, some companies, considering that the industry does not yet have a trade association, face many obstacles in promoting their business. Therefore, Yongchang, Xingye, Lemao and 26 other stock companies jointly invited the industry in the city to gather at Xinghualou on Simalu at 2 pm yesterday. They discussed ways to organize a trade association, and at the same time, the resumption of the Chinese stock market was the focus of discussion. The details of yesterday afternoon's meeting are as follows:

Representatives Attending

It is estimated that there are no less than one or two hundred firms in this city that engage in the trading of Chinese stocks, so-called stock companies. However, due to the lack of organization, the industry has been very disorganized. Although there was news of forming a trade association once in August and September of last year, it unfortunately ended in failure. This gathering of the industry had a total of 131 representatives attending, including Liangji, Yongchang, and Xingye. The scale can be described as unprecedented in the history of the industry. The Special High Section of the Public Works Department also sent Qian Shuntang to the scene to monitor the meeting.

Preparation Process

The initial initiators of this meeting were a small number of enthusiastic members of the industry, such as Yu Mingshi of Xingye Stock Company, Zhang Yilin of Guotai Stock Company, and Zhou Lundi of Huashang Stock Company. It is said that an informal meeting in the form of a prototype had been convened once before, and it was decided on the spot that the 29 stock companies attending the meeting, including Xingye and Lemao, would jointly issue a letter to invite the entire industry to hold a temporary gathering, and at the same time notify the competent authorities to send personnel to attend the meeting.

Motivation for the Meeting

Yu Mingshi was publicly elected as the temporary chairman of the meeting. Then, Zhang Yilin and Zhou Lundi separately stated the purpose and process of preparing for and inviting the entire industry to the meeting. Zhang and Zhou emphasized the importance of the Chinese stock business in the entire commerce and finance, and then frankly admitted that "in the past, the industry's operation of Chinese stock trading may have had errors in procedures, at least the competent authorities have considered that there must be errors." Therefore, in order to break the current serious and depressing stalemate, and to seek instructions from the relevant authorities on a legal way to operate Chinese stocks as soon as possible, the motivation for yesterday's first meeting was formed.

Glimpse of the Topics

The focus of the meeting's discussion was almost entirely on the point of sending a delegation to seek a solution to the resumption of business. Although some people also advocated the immediate establishment of a permanent organization similar to a trade association, the majority of opinions seemed to focus more on clarifying the current stalemate. Therefore, the only decision at the end was to elect 15 industry representatives to form a "Temporary Delegation of the Chinese Stock Industry," which was authorized by the general meeting to contact the relevant authorities to find out how to resume normal operations in order to comply with the government authorities' intention to control commodity prices and other laws.

Elected Representatives

Following the election of the delegation, the fifteen elected representatives are as follows: Zhang Xiaoxian, Zhou Lundi, Yu Mingshi, Yin Wenzhao, Zhao Tiezhang, Zhang Yilin, Ma Weiyuan, Sun Wencheng, Han Jixiang, Lu Junfu, Shen Zhangfu, Yao Zhaotang, Wang Dunfu, Jin Songgan, Zheng Xuegao.

### Shanghai Silver and Money Industry Decides on Prudent Lending Principles

Following the Ministry's order to prevent speculation and hoarding and suppress commodity prices, the Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee and the Money Industry Joint Reserve have implemented tight restrictions on interbank lending among members. All banks and money shops have decided on the following principles for all lending, including mortgages, credit, and overdrafts: (1) Mortgage loans: Extreme caution should be exercised when providing loans secured by goods. Loans related to daily necessities for people's livelihoods should be refused. Those that have already been made should be redeemed within a specified period and should absolutely not be extended. Applications for mortgages from legitimate merchants in various industries must guarantee that the goods they hold are not for speculation and profiteering, and are limited to the goods of their respective industries. For example, the cotton cloth industry is only allowed to use the cotton cloth it operates as collateral, and no loans can be made with other commodities as collateral. The industrial and commercial firms applying for loans must be members of the industry association, and the term shall not exceed two months at most, and the purpose of the loan must be stated. After the loan has been approved after examination, the lending bank or money shop has the right to immediately recover the loan if it finds that the use of the loan is improper. (2) Credit loans: The term is six months, and according to the usual practice, it is divided into four draws, ten draws, and two installments. However, from now on, special care should be taken to tighten them, and they should be limited to old customers with good credit and those engaged in production. (3) There must be a reliable guarantor responsible for repaying the principal and interest. Short-term credit loans are handled at the discretion of the banks and money shops, and the maximum amount of the loan is limited depending on the business situation of the borrower. Regarding overdrafts, they are handled according to the original overdraft amount, and it is absolutely not allowed to exceed the overdraft amount. As for companies and firms that do not produce, they will be stopped altogether, as they may use credit loans and overdraft funds to speculate and manipulate market prices, as well as hoard goods and raise prices for profit. It is said that after the banks and money shops implemented the above restrictions, speculative merchants who use loan funds from banks and money shops will inevitably suffer a great blow. This move will help curb speculation, hoarding, and price fluctuations, so that legitimate merchants can legally operate their businesses.

### List of Banks That Have Held Inaugural Meetings

Recently, new banks have been established in this city like mushrooms after rain. In addition to those that have officially opened, there are still 23 that have held inaugural meetings but have not yet officially opened. The names of the banks, the amount of capital, the date of the inaugural meeting, and the address or telephone number are listed below. "Note": Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise is a transformation of Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise Company (A)

### Central Reserve Bank Raises Deposit Interest Rates to Around Two Fen Per Week

In order to absorb floating capital in the market and maintain the value of reserve certificates, the Central Reserve Bank plans to revise its deposit interest rates in the shortest possible time. The bank's deposit interest rate is currently one fen per week, while the general Chinese banks in the city are above two fen. Therefore, the total amount of deposits in the bank is decreasing day by day. The degree of future increase is expected to be around two fen. In addition, the interest rate of the Central Reserve Bank is similar to that of the six Japanese banks, and this matter must be agreed upon with the Japanese banks before it can be formally decided.

### Two Banks' Checks Exchanged on Behalf of Each Other, Seven Money Shops Join the Money Bank

The Shanghai Banking Association Preparatory Committee began to exchange Cai bills from Yizhong and China Porcelain Banks on behalf of each other from yesterday (8th), and assigned the Yizhong Bank's exchange number as 53-12 and China Porcelain's exchange number as 53-14.

In addition, because the association approved the Money Bank's letter stating that the seven money shops of Tongxing, Defeng, Chengyu, Yongjia, Jianchang, Shenyu, and Yuantai have joined the bank as members, from yesterday (8th), the association will handle the collection of payment bills from the seven money shops in accordance with the methods of other member shops.

### Flat-Priced Soybeans, Delivery Begins

The flat-priced soybeans of the Shanghai Grain and Sundries Group began to be shipped on the 6th, and the extraction continued yesterday. It is said that those who went to ship the goods in two days included 207 packages from the French Concession, totaling 1,071 packages, 43 from Zhabei, totaling 223 packages, and 236 from Nanshi, totaling 1,160 packages. There are also areas in the Public Concession and Hongkou in West Shanghai that will pick up the goods in the near future. As for the request for allocation from the Pudong tofu industry, it has been approved. However, it is worth noting whether the retail stores sell these soybeans at flat prices.

### Allocation of Cooking Oil, Manufacturing Should Be Sold

The system of rationing cooking oil based on population is about to be realized, but the date of commencement has not yet been determined. According to the wholesale office of the cooking oil industry, the authorities are actively distributing large quantities of soybean raw materials to seven oil extraction plants in the city, including Wanming, Yoshida, Rihua, Taishan, and Coating Oil, to speed up manufacturing. It is expected that a considerable amount will be available for sale in the near future. Therefore, the oil allocated this time is likely to be soybean oil.

### Foreign Economic News

Chile Controls Excessive Profits

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, March 7th, Havas News Agency - The Chilean government recently submitted a bill to Congress proposing to control excessive profits in industry and commerce. Any company whose profits exceed 15% of the company's capital must set aside a certain amount. 40% of this additional profit must be used to increase work efficiency, and the remaining 60% must be invested in special bonds issued by public economic associations. These bonds are guaranteed by the state with an interest rate of 3% to 5%.

At the same time, the Chilean government requested Congress to set price limits for all raw materials, daily necessities, rent, and wages, based on the price limits implemented on December 1, 1942. The proposal also gives the president broad powers to decide on economic controls, as well as wages and working hours.

US Butchers Fined for Overpricing

Lisbon, March 7th, Allied News Agency - The US Federal Court in Boston, Massachusetts, accused the president of a Boston meat wholesale company last Friday of selling beef and mutton above the price limits set by the government. The lawsuit arose from the black market price problem, and this is the first time this has happened.

UK Merges Industrial Organizations

Stockholm, Sweden, March 7th, Havas News Agency - A British Labor Party spokesman claimed that in view of the labor shortage in the UK, all industrial organizations will be merged in order to obtain surplus labor for wartime production work. At the same time, married women will be employed to participate in production work. Housewives with larger families will be asked to work part-time.

US Implements Partial Prohibition

Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, March 7th, Havas News Agency - Although the majority of US senators still oppose the complete prohibition of alcohol in the United States, many support the Canadian and British methods of restricting the time and hours of daily alcohol sales.

Governor of US State Hoards Whiskey

Lisbon, March 7th, Havas News Agency - It was reported last night that the Governor of the State of Aha A in the United Kingdom recently hoarded 38,000 barrels of whiskey produced in Kandaki to prevent panic in the state's liquor market. However, this hoarding of alcohol can be purchased by people who apply for a government license.

Manchuria Post Office Savings Increase

Changchun, March 7th, Havas World News Agency - The Manchuria Postal Administration hopes that the total amount of savings this year will reach 100 million yuan. According to the survey results in mid-February, the number of new depositors increased by 130,000, and the amount of deposits increased by 28 million yuan. According to this rate, the 100 million yuan of deposits this year may be exceeded.

Brazilian Agricultural Products are Expensive

Buenos Aires, Argentina, March 8th, Havas News Agency - A telegram from Rio de Janeiro stated that agricultural product prices are soaring, and the relevant parties are planning to establish purchasing cooperatives with branches throughout the country to sell agricultural products at low prices.

### Adjustment of Exchange Rate Between North and Central China, Specific Methods to Be Established Soon

When Mr. Wang Shijing, President of the North China United Bank, came to Shanghai earlier, he planned to promote the exchange of goods between North and Central China in financial work, and discussed various plans with the relevant parties here on this issue. As a result, all parties agreed that adjusting the exchange rate was the most appropriate method. As for the specific methods for adjusting the exchange rate, they can be established soon. This matter is of great importance to the exchange of goods, so all parties are paying close attention. Since the new year, prices in North China have fluctuated sharply due to restrictions on the movement of goods. At the same time, the financial policies in Central China have also changed due to the preparation of purchasing institutions for goods in the inland and the implementation of loan restrictions. Under the conditions of this basic situation that is about to change, a new plan for adjusting the exchange rate between the United Note and the Reserve Certificate will be implemented. (According to the trade of imports and exports between North and Central China, the United Note and the Reserve Certificate cannot be directly exchanged, but must be indirectly exchanged through special yuan. This new plan is related to the chained exchange rate of the special yuan in North China and the trade between North and Central China in the future, and the rise and fall of the United Note will also have an impact.)

Reader's Opinion

### A Humble Opinion on Production Organizations

— Zhao Xixian

"Floating capital" is capital that is detached. Capital is one of the essential elements of production. Floating capital, however, is capital that has strayed from its fundamental role in production and entered the realm of consumption. Therefore, floating capital is a burden on society even in times of peace, and its harmful effects are even more pronounced during wartime.

In recent years, as the flames of war have spread across the globe, various unique wartime phenomena such as social unrest, insufficient production, and currency devaluation have caused the owners of floating capital to feel uneasy. For their own survival, they seize their floating capital and seek an outlet, disregarding laws, morality, and the safety of the nation and society. Driven by selfish motives, they exploit every opportunity to seek profit. Furthermore, as the war expands and social unrest increases, businesses find it impossible to operate. Entrepreneurs take their capital and relocate to safe havens, where floating capital congregates and wreaks even more havoc. Thus, although floating capital is driven by selfishness, its ultimate goal is simply to find a safe haven.

Shanghai, as an international metropolis, has temporarily become a gathering place for floating capital. Unofficial estimates from banks suggest that the amount is alarmingly large. To find a way out, this massive amount of floating capital engages in currency speculation and hoarding of goods. At the same time, production sharply declines and currency values plummet, creating an opportune moment for unscrupulous operators to amass wealth from the nation's crisis. Thus, the cart is put before the horse, and it is believed that all business operations are not as profitable as engaging in speculation and hoarding, which can yield easy profits. What owner of floating capital would be willing to bury themselves in investing in and operating a production enterprise, hoping for long-term gains?

In the context of private capital today, the freedom of trade is undeniably justifiable. However, during extraordinary times of war, such behavior is akin to causing disruption in the rear. The authorities are actively cracking down on such activities. Recently, the authorities have taken the following measures to address the problems caused by floating capital: (1) cracking down on speculation involving short selling and buying, as well as hoarding; (2) restricting collateral loans; (3) raising interbank lending rates; (4) encouraging investment in rural areas.

Other proposals include establishing prize-winning lottery tickets and setting up savings departments in banks and financial institutions.

Based on the above observations, the fundamental solution to the problem of floating capital ultimately lies in economic principles. Since capital is an essential element of production, we must return to the foundation of production and guide it back to its origin, just as diverting the Huai and Yellow Rivers leads them back to the sea. Our recommendations are as follows:

(1) The government should authorize a state-owned enterprise or establish a special department to formulate a comprehensive economic construction plan, such as a three-year or five-year plan. Regarding various production sectors such as textiles, milling, afforestation, land reclamation, and animal husbandry, each sector should be classified as essential or secondary according to its nature, and the plan should be implemented accordingly.

(2) The government should issue a large-scale economic construction bond, with an amount of 300 billion or 500 billion, with an interest rate of 8%. The funds raised from the bond should be authorized to the state-owned enterprise for extensive investment based on the established plan. The main objective of various production sectors under the overall plan should be to meet the minimum needs of people's livelihood, so that the problems of overproduction and underproduction will naturally cease to exist. The phenomena of production operators avoiding hard work and seeking shortcuts, and blind investment will also disappear.

(3) The government's investment in production organizations should be in the nature of loans. If a production organization expands through investment, it will have the obligation to repay the principal and interest to the government. The benefits can be described as follows: (A) Since the government's investment in production organizations is in the nature of loans, the interest on this huge bond can be borne by the production organizations. (B) Since the government's investment is in the form of loans, the production organizations must repay the principal and interest to the government on schedule. In this way, the government can circulate the funds and invest in another production organization. (C) Since the economic construction bond is guaranteed first by the government and then by large-scale production organizations, its creditworthiness is outstanding, making it a safe haven for investment.

(4) The construction of production organizations can largely be achieved by forcibly expanding or merging existing production organizations, transforming small-scale operations into large-scale operations and modernizing them. This will save effort and yield quick results, quickly meeting the needs of the people without wasting time. Moreover, since the production organization is a modern, large-scale organization with government assistance, its creditworthiness will naturally be outstanding. However, for its own development, it can also issue shares on the open market to provide flexibility. The issuance of shares has two benefits: (A) After issuing shares, it can utilize external investment, which can accelerate the repayment of government investment and allow it to quickly build another production organization. At the very least, it should prevent delays or defaults in principal and interest payments, which would indirectly prevent the economic construction plan from being completed on schedule. (B) The issuance of shares allows production organizations to have room for expansion and contraction in the market, so that their own development does not rely solely on government support. In this way, the government can have the resources to manage other construction projects without worries. (C) These shares have outstanding creditworthiness, which will provide owners of floating capital with another safe haven.

(5) The government's investment in production organizations should have a flexible interest rate that is not uniform. Because production organizations have uneven performance, with some failing to make a profit for a long time and others making profits easily and abundantly. To provide assistance, the government should lower interest rates or exempt them from interest for those that are not easy to profit from, and raise interest rates for those that are highly profitable, in order to achieve balanced development. Investors should consider both factors, and the overall balance should be relatively even, without excessive disparity, so that there is no need to choose between one or the other.

(6) The management of production organizations must be entrusted to renowned business leaders appointed by the government, with the government only providing necessary supervision and guidance. In short, it is government supervision with merchant operation. In terms of past experience, purely government-run enterprises are overly bureaucratic and often fail. It is undeniable that the mere mention of a government-run enterprise is daunting. Therefore, to adapt to national conditions and public habits, business leaders must be engaged to manage them. In fact, a production organization that is a large-scale state-owned organization and is managed by experienced leaders is the icing on the cake, which is enough to inspire confidence.

(7) Since production organizations are state-owned, they have a monopolistic and patented nature in terms of raw material supply and market sales. Even if the profit margin is extremely thin, it will still be considerable. The government may levy a capital tax on investors in this project and use the capital tax revenue to repay part of the bond.

(8) The repayment of the principal of the bond should only begin after half of the economic construction plan has been completed. If various construction plans can be completed on schedule, the production sector itself will be able to stand on its own and absorb floating capital. Gradually, there will be no need for government funding. If all construction projects are fully completed, floating capital will be brought into line, and the government will no longer need to possess large amounts of capital.

(9) Floating capital can have a correct investment target, thereby entering the state-owned enterprise system. From the perspective of wartime economic footing, this is especially urgent at present.

In short, all government affairs cannot be carried out without finance. Capital is the driving force behind everything. This is an undeniable fact. China's production is backward, coupled with years of war. With such little capital, it is not being used for production but for detached consumption. The future of the national economy is in grave danger. Therefore, guiding it to production and returning it to its origin is an urgent task at present. At present, large amounts of floating capital are struggling to find a safe and profitable outlet. The government should lure it with benefits, provide safety guarantees, and guide it to production. Therefore, if today's floating capital can be put to good use, it may well be the driving force behind China's revitalization. Moreover, the use of bonds for construction is not comparable to the misappropriation of government funds, which is something that the public will be happy to hear. Therefore, if this plan can be implemented step by step, the current phenomenon of blind speculation, excessively inflated securities, manipulated and soaring prices, hoarding and speculation, and all kinds of anxiety and instability in people's livelihood can be swept away.

### Work and Interest

— Liuyun

Work and interest are not two unrelated things. On the contrary, to demand the greatest effect and the best results from work, we cannot ignore the factor of interest.

A person who is interested in their work will surely be able to work better, faster, and feel very competent; without the slightest pain. Even if they encounter many difficult obstacles on their work journey, they will not have the intention of retreating or becoming discouraged.

If the great inventor Edison had not been interested in research, he would not have been driven off the train; nor would he have continued his invention work after becoming deaf. It cannot be said that he had few inventions or encountered few difficulties, but he was finally able to overcome them. This was undoubtedly a gift of perseverance, but it was not without the courage that interest gave him in his work, leading him and encouraging him in disappointment to complete his life's great achievements.

Not all interests are good. We should cultivate interest in undertakings that are beneficial to people, otherwise both people and oneself will suffer.

Because of economic, environmental, and objective constraints, work cannot always suit everyone's interests, and thus the complaint of "disliking whatever line you're in" arises. To eliminate this phenomenon, we can start in two ways: first, perhaps the true interest in the work has not been discovered, so it should be cultivated through work. Second, if the work is fundamentally unsuitable for one's temperament, then one should explore where one's interests lie and cultivate them well, because with good cultivation, there will be opportunities to develop them, and it will not be unsuccessful.

Work can relieve worries, inspire new wisdom, and strengthen muscles and bones. Work is not suffering, work is interest. What is more satisfying than the joy after completing work? But what exactly is interest? I can't tell you, I can only say: "It's like a glass of fine wine, the taste is something you have to experience for yourself."

### Observation and Enlightenment

— Qiluo

Only observation can increase our knowledge, and only enlightenment can nurture our success.

Observation is a very important thing in daily life. We live in this real society of survival of the fittest, and if we do not observe accurately at all times, we will be eliminated immediately. Wild thoughts are the greatest obstacle to observation, just as a spark of fire can start a prairie fire, so we must find a way to extinguish them.

Gibberish said: "Dreamers forget their surroundings. And those who daydream are often addicted to fantasy lives and have no interest in real life." This sentence is aimed at people who are addicted to daydreaming and do not pay attention to real life.

Edison said: "The things that ordinary people remember in their minds are not even one-thousandth of what they see with their eyes. From this, we can see that our ability to observe is truly pitifully weak."

Even a great scientist like Edison, who had such a strong attention span, lamented his weak observation skills; how much more so we who enjoy his inventions. It can be seen that observation is really not an easy thing.

People often do not want to admit their shortcomings because of arrogance or timidity, and therefore, many unpredictable crises are buried in their lives. These crises can cause them to be squeezed out of the advancing ranks and become a member of disgrace.

The ancient sages had a famous saying: "Know yourself." Usually, we can list others' faults like family treasures, but what we understand the least is ourselves. There are many extremely intelligent people who are vague about their own affairs, which is why they cannot be thoroughly enlightened. Thorough enlightenment is like watching quietly from the sidelines. Because those involved are confused, and those on the sidelines are clear.

Bobbons said: "Everyone must have some undiscovered shortcomings. Many people often do not realize until they are forty or fifty years old some shortcomings that have made them encounter misfortune in their lives." Therefore, if we cannot discover our own shortcomings early and work hard to correct them. Then, we will certainly not reach the road to success easily.

We must first observe, and then we can be enlightened. If we have not discovered our own shortcomings, then we have nothing to be enlightened about. Therefore, observation and enlightenment are closely related, and at the same time, they are both elements of our success.

We must make observation and enlightenment our friends. Always by our side, reminding and helping us deal with complex affairs. We need the power of observation and the power of enlightenment.

### Ninth Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life as a Nursing Student

— Yan Huisun

I am a nursing student, a nursing student preparing to become a nurse in the future. In Chinese society, nurses are generally despised. Indeed, the work done by nurses is really base, pouring medicine and tea, and giving patients baths and holding bedpans, which seems like something that maids do. Ordinary modern girls and young ladies disdain to do it. Although I have not yet become a nurse, in the year or so of my internship, I have also done a lot of nursing work. I have seen many patients, and I feel that the most painful and boring time for a person is when they are sick, and the nurse is the caretaker for all people in their most painful and boring times, relieving patients of a lot of pain and boredom. I think this kind of work is very noble, and I think this kind of work that seeks happiness for the masses is the work that people should do!

My first year as a nursing student was only reading, reading like all the students. It was not until the beginning of the second year that I read on the one hand and did a little internship in the ordinary outpatient department of the hospital on the other hand. This outpatient department treats some patients who have not yet been bedridden, but there is not much work to do: just listening to how the doctor asks about the source of the disease, how to prescribe medicine, and how to tell the patient. And in the surgical room, helping the doctor to apply ointment and bandages to the patient.

After interning in the outpatient department for two months, I was transferred to the operating room for an internship. The operating room is a place dedicated to performing surgery. What abdominal surgery, sawing off hands and feet, cutting tumors... It really has everything, and the work I interned in was to prepare and disinfect instruments before surgery. And watch how the doctor anesthetizes the patient and how he makes the incision during surgery. At first, I was a little afraid to see the surgeon using his sharp knife to cut back and forth on the patient's body so quickly, and even turning out the internal organs, but after a few times I got used to it. Sometimes, when a relatively large operation had to be performed, the patient had to be anesthetized with ether first. At that time, the patient was completely unconscious, leaving only the pulse and heart beating, and rapid breathing. No matter what knife cut, he did not feel pain. It is really pitiful and enviable to be able to forget all the emotions at one time! When a patient with appendicitis came, I had to open the abdomen, cut off the rotten part of the intestine, and then sew it up again, which made me admire the omnipotence of science; but at the same time, I also felt the contradiction of mankind; if the lethal weapon had not been invented in the first place, why bother to think of this method of rescue?

After interning in the operating room for two months, I was transferred to the obstetrics department of the inpatient department for an internship. At this time, the work I interned in was to take care of women who were one or two months before and after childbirth, and newborn children. At this time, I realized the pain of giving birth to children, and realized that the love of a loving mother for her children was originally for the hard work of giving birth. Usually, a woman feels a burst of abdominal pain about twelve hours before she is about to give birth, shouting for her mother and father and groaning non-stop. The pain is really unbearable to hear and unbearable to see. After giving birth, she has to go through several months of physical weakness. When she encounters difficult labor, she has to use instruments or even open her abdomen to bring the child out. Giving birth to a child is really not easy! As for the children, some good ones are indeed fat, white and lovely, but some children who have inherited their parents' syphilis are very ugly! The heavy ones are as thin as firewood and die in a few days, and the light ones also become lifelong disabled. All the disabled people in the world, limping, blind, and dumb... were originally due to the inheritance of their parents' syphilis. Every time I held a syphilis child to bathe and change clothes, I always hated and complained about their parents a few words.

Four months later, I was transferred to the surgical ward of the inpatient department for an internship. At this time, my job changed to taking care of surgical patients. Those surgical patients who had undergone surgery did not feel the pain of the incision because of the anesthesia in the operating room; but when they woke up, they were in extreme pain and groaned non-stop, and they had to go through two or three days of being unable to move their whole body. Urinating and defecating had to be done in bed. This time was very in need of someone to take care of them. The rest were some patients with broken hands and feet and large sores. Many of these patients became disabled after being cured. Therefore, my four-month internship in the surgical room was every day among these patients who were about to become disabled and listening to their piercing cries of pain!

Now I have been transferred to the medical ward of the inpatient department for an internship. Chinese people are used to going to the hospital only when they are very sick, so almost all of these medical patients are dying. They are completely different from surgical patients. They have reached a state of extreme physical weakness. They cannot shout in pain like surgical patients. They just groan weakly. Some of them even faint for a few hours. Such patients are the most difficult to take care of. In addition to the daily prescribed temperature checks, pulse checks, breathing checks, medication, and injections, they also have to constantly go to the ward to take care of them. If you are not careful, there is a risk of death.

Because I am used to seeing patients, I know deeply the pain that disease brings to people, and I cannot help but feel sympathy for the patients. I always try my best to take care of them and comfort them. What makes me sad is when I encounter patients who are about to die, they mostly cannot bear to leave their families. It is true that they do not want to close their eyes in death. The inertia when they are about to die is really unbearable, and the sorrow of those who die later, the sad crying of those who die later, men, women, old, and young, often make me cry too! What is even more pitiful are those who wander in other places and die in a foreign land. There are no relatives by their side when they die. How desolate this situation is! When I see all the sorrows of this death, I really hope that I have the magic of bringing the dead back to life!

(Editor's note) The author, Yan Huisun, is eighteen years old, graduated from Shanghai Girls' Middle School, and is now studying nursing at Bethel Hospital.

### Root

— Xinbo

There was another noisy sound.

"Alas!..." Huang Chong'an sighed.

"Chongweng,..." Yang Zijie comforted.

Yu Duzhou was still staring, but Genming frowned. Yu Duzhou was indeed worried, because at this moment he remembered that a few days ago Yang Zijie had said to him on behalf of Huang Chong'an that after the lunar year, if he had merit, he would come to his private school to study. Huang Chong'an said that the private school that Yougong originally attended had poor teaching methods, which caused Yougong's temper to become worse and worse.

Genming was racking his brains to study: why did he have to eat that way when he had this to eat; why was eating this way bad, but he had to eat that way.

"Go and call Sanhua, only go and call Sanhua," the mother's slightly decisive voice, and then she raised her throat and shouted, "Aunt Qian, Aunt Qian, go and call Miss Three."

"I don't want to eat, vomit, vomit,..." he was still crying, but there was no strength in his voice, just like the distant sound of thunder. Although it was still showing its remaining power, it sounded like the trailing sound of a cicada passing by another branch. It was not terrible at all, but it showed the sadness of its imminent demise.

After a while, silence suddenly reigned over the room. The others certainly stopped talking and persuading, and even Yougong had no sound, which made the people in the study on this side secretly feel that there was an extraordinary situation in that room. No, an extraordinary figure must have appeared.

"Eat if you want to eat, or forget it. What's all the fuss about!" A clear voice resounded throughout the two rooms. "I don't think he'll eat it!" The words implied a meaning of surveillance.

"He ate it, he ate it. Third Sister, please go." Xue Fengchun said with a smile.

"I don't think he'll eat it!" This sentence came out in the courtyard, and then a series of small and rapid footsteps sent the person who said this into the study.

"Miss Three is here," Genming was the first to stand up. "Hello, Miss Three, long time no see,..." he said in a row, his attitude was very natural, very different from when he first came in.

"Uncle Wang, hello." Sincere greeting.

"You're welcome, thank you." (VII) Social Services

### Small Gifts, Big Hearts: Elementary School Students Help Teachers

Many grains of sand form a pagoda. Many tiny hairs form a fur coat.

(Letter) We are a group of elementary school students who live with our teachers every day, so we deeply understand the difficulties of the teachers' lives, but we are still children of the consumption era, "our hearts are willing, but our strength is not enough", and we can only sigh helplessly.

Since the Shih Pao Daily News launched the "Elementary School Teacher Medical Assistance Fund", it has aroused the enthusiastic sympathy of the community, which is really admirable. Although we are children, we are also a part of society, and those who are directly helped are the elementary school teachers who do their best for us day and night. Can we stand by and watch? No! Therefore, we all gathered two hundred yuan, which is a small amount, but "small gifts mean a lot," please accept it.

This amount is only one-thousandth of the 200,000 yuan target set by your newspaper, but if all the children in Shanghai can "gather sand to form a pagoda", we will definitely get satisfactory results. All the students of the Private Qicheng Elementary School.

### What Is the Most Fun Thing to Do?

— Tianyu

What is the most fun thing to do? Go to the dance hall, hug the dancer's waist, and dance a few "waltzes" and "bolos"? No! Invite three or five friends to go to a Changsan Maoer brothel and drink a few glasses of fancy wine? No! Go to a Western restaurant and eat Western food? No! Take a lover or girlfriend to the "Great Light" or "Great Shanghai" to watch a new movie? No! Take the family to the "Golden", "Empress" and "Renewal" to enjoy the famous Peking Opera actors' signature plays? No!

This is not it, and that is not it. What is the most fun thing to do? I say doing good is the most fun: that is, doing good deeds is the most fun. What is a good deed? "Relieving refugee children" is. If everyone can save as much as possible the various expenses mentioned above and send them to the Shih Pao Daily News Social Service Office, which will select and distribute them to various refugee children's education and care homes, you will be cultivating happiness and virtue for yourself and your whole family!
