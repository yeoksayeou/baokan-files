### A Glorious Page in Sino-Japanese History: Respectfully Thanking Prime Minister Tojo for Visiting China

Prime Minister Tojo's visit to China is the most glorious page in the history of the Republic of China, the beginning of true equality and close cooperation between China and Japan from theory to practice. We, the Chinese people, will forever remember this grand event—an expression of gratitude that ordinary respect cannot convey. Standing from the position of the Chinese people, towards this major event in Sino-Japanese history, we naturally have a profound impression and a need to express our sincere thoughts.

The prime ministers of friendly nation Japan do not lightly travel abroad, especially during wartime. Prime Minister Tojo, overseeing all aspects of the nation and commanding the overall situation, visiting our country, the significance of which is great, the sincerity of which is touching, cannot be described by words. At the same time, since the establishment of the Republic of China, the head of a friendly government visiting in person, Prime Minister Tojo is the first. Especially worthy of commemoration is that the Prime Minister's visit coincides with the friendly nation's declaration to abolish extraterritorial rights in China, return concessions, and transfer enemy property, and it is when China and Japan begin to stand on a completely equal and friendly footing.

Under this significance, we deeply believe that the Prime Minister's visit to China will certainly further enhance the friendly and cooperative relations between the two countries, extending to an immeasurable and enduring future. At the same time, it will also enable the people of China, Japan, and even all countries in East Asia to deeply believe that the friendly cooperation between the two major powers of East Asia will certainly ensure the co-existence and co-prosperity of all countries in East Asia. This is the first point of our profound feelings.

Prime Minister's visit to China, is just in the third month since our country joined the war, is when our country's politics, military, economic, cultural, and other aspects are shifting to a wartime system, and is also when all aspects of our country are urgently looking forward to the guidance and assistance of the Prime Minister of the friendly nation. Therefore, we have earnest expectations for the Prime Minister's visit. At the same time, the Chinese people must also prepare to undertake new tasks and arduous responsibilities. Modern warfare will achieve rapid and comprehensive victory in a long-term war, and a considerable price must be paid. In the past, due to our country's special circumstances, the Greater East Asia War was being carried out independently by the friendly nation, that is, the friendly nation alone was paying the price for the liberation of all ethnic groups in East Asia. However, now that our country has already joined the war, and China and Japan are standing on an equal footing, we must not continue to allow Japan to unilaterally fight and unilaterally pay the price for future happiness. We must have the courage to stand up and the determination to sacrifice and fight. This is the second point that we dare to sincerely reveal to the Prime Minister and friendly nation.

What we feel most uneasy and heartbroken about regarding the Prime Minister's visit to China is that within a part of our country's territory, under the deception and control of British and American imperialism, it continues to stand in opposition to the friendly nation and wage unfortunate warfare. However, we can frankly point out that all of us Chinese people have already awakened with the beginning of this new era. The deceptive abolition of unequal treaties recently announced by British and American imperialism towards Chongqing, and their actual aid on the verge of being cut off, while merely demanding to use our country's territory as a battlefield and our country's people as cannon fodder, this insidious cunning plan will inevitably further arouse the resistance of our compatriots in the southwest and northwest provinces. All Chinese compatriots standing under the banner of the great unity of the oppressed ethnic groups in East Asia, especially standing under the banner of unity and cooperation between the two major ethnic groups of China and Japan, the day when the evil forces of British and American imperialism invading East Asia will be finally defeated will come quickly. This is the third point that we dare to solemnly explain in addition to respectfully thanking the Prime Minister for visiting.

This time, the Prime Minister's visit to our country will surely have epoch-making success in the close coordination between the authorities and national policies of the two countries. At the same time, we more closely expect that in the near future, delegations of friendly nation’s civilians and delegations of our country’s civilians will visit each other because we deeply believe that the mutual understanding and cooperation between the two countries' civilians is the prerequisite for the implementation of the two countries' common policies, and also the greatest guarantee that the two countries' common ideals and beliefs can be quickly realized.

### Prime Minister Tojo's Return Visit to China: Expressing Respect for the National Government's Participation in the War: Sino-Japanese Relations Will Become More Harmonious

Both sides' opinions on various issues regarding completing the common goal were extremely harmonious. Minister Tojo went to Shanghai on the 14th and returned safely to Japan on the 15th. Our entire country, from top to bottom, deeply feels inspired by Prime Minister Tojo taking the time to visit during this great era of the Greater East Asia War. According to Japan, this is the first time that a sitting prime minister has visited a foreign country, and it fully demonstrates the intimacy of Sino-Japanese relations. People here generally believe that Prime Minister Tojo's visit will further increase the friendship between China and Japan, and as a new development in Sino-Japanese relations since the return of the National Government to the capital, this will be used as an opportunity to make a leap forward in various measures for the two countries to complete the common goal. Furthermore, Japan is about to return its exclusive concessions in our country and abolish extraterritorial rights. This kind of sincere assistance to our country in completing its independence and autonomy, and the friendly expression of Prime Minister Tojo's visit, have the same significance. Therefore, our people's belief in sharing weal and woe, living and dying together with Japan, is strengthened, and it is believed that Prime Minister Tojo's visit will further brighten the future of building a new order in East Asia.

### Summary of Chairman Wang's Speech

Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: Chairman Wang's speech at the banquet in honor of Prime Minister Tojo was as follows: In the great era of the Greater East Asia War, Prime Minister Tojo bears extremely heavy responsibilities and is truly busy day and night. However, he took the time to visit us in person, which is deeply comforting in terms of Sino-Japanese friendly relations, especially in terms of the Sino-Japanese relationship of sharing weal and woe, living and dying together in the Greater East Asia War.

Recalling my visit to Tokyo in December last year, I received various clear instructions from Prime Minister Tojo regarding the future of the Greater East Asia War. He also understood and provided great assistance to the enthusiasm and determination of the Chinese National Government and the people to participate in the Greater East Asia War, which gave the National Government and the people boundless courage. The measures taken on January 9 this year to return the concessions and abolish extraterritorial rights fulfilled the long-cherished wish of the Chinese people, both in and out of government, for decades. It fulfilled Japan's promise to assist China in completing the conditions necessary to become an independent country. This great assistance is not only unforgettable to China, but also opened a new epoch in East Asia. All East Asian compatriots will never forget it.

Since participating in the Greater East Asia War, China has increasingly encouraged itself in its determination and increasingly sought to exert its ability to share the responsibilities that it should bear. However, while having this firm determination and position, we also deeply feel the inadequacy of our national strength and people's strength, fearing that we cannot contribute to the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, we only seek to make rapid progress, and in these two months and more, we have worked diligently and dared not slacken in the slightest. Thanks to the various good intentions and assistance of the ambassadors and generals of friendly nations, we have fortunately gained a foundation for progress. Today, Prime Minister Tojo has graced us with his presence, and we hope that he will not hesitate to give us guidance. Now, I would like to offer a toast with all sincerity, wishing Prime Minister Tojo good health and the ultimate victory of the Greater East Asia War.

### Summary of Prime Minister Tojo's Reply Speech

Nanjing, 15th, Central News Agency telegram: After Chairman Wang delivered a welcome speech at the banquet in honor of Prime Minister Tojo, Prime Minister Tojo immediately delivered a reply speech, which roughly stated: This visit to your country is to return the visit of Chairman Wang to our country at the end of last year, and to express respect for your country's resolute declaration of war against the common enemy of Greater East Asia, Britain and the United States, on January 9 this year. Also, to have frank talks with Chairman Wang and various dignitaries of your country on the strategies to complete the common war. Although my stay in your country is extremely short, I have witnessed that under the leadership of Chairman Wang, your country, from top to bottom, is working together in unity and has already reaped great results, which is deeply touching. I express my utmost respect for the concerted efforts of your country. Your country has made great progress since declaring war, and at the same time has contributed greatly to the Greater East Asia War, which is sincerely appreciated by our country. Therefore, our country, based on the fundamental spirit of cooperation between our two countries, has worked hard to establish a relationship between our two countries that is adapted to the new era, and is determined to re-consider according to the spirit of the established agreements in order to adapt to the future development of the relationship between our two countries. Today, our country's troops have completely destroyed the bases of Britain, America, and Holland in various parts of Greater East Asia, and laid the foundation for certain victory and invincibility. We will continue to carry out vigorous operations. At the same time, the development of Manchuria is steadily progressing, and the connection between China, Japan, and Manchuria is also becoming closer. Your country has made great contributions to completing the war, and Burma is about to obtain the honor of independence based on mutual assistance. At the same time, Germany and Italy, our allies in Europe, are also increasingly high-spirited and are preparing to launch large-scale offensives in the future. It is deeply gratifying that the allied countries are cooperating with each other and that the future is infinitely bright, working hard to overcome difficulties and defeat Britain and the United States. Here, I would like to reiterate our country's determination, that is, our country is determined to work closely with the allied countries to strengthen our combat power, severely attack Britain and the United States, strive for final victory, build a new Greater East Asia, and contribute to the construction of a new world order. At the same time, I would like to express my respect for your country's great efforts under the leadership of Chairman Wang to work together and complete the Greater East Asia War. I wish Chairman Wang good health and your country prosperous national fortunes.

### Hosting a Japanese Military and Civilian Discussion: Earnestly Emphasizing the Importance of Shanghai's Current Status: Making it a True Sino-Japanese Cooperation Zone

Central News Agency Shanghai News: Prime Minister Tojo of Japan arrived in Shanghai at 1:00 PM on the afternoon of the 14th. At 7:30 PM on the afternoon of the 14th, he invited Shimomura, the highest commander of the Japanese army in the Shanghai area, Nagatsu, the commander of the Shanghai army, Minister Tajiri, and many other military officers and civilians to a certain mansion for a discussion. Prime Minister Tojo's speech was roughly as follows:

I am very grateful to be able to take this opportunity to invite you and all the military officers and civilian dignitaries, who have all attended. I am deeply grateful for your tireless efforts here day and night. I would like to take this opportunity to express my heartfelt thanks. The purpose of my visit to China this time is to thank Chairman for visiting the Empire at the end of last year, and at the same time to personally express my respect to the Republic of China for resolutely declaring war against Britain and the United States, the common enemy of Greater East Asia, on January 9 this year. In order to complete the common war, I have had frank talks with the dignitaries of the National Government, and I have also investigated the actual situation of the army, navy, and other agencies in China and personally rewarded their hard work. At the same time, I inspected the implementation of the fundamental policy towards China decided by His Majesty the Emperor some time ago. In Nanjing, I held cordial talks with Chairman and other dignitaries. As a result, we reached a complete consensus on the strategies for completing the common war. The cooperation and coordination between the two countries in military, political, and economic matters are becoming closer, which is extremely gratifying.

Although my stay this time is temporary, I am deeply impressed by the way you and everyone have fully overcome various difficulties and worked hard to complete your tasks. Regarding the policy towards China this time, Shanghai's status is extremely important. All the handling of local affairs is attracting the attention of everyone. I firmly believe that we must quickly wipe out the colors of Britain and the United States and build a true Sino-Japanese cooperation zone here. This is the most urgent thing now. I believe that we must fully respect the responsibility and creativity of the Chinese side at any time and in any place to handle the above-mentioned issues in order to ensure true cooperation in the war, especially in the economic aspect. Only after the national policy is changed can we seek to realize it concretely, and we hope for the cooperation of the people. This turning point in national policy has a profound impact on the people standing on the front line, and there is a tendency to put them in a difficult position. The government, at the time of this major shift in policy towards China, also deeply sympathizes with the position of the overseas Chinese residing in China and is fully considering its follow-up measures.

However, if there are those who have oppressed and exploited the Chinese side based on personal desires in the past, they must be resolutely rectified, otherwise, the results of this fundamental policy cannot be expected. The government will consistently adhere to its original intention from beginning to end regarding the purpose and implementation of this fundamental policy and is determined to achieve its goals. However, the realization of the national policy must depend on the strength of you and everyone. We earnestly hope that the military and civilians will cooperate and work together in the future.

### Prime Minister Tojo Returns Home: Chairman Wang Issues Statement, Comprehensively Answering Questions from Chinese and Foreign Journalists

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Chairman Wang met with Chinese and foreign journalists today, comprehensively answering questions raised by the reporters. The main points of the conversation are recorded below:

Prime Minister Tojo's return visit to China this time, including two meetings, has brought immense joy. I have just received a telegram informing me that he safely arrived back in Fukuoka today. Prime Minister Tojo bears the major responsibility of strategizing and commanding the Greater East Asia War. I am extremely grateful that he took the time to visit China amidst his busy schedule.

Last December, I met with Prime Minister Tojo in Tokyo. Prime Minister Tojo expressed a firm and clear vision for the future of the Greater East Asia War. Every word and sentence was deeply imprinted in my mind. Two months later, the development of the war situation has become even clearer, and Prime Minister Tojo's repeated statements have become even more detailed. I deeply admire Prime Minister Tojo's belief in the inevitable victory in the Greater East Asia War and his great enthusiasm for the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and the independence and liberation of India, Burma, and the Philippines.

Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, China has constantly been torn between two feelings. On the one hand, we are keenly aware of our weak national strength and fear that we cannot contribute to the Greater East Asia War. On the other hand, we deeply believe in the righteousness of the cause and feel that we cannot fulfill our responsibility as a member of East Asia without participating in the war. These two feelings have been understood by the governments and people of friendly nations, who have not hesitated to provide assistance. Having understood China's position and determination and agreeing to our participation in the war, they have clearly recognized China's current situation and needs, and have helped us strengthen our political, economic, and military capabilities. Since our participation in the war on January 9th, we have repeatedly received various forms of assistance from friendly nations. This time, Prime Minister Tojo personally visited China and treated us with sincerity. I firmly believe that the Chinese people will be even more united for China, for Sino-Japanese relations, and for the collective unity of East Asia. Our belief in the inevitable victory of the Greater East Asia War will be even more steadfast, and our efforts in participating in the war will be even more vigorous.

Some of you reporters have asked about the wartime system and our policies towards Chongqing. After participating in the war, the National Government immediately established the Supreme National Defense Council, reformed the central and local administrative organizations, and successively held various national conferences, such as the National Conference of Local Chiefs, the National Judicial Administration Conference, the New National Movement Promotion Conference, the National Military Conference, the National Economic Conference, the National Education Administration Conference, and the plenary session of the Chinese Nationalist Party. All of these were aimed at establishing a wartime system, concentrating national spirit and strength, and contributing even more to total war participation. As for the policies towards Chongqing, I believe that the most important thing is to grasp the hearts of the people. We have a firm belief in this. Since the thirteenth year of the Republic of China, we have followed the teachings of the Founding Father on Pan-Asianism and have taken preventative measures regarding Sino-Japanese relations before the incident, striving to prevent the incident from happening. After the incident, we have taken remedial measures, and even if the incident unfortunately occurred, we must seize the opportunity and quickly seek reconciliation. This is our fundamental view on the Sino-Japanese Incident. As for the Greater East Asia War, we believe that it is a necessary struggle for China's freedom and equality and for the liberation of East Asia, and it is also the original goal of the National Revolution. In this, China has no choice but to stand on the same front as our friendly nation, Japan, and advance towards the great path of Pan-Asianism without hesitation. Chiang Kai-shek's views are completely the opposite. Pan-Asianism has long been forgotten. He advocates resistance to the end against Japan and willingly serves as a detachment for the United Kingdom and the United States. Sino-Japanese cooperation has been sabotaged, and the nation's vitality has been devastated. Since our views are fundamentally opposed, the people's support will naturally be determined as facts progress. Therefore, the National Government's policies today are not directed at Chongqing but at the hearts of the people. I know that all the people of the country hope for an early end to the war and an early realization of peace. Those who hesitate are only concerned about whether peace can be achieved. If the peace proposals can be gradually realized, if the Sino-Japanese cooperation policy is implemented one by one, and if China's freedom and equality and East Asia's co-existence and co-prosperity can be truly achieved, then the people in Chongqing will definitely oppose resistance and lean towards peace. It can be asserted that the collapse of Chongqing can be awaited once the people's support is determined. The people's hearts may seem invisible, but they are actually tangible and can be seen everywhere. For example, on the tenth of this month, the anniversary of the Japanese Army, the troops of our friendly nation held a defense exercise. Students from the Central Military Academy enthusiastically participated. On that day, tens of thousands of people from the capital came out to watch, filling the mountains and valleys with enthusiastic emotions, far surpassing the past when people would hide at home at the sound of gunfire. From this, it can be seen that since our participation in the war, the general public has universally recognized the significance of the Greater East Asia War and has deeply understood Sino-Japanese relations. Their enthusiasm for the progress of the current situation is shared. It can also be seen that the spirit of the two countries, China and Japan, moving from sharing joys and sorrows to sharing life and death in the Greater East Asia War has been gradually popularized through your publicity efforts. A movement is only concerned that the spirit of the people has not yet been awakened, and there is nothing to start with. Once the spirit of the people has been awakened, it will inevitably generate a powerful force. I have silently observed the progress of the peace movement and the current sentiments of the Chinese people, and I am deeply optimistic about the future of Sino-Japanese cooperation and the Greater East Asia War. Today, on the day that Prime Minister Tojo, who has made a historically significant return visit, safely returns to our friendly nation, I meet with you all and wish you the greatest congratulations and encouragement for our common future.

### Prime Minister Tojo Returns to Fukuoka, Issues Important Statement: Honest Talks Held with Key Figures of the National Government, China and Japan Moving Forward in Unified Step

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – Prime Minister Tojo, accompanied by Military Affairs Bureau Chief Sato and other staff members, departed from Tokyo on the 12th to visit Nanjing, the capital of China, and after meeting with Chairman Wang of the National Government, returned to Fukuoka by plane at noon on the 15th. The Cabinet Information Bureau issued the following statement regarding this matter:

"Prime Minister Tojo, concurrently serving as Minister of the Army, made a return visit to Chairman Wang of the Chinese National Government in response to his visit to Japan at the end of last year. He also expressed his respect for the Republic of China's declaration of war against the United Kingdom and the United States. Furthermore, he held frank discussions with the leaders of the National Government regarding the completion of the common war and inspected various institutions. He departed from Tokyo on March 12th, visited Nanjing, and then traveled to Shanghai before returning home on the 15th."

Tokyo, 15th (Central News Agency) – According to a Fukuoka telephone report, Prime Minister Tojo issued a statement upon his return from his visit to China, stating in essence that he had long desired to visit the Republic of China. This visit was to reciprocate the visit of Chairman Wang of the National Government to Japan at the end of last year and to express respect for the National Government's participation in the war. He also held honest talks with the leaders of national defense regarding strategies for completing the common war. Although the duration was extremely short, he was deeply gratified to have fulfilled this long-cherished wish. Since the Republic of China declared war against the United Kingdom and the United States, it has been developing steadily towards autonomy and independence as one of the nations of Greater East Asia. The Empire sincerely hopes that the National Government's efforts will contribute to the completion of the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, to adapt to the new situation, a new direction has been decided to establish Sino-Japanese relations, namely, to return all exclusive concessions managed by the Empire in China, to recognize China's recovery of the Shanghai Public Concession, the Xiamen Public Concession, and the Beijing Legation Quarter, and to abolish extraterritorial rights. In addition, various benevolent measures will be taken to handle enemy property in China. All of this work is currently being carried out continuously. In the future, the Empire will further adapt to the development of Sino-Japanese relations and will resolve to reconsider existing treaties based on the same spirit. During this visit to the Republic of China, I personally witnessed the reality of China's participation in the war and held frank discussions with key figures of the National Government. It goes without saying that Chairman Wang and other leaders of the National Government, as well as the general Chinese people, unanimously resonated with the sincerity of the Empire. Therefore, their determination to share joys and sorrows and share life and death with the Empire in the capacity of a fellow nation of Greater East Asia is extremely firm. I am deeply excited by the current situation in which China and Japan treat each other with sincerity. Moreover, the Empire has always been a nation of good faith. Now, at a time of great transformation in the world, the Empire's fundamental policy towards China, which has been decided for the construction of a new Greater East Asia, will be realized one after another as the war situation progresses. The Empire has established a solid foundation for inevitable victory and invincibility. The war situation is progressing in a situation favorable to us, and the ultimate victory will be obtained without a doubt. I am confident that the Chinese people, understanding the new state of Sino-Japanese relations, will gladly move forward in unified step with us under the leadership of Chairman Wang. Furthermore, I am deeply grateful for the valiant and courageous fighting of the Japanese army in China, and I hereby express my gratitude. I express my respect for the hard work of the imperial military, government officials, and civilians in China. As for the Japanese expatriates in China, I cannot help but deeply sympathize with them due to the various complexities and difficulties involved in the implementation of the new policies. We will, of course, make the most complete consideration for aftercare in the future.

### Air Battle Occurs on the India-Burma Border

Japanese Air Force Base in Burma, 15th (Domei News Agency) – Yesterday afternoon, Japanese army aircraft engaged ten enemy fighters and three bombers in the skies over Maungdaw on the India-Burma border. Four enemy fighters and one bomber were shot down. There were no losses on the Japanese side.

### U.S. Air Forces in Chongqing and India Become Independent

Guangzhou, 15th (Central News Agency) – In order to reorganize the command system and alleviate internal conflicts, the U.S. Air Force authorities have separated the U.S. Air Force stationed in Chongqing and the U.S. Air Force stationed in India, allowing them to operate independently. According to a New Delhi dispatch, when Major General Bissell, commander of the U.S. Air Force in India, met with reporters on the 13th, he answered questions regarding the independence of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, stating that the Tenth Air Force unit under his command in India would do its utmost to cooperate with the Fourteenth Air Force unit and would maintain unified cooperative operations under the command of General Stilwell. However, he avoided mentioning any discord between him and Major General Chennault, commander of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, and only stated that the Tenth Air Force unit had been working hard for the anti-Axis coalition since its deployment in India and had made great contributions to the transportation of the Chongqing-India route. Because his remarks made no mention of the activities of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing, it sparked another dispute. The Chongqing Ta Kung Pao published a commentary on the 13th stating in essence that the separation and independence of the U.S. Air Force in Chongqing and the U.S. Air Force in India was a concrete measure taken by Roosevelt to emphasize the East Asian front and to strictly order direct attacks on Japan. Therefore, this measure is of great significance for the defense of Chongqing and the counterattack against Japan. The newspaper also emphasized the need for the Chongqing Air Force to obtain close cooperation with the U.S. Air Force and subtly satirized the past lack of cooperation between the two sides, saying that the U.S. Air Force would surely exert more effort in the future.

### U.S. Plans to Establish Information Branch in Moscow

### Prime Minister Tojo's Visit to China Has Great Significance

Nanjing, 15th (Central News Agency) – Since Chairman Wang of the National Government visited Japan last December, Prime Minister Tojo's return visit to China this time, within a period of less than three months, is a major turning point with epoch-making progress in the history of Sino-Japanese relations. During this period, Japan's policy towards China has undergone new developments. Due to our country's participation in the war, both China and Japan have successively implemented many highly important policies. China and Japan have become completely unified in order to achieve the supreme common goal of completing the Greater East Asia War, preparing to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States in an invincible posture. Today, Prime Minister Tojo personally returned a visit to our nation's capital and paid respects to Chairman Wang, strengthening the determination to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. This has great significance in the joint completion of the war. In the future, China will strengthen the National Government with Japan's unchanging attitude as its background and will advance towards the path of self-improvement with even greater efforts. Looking back, since Japan and the National Government established an eternally unchanging relationship with the Sino-Japanese Basic Treaty as the cornerstone, the relationship between the two countries has gradually progressed. Before the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the National Government's policy goals were peace and nation-building, but the influence of the United Kingdom and the United States had not been completely eliminated, and the goal of cooperative warfare was inevitably somewhat vague. However, since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, our country's war goals have become clear. In particular, since the visit of the three special envoys, Japan's Hiranuma, Arita, and Nagai, to our country last September, there has been a tremendous impact on promoting a high degree of cooperation between the two countries. At that time, the National Government expressed unofficially its intention to voluntarily participate in the war and presented active opinions on the specific tasks that should be undertaken and how they should be practiced in the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. The National Government's sincerity in embracing cooperative warfare was conveyed to the Japanese side by the special envoys. In order to actively promote construction policies in the entire East Asian region, Japan established the Ministry of Greater East Asia last November. The importance of Japan's policy towards China has been emphasized by all parties. As a result, a broad policy was decided on implementing the outline of policies towards China. In December, a conference of Japanese ambassadors and consuls in China was convened to implement the policies of the Japanese central government. At this time, the National Government also reorganized its domestic institutions to adapt to the development of this new situation. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan, responding to the wishes of both parties, had the intention of visiting China last December, but ultimately could not realize it due to his busy political affairs. Subsequently, there was Chairman Wang's visit to Japan. Due to Chairman Wang's visit to Japan, the progress of Japan's policy towards China became concrete. On January 9th of this year, the National Government announced its participation in the war, and Sino-Japanese relations entered a new stage. The National Government's wartime Sino-Japanese Joint Declaration clearly clarified the integrated relationship between the two countries to both domestic and foreign audiences. Based on this national policy, Japan also returned concessions, abolished extraterritorial rights, and transferred enemy property. With our country as the main entity, it established economic control institutions and made great efforts in various aspects to strengthen the cooperative National Government. We are deeply grateful for Japan's friendly measures and are determined to cooperate with Japan to destroy the United Kingdom and the United States. In preparation for the wartime system, we first implemented a comprehensive reform of administrative institutions, followed by preparations in military and economic aspects for the wartime system. Up to today, Japan's wartime parliament has naturally adjourned. Prime Minister Tojo of Japan has made this special return visit to Chairman Wang in order to resolve pending issues between the two countries at once. Our country is deeply grateful for Japan's ethical diplomacy and deeply feels that the responsibility that China bears in completing the Greater East Asia War has become increasingly important. We are determined to reciprocate Japan's sincere attitude. As the third anniversary of the return to the capital approaches, the National Government is showing a surging momentum. In the future, the attitude of China and Japan completing the war as one entity will be further strengthened by Prime Minister Tojo's visit, and concrete progress can be expected.

### Ukraine's Door Closed: German Forces Reoccupy Kharkov City, Soviet Forces on Central Front Continuously Increase Pressure

German Supreme Headquarters, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – The German Supreme Headquarters issued a special war report last night stating that the German counteroffensive on the southern front has driven the Soviet forces across the Donets River. After weeks of fierce fighting, an important victory has been achieved today. German advancing troops, with the assistance of the Air Force, encircled Kharkov from the northeast and reoccupied the city. The enemy lost countless soldiers and war materiel.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible sources here stated that German forces and Waffen-SS troops, led by General Hoth, are continuing their offensive in the Kharkov region. Soviet forces are using fresh troops west of Belgorod in an attempt to stop the German advance, but they have been repulsed.

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – According to recent reports, when German forces attacked Kharkov, a large number of aircraft provided air support. At that time, two Soviet artillery positions were guarding the two main roads leading to the city center. One hundred German dive bombers first thoroughly destroyed the enemy's artillery, and the infantry, losing the cover of artillery, had to quickly retreat.

Berlin, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – A Haitong News Agency military correspondent stated that the German occupation of Kharkov is the prelude to a large-scale German counteroffensive on the southern front of the Eastern Front. About a month ago, German forces withdrew from Kharkov according to plan, and Soviet forces entered the city. At that time, the Soviet headquarters said that the door to Ukraine had now been opened. Now that German forces have reoccupied the city, they have closed this door again. Kharkov is an important transportation center between the Donets Basin and the Orel region. The strategic importance of the German forces reoccupying the city is self-evident.

Soviet border area, 15th (Havas News Agency) – The most noteworthy event on the Eastern Front today is the battle for Kharkov City. Over the past 24 hours, German and Soviet forces have engaged in the most intense battle near Kharkov City, especially in the northern part of the city. Although the Soviet Union has not acknowledged the German occupation of Kharkov City, it has not denied it either, only stating that "the enemy forces are numerous, far exceeding the Red Army, and our army is currently fighting hard to resist the strong enemy." According to Soviet official statements, German infantry, under the cover of 100 tanks, has broken through the Red Army's defense line in the southern suburbs of Kharkov City. The success of this German offensive should be attributed to the German Air Force. The weather in the front line is clear and favorable for air operations, and German aircraft groups have the advantage in both quantity and strategy. The German occupation of the city is quite important. German forces are currently advancing along the Kharkov-Kursk railway towards Belgorod, cutting off General Golikov's forces. However, the Red Army on the central front continues to apply pressure. General Timoshenko's forces, which departed from Vyazma, have reached the upper reaches of the Dnieper River near Dorogobuzh. Another Red Army force, led by General Shakhurin, is advancing along the Vyazma-Bryansk railway and continues to make progress. It is reported to have occupied Milietinon. In addition, in the Orel area, the Red Army is continuing to attack the city and attempting to advance into Bryansk, but it is being blocked by German forces.

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Washington sources, British Foreign Secretary Eden had his second meeting with President Roosevelt at the White House yesterday and is scheduled to have a third meeting today. Eden has met with U.S. Secretary of War Stimson, Secretary of the Navy Knox, and Chairman Connally of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. Secretary of State Hull will also participate in the talks after returning from vacation.

Lisbon, 15th (Domei News Agency) – According to a Washington dispatch, British Foreign Secretary Eden visited President Roosevelt at the White House on the evening of the 13th for dinner and discussions. Eden also met separately with the ambassadors of Australia, New Zealand, and the South African Union to the United States in the afternoon. Eden's visit to the United States is attracting much attention because it is appropriately timed for a delicate period in the internal relations of the Allied Powers.

Stockholm, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – London's "Daily Mail" carried a Washington dispatch stating that it is generally expected that British Foreign Secretary Eden and U.S. Secretary of State Hull will first seek understanding and connection between the United Kingdom and the United States, and then use this as the basis for establishing an agreement for all the Allied Powers. Eden will also be a mediator between the United States and the Soviet Union, drafting a plan acceptable to both countries.

Lisbon, 15th (Haitong News Agency) – According to Washington sources, the first conference of the Allied Powers has been scheduled for April 26th. President Roosevelt discussed the Congressional resolution on the Allied Powers' increased cooperation with senators yesterday for an hour and a half.

Zurich, 14th (Havas News Agency) – London attaches great importance to British Foreign Secretary Eden's trip to Washington. It is said that Foreign Secretary Eden will try to resolve some important issues between the United Kingdom and the United States. First, Eden will declare to the U.S. government that the British government finds it difficult to agree with the proposal by some people in Washington to establish an international committee to manage the administration of all colonies. In other words, any suggestion that conflicts with Britain's sovereignty over its territories and occupied territories during the war will be difficult to accept. Second, on the Indian issue, Eden will have the U.S. authorities accept the tough policies adopted by the British government. Third, the Chongqing government will require Britain to return Hong Kong. This request may have been backed by the United States, but it has not yet been approved by the British cabinet. Fourth, the dispute between the French rebel generals Giraud and de Gaulle, which is still unresolved, will also be discussed. Fifth, the Soviet Union's territorial demands in Europe are the most important. It is said that the United States has a rather lenient attitude towards them, while the United Kingdom is strongly opposed.

Havas News Agency, Bern, 14th – According to news from London, Hall, the Executive Committee member of the British Miners' Federation, delivered a speech at a mass meeting in Trafalgar Square in the British capital today, requesting the opening of a second battlefield. He stated, "Our reason for urging the immediate opening of a second battlefield is not entirely to help the Soviet Union, but actually to implement policies related to the safety of the British people. There is currently a movement aimed at making the British people believe that the Soviet Union is capable of winning alone, but it is also a fact that the Soviet Union cannot win for Britain." After Hall's speech, the assembly unanimously resolved to demand the immediate opening of a second battlefield.

### National Chamber of Commerce Control Association Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday; Over 300 Chinese and Japanese Business Guests Attended; Minister Mei and Mayor Chen Personally Delivered Admonitory Speeches

The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association held its inaugural meeting at 4:00 PM yesterday (the 15th) on the eighth floor of the Cathay Hotel. In addition to all the directors and supervisors, a total of over 300 Chinese and Japanese officials and guests from the Chinese and Japanese financial and business communities attended. After performing the rituals, Chairman Shoumin delivered the opening remarks, followed by admonitory speeches by Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry, Mayor Chen, and Xiangdai. Guests included Xu Jianping, Chinese Director of the Shanghai Municipal Council, Aoki, Chairman of the Shanghai Japanese Chamber of Commerce and Industry, who delivered congratulatory speeches. Finally, Wen Lantian, Director of the Salt Affairs, delivered a thank-you speech. The ceremony concluded around 7:00 PM. The ceremony was simple and solemn. The details are as follows:

Attending Guests

The guests attending the meeting included Mayor Chen Gongbo on the Chinese side, Wang Zhigang, Director of the Economic Bureau, Yuan Houzhi, Lu Ying, Pan Da, and the heads of various bureaus of the municipal government, Feng Jie, the director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai office, and representatives from the financial and business communities, including Qi Runxiang, Pei Yunqing, Wang Boyuan, Huang Jiangquan, Jin Zongcheng, Hu Guigeng, Zhu Miaosheng, and Tang Xinghai. On the side of Allied nations, the guests included Minister Horiuchi, Minister Tajiri, Aoki Setsu, Kurimoto Toraji, Komuro Takeo, Kawaguchi Ken, Yamamoto Takeo, Tei Ko, Kimura Masutaro, and Fukuda Kou, Inagaki Noboru, the Director of the Material Control Department of the Shanghai Municipal Council, and Guo Hong, Chen Zhong, Xiang Xun, Sun Zuji, and Zhang Jun, the directors of various bureaus of the Ministry of Industry, all attended the meeting. Minister Mei of the Ministry of Industry personally attended the meeting to provide guidance.

Speech by Director Tang

Tang Shoumin, the director of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, delivered the opening remarks, saying, "Material control is extremely important for people's livelihood, especially during wartime when production is insufficient. If we want to stabilize people's lives and maintain social order, material control is absolutely necessary. Japan and Germany were the first countries to implement material control, and their methods are the most complete. The effectiveness of their systems has long been recognized by the world and does not need to be elaborated upon.

Hoping for Sincere Cooperation from All Parties

Our country's material control work was originally handled by various agencies of Allied nations. Now, the authorities of Allied nations, in the spirit of cooperation, and with great enthusiasm and determination, have returned the task of material control to our country to handle ourselves, while still providing assistance at any time to promote its success. The government, fearing that having the government handle it directly would create a disconnect with commercial realities, transferred the responsibility to an economically autonomous group to manage, with the government maintaining a supervisory and guidance role while promulgating laws and regulations. The thoughtfulness of the authorities of both countries regarding the people's livelihood is appreciated by all the people. Considering the nature of this association, it belongs to a group organization of trade associations. According to the organizational procedure, we should have started from the lower levels. However, due to time constraints, we are simultaneously having the government appoint personnel to organize the general association and strengthen trade organizations to ensure that material control work is not disrupted. This was originally a temporary expedient measure, but the members of the general association are still members of trade associations. Although the method is a variation, the spirit remains. However, I still hope that we can strengthen the trade associations in various regions according to the original organizational procedure, so that the establishment of the general association can conform to the true spirit of collective autonomy, and the progress of control work can become smoother and more efficient. Control methods are still a pioneering effort in our country. Many conditions are not yet in place, and reference materials are still lacking. The various difficulties in implementation are inherent. The most difficult of these is that the nature of control policies is completely opposite to that of free economic policies, and free economic policies have long been deeply rooted in China. Once the policy is shifted, not only will the commercial sector feel inconvenience, but consumers will also inevitably feel constrained and restricted. However, we must recognize that control methods are, first, favored by the world trend, and second, are the basis of national policy. At this critical juncture for people's livelihood that needs to be resolved urgently, there is no other way but to pool our efforts, abandon selfish views, and jointly promote national policy to achieve the goal of the greater good. The organization of this general association was extremely hasty. Those who were appointed had no choice but to step forward and take on the responsibility. How to make the organization of this association more sound still requires a long period of research and consideration, and gradual improvement based on practical experience. In the early stages, there will inevitably be many unsatisfactory aspects. Even I have the same feeling. I hope that government officials, Allied authorities, and people from all walks of life in China and Japan will understand, sympathize, provide guidance and assistance, especially hoping that the heads of various agencies of Allied nations, and agencies at all levels from top to bottom, will provide significant assistance in the spirit of cooperation. Secondly, I hope that various commercial organizations of Allied nations will cooperate sincerely according to the principle of equality agreed upon by the authorities of both countries. In the future, there may be situations where the implementation of laws and regulations may not fully meet the wishes of individual businesses. In such cases, please give special understanding.

Assuming Responsibility for the Greater Good

As for Shoumin personally, I am a businessman. This time, in the capacity of a trade association, I have been appointed by the government to take on this difficult and pioneering work. I originally did not dare to accept. Moreover, I have little research on control issues, lack knowledge, and even less experience. I am in no way qualified to undertake this task. The inadequacy of my spirit, the outdatedness of my thinking, and the inability to divide myself from my own business are even more secondary matters. However, because I believe that implementing autonomous control is related to national policy, and that the current problem of people's livelihood is serious and needs to be resolved rationally, and because the government officials have earnestly encouraged me and charged me with the greater good, I have no choice but to forget my inadequacies and temporarily assume responsibility, waiting for the government officials to calmly seek out virtuous and capable individuals. I hope that the government officials will fulfill this promise and find other capable individuals as soon as possible, so as not to delay the advancement of the country's major policies and to prevent myself from incurring blame. However, since I am a member of the trade association, I will never stand idly by, and I will still contribute my opinions at any time for the government and this association to consider and adopt.

Increase Production and Stabilize Currency

Moreover, I am naturally straightforward. I always seek to be practical in everything I undertake and will never do things perfunctorily. I will do what I can, and if I cannot do it, I will immediately resign. I have no other strengths, but I am courageous in advancing and retreating. Being courageous in advancing means wanting to fulfill my responsibilities, and being courageous in retreating means not wanting to be a mere figurehead. I always encourage myself to be honest and upright. This is what I want to frankly report to you today. This association is a commercial and autonomous collective organization. If we want to complete our mission, we must fully develop the spirit of autonomy. How to develop the spirit of autonomy depends entirely on the unity and cooperation of leaders in various industries. It cannot be accomplished by one person alone. How to promote perfection depends even more on the government having detailed regulations to facilitate implementation. If the association has any opinions, it will contribute them at any time, and I hope that the government will consider and adopt them to comply with public sentiment. Controlled purchase and distribution are only one part of the control work. The important key still lies in increasing production, and increasing production depends even more on financial regulation and currency stability. I hope that government officials will pay special attention to these points to coordinate with the work of this association.

Finally, I would still like to repeat and solemnly declare that since this association was established in a hurry, my colleagues have little research and experience in material control work. It is expected that the handling will not be perfect. I hope that people from all walks of life will not have excessive expectations. My colleagues and I will also strive to move forward under the principles of fairness, frankness, integrity, and credibility, so as not to fail the expectations of society for this association. Please ask government officials, Allied authorities, business groups of both sides, and people from all walks of life to correct and guide us at any time. My colleagues and I are willing to accept it with great enthusiasm and respect."

Speech by Minister Mei

Minister Mei Siping of the Ministry of Industry stood up and delivered an admonitory speech on behalf of the government, saying that the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association was prepared and established in a short period of time. From the government's point of view, there are three reasons why this was necessary: (1) Although the candidates for the directors and supervisors of this Chamber of Commerce Control Association were appointed by the government, the standards for appointment were extremely objective. Those who serve as directors and supervisors have knowledge, experience, prestige, and ability. I am confident that the central organization is sufficient to meet the needs. As for the representatives of various industrial and commercial firms, because the investigation has not been completed, they could not be selected immediately. After the investigation is clear in the future, they will be gradually supplemented. This is due to the urgency of time, and I hope that the people in the industrial and commercial circles who participated in the inaugural meeting today will forgive us. (2) The government hopes that the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will become the highest control organization in the national commerce, which can take into account both military needs at the front and people's livelihood in the rear. Military needs and people's livelihood are closely related. If people's livelihood in the rear is not prosperous, then the military needs at the front are in danger. If the military needs at the front are scarce, then people's livelihood in the rear will also be difficult to guarantee. As for the method of taking into account both military needs and people's livelihood, the first is to increase production and stabilize prices. I hope that the Chamber of Commerce Control Association can assist the government in implementing the policy of price management in the future, so that the two major problems of military needs and people's livelihood can be solved easily. (3) The organization of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is an innovation in China and is also emerging in other countries. Whether it can implement its mission and promote control work in the future depends on the strength of the organization. However, control work relies solely on the strength of the government, which is really insufficient. We must concentrate the economic strength of the country to achieve the goal. At the same time, the control organization itself should give full play to the spirit of autonomy and integrate the strength of all aspects, so that the organization can be sound and the work can be successful. I am very honored to attend the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association today. The above three points are the government's policy, and I have to take this opportunity to tell you."

Speech by Mayor Chen

Mayor Chen said, "The establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association is something that we have been eagerly expecting to come true in our minds. This matter has been achieved through the efforts and promotion of both officials and businessmen. The directors and supervisors who have been honorably appointed have known each other for a long time, and they must have a thorough and full understanding of the significance of the association. Regarding future plans, it is not about what methods to use, but how to do it, because the methods already exist, and it is about how to do it and how to implement it. In the past, all parties complained about the control affairs because of their complexity and triviality. Due to my duties, I often summarized the opinions of various parties and conveyed them to Japanese officials and people from all walks of life. Although they all believe that the control work should be handled by the Chinese themselves, there are also concerns that the Chinese side may not have enough ability, and it is easy to cause abuses in the future. I believe that this kind of opinion of the Japanese side cannot be said to be completely unfounded, but I dare to guarantee that after the control affairs are handled by the Chinese themselves, the situation will not be worse than it is now. Now that the matter of self-handling of material control has been realized, it is indeed gratifying. What I fear is not being unable to do things, but having too many opinions, avoiding difficulties, and lacking a sense of responsibility. The situation in the past was like this. I hope that this kind of inferiority can be eliminated in the future, not being afraid of others' criticism, not being afraid of difficulties and hardships, and doing things practically. Now that free trade has been changed to a controlled economy, the people's psychology also needs to be corrected. The rise in prices is due to the "looking high" mentality. I hope to control others and let myself go, but since I have let myself go, how can I control others? The economic level is high if it is all high, and low if it is all low. There is no reason for this high and that low, this low and that high. Therefore, the people must eliminate the past "looking high" mentality. The price of goods should be based on cost and a reasonable profit should be determined. In the past, the citizens have criticized the municipal government for not thinking of a way, but in fact, there is no way to do it. Now that there is a National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, we must take the people's livelihood as the premise. If we can do it, we must do it. If we cannot do it, we must still do it. If we can only do it, then we do it. If we cannot do it, then we don't do it. I ask, who will do it? There is no easy task in the world, it is about measuring yourself. Doing things only seeks to be honest. It is fine to criticize or scold. On the day of the establishment of this Chamber of Commerce, I would like to encourage you with this word." Speech by Ambassador Horiuchi

Then, Minister Horiuchi gave a speech on behalf of Ambassador Eizo. Mr. Horiuchi came to Shanghai from Nanjing to attend the meeting. The summary of his speech is as follows: "The National Chamber of Commerce Control Association was established today. I came to Shanghai from Nanjing to attend the meeting and am very pleased. China and Japan share the basic spirit of national relations, sharing weal and woe. Sharing woe today will enable us to share weal in the future, and the economy can also have a solid position. Since the National Government participated in the war, Japan has decided to conduct the Greater East Asia War with the Chinese people. In order to respect China's sovereignty, Japan is determined to abolish extraterritoriality and return the concessions. The two countries have already agreed to formally implement this matter by the end of this month. I believe that the two major tasks of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihood, although directly related to China, are also of great concern to Japan. This matter is difficult to achieve without the operation of a formal control agency. China has always advocated a free economy, which is deeply rooted. Therefore, we must overcome various difficulties in the future in order to succeed. The control work was originally handled by the Japanese side, and now it is returned to China for self-defense. Some people may suspect that Japan will be happy to see China fail after handing over this matter to China, and will only fear its success. In fact, China and Japan are brotherly countries. The brother entrusts the matter to the younger brother, and they will naturally share weal and woe, and care about each other at all times. If it succeeds, they will be happy, and if it fails, they will be worried. Japanese officials all feel the same way. I hope that the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will work hard from now on. Ambassador Eizo was overjoyed after hearing about this matter and specially asked me to come to Shanghai to participate in the grand ceremony and give a speech on behalf of him. Please understand."

Summary of Speech by Minister Tajiri

Minister Tajiri said, "Today, the Japanese Chamber of Commerce Control Association held its inaugural ceremony. I am very happy to participate in this event. In the past, the economy of Shanghai and Central China had to be controlled due to military relations, so foreign trade was also virtually stagnated, and Shanghai became a consumer city. The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association will undoubtedly make a significant contribution to the economy of China, Japan, and Greater East Asia. Recently, China and Japan have had further cooperation. Today, the Japanese have two major feelings: (1) The establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is the prelude to the entire economic control. Now that the National Government has already participated in the war, it is even more urgent to control the economy. Japan will be able to provide the greatest possible assistance within the possible range. (2) In order to revitalize China's economy and welcome the current economic trend, the establishment of the Chamber of Commerce Control Association is extremely important. I hope that the parties concerned can work hard to achieve the ideal goal."

Thank-you Speech by Supervisor Wen

Finally, Xie Wenlan, the director of the Supervisory Committee of the General Assembly, delivered a thank-you speech on behalf of all the directors and supervisors, saying, "We are very grateful to the heads of the national government and the heads of allied countries for attending the meeting today. In the future, this association will work hard under the leadership of the heads of government, in accordance with the established policies, to complete the important mission."

### Japan's Wartime Insurance Law May Be Applicable to Central China

Japan's Wartime Insurance Law (Note: Japan's Wartime Insurance Law stipulates that wartime insurance undertaken by various insurance companies, such as air raid risks and artillery fire risks, can apply for reinsurance from the state) has recently been learned to be possibly applicable to Central China. The Japanese Embassy Office has ordered the Shanghai Japanese Non-Life Insurance Association to submit an application. After receiving the order, the association conducted various investigations and is now drafting a submission, which will be submitted to the embassy in the next few days.

Commentary

### Dedicated to the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association

After the establishment of the National Chamber of Commerce Control Association, how it will work hard to live up to the expectations of the government and the goodwill of allied nations has been briefly discussed yesterday. Here is another suggestion:

(1) Personnel should break the idea of ​​personal interests. Anything that only benefits a few people and makes it difficult for most people should be avoided as much as possible.

(2) To stabilize prices, it is best to make it impossible for black market prices to arise. The current official prices of goods should be calculated based on their cost, and scientifically increased, so that those who own materials will not hide them and not sell them. This is the initial method.

(3) The procedure for handling affairs should be simple and fast. It is hoped that the bad habits of the past officialdom will be washed away.

(4) It is best to obtain the cooperation of transportation, taxation, military, and police departments, and work together to promote the progress of affairs.

(5) It seems that the leaders of various industries and the mainstays of various trade associations should be recruited to serve as consultants, and to plan the most fair distribution and purchase as a whole.

(6) The three provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, and the two cities of Nanjing and Shanghai, are the pilot areas. The urban commercial ports of these three provinces and two cities should designate local impartial persons to be responsible for presiding over and promoting the work.

In short, the two words "huge and difficult" are enough to describe the working state of the association. The hosts should carefully plan to live up to the government's main purpose of stepping up wartime production. They should also have perseverance and determination, endure hard work and complaints, avoid difficulties, break through emotions, and use the courage of 120,000 points to overcome this difficult and great task.

### Cotton Control Association: New Plan for Buying Cotton

(2) Cotton farmers who must obtain rations of daily necessities and hold the above-mentioned exchange coupons can purchase their required materials at the designated locations at the official prices. (3) In the first three months of implementing this plan, the materials allocated to cotton farmers will be limited to cotton yarn. After this period, it will be extended to cigarettes, firecrackers, candles, sugar, and other daily necessities.

### Hangzhou New Tea Soon to Be on the Market

High Costs and Difficulties in Achieving Abundant Production

Tea is one of China's special products, and this port has always been an important outlet for Chinese tea exports. However, since the incident [likely refers to the outbreak of war], exports have been halted, and goods from the production areas cannot easily reach Shanghai, resulting in a sharp decline in the local tea market. In the past year, demand has only come from local retail shops and a slight need from new pharmaceutical businesses. The source of tea has been primarily limited to Hangzhou, with occasional shipments from Ningbo, but in very small quantities. As Qingming Festival approaches, Hangzhou tea is entering the budding season, and new tea will soon be on the market. According to inquiries with tea merchants, tea production this year will be limited due to years of local unrest, rising living costs, and continuously increasing tea production costs. Therefore, abundant production is unlikely, and prices are not expected to stabilize.

Editorial

### Observations on the National Commercial Control Association

Yesterday, The Times made the following observations on the establishment of the National Commercial Control Association: "The National Commercial Control Association provides civilian commercial organizations with a greater scope of activity to participate in the economic and industrial activities of the Central China region. From any perspective, the establishment of this organization can revive the economic prosperity of Central China and strengthen the Nanjing government's administrative power within the peaceful regions.

"According to the new regulations, the movement of goods in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River, which previously required permits issued by the Japanese military authorities, will now be issued by the Commercial Control Association. With the permission of the Association, the industrial and commercial sectors can move goods specified in the regulations from the Shanghai area to other peaceful areas, or from other peaceful areas to the Shanghai area. In this way, Shanghai's industry and commerce will surely benefit, thereby promoting the industrial revival of Shanghai and its neighboring areas.

"The Nanjing government is currently planning to establish economic bureaus in various provinces and cities, directly under the supervision of the Ministry of Industry, to be responsible for registering, supervising, and guiding various industrial and commercial organizations, and to promote the improvement of industrial and commercial enterprises, the revival of economic markets, and the adjustment of all commodity prices. These matters will be handled through the joint cooperation of the Economic Bureau and the National Commercial Control Association.

"From this, it can be seen that the scope of activity of the Commercial Control Association extends to all sectors of industry and commerce, and can serve as an intermediary liaison between the Nanjing government and the civilian economic sector. This measure can be truly called a necessary step to revive the Chinese economy, and the sincere cooperation of leaders in the Chinese banking and industrial and commercial sectors can become the guarantee of success for this plan. In the future, with the purchase of materials and the allocation of raw materials being controlled, the Nanjing government can witness the stability of national life, because without a stable national life, there can be no healthy economic development.

In the future, the responsibilities of leaders in the Chinese financial and industrial sectors will inevitably increase as they participate in the National Commercial Control Association. In any case, the foundation for cooperation between China and Japan and their people can now be established."

### Refusal of Passage for Uncertified Citizens in the City

Regarding the period during which residents of the city are applying for residence certificates, after the Shanghai Municipal Police extended the deadline to the end of this month for the city center and the district police extended it to the end of June, citizens applying for certificates in the city center have been extremely crowded in recent days. To encourage citizens to quickly apply for certificates, the police sub-bureaus in Nanshi have been strictly checking at the borders of the French and Chinese concessions. All uncertified citizens are prohibited from passing for one hour, as a warning against negligence. It is reported that after the expiration of the period in the city center, the police will strictly enforce the refusal of passage for uncertified citizens. This matter concerns the vital interests of citizens, so please do not delay and cause obstacles to passage in the future, so that petty criminals can be prevented from mingling in, and the security of the city center can be further consolidated.

### Thirtieth Ration of Food Allotted Entirely as Whole Rice

Yesterday, rice shops under contract with the Public Concession and the French Concession began to collect the purchase orders for the 30th ration of household food from the Municipal Council's rice and flour allocation office. These purchase orders were obtained by the rice industry association and then distributed to the contracted rice shops. Starting today, each rice shop will pay the Municipal Council according to the purchase order, and present the bill of lading to pick up the goods from the designated warehouse. The rice and flour will be sold starting from the 21st of this month, based on the rice and flour certificates. The effective period is until March 30th.

Quantity and Price

Yesterday, this reporter inquired with the rice industry and learned that the rice specified on the 30th purchase order is a single variety of whole rice, without the combination of broken rice, and is mostly white rice, with a small amount of brown rice. The flour is of two types: No. 2 flour and No. 3 flour. The quantity of whole rice and flour and the purchase price for each rice shop are the same as the previous period, so it is expected that the household ration for the next period will not change significantly, that is, 2.5 liters of rice, costing 6 yuan and 3 jiao, and a total of 1 jin and 12 liang of No. 2 and No. 3 flour, costing 3 yuan and 8 jiao and a half. However, the exact allocation quantity and price are subject to the official announcement of the Municipal Council.

Delayed Distribution of Coarse Grains

As for the distribution of coarse grains, although it was scheduled to be distributed along with the 30th ration of household food, the purchase orders collected by the rice shops yesterday did not include coarse grains. It is feared that it may not be realized. The exact distribution date is subject to the announcement.

If it is used twice, or used to transport rice that is not authorized by this permit, the Bureau will confiscate all the rice being transported without compensation."

### Celebration Tea Party at the Manchukuo Consulate General in Shanghai

### Trade Associations Secretly Investigate Inventory: No Protection for Those Who Conceal

In order to effectively suppress the sales prices of their respective members, the trade associations in the two concessions have been strictly investigating the inventory of their members recently. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, the trade association authorities believe that members often intentionally underreport the quantity of their inventory, transferring part of the goods for private sale on the black market. Therefore, in order to prevent this malpractice, the investigation work has been intensified. Recently, secret investigations have been implemented. If any goods obtained from wholesalers are found to be hidden in secret locations, they will be confiscated in full. In addition to implementing secret investigations, each trade association has also issued a clear warning to its members in order to understand their inventory, stating that if any member is found to have deceived the authorities, the trade association will not provide protection, and will cancel their membership status and suspend the allocation of goods.

### Zhang Hongsheng's Appeal: Sentence Changed to Death Penalty; Jiang Yilong's Imprisonment for Fifteen Years

Regarding the case of the murder of Hua Liying, a star dancer at the MGM Ballroom, who was strangled to death on the night of November 12th last year at her residence at 74 Hengmao Lane, Baxianqiao, the Second Special Court prosecuted Zhang Hongsheng for the crimes of robbery and murder, sentencing him to 15 years of imprisonment for the crimes of murder and theft, and depriving him of his civil rights for 10 years. Jiang Yilong was sentenced to 10 years of imprisonment for the same crimes, and deprived of his civil rights for 8 years. Subsequently, because the prosecutor and the French Concession authorities believed that the sentencing in the first instance was inappropriate, they appealed to the Third High Court. Zhang and Jiang also appealed at the same time. The case was heard by the High Court Collegial Panel on the 8th of this month. At that time, the French Concession authorities objected to the prosecutor's appeal as violating the agreement and not complying with the litigation procedure, and requested that it be rejected. The court ruled to reject the prosecutor's appeal and proceeded with the hearing. The French Concession authorities and the Zhang and Jiang appeals were declared closed, awaiting judgment. The judgment was announced yesterday afternoon, and the original judgment was revoked. Zhang Hongsheng was sentenced to death for joint robbery and intentional homicide, and deprived of his civil rights for life.

Since the French Municipal Council Health Department established the Child Protection Section on the 9th of this month, it has begun to handle matters related to the welfare of children in the French Concession. The nature of the section is exactly the same as the Child Protection Section of the Public Concession Municipal Council. Its most important work is to take in homeless children and wait for their parents to claim them. The French Concession Child Protection Section has also recently drafted measures to hold official publicity campaigns, similar to the "Children's Welfare Week" held by the Public Concession not long ago. The purpose of the publicity is to make residents of the French Concession understand the significance of the establishment of the section, and to inform parents of the educational knowledge they should have for their children.

### The Trend of Grave Robbing Has Resurfaced in the Suburbs of Shanghai; Local Authorities Strictly Pursue Perpetrators

After the war, incidents of tomb robbery and corpse desecration occurred repeatedly. Since the municipal authorities effectively investigated and prohibited them, this trend has been suppressed. Unexpectedly, the trend of grave robbing has resurfaced recently in Jiading and other districts in the suburbs of Shanghai. Many graves have been dug up in various villages, with corpses scattered everywhere, exposing the wilderness. The tragic situation is unbearable to witness. The Shanghai Garrison Headquarters reported that, in order to effectively prevent the continued occurrence of this type of incident, in addition to offering a reward of 3,000 yuan for the arrest of grave robbers, it has also ordered its subordinates to assist in the arrest in order to maintain the law.

### The Practice of Purchasing New Goods with Old Goods Will Gradually Be Implemented

In order to conserve resources in Shanghai, there is a growing trend towards gradually implementing the practice of purchasing new goods with old goods for various daily necessities. Currently, this practice has already begun for rubber overshoes and light bulbs. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter, in the near future, canned food, tin cans, or carton cigarettes, as well as various leather shoes, cloth shoes, and bottled ink, etc., may also implement this practice.

### Business Profit Tax: The Amount of Tax Payable Is Still Awaiting Verification; Old-Style Account Books Must Be Reviewed and Inspected

The Shanghai District Collection Bureau of the Income Tax Department of the Ministry of Finance has stipulated that the business profit tax for the 31st year of the Republic should be collected from all industries, businesses, banks, and money shops in this city starting this month, and has issued a general order to all industries to comply and complete the procedures for paying overdue taxes. The remittance shops affiliated with the Money Industry Association have already filled out the forms in detail, reporting their profits for last year. The association has collected them and submitted them to the bureau for review. Once the amount of tax payable has been reviewed and determined, each shop will pay the tax to the Shanghai branch of the Central Reserve Bank. The banking industry association is also actively working on it and will submit it to the bureau as soon as possible for review and tax payment. As for industrial, commercial, and company firms, those who keep new-style books have been rushing to file their returns, or have already completed and submitted them to the bureau. However, for those with old-style account books, the settlement and reporting procedures do not seem to be completed quickly. Even for those who have rushed to complete the work, the bureau will inevitably review the account books to verify the exact amount, and the work procedures will take some time before the tax payable can be determined. It is estimated that the business profit tax matters for various industries can be completed before June of this year.

### The Inaugural Meeting of the Local Security Association Held; The Meeting Place Is Temporarily Set in Nanshi; Mayor Chen Addressed the Meeting Yesterday

In order to strengthen the existing security associations in various districts and ensure local security, the municipal government of this city has organized a security association committee, which has been prepared and was officially established yesterday morning at 10:00 AM on the second floor of the municipal government. Secretary-General Zhao of the municipal government, as well as Director Lu Ying of the committee, and more than ten committee members including Pan Da, Tan Shuqian, Zhang Yicheng, Bu Lifu, Jin Shaofu, Lu Tieying, Ding Chao, and Xu Shaoxiu attended the meeting.

Hoping for Accurate Household Registration

After Chairman Lu Ying performed the necessary rituals, Mayor Chen delivered an address, mainly: (1) The security association is the foundation of self-government, and it is necessary to make the people understand the importance of the security association and complete the mission of the security association organization. However, the general public often disregards various important policies such as self-defense, education, and transportation, and refuses to fulfill their duties. This kind of mistaken concept should be corrected. (2) In terms of security association administration, it is hoped that the household registration will be accurate, so that the household registration of the security association is mutually consistent with the household registration of the police station and the district government. Subsequently, Director Lu made inquiries, stating that he would follow the guidelines instructed by the mayor, and hoped that the committee members would provide more suggestions at any time. The meeting concluded at 11:30 AM. It is understood that the association has appointed Zhang Yicheng as the director of the first section, Zhan Ximan as the director of the second section, and Zhu Yunsheng as the director of the third section.

On Saturday (the 20th), in the second round of the First Division, Lianyi will face the Portuguese Businessmen in the first round. The two teams drew 3-3.

### The Overflow of Human Desires

-- Huang Tong

A friend humorously said to me: "Mahjong and concubines are the characteristics of most lanes in Shanghai." This friend had no statistical basis, just said it casually. However, if we have the leisure to visit most lanes, we will surely hear the sounds of mahjong clattering. If you live in a lane for a long time, after careful inquiry, you will be surprised by the number of concubines in Shanghai.

Playing mahjong and taking concubines are serious pathologies in our country. This is undeniable and does not need to be denied. Some men are focused on making "easy money." After making money, they spend their days playing mahjong and enjoying themselves, and taking concubines for pleasure. Some women only have the skill of playing mahjong, are greedy and lazy, and willingly become concubines. Human desires overflow. How can the family be healthy? How can the country and society become wealthy and strong?

Rectifying the mind, being sincere in intention, cultivating oneself, managing the family, governing the country, and bringing peace to the world - this set of skills is not the pedantry of Confucianism. If the country and nation are not to be corrupted and eliminated, this set of skills is absolutely indispensable.

Banning gambling by law and not giving concubines legal protection does have considerable effect. The fundamental solution still lies in: popularizing education, developing industry and commerce, and promoting wholesome entertainment. If government officials and people with status in society, as well as university professors, middle and primary school teachers, all lead by example, they will surely be able to change customs and eliminate long-standing malpractices.

### On the Broad Sense of Reading

— Jiang Lang

Speaking of reading, many people think of it as an ivory tower, inaccessible; many people think of it as a confusing crossroads, unable to find the direction forward. But it can be said that these are all reactions to randomly picking up one or two books that are not suitable for oneself, resulting in giving up halfway, feeling stiff and boring. As a result, not only does it not increase one's interest in books, but it adds to the feeling of being overwhelmed by them. In fact, reading is not about gnawing on a bound or hardcover book, reading from the first sentence to the last. This is a narrow way of reading, only suitable for beginners.

However, reading is not for the sake of reading paper-bound books, but for the sake of life, to explore from them the paths of our lives and solve the problems of our lives. But everyone's path is different, and the author cannot write a book that is suitable for everyone. The difficulties that each person encounters on the road of life are by no means identical, so the author can only crudely provide some references. For this reason, reading should not blindly follow the book, but should be developed in the nature surrounding you. This is what is called reading in the broad sense.

Nature is a wordless encyclopedia. Are not the organizational situations of various nations and countries in the world ready-made reference books on economics, politics, and society? Are not mountains, rivers, forests, flowers, birds, fish, insects, and animals all-encompassing biology books? Is not the principle of apples falling and iron rusting a textbook of physics and chemistry? Therefore, we can obtain things described in books anytime and anywhere, and we can also get a lot of supplementary materials that we get from ourselves, enough for a lifetime of use.

From the above points, reading is undoubtedly to enrich knowledge. Knowledge itself is like the light of the sun, which everyone in the world can enjoy, except for some self-abandoned people who would rather not see the light of day. Then they will only end up as anemic weaklings for the rest of their lives, and as a result, they will not be able to solve the difficulties of life, nor will they be able to become complete people in society.

Since the opportunity to seek knowledge is everywhere, we should think of some ways not to let them escape, we must grasp them as much as possible and use them as much as possible, and then we must rely on the following rules to do it:

(A) Precise observation—If we want to learn a kind of knowledge and skills well, we must observe it in detail and find out where its truth lies. "Absent-minded, seeing without seeing, hearing without hearing, eating without knowing the taste." It can be seen that no matter what it is, it is difficult to be effective if it is not observed carefully and calmly. Therefore, when you are wandering in the park, you should use your eyes to observe the life forms of plants and animals. When visiting a factory, you can observe the power of the machines and doubt how the force originating in only one place can make all the machines generate power and work. So Watt also said a sentence: "My success is nothing more than observing all the new discoveries."

(B) Recording—Some people say: "Thoughts are like a bird. If you don't catch it immediately, it will fly away in an instant." To preserve the knowledge we get from observation by relying on memory is the most wasteful thing of brain power and time. Therefore, we must catch our own insights and record them at any time and anywhere. This has two advantages: one is to expand the realm of one's own knowledge, so that it gradually has new discoveries due to the expansion of the realm; the other is to obtain corroboration, so that one's own opinions can be cited with the things seen, and to study whether the two aspects are accurate and appropriate. It is said that the American novelist Hawthorne always carried a small notebook with him, whether he was walking on the street, sitting in the car, or traveling to various places, and he immediately wrote down whatever thoughts emerged. (We can imitate this.)

(C) Conversation—The pursuit of knowledge now is collective, not the era when one person lived quietly in an ancient temple or sat alone in a study and read the Four Books and Five Classics. Instead, it is the era of gathering a few like-minded friends to talk about each other's insights, which is the most beneficial to knowledge. Preserve what is worth preserving and record it for future reference. Discard what is not worth preserving, so that one's own knowledge will naturally become correct.

This is my so-called broad sense of reading, and there are certainly many omissions. But if you can lay a good foundation in books, and then give up using books (not absolutely) and engage in the observation of nature, the recording of observation insights, and the conversation of corroborating insights and ideas, this can also increase a person's knowledge.

### Wooden Motor Sailing Ship

— Long Fisherman

The newspaper reported: Hong Kong's construction overview, which mentioned: "...Regarding the construction and repair of ships, the progress is very smooth, and the construction of wooden motor sailing ships has achieved particularly good results. In order to enhance Hong Kong's transportation capacity, this type of wooden motor sailing ship has now been used for the transportation of materials between Hong Kong and the south, and wooden motor sailing ships have been used as a major supplement to local transportation..."

At a time when prices are soaring and ships are scarce, the construction of wooden motor sailing ships is indeed a major event that cannot be delayed! We should use this type of ship as the only means of transportation at present! Such as evacuating the surplus population to their hometowns, transporting food to Vietnam, Thailand, etc... can all be used.

It is said that the Daozhong wooden motor ship is equipped with wooden machines, which are rotated by manpower and do not require fuel, which is very convenient. If Shanghai has this kind of wooden motor sailing ship, then Tianjin, Qingdao, Xiamen, Shantou, Hong Kong, and the Yangtze River Basin can all use it as the only tool for transporting materials.

### Genius Mystery

— Sha Lei

Being able to write poetry at the age of three and compose prose at the age of seven is respected as a genius. Edison's achievements in electricity are also called the invention of a genius. Genius, genius, how many people admire it like a mystery.

However, there are also people who fundamentally deny the existence of genius in the world, saying that this is nothing more than the words of those who do not work hard to shirk the responsibilities they should bear.

Suppose we admit that there is indeed genius in the world. Comparing two children with the same musical genius, one is placed in a remote mountain temple, not allowed to contact the outside world, not allowed to tune the pipes and play the strings; what about the other? Let him immerse himself in the atmosphere of music every day, supervise him, educate him, and as a result, it is not difficult for us to think of the differences between them. The former becomes a fool, while the latter has achievements in music. Then, should we say that the former has no genius, and only admit that the latter has genius?

In this way, innate genius is not enough to rely on at all - it is like a tender sapling, without the nourishment of sunlight and rain, without fertilization and cultivation, even if it is lucky enough not to lose its vitality, it will definitely grow weak and inconspicuous. Therefore, a towering ancient tree has the conditions for its height and size. A child with genius, the acquired environment and upbringing, rewards and inducements, and his own efforts, can promote and encourage

Edison said: "One point of genius, nine points of effort." I think this is the appropriate interpretation of genius.

### Root

— Xin Bo

After writing for a while, he suddenly stopped writing, turned his head, and asked the person on the earthen bed, "What is the price?"

"Didn't you say fifty-four yuan?" Yang Zijie replied.

"No, no," Genming hurriedly continued, "Fifty-four yuan is really not enough. Please, Mr. Huang, add some more." He said it very clearly and calmly.

"Old Gen, don't be insatiable," Huang Chong'an said with a straight face, "If it weren't for staying at your house for a few days three months ago, I wouldn't even want your field! Go and find out, in today's world, who is willing to put out cash to buy fields!"

"Yes! That's also because I said it again and again that Mr. Huang added four yuan to you. Now,..." Yang Zijie's words.

While they were talking about the amount of the price, Yu Duzhou's pen kept stopping, not writing down.

Genming still did not express his agreement, only saying "not enough, not enough" in a low voice.

"If you really want to use a few more yuan," Yang Zijie got off the earthen bed and walked to the account table, "then it is better to change the living contract to a dead contract." His hoarse voice was even more hoarse because he was a little anxious.

"I can't do this," Genming also stood up, seemingly afraid that Yu Duzhou would really write a dead contract, and wanted to stop it in advance, "I still have five sons!"

They had another argument. Genming had no timidity at all at this critical moment. He said that Huang Chong'an bought hundreds of acres of land every year, and it didn't matter to give a few more yuan for the price of one acre, and he also said that if Huang Chong'an helped him in his urgent need, he would always be grateful and would definitely try to repay him in the future, not to mention the kindness of staying at his house three or four months ago.

### Second Report on Small Loan Program

Our small loan program has always relied on donations from all walks of life. However, it has been found that donations have been scarce in the past two months, while the number of applicants has been increasing, resulting in weak deposits. Therefore, we have had to temporarily limit each person to a loan of fifty yuan. At a time when prices are high and rising, how can one make a living with a mere fifty yuan? For this reason, our office is appealing to enthusiastic people from all walks of life again, hoping for a steady stream of assistance so that the loan amount can be slightly increased, so that poor compatriots can maintain their livelihoods and alleviate the pain of living under pressure. As of March 15th, a total of 9,150.00 yuan has been received in donations, 1,260.00 yuan has been loaned out, and 7,890.00 yuan remains.

Preferential Treatment for Teachers in Group Weddings. The Da Lai Group Wedding has been held for 15 sessions, with a fee of only 120 yuan.

All current primary and secondary school teachers who are certified by this newspaper will receive a 10% discount. The address of the association is Zhifu Road, telephone number 94546.

Jisheng Association provides medical treatment. The Chinese Jisheng Association in Sheng'an Lane, Ningbo Road, is scheduled to continue providing medical treatment and medicine from the 12th day of the second lunar month of this year, only taking a registration fee of five cents.
