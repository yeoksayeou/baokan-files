### Establishment of Wartime Cultural Policy Guidelines

The "Total War Participation" has reached the stage of implementation, requiring that all undertakings in the political, economic, and cultural sectors nationwide adapt to the needs of wartime and complete the wartime system. This is to concentrate all human, material, and intellectual resources to strive for ultimate victory. The wartime political system has now been established and is being implemented. In the economic field, the National Defense Temporary Conference has passed the "Wartime Economic Policy Guidelines," which will soon be implemented. However, in order to thoroughly implement the wartime political and economic policy guidelines, we further hope that the government will quickly and carefully establish wartime cultural policy guidelines.

Culture is the highest manifestation of a country's national strength, and wartime culture is the driving force behind the people's "Total War Participation." In peacetime, a country's rise and fall can be seen in its cultural situation; in wartime, if cultural policies are correct and cultural movements are active, then all wartime policies and measures will inevitably be widely understood and supported by the people. It can universally mobilize all active and passive forces among the people, implement policies and decrees, and achieve final victory. Conversely, if wartime culture is not emphasized, if there is no correct wartime cultural policy and the earnest execution of such a policy, then even with perfect political and economic policies and wartime implementations, it will be difficult to achieve thorough implementation in practice.

The main task of the wartime cultural policy guidelines is to mobilize the people of the whole country to participate in the fight to defend East Asia and liberate China. Therefore, this policy guideline must be proactive and constructive, to improve and promote the cultural standards of China. Especially in China today, after six years of long-term turmoil and unrest, cultural undertakings have long fallen into a state of decline and stagnation. Therefore, today's wartime cultural policy guidelines must first and foremost be proactive and constructive wartime cultural policy guidelines, providing multifaceted guidance to national cultural undertakings, encouraging and promoting national culture, and expanding all wartime facilities in the cultural arena, so that the people of the whole country can enter a brand-new cultural garden. In this garden, they can understand the world, understand the times, understand their own motherland and its true friends and enemies, and then spontaneously and automatically dedicate themselves to the cause of national and East Asian liberation. This is the prerequisite for establishing wartime cultural policy guidelines.

The current war, from the perspective of the nation, is a war against Anglo-American enslavement of China. Therefore, China's wartime cultural policy must mainly be a cultural policy suitable for mobilizing the strength of the Chinese people. It must be Chinese, and especially a cultural policy that can be loved and accepted by the majority of the Chinese people. This is one. Secondly, from the perspective of the East Asian nations, this war is a war in which the East Asian nations rise up to resist and eliminate the aggressive policies of Anglo-American imperialism. Therefore, the wartime cultural policy guidelines must have the characteristics of the East Asian national liberation movement and the characteristics of opposing Anglo-American imperialist culture. We must thoroughly liquidate the actual situation of the European and American colonial management policies for the past hundred years, such as the deception, anesthetization, and exploitation of the nations of East Asia, through wartime cultural policy guidelines with such characteristics. At the same time, we must actively establish a new culture that guarantees the independence and liberation of the East Asian nations, especially the research and promotion of Chinese and Japanese cultures, the research and promotion of the cultures of all East Asian nations, and the establishment of a solid cultural front among the East Asian nations. This is two. Furthermore, from an international perspective, this war is a war to eliminate the old order of the Anglo-American imperialist system, and its purpose is to establish a new world order in which all countries and nations help each other and seek common development. Therefore, the wartime cultural policy guidelines we hope for must have this new era significance and world significance. This is three. The above three are the basic principles of the wartime cultural policy guidelines.

With the prerequisites and basic principles, let us then talk about the specific content, which can be divided into negative and positive aspects. The negative aspect is naturally the implementation of wartime cultural control: (1) Clearly stipulate the scope and methods of wartime restrictions on the people's speech, publication, writing, and communication, so that the people and the media have something to follow. (2) Regarding the consumption of cultural materials, there should be strict and reasonable control, especially for paper, ink, etc. Publications that do not contribute to wartime national policy and are not beneficial to social and national culture should be restricted. Necessary restrictions should also be made on the consumption of cultural materials by non-cultural departments. However, we must especially understand the poverty of Chinese culture, so negative restrictions should only be implemented occasionally in cases of absolute necessity. The most important thing is to actively guide and cultivate in order to build China's wartime culture.

So, what should be done in the positive aspect? First, it is necessary to concentrate specialized talents from all aspects and establish a national-scale cultural front under the correct leadership of the government. This is a cultural headquarters for cooperation between officials and the people. Its main task is to promote and implement wartime cultural policies, and to advance the work of wartime cultural mobilization. This is not only to control all cultural departments, cultural undertakings, and cultural movements nationwide, but also, and more importantly, to strive to promote wartime culture, develop national cultural undertakings, promote wartime cultural movements, and improve the cultural standards of the people nationwide. Second, the wartime cultural policy guidelines must stipulate methods for uniting warriors in all aspects of the cultural world, and should truly concentrate the strength of the whole country to promote wartime cultural movements, develop Chinese cultural undertakings, and improve the cultural standards of the people. Third, it is necessary to cultivate a large number of wartime cultural cadres and create a new army of cultural undertakings for the new China. Therefore, the creation of the highest central cultural research institution and the establishment of a national cultural cadre training institution are even more urgent undertakings in this wartime. This matter is of great importance not only for the present but also for the future construction of China, and must be carried out carefully today. Fourth, we hope that there will be a fixed and substantial amount of funding in the government budget to develop cultural undertakings and promote cultural movements, and that the society will also cooperate in promoting cultural donation movements. The main uses of this kind of funding should be stipulated as: (1) Universally increasing the number of public libraries, museums, especially exhibitions of wartime life in various countries, and all exhibitions that adapt to wartime culture, etc. (2) Subsidizing private cultural undertakings—newspapers, magazines, libraries, publishing companies, etc.—to promote cultural movements and improve national cultural standards. What is even more urgent is (3) In view of the hardship of the daily lives of cultural figures at present, appropriate subsidies should be given with a certain amount of funding, such as the universal establishment of research institutes and specialized academic grants, so that aspiring literati can concentrate on the specialized study of culture and academics: special awards should be set up to reward people who have made contributions in culture: in particular, responsible institutions should also be set up to assist cultural figures with illness and difficulties at any time and anywhere.

Culture is the driving force for realizing total war participation. We hope that the government will set wartime cultural policy guidelines as soon as possible and implement them earnestly. We also expect all sectors of society, especially the cultural world itself, to rise up together and promote its realization.

Soviet forces in the Novorossiysk area of the Taman Peninsula were repulsed yesterday. German forces in Krasnodar are moving according to plan. Fierce fighting erupted in the northeast of Kharkov the day before yesterday. Most enemy forces were repulsed, and those that penetrated German lines were mostly surrounded and easily annihilated. North of Kursk, Soviet forces attacked in several waves but achieved nothing, losing a large number of prisoners and equipment. Only minor battles have occurred in the central sector of the Eastern Front in recent days. Soviet forces continue to attack between Volkhov and Lake Ladoga, and in the Leningrad area.

Izyum Sees Heavy Soviet Concentration, Aiming to Attack Rostov

Stockholm, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to Eastern Front sources, the situation in the Don River estuary became more intense again on the afternoon of the 13th. German forces engaged advancing Soviet forces on a 250-kilometer front east of Rostov, with large-scale mechanized battles unfolding in various locations. According to Soviet communiqués over the past two days, Soviet forces have advanced to Krasnoarmeysk, a key railway junction 50 kilometers south of Krasnodar, and to the vicinity of Voroshilovsk, 150 kilometers north of Rostov, and it is widely rumored that they have approached Rostov. German front-line reports on the 13th stated that German forces are currently launching fierce attacks, cutting off communication between the advancing Soviet units and their rear, and launching encirclement and annihilation operations in several areas.

Berlin, 14th (Havas) - Although the weather in the southern sector of the Eastern Front is mild, the snow and ice have not yet melted, so the enemy's offensive is not affected. The Donets Basin remains the center of the enemy's offensive, with fierce battles unfolding at several railway hubs. In the Izyum area, the Soviets have concentrated heavy forces, seemingly intending to outflank the German rear and attack Rostov. The German High Command's counteroffensive actions have not yet produced very significant results.

Several Points Behind German Lines, Infiltrating Soviet Forces Annihilated

Vichy, 14th (Havas) - A correspondent stationed in Berlin reports that in the past 24 hours, German and Soviet forces have continued to fight fiercely. The Red Army is currently doing everything possible to take full advantage of the current climate and launch continuous offensives. The Red Army High Command, drawing on the experience and lessons learned from the past two years of combat, seems to be making every effort to improve the Red Army's position before the winter passes, as the Red Army is better suited to winter warfare. Not only that, but the Red Army can also take full advantage of its deep understanding of Soviet geography and the possibilities of winter warfare. However, the German side is also studying special strategies to adapt to the Soviet climate. Therefore, at the beginning of the Red Army's winter offensive, it dug trenches in the snow to transport troops to the front for combat. By now, the German army has already understood these strategies and is using artillery and landmines to counter the Red Army, rendering its strategies ineffective. German officials are keeping silent about the alarming news released by the Soviet side and are not paying much attention to it. It is generally said that the Eastern Front cannot be considered a fixed front, divided by definite points, especially in the south, where the situation is chaotic. In some places, the Red Army has penetrated behind German lines but has been annihilated by German forces. On another occasion, the Red Army surrounded German forces, but was instead surrounded by German forces and then cleared out. In short, the situation on the Eastern Front is extremely chaotic. German war reports also do not specify locations, but the areas involved in the fighting are in fact more suitable for the current situation. In addition, according to a correspondent stationed in the Hungarian capital, the fighting near Kursk is the most intense, with Hungarian armored units fighting alongside German forces to stop the Red Army's advance.

### British and Japanese Newspapers Discuss Submarine Warfare: Allied Crisis Severe

Tokyo, 14th (Havas) - The "Mainichi Shimbun" published an editorial stating that the effectiveness of submarine warfare can be explained by the following facts: During World War I, Britain once faced the danger of complete collapse. Today, the crisis facing the anti-Axis powers has also reached a very serious stage. The United States had to admit last month that 601 American ships have been lost since entering the war, most of which were sunk by German submarines. This danger has not only not disappeared, but is constantly increasing. The Allies have established a special committee to study countermeasures, but it is to no avail. Churchill, in order to reassure people, once said in a speech that German submarine activity has decreased, while Allied merchant ships are constantly increasing. However, such statements were also made during the most dangerous period for British merchant ships in 1917. Germany has now promoted Admiral Dönitz, an expert in submarine warfare, to Commander-in-Chief of the Navy, which shows Germany's determination to engage in submarine warfare with all its strength. German submarine activity will inevitably continue to intensify.

Bern, 13th (Havas) - The London Daily Mail published an article today, elaborating on the crisis of submarines to Allied shipping, stating that so far, the Allies have not been able to prevent enemy submarines from attacking convoys, and the various methods of bombing enemy submarine bases have also failed. In addition, due to the impact of enemy submarine attacks, domestic food shortages are becoming increasingly serious. The authorities have probably not yet fully released the exact number of Allied ship losses.

### Former Bulgarian Army Chief Shot Dead, Background Not Yet Ascertained

Sofia, 14th (Havas) - Former Bulgarian Army Minister Rusev was shot dead in front of his residence at 9 p.m. last night.

Sofia, 14th (Havas) - Regarding the assassination of former Bulgarian Army Chief General Rusev, it is now known that on Saturday night, Rusev accompanied a friend home after watching the German film "Front Stage." As he was opening the door with his key, his daughter glimpsed someone outside shooting at him from inside the house. The murderer immediately ran to the door and fired several more shots at Rusev, who was lying in a pool of blood. His daughter screamed, and a street policeman responded and arrived, but the murderer had already fled, along with an accomplice. Soon after, the police chief also arrived and surrounded the area to search. The Bulgarian Army Chief and Interior Minister also arrived shortly after. The background of the case has not yet been ascertained. Bulgarian newspapers claim that the incident was carried out by Bulgaria's enemies. Rusev was 56 years old, born in Varna, and graduated from the Bulgarian Military Academy in Sofia in 1907. During World War I, he served as a artillery commander. In 1916, he was assigned to the German 185th Division. In 1934, he became commander of the Bulgarian 3rd Division and later that year became Army Chief, holding the position until January 4, 1938. During his tenure, he reorganized the Bulgarian army, making significant contributions. He is currently a leader of the Bulgarian Student National Movement.

### Indian Viceroy Invites Various Parties to Hold Regular Meetings to Discuss Gandhi's Hunger Strike, The Mahasabha Party Demands Immediate Release

Stamford, 14th (Central News Agency) - The Indian Viceroy's office has been greatly embarrassed since Gandhi's hunger strike, so it plans to convene pro-British Indian politicians in the near future to discuss countermeasures. According to a dispatch from New Delhi, a meeting has been scheduled for the 18th in New Delhi. It is rumored that representatives from all parties and factions in India have been invited to attend, such as Rajagopalachari, the former Governor of Madras who advocates cooperation between Hindus and Muslims, Jinnah, the president of the Muslim League, Haq, the Governor of Bengal, Sabarkar, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Sapru, the president of the Liberal League, and George, the leader of the Central Legislative Assembly.

The Committee further suggested that the conflict between the government and Indian nationalists be temporarily set aside to save Gandhi's life.

Lisbon, 14th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from New Delhi, Gandhi has been on hunger strike for three days. His attending physician, Dr. Major, said regarding his health condition that apart from lack of sleep, his overall health condition is still satisfactory.

Lisbon, 13th (Havas) - New Delhi reports that the Indian government has released the exchange of documents between the Home Secretary and Gandhi. In his letter, the Home Secretary proposed to Gandhi that he be completely free during his hunger strike, and expressed his hope that he would move out of the Aga Khan Palace detention center, and hoped that he would stop the hunger strike. The letter included a government bulletin drafted regarding this matter, but stated that if Gandhi was still on hunger strike in prison, the bulletin would not be released. Gandhi replied refusing the suggestion to temporarily restore his freedom, but said that if he was released, he could reconsider his hunger strike. He decided to go on hunger strike in prison. The Home Secretary then sent another letter to Gandhi, stating that there was no change in the Indian government's position, but since Gandhi had decided to go on hunger strike, he should take responsibility and bear the risks.

Vichy Worries About Gandhi's Health

Vichy, 13th (Havas) - Since Gandhi's hunger strike, all sectors here have been extremely anxious. In the past, Gandhi has used hunger strikes to express his political views seven times, all based on his unwavering will and indomitable spirit. However, the situation of this hunger strike is slightly different, because he is 74 years old and is often ill, with doctors by his side, so his health is worrying. According to common experience, after a hunger strike of seven or eight days, there is a risk to life, but there are also those who can survive a hunger strike of thirty or forty days. For example, in 1760, Mr. Ge Giloam suffered from illness and could not eat or drink, and was bedridden for four years. Later, he felt dry in his mouth and was fed a few drops of wine. At the time, he was in so much pain that everyone thought he would not recover. Then, a few drops of milk were given to him, and the pain gradually subsided. As a result, Ge Giloam was able to resume eating and drinking. It is generally believed by scientists that a hunger strike of 20 days will not cause an accident, especially if the person carrying out the hunger strike is motivated by passion, making them more able to persevere. This is also the same for those who have gone on hunger strikes repeatedly. According to Dr. Baogai's report on the duration of voluntary hunger strikes, Marati fasted for 50 days, Danna for 40 days, and Susi for 30 days. In recent years, hunger strikes have also occurred in the Soviet Union. The newspapers did not publish their names, but only said that someone fasted for 50 days, drank a small amount of boiled water every day, and was still able to survive, but his weight decreased by a quarter. In addition, there was also Mayor Cook, Maxwell, who died after fasting for 73 days. The Italian, Teng Ke Ge, died in prison in 1929 after fasting for 65 days. It is essential that the will is strong for those fasting. For example, after the shipwreck of the ship Medusa, all 150 passengers drifted with the waves. After four or five days, only 77 people were left, and after another seven days, only 15 people remained.

British-Indian Institutions Continuously Attacked

Stamford, 13th (Allied Press) - According to a New Delhi radio report, a total of 828 institutions under the British Indian Political Office have been set on fire or destroyed by Indian patriots since last August, including 192 police stations, 318 railway stations, and 318 telegraph and telephone offices.

The cold Shanxi front, active Japanese soldiers, quench their thirst by taking ice in the Taihang Mountains.

### Wartime National Life in Various Countries (II)

— Written by Ryoichi Ishii, Translated by Jingyi

Germany, Italy, America, England, Soviet Union

America

The United States, blessed by nature, is experiencing increasing food shortages due to wartime demand, supplies to the Allied nations, and transportation issues. Sugar consumption has been severely restricted, starting October 9th, with meatless Tuesdays. New York City, in particular, must have two meatless days per week. The import of processed beef and lamb is prohibited due to shipping constraints. These essential items have been reduced by approximately 20%. A rationing system is being planned. Sugar allocation has been reduced by about 30% due to domestic sugar production. However, due to shipping difficulties, the import of cane sugar from Java and the Philippines is impossible. Therefore, since May 4th of last year, a rationing system of half a pound per person per week has been implemented. For other canned vegetables, fruits, and other storable foods, an annual allocation of five pounds is given. Recently, coffee has also been rationed, and other materials are gradually being subjected to regulations for proper consumption. Wheat is the only item with a surplus due to overproduction; even without production for two years, it can still be self-sufficient and thus has a surplus. However, overall food prices are rising, which affects the livelihoods of the people. Therefore, on October 5th, a decree was issued to halt the rising prices of food items, using the highest prices from September 28th to October 2nd as the standard, with a temporary validity period of 60 days.

In terms of clothing, especially wool, civilian use is almost entirely prohibited due to insufficient supply. Currently, mixed silk products are used, and the materials for both men's and women's clothing have been reduced in quality. Therefore, rayon has become very popular recently. Socks have also been significantly weakened due to the Japanese ban on raw silk exports. Other materials, such as rubber, are in short supply, so the manufacture of civilian small cars and trucks is prohibited. Rubber shoes are also subject to rationing. Car tires are not readily available, and gasoline is also rationed. Petroleum is allocated. After November, safety razors, lighters, fountain pens, powder compacts, and various shelves and other special daily necessities that require iron are successively prohibited from being manufactured. Due to the increased need for scrap iron, the slogan to destroy unused machinery is loudly proclaimed. Recently, the 10,000-ton memorial battleship Coolidge has also been decided to be dismantled to obtain 7,000 tons of scrap iron. At the same time, various scrap metal items owned by private individuals are collected. On the one hand, consumption is reduced to be a source of funds for the war. Recently, taxes have been greatly increased, such as excise taxes on cigarettes, beer, and other alcoholic beverages, all increased across the board. Cigarette taxes have increased by 20%, and a bottle of beer that cost one yuan now costs two yuan and fifty cents. The price of alcoholic beverages has increased from 22% to a high of 55%.

Coal is also gradually becoming insufficient. Since last winter, there have been rumors of implementing fuel conservation, reducing consumption by 25% compared to normal. In terms of housing, there is a feeling of housing scarcity in the areas of military factories. As a result, rents have also risen sharply. The government, on October 5th, limited rents and prohibited further increases. Other equipment inside homes, such as pots and kettles, are standardized with manufacturing specifications of about 60%. Judging from the restriction on the manufacture of metal products, we can imagine that the residential lives of the American people are already very difficult.

England

The food problem in England is also becoming more profound day by day. The current rationed quantities are generally lower than when the rationing system was first implemented in January of the previous year. Compared to pre-war consumption, sugar has been reduced by 39%, meat by 60%, bacon, ham, and margarine by 66.7%, butter by 52%, cheese by 33%, and black tea by 66%. The recent allocation is 32 grams of sugar, 8 grams of cheese, 32 grams of butter, 15 grams of lard, 8 grams of tea, 73 grams of beef, and 16 grams of pork per person per day. Among these, the monthly allocation of sugar is about 1.6 catties, which is about three times the 0.6 catties allocated to urban dwellers in Japan per month. However, the average British citizen consumes a lot of sugar daily. If it is reduced to about 40% of the normal consumption, the impact would be too great. Although this allocation system is still maintained recently, it is actually difficult to buy. It will be more difficult in the future. Other items such as butter, lard, fruits, and meat will also become difficult to buy. The biggest reason for the reduction in butter is that New Zealand, the world's only butter-producing region, cannot ship its products. Similarly, fruits cannot be shipped from Australia. In addition, rice, beans, and dried noodles will soon be rationed. Only bread, milk, and vegetables are not yet rationed, but bread is no longer available on the market. Milk has been under control since October of the previous year. As for eggs, there are only two or three per month.

Ordinary restaurants or large cafes can superficially be freely patronized, but each meal is limited to three dishes, not exceeding five shillings at most. Therefore, there is a great shortage of items in first-class hotels now. Occasionally, a dried orange is placed on the table, and everyone considers it very precious and cheers in unison. Under these circumstances, the soaring value of food items is, of course, conceivable. To curb rising prices, the government has allocated 140 million pounds to handle this matter, but the extent to which it can be suppressed is still a question.

In terms of clothing, such as wool and cotton clothing, which used to be shipped from Australia, New Zealand, South Africa, and India, is now impossible. Therefore, the national life has been greatly affected. At that time, for the sake of economy, each person was allocated 66 points of clothing vouchers per year, later changed to 60 points, and now it has been further reduced. A suit of clothes costs 26 points, shoes 5 points, a shirt 5 points, socks 1 point, an undershirt 3 points, a towel 1 point, and underwear 3 points.

Other materials, such as iron, are lacking, so iron products are being collected on a large scale. Antiques and utensils containing a certain amount of iron are registered and prohibited from being transferred. All existing goods exceeding three tons are requisitioned, and a large-scale collection campaign is underway to reach a quantity of 10,000 tons. Recently, the iron window grilles and other iron materials in the primary school next to Edinburgh have been almost completely dismantled, and the iron doors in the air-raid shelters have also been successively recovered. The situation of such a lack of iron can be imagined. In addition, the recovery campaign of metals such as copper, lead, zinc, tin, brass, cupronickel, and aluminum has also been implemented.

To save fuel and rubber, the use of private cars is prohibited. At the same time, to alleviate the increase in transportation volume, various discounted tickets for recreational travel were abolished on October 5th. The number of trips parents made to visit their refugee children has also been reduced from six to three since last winter, and there are rumors of prohibiting the operation of long-distance buses. Household coal is registered, and those who violate the rules will have their supply stopped. Last winter, the Fuel Department ordered that the winter household coal consumption allocation be reduced to four million tons. From government offices to banks, companies, and theaters, the use of heating was uniformly prohibited in October. This year, the use of heating is only allowed from December. Theaters, cinemas, and stores are also closing earlier.

Regarding the coal shortage problem, according to the British economic magazine, the estimated shortage is 44 million tons. After saving consumption, 10 million tons can be saved. The rest will be compensated for by increasing production. However, incidents such as strikes and work stoppages by coal miners are expanding daily, so summoning workers is also a very difficult problem. Although the government intends to nationalize the mining industry to some extent, managed by the government, and allow workers to demand higher wages, the effect is still very limited. Therefore, the public extremely criticizes the government's policy of recalling soldiers serving in the military from the front line to work in mining, as well as various other government measures. The government had no choice but to mobilize young people aged 18 to 25 to engage in mining in order to increase coal production. At the same time, it mobilized news and broadcasting to promote fuel conservation efforts. The lack of fuel has a great impact on the war. Other items such as paper are also in short supply, so the number of newspaper pages has been reduced. Envelopes are even being turned over and reused for the second time.

Soviet Union

The Soviet Union's main food items, such as flour, do not seem to be a major problem, but the supply of side dishes is far worse than before the war. We can see this from the following table showing the rations of the rationing system implemented in various places in July of the previous year.

A, representing muscular laborers and technicians;

B, representing general employees;

C, representing housewives and travelers;

D, representing children under 12 and the elderly.

Bread is calculated on a daily basis, and other items are calculated on a monthly basis.

As of now, the bread ration has not changed, but dry noodles have been reduced by 40%, sugar and desserts by 60%, and butter and meat (including fish) by half. But this quantity is often not actually available. To buy food, you are supposed to go to state-owned stores, but they are often sold out quickly. If you go to the free market, you can buy one kilo of butter for only 20 rubles in state-owned stores, but here, it costs 700 rubles. Other foods that do not require vouchers are not available in state-owned stores, so even though you know the prices are high, you have to go to the free market to buy them.

Clothing materials are rationed at the same time as food. Each person is issued a ration coupon once every six months. The allocation is 25 points for laborers and technicians, 100 points for general employees, and 80 points for children, the elderly, and others without a fixed occupation. Cotton and silk fabrics are 10 points per meter, leather shoes are 30 points, outerwear and other clothing items; wool fabrics are 80 points, cotton fabrics are 60 points, shirts are 10 to 12 points, and socks are 2 points. But the manufacture of clothes has almost completely stopped, so although there are vouchers in name, they are practically zero. However, the Soviet people had prepared for these kinds of items before the war, so they can still manage to use them for now.

The soap allocation is one bar of perfumed soap and one bar of laundry soap each month. In addition, paper and matches are also very scarce.

Coal is also a problem. Since the Donbass coal mine was occupied by Germany, the lack of coal has intensified. As a result, the coal allocation has been reduced by 60%, and electricity has been reduced by 30%. Since last winter, heating has also been reduced accordingly. In terms of housing: in cities in the free zone, there is also a feeling of housing scarcity due to the sharp increase in the refugee population. The population of cities in Siberia has doubled, and residents of Moscow who have moved inland are ordered to surrender their homes for others to live in and are prohibited from moving back. Some cities even prohibit travel to alleviate the housing problem.

The above is only a brief statement of the national life of Germany, Italy, England, the United States, and the Soviet Union. In short, materials are becoming increasingly scarce. How will the people be able to endure this? We must know that in this extraordinary period, no matter what, we must cultivate sufficient endurance because this is the foundation for us to prepare our domestic system to achieve the final victory!

### Germany's New Tax Laws Not Yet Implemented; Considering Taxing Industry

Berlin, 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The new tax laws recently announced by German Minister of Economic Affairs Funk have not yet been implemented and are still under discussion. However, it is understood that those with an income of more than 8,000 marks will be subject to new taxes. The past wartime surtax only accounted for 50% of income tax, but it may be doubled in the future. The extent of the increase in business tax is not yet known. The authorities are currently considering taxing industry. If so, Germany's revenue could increase by 2,500,000,000 marks. Those who own real estate will also pay the same taxes, estimated to total 8,000,000,000 marks. At the same time, the government's value payments to the armaments industry are reduced, which can save hundreds of thousands of marks each year. The purpose of the new tax laws is to limit excessive private income and reduce the national debt. The deposits of German public savings banks increased from 15,000,000,000 marks to 50,000,000,000 marks in 1942. This amount has been absorbed by the state to be used as war expenses and paid with public bonds with an interest rate of 3.5%. Germany's war expenses in 1943 will obviously increase. In the past, 50% of Germany's war expenses came from borrowing, and the other 50% came from taxes and other national income. The total amount of Germany's income in the fiscal year from April 1, 1942, to March 31, 1943, was 50,000,000,000 marks. During the same period, Germany's war expenses amounted to 100,000,000,000 marks. The countries occupied by the German army, the Protectorate of Bohemia and Moravia, and former Poland contributed approximately 14,000,000,000 marks to the German treasury.

### A Tour of the Manchu-Soviet Border: Dispatch from a Member of the Manchu-Soviet Border Garrison Unit – A Record of Participating in the First Kwantung Army Reporting Exercise

Manchukuo, as the guardian of Japan's northern flank and a supplier of food, light metals, and iron ore, is cooperating with Japan to complete the great undertaking of war. On January 16th, three hundred members of the reporting team gathered at the Kwantung Army Headquarters in Xinjing. From that day forward, they began a life of motorcades, with all aspects of their daily routines and movements based on military standards. After five days of preparatory education, they departed on the 21st for the Manchu-Soviet border, visiting the foremost surveillance posts of the local units guarding the border to concretely inspect their living conditions. The reporter, as the leader of the sixth team, visited various units on the front lines of the Heihe Province border area and learned about the reality of the defense there. This occurred during the coldest period of the continuous blockade, and looking out at the rivers and mountains covered in ice and snow, an infinite sense of emotion welled up within me.

Lonely Border Landscape

In the night of northern Manchuria, the moon shines brightly, illuminating the earth. Soldiers on patrol, their boots crunching on the snow, emit a soft metallic sound. Standing on the northern bank of the 〇〇 River, covered in snow, and gazing towards the opposite bank, the city across the river lies silent in the bright moonlight. The extreme cold, tens of degrees below zero, freezes everything into an icy stillness. To the downstream left bank, there is the light of a flashing electric lamp, suggesting that someone lives there. The eternally flowing Heilong River is a river that embodies the history of the long struggle between the Slavic and East Asian peoples over 2,300 years. What is now seen is merely a stretch of greyish-white ice and snow, silently flowing after freezing, which is the long border, eight hundred meters wide and winding like a ribbon. On this border line, there is no barbed wire, but not even an ant could pass.

The sunset in Manchuria is as blood-red as the morning sun. On the roofs and glass windows of the various red, white, and blue buildings in the city across the river, sunlight glimmers. From the tall chimneys, wisps of white smoke curl in the cold wind. On the avenue along the riverbank, and in the gaps of the birch forest, it seems that vehicles and horses are passing by. Apart from the three patrolling soldiers who stomp around on the ice, there is no sign of other people.

Three Invisible Enemies

Each unit treats the reporting team members with the utmost courtesy. One unit prepared a feast of meat and wine, using their limited sugar to make steamed buns, eagerly awaiting our arrival. They got up at 4:00 AM to prepare the meal, because each reporting team member is backed by the people of their hometown, and you can sense the flavor of home on them. The lives of the soldiers in remote borderlands, enduring such extreme cold in desolate villages, can be seen here in a glimpse. The soldiers defending the northern frontier must struggle against three invisible enemies: the frigid climate, local diseases, and the constant need to maintain vigilance even without war, that is, the mental struggle of their duties. The soldiers of the local army completely overcome these enemies. They do not consider the severe cold to be anything special; even forty degrees below zero is considered normal. This is due to (1) the completeness of their cold-weather gear, (2) the training and thorough preparation for frostbite prevention, and (3) habituation to the climate. Although the first year is difficult, after two or three years, the extremely cold climate becomes commonplace, and frostbite is not even noticed, but cases of frostbite are extremely rare. The early trees are completely frozen, and exhaled breath turns into white smoke. Frost flowers grow on the edges of the cold-weather hats, and the wind-blown snowflakes feel like cuts on the face. Under such extremely cold conditions, without an unimaginable mental strength and training, ordinary people would be unable to endure it. The forging of being able to treat the extreme cold as if it were normal can be imagined.

Although there is no war, the need to maintain vigilance on the front lines causes tremendous fatigue on both the mind and body. Therefore, the commanders of each unit pay close attention to mental training and physical exercise, not allowing a moment of relaxation. Every morning and after dinner, they conduct calisthenics while also teaching the art of the sword, and hold various sports competitions to shift interests and exercise the body. In other aspects, they also prepare various entertainment facilities, adapting to the different seasons of spring, summer, autumn, and winter, and spend time in the wilderness with nature, pouring out continuous efforts.

Cultivating the Fields for Self-Sufficiency

Soldiers, non-commissioned officers, officers, and company commanders often hold forums to report on the actual conditions of army life in the area. In any situation, first, they train themselves not to shrink from hard work due to the cold. You will not hear anyone complaining about any inconvenience or deficiency in their personal lives. Personal matters are dismissed with a laugh and not mentioned again. Is this not the true life of selfless dedication to public service? In view of the domestic situation, the unit commanders told the local army to implement a policy of self-sufficiency. In addition to relentless and rigorous training, they also engage in farming, animal husbandry, and making tofu and horse fodder, putting in tremendous effort, and gradually achieving success. The bread made by the 〇〇 Unit has a reputation as the best in the north and is the most treasured item for visitors. Each unit also plans to conserve resources, and to adjust the monotonous life in the army, they encourage effort and creative research, planning to improve life in poverty and promote the spirit of respecting resources.

The gate of one unit completely utilizes the elasticity of birch wood to create a simple automatic locking device. The 〇〇 Unit planted elegant birch trees in the four corners of the courtyard, creating a small and exquisite garden. The 〇〇 Unit makes straw sandals. The 〇〇 Unit held an exhibition of slogans for the anniversary of the Great War, with many excellent works. Exquisite furniture made of birch wood can be seen in every unit.

Respect for resources is followed by encouragement of savings. For example, one team from the 〇〇 Unit has already reached 25,000 yuan, and the highest individual amount is 350 yuan.

Harmonious Feelings Among Soldiers

Harmony among soldiers is the foundation of the Japanese army's strength. Especially in the northern Manchurian border area, geographically isolated from other places, the soldiers are very harmonious with each other, and especially with their superiors. Company commanders unanimously explain their loving position to the soldiers, sharing their joys and sorrows. The misfortune of one soldier is comforted by the entire company. Officers operate in the fields like soldiers and often hold picnics, trying to find happiness during the short spring and summer seasons of northern Manchuria. Company commanders often tell jokes so that the soldiers do not feel a sense of hierarchy. One unit said, "When we were trainees, we slept in the open fields. Now we have such magnificent barracks, complete facilities, and ample supplies. To complain about poverty would be too much."

One non-commissioned officer said, "No matter how cold it is, we have such complete cold-weather gear, and the food and drinks are abundant, so we should work harder so as not to let down those back home."

Looking out over thousands of miles, the ground is frozen solid. The soldiers endure constant training in this wilderness border, and the barracks, provisions, and entertainment are not sufficient, but they do not express dissatisfaction. This kind of humility, the difficult military life in the northern frontier, is completely different from the comfort of a warm and peaceful inland life. We, who visited the area, strongly felt the tension.

The Hundred Flowers of Spring in Northern Manchuria

The long winter has passed, and the spring of a hundred blooming flowers is about to descend on northern Manchuria.

Near the barracks, on the mountains, and by the roadside, it will become a field of flowers.

The officers in heavy fur coats and felt boots will see a frozen land, the stinging north wind and powdered snow, and the rustling sound of walking will all become associations in name only. The purple anemone, called the "welcoming spring flower," stretches out its pitiful branches on the ground in April, where the remaining snow is tightly packed. The flowers that bloom in the mainland from spring to mid-autumn all open their buds together. The flower garden of the Japanese Alps is now in front of the barracks here. The soldiers' whiskers, grown out due to the spring breeze (turning into icicles in winter), are growing. All the windows of the barracks are open, and the empty cans and beer bottles in each room are filled with unknown wildflowers. Spring has arrived!

The soldiers of the local units are calmly accumulating a force for certain victory. But the northern Manchurian border is connected to the distant southern battlefields. Morning and evening are facing each other, and the flowing Heilong River winds through a 1,300-mile-long transparent iron wall, struggling with nature and one's own spirit. This is a silent battlefield. (Sho Translated from the February 7th Tokyo Asahi Shimbun)

### Snow Falls in Several Locations in Tunisia; Two Axis Units Have Met: Concentrating Forces to Maintain Lines of Communication

German Headquarters, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – A German military dispatch today stated that there was only localized fighting in North Africa yesterday. German aircraft bombed the port of Benghazi and Libyan border troops.

Rome, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – The Italian military announced that Italian troops in Tunisia repelled two enemy attacks yesterday, destroying two enemy aircraft. Three Italian aircraft have not returned in the past four days.

Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from North Africa, the Finan Emme and Rommel armies of the Axis forces in Tunisia have now joined forces in the corridor area. According to reliable information, several groups of Axis forces are now in close communication and will completely thwart any attempts by the anti-Axis forces to counterattack. It appears that the northern region also has a large number of troops to guard against a fierce attack on the ports of Bizerte and Tunis by the British First Army. A group of forces is also stationed in the southwestern region of Tunisia, and a large number of mechanized units are stationed near Faid in the east to the eastern coast to ensure communication lines between northern and southern Tunisia. The Axis forces in southern Tunisia are also on high alert, and the offensive of the British Eighth Army and the anti-Axis forces in the southwest has no opportunity.

Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to news from North Africa, the situation in Tunisia remains unchanged. Due to the harsh climate, no large-scale battles have occurred in any area. Heavy snow fell suddenly in several locations in Tunisia on the 12th. According to Cairo, rain and snow mixed on the front lines, hindering the operations of the anti-Axis forces. However, according to another dispatch, reconnaissance battles have been quite active across the entire line in the past forty-eight hours. It is reported that Axis forces near Ousseltia in the central region have launched a fierce attack on the anti-Axis positions, but details are unknown. Although air force activity is limited, Axis air forces still sortie in adverse weather, prying into and bombing anti-Axis troop bases in the De Arada area, and bombing the ports of Puji and Bono. Two ships and port facilities were set on fire.

Bern, Switzerland, February 13th (Havas News Agency) – According to the Stefani News Agency in Rome, the Axis forces in Tunisia are currently holding their positions and firmly occupy the entire east coast, where the defenses are extremely strong. The terrain in Tunisia is easier to defend than in Libya, and the Axis forces have no major difficulties in obtaining supplies. Once the cold season passes, the frontline fighting will become more active.

### Comments from Various Countries After Roosevelt's Speech

(Germany) Berlin, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Berlin newspapers believe that President Roosevelt's recent speech aimed to reduce the opposition within the country. It has the same meaning as Churchill's speech in the House of Commons. Although the opinions of the leaders of the United Nations are extremely divided, they seem to agree on the plan to hand Europe over to the Bolsheviks. The Berlin Evening News commented that Roosevelt's statement that Germany's enemies intend to completely destroy the German nation and European culture is true. Stalin is also a shrewd man who will certainly cultivate his strength to eliminate the power of Britain and the United States.

Berlin has expressed its views on Roosevelt's extensive speech on the 12th, believing that Roosevelt's confidence that the anti-Axis forces will drive the Axis forces out of North Africa and launch an offensive on the European continent within the year, while admitting the strength of the Axis positions in Tunisia, is contradictory. It should be noted that the Axis forces do not care about the defeat of the troops at Dunkirk. As for those who dream of invading Europe, they are simply showing their ignorance. The coastal defenses of Europe today are very different from those in North Africa.

(Italy) Rome, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – There is little attention paid here to President Roosevelt's recent speech, merely stating that the Axis powers are completely calm in the face of the great war declared by Roosevelt. Romans consider Roosevelt's speech to be a "Hollywood-style" speech, so it is not important. The recent speech revealed some interesting facts: First, the American people do not yet understand the purpose of this war. Therefore, the various restrictions imposed by the American government have aroused popular resentment. Second, Roosevelt's speech confirmed the seriousness of the American economic situation. Social unrest, strikes, conflicts, and the crisis of communism are emerging one after another. Third, Roosevelt admitted that the United States has discovered defeatists, demoralized people, and social contradictions. We deeply believe in the victory Roosevelt mentioned. On the contrary, the American people are deeply worried about the crisis of the Bolshevik alliance. After the Bolsheviks achieve victory, the United States will lose all of its foreign trade, which alone is enough to make those who enthusiastically support Roosevelt lose their enthusiasm. In short, Roosevelt's speech not only clearly expressed the disappointment of the American people, but also proved Roosevelt's failure in war propaganda.

### Soviet General to the US

Lisbon, February 14th (Allied News Agency) – According to a report from Rio de Janeiro, a Soviet lieutenant general and a naval admiral passed through Natal and Brazil two days ago. According to yesterday's news, they are on their way to the United States.

Lisbon, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to a Reuters dispatch from South America, a Soviet military delegation arrived in Natal, Brazil, by plane on the 13th and is said to be traveling to another location. The delegation is composed of four generals and one admiral from Marshal Timoshenko's command, but the mission and destination of the delegation are not clear.

### Uruguayan Parliament Regains Power

Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – According to news from Montevideo, the Uruguayan Parliament will regain power after the elections in December.

### All Argentine Cinemas to Close

Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 13th (Havas News Agency) – The Argentine film industry is in danger of shutting down due to the cessation of film supply. Before the war, most of the films screened in the country came from Germany, but later the country switched to purchasing films from the United States, but with little success. Therefore, cinemas across the country are likely to be forced to close. However, no fewer than 15,000 people depend on this for a living, and it is expected that their livelihoods will be difficult after the closure.

### Shortage of US Materials

Buenos Aires, Argentina, February 14th (Central News Agency) – According to the New York Times, the US Bureau of Mines recently announced a new invention of a mixed fuel of coal and petroleum as a substitute for industrial fuel oil. Boilers that have always used oil can use this new fuel without modification and can save 35% of oil consumption. However, the only problem is that turning the kerosene mixed with petroleum into powder requires a large number of coal crushers, so it is not suitable when the demand is urgent. According to a dispatch from Los Angeles, a countermeasure to remedy the shortage of tin has been invented, a container that does not use tin at all.

### Reported Martial Law Throughout Iraq, Frequent Riots in Damascus

### Former German Kaiser Wilhelm's Second Son Divorces His Wife

Berlin, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – News here yesterday that Prince Louis Ferdinand, the second son of former German Kaiser Wilhelm, has divorced his wife. Prince Louis Ferdinand is currently a captain in the German Air Force. His wife is a famous beauty in Berlin. When the two married a year ago, it caused a sensation in Berlin society.

### German-Romanian Industrial Conference

Budapest, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Key figures from the German and Romanian industrial sectors held a conference here from February 9th to 14th to discuss plans to increase Romanian industrial production.

### Turkey's Neutral Policy Unchanged: Extension for Ambassador to Soviet Union to Return to Post; Turkey and Romania Sign Commercial Treaty

Ankara, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Responsible officials here deny reports that Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hacıkalın, left for the Soviet Union the day before yesterday. They declare that Hacıkalın will extend his stay before returning to his post.

Ankara, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – For months, Britain and the United States have been spreading rumors about the signing of a Soviet-Turkish friendship treaty. When Turkish Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Hacıkalın, returns to his post at the beginning of this week, the rumors will resurface. Informed sources here believe that Soviet-Turkish relations have been clarified by the Ahlat Declaration and will not be changed by a new treaty. The Turkish government issued a declaration of neutrality when the German-Soviet war broke out. The Soviet government also issued a declaration on August 13, 1941, denying any intention of aggression or territorial claims against Turkey. The above declarations still have a decisive force on Soviet-Turkish relations. Turkish officials acknowledge that British and American diplomats in Ankara are making every effort to bring the Soviet Union and Turkey closer together. However, Turkey believes that approaching the Soviet Union violates the neutral policy stipulated in the Turkish declaration of neutrality of June 22, 1941. Britain and the United States are spreading rumors, trying to alienate German-Turkish relations. However, after the Soviet Union launched its winter offensive, the Turkish authorities and the public became increasingly aware of the threat of Bolshevism. Turkey does not want to take steps that weaken the European anti-communist front. According to the Turkish government party newspaper "Ulus," Churchill's declaration on the Adana Conference is consistent with the Turkish official statement. This meeting does not target any country. Churchill has once again elaborated on the usefulness of Turkish neutrality. Turkey believes that maintaining neutrality is beneficial to all countries involved, and Churchill shares this sentiment.

Istanbul, February 14th (Haitong News Agency) – Turkey and Romania signed a commercial treaty in Ankara on the 2nd of this month, stipulating that Romania will supply Turkey with 49,000 tons of kerosene, and Turkey will supply Romania with copper, wool textiles, and olive oil. Other trade must also be authorized by the responsible authorities of both countries.

Rally Declaration, Slogans, and Banners

(1) Declaration: The National Government declared war on England and America on January 9th. We feel infinite excitement and hope. History tells us that Anglo-American imperialism is our irreconcilable enemy. On December 8th of the year before last, our friendly neighbor Japan raised the righteous banner of liberating East Asia and fought desperately with Anglo-American imperialism in the Pacific with all of its national manpower and material resources. For more than a year, Japan has won victory after victory, and the aggressive forces of England and America in East Asia have been completely driven out. East Asia has restored its original appearance and has become East Asia for East Asians. We remember that when the Greater East Asia War broke out, our government declared that it would work with Japan in the spirit of sharing joys and sorrows to seek the complete liberation of East Asia. Now, although Anglo-American imperialism has become an arrow at the end of its flight and is about to collapse, the great war is not yet over, and our freedom cannot be guaranteed in the safest way. Since we are a member of East Asia, and this war is a matter of life and death for us, then we should naturally take out all of our strength and fight to the death with our friendly neighbor Japan against Anglo-American imperialism. Therefore, the government's declaration of war on England and America is entirely a decision based on the objective situation. From now on, we should fight with England and America with the determination to die together and completely eliminate all aggressive forces in East Asia. As long as Anglo-American imperialism does not completely collapse, our survival and independent freedom will not be guaranteed. We must fight England and America, we must fight England and America. Let us unite and support the National Government's official war against England and America. (2) Slogans: (1) Support joining the war; (2) Overthrow England and America; (3) China and Japan work together to complete the Greater East Asia War; (4) Revive China; (5) Defend East Asia; (6) Long live Chairman Wang; (7) Long live the Republic of China; (3) Banners: (1) Obey the leader, dedicate everything to the country; (2) China and Japan work together to complete the Greater East Asia War; (3) Support joining the war, complete the wartime system; (4) Expand the forces of peace, liberate the compatriots trampled under Jiang's Communist Party; (5) Overthrow England and America, defend East Asia; (6) Complete peace, realize peace; (7) Overthrow England and America; (8) Revive China.

### Municipal Propaganda Department Held a Symposium of Cultural Figures Yesterday; Mayor Chen and Minister Lin Personally Presided; Various Cultural Figures Enthusiastically Expressed Their Opinions

Mayor Chen Gongbo and Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng personally participated and presided over the meeting. Details of the situation are as follows:

List of Attendees

In addition to Mayor Chen Gongbo and Minister Lin Bosheng, Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Ming Gan, Director of the Jiangsu Propaganda Office, Secretary Ma Zongyao, Ling Dating of the Municipal Government, and the city's cultural figures Zhu Pu, Chen Binhe, Zhou Yueran, Huang Jingwan, Xu Liqiu, Yan Jiabao, Liang Shi, Wu Beizhi, Yang Huilang, Wang Ping, Pan Yuqie, Liu Yusheng, Liu Tong, Zhang Yian, Bao Tianxiao, Sun Choucheng, Zheng Yimei, Gu Fengcheng, Yang Guangzheng, Yang Zhihua, Ping Jinya, Chen Dieyi, Zheng Jie, Wu Chengzhi, Qiu Shimu, Chen Zhengfan, Wu Yisheng, Tao Qin, Ma Mingfeng, Lei Dun, Zhu Musong, Nai Liang, Hu Sian, Cheng Yiping, Gao Yin, Shen Diewei, Du Liang, Feng Heyi, Qian Gongxia, Gu Lengguan, Lv Baihua, Chen Binghong, Qin Shouou, Sui Sheng, Jiang Kehou, Yang Li, Zuo Junsheng, Tao Diya, He, Xue Xiaoyun, Wen Zaidao, etc., and female writer Guan Lu and others, no less than 70 people.

Chairman's Report

A tea party was held at 10:00 a.m., and Mayor Chen, as chairman, reported the significance of convening a symposium of cultural figures, saying that it was rare to be able to chat with everyone today. Minister Lin and I have long wanted to talk with you, and it has only been realized today. This conversation is not about formal expression, but about understanding the true opinions of everyone, and soliciting everyone's expressions on the national cultural factory knot. I hope that everyone will provide full opinions. I once met with everyone two or three months ago, but it was not such a grand gathering. It was even more difficult to meet before. However, in the cultural journals and newspapers, I have read your masterpieces. Today, Minister Lin and I, in the dual capacity of hosts, meet with you to hear your valuable opinions and seek the reconstruction of today's culture. I hope everyone will speak frankly and give full play to their ideas. It was decided that Minister Lin would give a speech.

The main points of Lin's speech are as follows: (1) Since the Incident, the cultural world has felt difficulties in its career and life. I am responsible for promoting culture, but I have not been able to relieve your pain, which is regrettable. (2) Chinese culture was already lagging behind before the Incident, and it has become more chaotic after the Incident. (3) How to rebuild the foundation of Chinese culture, and how to establish a position for us to stand in relation to East Asia and the world, are all issues that we should review. (4) He pointed out the fallacy of the past Chinese cultural world in the ideological struggle between the old and new factions. (5) It is necessary to establish that the greatest goal of Chinese culture should be the nation and the ethnic group. Since China has suffered from the aggression of British and American culture for the past 100 years, and has also been poisoned by Communist ideology for the past 20 years, it has been the greatest blow to Chinese culture. We should clean it up from the standpoint of the nation and the ethnic group, promote Chinese culture, and eradicate the poisonous effects of British and American aggressive ideology and Communist ideology. (6) To promote cultural undertakings during the war, such as the difficulty of paper and the difficulty of publishing the works of cultural figures, the Propaganda Department should make an overall plan to solve the problem. (7) The organization of the Cultural Association should be accelerated, unite sincerely, jointly promote the development of cultural professions, and jointly seek the improvement of life. (8) I hope that all cultural figures will stand on the position of the nation and the ethnic group and do their best. I will work with you to move forward.

Details of the Discussion

(A) Chen Binhe raised the serious nature of the current cultural publishing industry: (1) He requested that the government collect paper and implement a unified system of control and distribution to the cultural publishing industry to prevent hoarding and monopoly; (2) He advocated the use of local paper to make up for the shortage and consumption of newspaper paper; (3) He improved the living conditions of cultural figures, and asked the authorities to plan a cooperative to distribute daily necessities so that cultural figures can obtain life guarantees under the guidance of the Propaganda Department and do their best for wartime culture. (B) Yang Guangzheng proposed: (1) The mistake of Chinese cultural figures in the past was the lack of a mainstream of thought and the division of factions; (2) Seeking the coordination of culture and politics; (3) With the assistance of the authorities, seeking the realization of unity and organization of cultural figures, guaranteeing their lives, and rewarding their writings. (C) Zheng Han proposed that in order to realize the goal of struggling for culture, he hoped that the authorities would expand large-scale bookstores or add official and civilian-run large bookstores to develop the production of writing. (D) Pan Yuqie proposed: (1) Writers, editors and publishers should be integrated, because articles and people cannot be separated; (2) Break the life of cultural workers as beasts of burden, hoping that the authorities will subsidize writers when they have difficulties and illnesses; (3) Break the concept of writers as laborers and stipulate the lowest royalty for writers' works; (4) Hope that the authorities will reward writers and encourage them to create writings. (E) Liu Yusheng's program, (F) Wen Zaidao's opinions. Implement measures to eliminate pornography to avoid wasting paper and harming young people's thoughts. Yu Zhou Yueran, Gu Zhijian and others also made suggestions.

Final Conclusion

At the end, Mayor Chen made a conclusion, roughly saying, "The high theories raised by everyone present today can be divided into three points in summary: (1) The lack of printing materials in the cultural world has been explained in detail by Minister Lin, who is planning an overall solution, which will be implemented by the Propaganda Department; (2) The living problem of cultural figures is very important. This kind of difficulty is not only seen in today's situation, but also has always existed in the past. In order to solve the difficulties of cultural figures, I hope that cultural institutions can be quickly established in the future, and the government or organizations will strive to solve the lives of cultural figures so that everyone can create the most valuable works under the conditions of a stable life and establish the foundation of their life's profession; (3) How can the writing of cultural figures achieve the highest goal of the nation and the ethnic group? Looking back over the past ten years, the writing in the country has shown progress in terms of technology, but the content of the works is mostly (1) taking things related to the author's individual as the subject matter; (2) exposing the dark side of society. We have not seen anything that can truly represent the nation and the ethnic group. The official department is also drafting a wartime cultural program, and I hope everyone will contribute as much as possible to meet the needs of the present and the future, and take on the responsibility of completing works that can truly represent the nation and the ethnic group." Finally, tea and snacks were served, and the meeting ended happily at 12:00 noon.

### At the Speech Meeting of Government and Civilian Cadres, Minister Lin Promoted National Policy; More Than 500 Government and Civilian Cadres Attended

The Central Government specially dispatched Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng, accompanied by Director Zhong Renlai, etc., to Shanghai in order to promote the significance of the National Government's participation in the war. The "Support Joining the War, Overthrow England and America Shanghai Special Municipality Government and Civilian Cadres Speech Meeting" was jointly hosted by the Municipal Government, the Social Movement Committee, and the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office at the Municipal Chamber of Commerce at 3:00 p.m. yesterday. Those present included government officials Propaganda Minister Lin Bosheng, Feng Jie, Director of the Propaganda Department's Shanghai Office, Ling Dating, Section Chief of the Municipal Government, Chen Dongbai of the Shanghai Office of the Social Movement Committee, Sun Wuqi, Director of the Municipal Social Movement Committee, Hu Shouqi, Deputy Director, Lin Jiongan, Director of the Municipal Education Bureau, Ye Xuesong, Director of the Public Utilities Bureau, Ling Xianwen, Director of the Social Affairs Bureau, Zhang Enlin, Director of the Public Works Bureau, etc., and the directors of the Central Government's offices in Shanghai, the directors of various bureaus in Shanghai, various industry associations, vocational associations, principals of large and small schools, and more than 500 representatives from various social groups and newspaper reporters. Director Sun Wuqi first gave a welcome speech, followed by Minister Lin Bosheng's speech on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war, expressing a grand theory.

Minister Lin's Speech

Minister Lin gave a two-hour speech on the significance of the National Government's participation in the war at the Support Joining the War Rally, entitled "The Significance of Our Country's Participation in the War." He thoroughly explained why China should participate in the war, why the Greater East Asia War occurred, the future of China and East Asia, the changes in the international situation in recent years, and the strength of China's participation in the war. The whole audience listened attentively and was deeply moved. In the tense and solemn atmosphere, applause was incessant. The main points of the speech are as follows: First, it is stated that China's participation in the war and the occurrence of the Greater East Asia War are based on historical destiny. For a hundred years, China has encountered crises under the oppression of Anglo-American imperialism, and all Asian nations have also suffered from the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism. From the observation of world history and geography for the past two or three hundred years, the result of the aggression of Anglo-American imperialism has been the change of colors on the map, and the weaker nations have been forced into slavery. The crisis in Asia, China and Japan are tied to a common destiny. The enlightened Japan, after the success of the Meiji Restoration, began to lift the shackles of unequal treaties, while China has procrastinated until now, which shows that the security of China and Japan is shared, without Japan there is no China, and without China there is no Japan." The Founding Father's teaching once pointed out the truth.

Revive China, Liberate East Asia

Secondly, it is stated that at the beginning of the National Revolution, the fundamental policy was determined to seek the revival of China and the liberation of East Asia. In accordance with the Founding Father's teaching, China and Japan should cooperate sincerely. Since the Kuomintang unified the country, the revolutionary line should follow the road of East Asian liberation, and unite the nations of East Asia to settle accounts with the Anglo-American imperialists. Therefore, the Chinese National Revolution and the Japanese Restoration were historically to settle accounts with England and America, and the Greater East Asia War was a total settlement of the East Asian nations with England and America. Originally, to settle accounts with England and America, we should only seek the mutual unity of China and Japan. However, looking back, not only did we fail to liberate the East Asian nations, but we were instead provoked and alienated by the Anglo-American imperialists, resulting in the Sino-Japanese Incident. The situation between China and Japan failed to ease in time, resulting in fraternal strife. However, we firmly believe that the truth of the East Asian nations uniting to settle accounts with England and America will surely be realized one day. Until Chairman Wang left Chongqing and issued a telegram, initiating the peace movement, China and Japan should only be friends, not enemies. The survival of China and the security of Japan are tied to a common destiny. Therefore, the revolution in China must have a peace movement.

Total Participation in the War, Settling Blood Debts

The practice of peace movement leads to participation in the war, taking on the responsibility of defending East Asia, and working with our friendly neighbor Japan in the Greater East Asia War to settle historical blood debts. After three years of hard work in the peace movement, under the national policy of peace, anti-communism, and national construction, we removed the yellow cloth sign and saw the blue sky, white sun, and crimson earth flag again. Finally, with regard to the significance of the total war, we explained the strength of our country's participation in the war after the National Government announced its participation in the war. In the end, it was said that this war is a war for the survival of China, Japan, and all East Asian nations. We can only win and not lose. In the event of failure, China will be reduced to the second India. Whether or not there is certainty in this war depends on the military situation and political strength. In terms of military affairs, our friendly neighbor Japan has adopted a strategy of turning from offense to defense, laying the foundation for victory, and has obtained an absolute advantage, which is beyond doubt. Therefore, political strength only seeks the close unity of the East Asian nations, which should be no problem. We should participate in the war with all our strength, and the loyal and brave warriors in the rear should work hard and sweat, and the brave and self-sacrificing soldiers in the front should complement each other. We should use all our material resources, manpower, and spiritual strength to maintain a long-term war until the final victory. We should unite the conscience of our 450 million compatriots and the heart to revive China and defend East Asia into one heart, and achieve the goal of reviving China and defending East Asia.

I hope that everyone will be responsible for reporting and cooperate to complete the Greater East Asia War and achieve final victory." Finally, Minister Lin replied on behalf of everyone, roughly saying, "Since China's participation in the war, the responsibilities of our reporters have become even greater. We should do our duty of propaganda, and like the frontline soldiers, be able to live and die with your country to complete the final victory of the Greater East Asia War. We firmly believe that cooperation between China and Japan will become more tight and consolidated in the future." During the meeting, there were mutual blessings and toasts, and the meeting ended happily at 9:30 p.m.

### Free Bicycle Owners in Both Concessions to Renew Licenses Starting Today; Strict Enforcement of Licensing Procedures to Prevent Bicycle Theft

In view of the increase in bicycle theft cases last year, the police of both concessions have recently jointly established new procedures and revised the system for issuing bicycle licenses. Details are as follows:

Police Directly Handle Licensing

According to our reporter, the Public Concession has transferred the issuance of bicycle licenses from the Donations Office to the Traffic and Air Defense Section of the Police Department starting today.

As for bicycles owned by commercial firms and factories, they must present the Citizen's ID of the representative of the firm or factory when submitting the vehicle for inspection. Furthermore, to facilitate identification, all rental bicycles will be painted with a specific color scheme: red in the front and black in the back, to help the police crack bicycle theft cases.

### Oil Rationing System by Headcount Not Yet Implemented

Retail edible oil stores in both concessions have ceased selling oil for more than half a month. Residents are worried about the lack of oil for cooking. According to our reporter's inquiry with the oil authorities, although wholesale distributors have drafted a plan for rationing oil by headcount, it will not be implemented in the near future. Previous reports stating that it would be implemented within this week are inaccurate.

### Buddhist Weekly Lecture Continued Yesterday

The Jing'an Temple Buddhist Academic Weekly Lecture, which was suspended last week due to the Lunar New Year, continued yesterday. Dharma Master Dengxia lectured on "Methods of Studying Buddhism in Lay Life," emphasizing that study should begin with cultivating blessings, wisdom, and taking refuge in the Three Jewels and observing the Five Precepts to benefit from Buddhist practice. Prominent figures will continue to lecture in future sessions.

### Ration Rice for the 26th Period: Only Three Days Remaining for Distribution; 27th Period Ration Distribution to Begin on the 19th

The distribution of the 26th period ration rice, managed by authorities in both concessions, which began on the 9th of this month, is now in its seventh day. It is reported that the distribution at rice shops has been smooth in recent days. Taxpaying Chinese residents are using their 26th period rice purchase coupons to collect rice at designated rice shops. Residents should note that only three days remain for this period's distribution. Those with coupons must purchase their rice within these three days, or they will be deemed to have forfeited their ration. As for the 27th period ration rice, rice shops have been receiving goods from designated warehouses since yesterday, based on the orders. Distribution will begin on the 19th of this month at the retail counters of the rice shops. Residents will be supplied upon presentation of the 27th period rice purchase coupons with (1) 1.5 Sheng of white rice, (2) 0.5 Sheng of broken rice, and (3) 1.12 Jin of flour, all sold together for 8.85 yuan in new legal tender. The authorities are scheduled to formally announce this tomorrow to inform the public.

### Encouragement to Students Receiving Scholarships

— Huang Jingwan

In this era of turmoil and economic hardship, families who were once self-sufficient are now displaced and struggling due to the war. The rising cost of living makes it difficult even to make ends meet, let alone provide for their children's education. Many young people of school age are unable to pursue their education due to limited resources, and their potential is buried as a result. Today's youth are the backbone of the future society, and their contributions to society depend on the education they receive. The neglect of youth is a small matter, but the loss to society is a great one. As servants of society, we cannot stand idly by and allow young people to waste their time without providing them with opportunities for advancement, causing immense loss to society.

Readers of this newspaper, aware of this situation, launched a scholarship program in the autumn of the 30th year of the Republic of China (1941), awarding scholarships to outstanding students from poor families with good character, based on examinations or assessments. These scholarships are funded by voluntary donations from numerous readers, some of whom donate anonymously in large sums, while others economize on food and clothing or laborers saving from their hard-earned wages, or children saving their New Year's money or candy expenses. These small contributions are pooled together to make this possible. The source is hard-won and represents the goodwill of many people, meeting the expectations of many. It is more significant than other individual or group student loans or scholarships, and those who receive it are more honored. Since its implementation, recipient students have understood the purpose of the program and worked hard, creating a group of students and industrial and commercial workers, numbering over 5,000. These students, originally from poor backgrounds, have become even more diligent, developing a village of moral and academic excellence, ready to serve the country. The method is good, and the intention is admirable. It is very suitable and meets the actual needs of this difficult time.

However, the recipient students should thoroughly reflect on how to work hard to live up to people's expectations and not waste their own futures. They should believe in themselves and always be proud of receiving assistance, knowing that it is not easy to obtain. They should be more vigilant and pay attention to their academics, character, willpower, and mental strength, moving towards a brighter future, opening up their paths through hardship, and seeking progress through struggle. In ancient times, people stole light from the wall and read by the glow of fireflies, eventually becoming great sages. All of this came from hardship and self-reliance. Today's students receive external assistance and are more fortunate than those of ancient times. Moreover, they have the earnest expectations and sincere support of many people, which is incomparable to the self-motivation of the ancients. The students should ask themselves how grateful and motivated they should be to live up to the expectations of themselves and others. Students in school should recognize that their study of applied social sciences and natural sciences is still mostly theoretical. Industrial and commercial workers, due to their work, have somewhat approached reality, but they should all broaden their horizons, take society as their current government, and nature as their research object. The ancients said that everything from carriages to horses and even the soles of one's feet is knowledge, and even those who sell soup or slaughter dogs can be heroes. I hope the students will truly understand this, seek fundamental knowledge with a deep vision, and cultivate their working skills with a reasonable life. They should strive to enrich their lives in every way, without relying on others, without borrowing, without being arrogant, and without being lazy, always applying what they have learned and integrating their lives with the times, making further progress. Make further recognition, further practice, constantly doubting, constantly reforming, constantly applying, constantly seeking to know the reason for it, follow the path of natural development, and strive to move forward, thereby approaching things, approaching the world, paying equal attention to hands and brains, and uniting knowledge and action, invigorating the common spirit, and enriching their ambition. By grasping reality and creating the future in this way, we will see that in the future society, scholars will not necessarily come from universities, and entrepreneurs may be more numerous than today. The contribution of scholarships will be even more immeasurable.

After the students complete their studies, they should remember the source of their success. They should seek welfare for society, and often return a hundred or a thousand times what they received today, returning to the source, not falling into emptiness. Although they do not repay individuals with a spring, they will realize the great use of gong in society, which I think is also what the helping gentlemen want to hear.

Since the announcement of the approved quota by this newspaper, there have been several instances each day of people standing and crying in front of the hall, sending letters to directly state their predicament, and requesting re-examinations. In the end, there was not enough to go around, and we were powerless to help. At this time, while the recipient students are gleefully receiving and paying their fees, I sincerely hope that the students, in their satisfaction, will reflect on themselves, not be proud or complacent, and not let down the good intentions of the scholarship. Time flies, and time passes like water. I hope the students will work hard in time.

### Meat Industry Association Petitions for Improvement in Distribution System; Meat Prices Again Exceed Price Limits Recently; Authorities Promise to Actively Consider

Recently, fresh meat prices in the city have again exceeded the price limits, causing hardship for citizens. Our reporter made a special visit to the Shanghai Fresh Meat Industry Association to inquire about the black market prices. The person in charge of the association revealed:

Caused by Black Market Manipulation

Since its reorganization in November of last year, the association has been determined to improve its work, and progress has been made. As for the creation of the fresh meat black market, it is actually due to the manipulation and unfair distribution by brokers. Since its reorganization, the association has made eliminating the black market its sole task and has repeatedly submitted opinions to the Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Livestock Market, seeking ways to improve the situation. After multiple consultations, opinions are gradually converging, recognizing that the fundamental solution to eliminating the black market is to transfer the distribution rights to the Industry Bureau, the Shanghai Livestock Market, and the association. One aspect is to dredge sources. The following is an excerpt of the key points regarding distribution that the association submitted to the Industry Bureau's association section on the 30th of last month:

Improve Distribution Methods

(1) Pigs must be distributed fairly and not manipulated by brokers. The Industry Bureau, the Shanghai Livestock Market, and the association will be jointly responsible. Members of the association will be divided into seven districts, and the distribution ratio will be determined by the size of the district. Within each district, members will be divided into four categories: A, B, C, and D, based on their usual business conditions. The Industry Bureau will review and issue distribution certificates for categories A, B, C, and D, allowing them to obtain the appropriate number of pigs from their respective districts. (2) Strictly implement the new distribution system and stipulate that members' profits should not exceed 20% of the Shanghai Livestock Market price. If the number of pigs on the market is small, the opening of sales should be suspended and postponed to the next day or several days later to prevent brokers and members from creating a black market under various pretexts. To strengthen its organization, the association will establish district chiefs in each district and form small groups of 20 members with a group leader. It will also organize an investigation team to investigate members' black market prices and illegal activities at any time. If any of the above situations are found, their distribution rights will be suspended. In serious cases, the distribution rights of a group or even a district will be suspended. The authorities have promised to actively consider the above measures.

Authorities Prepare Investigation Tables

The Industry Bureau and the Shanghai Livestock Market, in order to thoroughly understand the situation of the fresh meat industry in the city, recently issued an investigation form, handing it over to the association for investigation, and set a deadline for completion on the 18th of this month, in preparation for implementing the new distribution system. The person in charge of the fresh meat industry is also scheduled to visit Sheng Yudu, co-manager of the Industry Bureau, tomorrow to request instructions on the implementation of the new distribution methods.

### Greater East Asia Cartoon Exhibition Extended for One Day

The Greater East Asia Cartoon Exhibition on the fourth floor of the Great New World Department Store has been drawing exceptionally large crowds due to its exquisite layout, rich content, and free admission. It was originally scheduled to close yesterday afternoon. However, due to repeated requests from various sectors for an extension of the exhibition date, the China Cartoon Association, the organizer of the exhibition, has decided to extend the exhibition for one day today to meet the needs of the audience and to show support for today's mass demonstration in support of the war effort.

### After the End of the Anti-Spitting Campaign, Expand the Scope of Sanitation Work; Health Department Decides to Improve Public Health Facilities

The Public Concession in this port has officially begun the second Anti-Spitting Campaign starting yesterday. However, due to rain, various official publicity efforts could not be carried out smoothly. However, according to inquiries, the inspectors dispatched by the Health Department yesterday still carried out investigations in various public places despite the rain. Once detected, they will cooperate with the police to detain the offender to the police station and fine them five yuan.

At the same time, after the successful conclusion of the Anti-Spitting Campaign, the Health Department will formulate measures to expand public health publicity work. Improvements will be made to public restrooms and garbage bins in alleyways. Public places will be required to open more windows and clean them regularly. The Health Department will also utilize the baojia system (neighborhood self-governance system) to implement mutual supervision methods to promote the efficiency of public health implementation.

### Japanese Embassy Plans to Eliminate "Hostile" Music

The Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, in order to take consistent action with Japan, will soon announce specific measures to eliminate "hostile" music on the Chinese mainland. In addition, according to Mr. Tao Yi, the Japanese manager of the Victor Record Company's Xujiahui factory, after the army took over and handed over to its management, all anti-Japanese records were destroyed. The factory is now producing suitable records. Since November of last year, an average of 20,000 records have been shipped south each month, and even the needs of Japan are being met, because record factories in Japan have been converted into other more important factories.

### Fuxing Bank Continues to Offer Small Loans to Industry and Commerce

The Shanghai Special Municipal Fuxing Bank, previously in view of the large amount of floating capital in the city, believing that if it is not properly channeled into productive enterprises, speculative undertows will eventually be difficult to completely contain. Moreover, the city's credit is tight, and legitimate capital needs of industry and commerce are difficult to raise. Therefore, the bank, based on the policy of supporting industry and commerce and developing production, carefully formulated a plan and gradually implemented it. Among them, small industrial and commercial loans were first tested in August of last year. All industrial and commercial businesses in the port with a capital of more than 5,000 yuan, operating for more than one year, and with good credit can apply for a loan from the bank. All procedures are handled by the Savings and Credit Department. Zhang Yanjun, the manager of the Savings and Credit Department, is responsible for reviewing the use of funds and approving the loan amount. Last year, a very large amount of funds was loaned out, and all loans were repaid on time at the end of the year, with excellent results. This shows that China's credit business needs to be expanded urgently. Now that the Spring Festival is over and lending has begun, in addition to continuing to handle small loans, the bank is also adding small secured loans to industry and commerce. Factories and firms in need of funds can apply for secured loans using valuable movable and immovable property, with terms ranging from three to six months. Interest rates are low and procedures are simple. It will begin handling loans in the middle of this month. Applicants who wish to read the articles of association often negotiate in person at the bank to be cautious.

### Banks and Money Shops Offer Industrial Loans to Support Production and Trade Development

In order to support production and develop trade, the banks and money shops will provide as much lending as possible to various industries that legitimately need to finance their operations, in order to increase production and supply the market. According to inquiries with the banking industry yesterday, the lending to various industries by banks and money shops is divided into (1) loans secured by movable and immovable property for industrial use, (2) loans secured by goods in the respective industry, (3) loans for commercial and industrial firms, agricultural loans, (4) underwriting of goods under export, (5) discounting or accepting commercial bills, and (6) investment in the development of industrial and commercial industries. However, the review aspect is extremely cautious. For example, for mortgage loans, it must be proved that the owner's purpose is not to hoard goods for profit, so as not to help speculation.

### Local Post Office Plans to Resume Remittances to Eastern Zhejiang

The Shanghai Postal Administration, in order to facilitate public remittances, plans to resume remittances to the commercially prosperous areas of eastern Zhejiang. A total of 18 locations are under consideration and are expected to be decided within a few days so that the local branches of the bureau can start remitting. The locations under consideration are as follows: Shaoxing, Zhenhai, Chaqiao, Yuyao, Xiaoshan, Wufu, Sunduan, Shixi, Zhouxiang, Hushan, Cixi, Baiguan, Keqiao, Zhuangqiao, Andong City, Camel Bridge, Xiaqiao Bridge, Huizheng Bridge.

### Northwest Historical Geography Exploration

— Xie Pengcheng

Records from the "Northwest History and Geography Exploration Geography Group"

Qaka Basin

This area is bordered by the Zahas Mountains to the east, the Dulan mounds to the west, Wuqianshan to the south, and Wanyantongbu to the north, forming a narrow and long basin trending northeast to southwest. The Zahas Mountains are entirely composed of Jurassic strata, which are in fault contact with Paleozoic strata to the north. Towards the Qaka Basin, it gradually descends, likely a geosynclinal structure. The surrounding mountains of the basin are mostly composed of red granite, intruding into older rock layers. However, in the Zahas West Gully, it is seen intruding into Jurassic strata, indicating that its intrusion period could not be earlier than the Jurassic period, and may even be a product of the Tertiary period.

Alluvial fans at the foot of the mountains are the most important component, with fine sand and kaolin being particularly abundant. The central part of the basin is the famous Qinghai salt lake, about forty kilometers long from east to west and ten kilometers wide from north to south. The salt is completely crystalline and appears silvery from a distance, like ice and snow. The salt layer can be divided into four layers from top to bottom: First, the salt cap, consisting of white alkaline salt crystals, about eight or nine centimeters thick; second, crushed salt, white in color, with small, pure salt cubic crystals, about sixty to eighty centimeters to two meters thick; third, large salt or blue salt, with larger crystals, containing black mud and a slightly blue color, about one meter to several meters thick, which is the main salt layer currently extracted; fourth, black mud, with an odor, currently covering an area of approximately four hundred square kilometers. Even if only one meter thick, its reserves are astonishingly rich, making it a major mineral deposit in the Northwest. Since the salt lake has been directly managed by the "Ministry of Finance," it is stipulated that 400,000 dan be transported out annually. However, due to transportation difficulties, only horse-drawn carts, cattle, and camels are used as transportation tools, and even with full effort, only 70,000 to 80,000 dan can be transported out annually to supply the food needs of Qinghai, Gansu, and Shaanxi provinces. The formation of the salt is due to the surrounding mountains being mostly granite, which undergoes chemical reactions after weathering and decomposition. Furthermore, due to the dry climate and strong evaporation, this massive amount of salt has accumulated. According to local residents, salt caverns that have been mined are soon filled again, indicating the high concentration of salt in the water. If the source of the salt is from the weathering and decomposition of the surrounding mountain rocks, it is truly an inexhaustible mineral resource. There is now a highway from Lanzhou to Qaka, and the terrain is flat, making the construction of a light railway easy.

The topography of this basin is roughly the same as the Qinghai Basin. However, in the eastern part of the basin, the hills, about one hundred and fifty meters high, between the Zahas West Gully and Nadang Valley mouths, are purely composed of large and small gravel, which are terminal moraines from the Quaternary glaciation. The U-shaped valleys and cirques in the Zahas West Gully are particularly well-preserved. The alluvial terraces at the foot of the Wanyantongbu Mountains can be divided into about four layers, with the higher ones being about one hundred and twenty to thirty meters high and the lower ones being several to ten meters high. The stream valleys are constantly cutting down, creating an imbalance between the riverbed and the basin level. This can also explain why the basin is still continuing to subside. Furthermore, the dry climate of this basin also affects the plant communities. To the west of the Zahas Mountains, although there is a vast and boundless hygrophytic grassland, the degree of dryness gradually increases further west, with *Reaumuria*, *Achnatherum splendens*, *Nitraria tangutorum*, and *Ephedra* being commonly seen. The climate changes are even more pronounced near Qaka, with many succulent Chenopodiaceae and several halophytic plants. Other famous medicinal plants of the Northwest, such as *Cistanche deserticola*, also grow here, rising about four or five inches from the ground, with purple-red club-shaped flowers when blooming. The salt lake is shallow and not like the vast Qinghai Lake, which can regulate the surrounding climate. The surrounding high mountains have more rainfall and are sometimes covered in white snow, resulting in abundant water and grass. Yurts and tents are mostly distributed in the deep mountains and remote valleys. The evaporation rate in the basin is significant, and rain and snow rarely reach the ground. Many of the cattle and sheep raised by the salt miners in Qaka die due to drought. Qaka is located to the north of the salt lake, with more than a dozen yurts nearby, all living by salt mining, with animal husbandry being only a sideline. About thirty li west of Qaka is a place called Mohu, with more than a dozen earthen houses and a row of cave dwellings, inhabited by both Han and Hui people, mostly migrated from Huangyuan, Xining, and Huzhu counties. Mountain springs emerge in the area, providing irrigation, so residents mostly grow highland barley, fruits, and oats. The soil is good, and with a little fertilizer, it becomes fertile land. However, the water volume is limited, and the increase in cultivated land area is not unlimited.

Dulan Basin

This basin is bordered by Rongrong Haorao (mountain name) and Xueli Daowa to the north, and Qianshanxiu to the south, all about six hundred meters higher than Dulan, forming a narrow and long basin trending northwest to southeast. To the east is Dulan Lake, and to the west is the Dulan Salt Lake. In terms of geological structure, Kehaorao and Xueli Daowa are composed of Paleozoic rock layers and Tertiary granite, the entire mass thrusting southwest, covering the Middle or Late Tertiary rock layers. The latter rock layers are regularly positioned, lying prone downwards, forming hills at the foot of the mountains. The fault lines are significantly more prominent than those in the Qinghai and Qaka basins. Rigangdawa on the south bank of the basin is a composite of Paleozoic metamorphic rocks and Tertiary granite. The entire mass thrusts southwest, covering the northern edge of the Dalüdügan Basin (detailed later) from the Upper Cretaceous and Late Tertiary strata. Therefore, the southwestern edge of this basin is a normal fault. Based on this, the structure of this basin is also a geosyncline. Dulan County is located on the northern edge of this basin, with an altitude of about three thousand eight hundred meters. There are many sand dunes at the foot of the northeast mountains, so this basin has many southwest winds. This can also be used to prove it.

The alluvial deposits at the foot of Rongrong Haorao gently slope towards the basin, with rounded and elongated isolated masses scattered on them, about one hundred meters high, resembling remnants of alluvial layers. In fact, they are remnants of lateral moraines, terminal moraines, and medial moraines. The same topography exists in the Xueli Daowa Valley. The U-shaped valley from the Dulan Pass to Shangqianba is about twenty kilometers long, with cirques on both sides of the mountains. This proves that during the Quaternary period, glaciers flowed west from the Dulan Pass, converging with the ice flows from the Rongrong Haorao and Xueli Daowa mountains and flowing south into this basin. The extensive and thick alluvial deposits at the foot of Rongrong Haorao and other mountains could not have been caused by water flow but are accumulations after glacial melt. The salt quality of the Dulan Salt Lake is roughly the same as that of Qaka. No one has mined it yet. The area is quite large, and the reserves must be substantial. The source of the salt is also likely due to the weathering and decomposition of the surrounding granite. The nearby flora is also no different from Qaka.

The area near Dulan can be called a semi-agricultural region. In addition to planting Qingke, wheat, rapeseed, and vegetables in places where water can be diverted for irrigation, the rest has the characteristics of a dry grassland.

Between Dulan Temple and Dulan, there is a place called Chahan River, which is a scenic area near Dulan. The distribution of plants there can be representative of the high mountains within a hundred li around Dulan. On the mountains, at an altitude of four thousand meters, sparse cypress trees grow. The layer below it (below four thousand meters) is no different from the area near Dulan. The cypress forest extends from four thousand meters to four thousand two hundred meters. The sunny side is a cypress forest, while the shady side is a mixed forest of cypress and spruce, or a pure spruce forest. At four thousand one hundred meters, there are mountain willows growing under the forest. Above four thousand two hundred meters, forests disappear, and mountain willows still lie prostrate on the ground, emerging only after about ten meters. Further up to the mountaintop, there are still two or three hundred meters. Although there is no permanent snow in this zone, rainfall below four thousand two hundred meters turns to snow in this zone, resulting in few plants. The grass under the forest trees is roughly the same as in Zahas, but without *Thermopsis lanceolata*. However, *Rheum alexandrae*, broad-leaved mountain leeks, and purple fragrant *Lavandula angustifolia* are not found in Zahas. The geographical characteristics of the Dulan Basin are also similar to Qaka, but the aforementioned northeast mountains are high and steep, with abundant rain and snow. The water flows converge into the Dulan River, which flows into the basin, with a large volume of water, creating good agricultural land in Dulan, attracting Han Chinese farmers and Salar people to cultivate, residing in three villages to the north, east, and west, totaling more than one hundred and thirty households. Han Chinese are the majority, followed by Hui people. Dulan has a vast area and a sparse population, so agriculture is extensive, and crop rotation is adopted. The Hui and Han are skilled in farming, and the types of crops they plant are more diverse. Although affected by changes in the weather, they are not completely hopeless. The local farmers only grow highland barley, and their harvests are often uncertain. The total harvest from all the cultivated land near Dulan is about seven hundred dan annually, enough to supply local consumption. However, nomadic Mongolians often come to purchase Qingke, so the local food supply is sometimes scarce and must be supplemented by transportation from Huangyuan. Most of the land in the basin is saline-alkali soil, which is not conducive to crop production. Only in places with a large amount of freshwater flushing can cultivation be carried out. Agricultural areas in the dry grassland, such as Xiarhariha, Zhaha Wusu, and Zhazha Xiaoka, are all like this, so the development of cultivated land is greatly limited by the natural environment. Furthermore, agriculture in this area depends entirely on irrigation, and the water supplied by the rivers is not inexhaustible, so a large-scale migration of farmers is unlikely. Dry basins are mostly suitable for animal husbandry. Yurts are commonly seen scattered in the valleys with abundant water and grass, and nomadic tribes are distributed in the north and south of the Dulan Basin. Today, the power of the Mongolians is declining, grazing land is shrinking, and the vast Qaidam region in the west is being ravaged and occupied by the Kazakhs, forcing them to migrate eastward, further narrowing their living space.

Dalüdügan Basin

This basin is located south of the Dulan Basin, separated by the Rigangdawa Mountains. Arveyran stands to the south, with the former thrusting south and the latter covering northward. The Late Tertiary strata lie prone beneath it. Therefore, the north and south of this basin are also bordered by faults. The prominence of the fault outcrop of Rigangdawa, composed of Paleozoic green schist and sandstone, can be seen in Dangjinggaier (gully name). About three kilometers east, green schist lies flat on the Late Tertiary strata, like an umbrella. The latter is composed of conglomerate, breccia, sandstone, loess, etc. The lithology is loose, seeming younger than the Red Rock Series in the Dulan Basin, and the composition is mainly rock debris from the surrounding mountains, such as green schist, granite, and Cretaceous gravelly sandstone. An unconformity lies on the Cretaceous strata, dipping south or southeast at about fifty to eighty degrees. In the central part of the basin, it decreases to about ten degrees. In the Fourth Basin, lateral moraines, medial moraines, and terminal moraines are particularly well-preserved. Judging from the current topography, during the Quaternary period, there were large glaciers in this area, which can be divided into two major flows: one flowing north from the eastern part of Arveyran, entering the Dulan Basin along the Guo (gully name), and the other flowing southwest from the western part of Arveyran, converging the snow and ice in the central and northern mountains and entering the Dalüdügan Basin. The medial moraine between the two major glaciers of the day is still standing tall south of Dangjinggaier. Dangjinggaier is a narrow canyon, with very thin alluvial deposits. Compared with Guo, it is a relatively newly cut river valley. As for the glacial melt deposits in this basin, the accumulation is extensive and cannot be compared with the aforementioned basins. At the northwest foot of Arveyran, the area of sand dune distribution is very large, resembling a desert region. Only a few types of plants grow there, such as *Reaumuria*, *Nitraria tangutorum*, *Lycium ruthenicum*, and *Achnatherum splendens*.

The results of the exploration from Lanzhou to Dulan can be summarized as follows: In terms of geology, strata from the Archean Nanshan System, Carboniferous-Permian, Triassic, and Cretaceous are distributed along the way, while Tertiary and Quaternary strata occupy a larger area. In terms of igneous rocks, granite is dominant, and most are products of the Tertiary period. The second is diabase and other intrusive rock veins, which intrude into older strata. As for the orogenic periods, in addition to the unconformable contacts between the Carboniferous-Permian and the Nanshan System, the Triassic and the Carboniferous-Permian, the Upper or Middle Tertiary and various older rock layers seen on the Gansu-Qinghai road, the unconformity between the Late Tertiary sediments (Riyue Mountain Series) and various older rock layers and Quaternary alluvial layers is particularly prominent and widespread. The recent and most important orogenic movement in Gansu and Qinghai was likely in the Late Tertiary or Early Quaternary. The main features of today's topography were formed by this movement. The trend of the basins and mountains is roughly northwest-southeast, and the boundary between the two is mostly the location of faults. The direction of movement is approximately from northeast to southwest, so the Qinghai Qaka, Dulan, and Dalüdügan basins are all in the form of geosynclines. This movement seems to be continuing, so the alluvial deposits at the foot of the mountains are increasing daily, and the stream valleys are cutting down more frequently. This may be a sign that the basins are still subsiding. As for the rich reserves of the Qaka and Dulan salt lakes, they are worth paying attention to. The granite of the surrounding mountains is the source of salt. The well-preserved glacial landforms of the Quaternary period, in addition to those seen in the Qinling Mountains, which are the same as in the Daba Mountains, and the U-shaped valleys, lateral moraines, main moraines, terminal moraines, and cirques seen from the southern shore of Qinghai Lake to near Dulan, are particularly well-preserved, which can prove that glaciers in the Quaternary period were distributed in the area of Gansu and Qinghai at an altitude of about four thousand meters. The extensive and thick accumulations formed after glacial melt are the characteristics of the Qaka, Dulan, and Dalüdügan basins. In terms of plants, most of the area from near Lanzhou to Dulan has the characteristics of a dry grassland, which is a continuation of the western Xinjiang and Mongolian regions. However, in places with abundant rainwater or groundwater, hygrophytic grasslands or tundra bogs are formed. The Hasi and Chahan River areas are representative of the distribution of high mountain plants east of Dulan. *Juniperus przewalskii* forests, which are tropical, are a common phenomenon on various high mountains within several hundred li around Dulan.

### The Coal Market Control Agency Decides to Strictly Enforce Management Regulations. Anyone Daring to Defy Orders Will Be Strictly Investigated. Cash Allocation is Expected to Gradually Increase.

Regarding the supply of bulk fuel in this city, after the relevant authorities actively adopted effective measures and strictly controlled and implemented the rationing system, the general situation has improved. However, some coal merchants, with ulterior motives, engaged in black market transactions and spread rumors, attempting to hoard goods for profit. The authorities discovered and dealt with the case. The control agency regrets this. In order to uphold the original intention and completely eliminate illegal transactions, in addition to the Dazhong United Coal Company forwarding letters to various coal merchants' trade associations to closely cooperate and supervise their members, it has also decided to strictly enforce various established regulations. Anyone who violates or fails to comply with the regulations, or intends to engage in unauthorized trading, will be stopped from allocating any kind of cash coal and will be severely punished as a warning to others. Yesterday, a reporter who is familiar with the coal market said that the fuel reserves in this city are not only exceptionally abundant, but also the source of supply is continuous. Most of this coal comes from North China and Korea, with very low production costs. At the same time, cash allocation has never been interrupted, so there is no shortage. It is also learned that the eighth batch of goods will be allocated within days, but the selling price per ton has not yet been announced.

### The City Police Department Sends Personnel to Participate in the Economic Special High Police Class.

The Central Police Academy, in order to actively train economic special high-level personnel, has specially continued to hold the fourth term of the Economic Special High Police Training Class to cultivate economic special high police. The Municipal Police Department has specially designated a large number of inspectors to go to the school for training, in order to complete and strengthen the city's police force as soon as possible.

### Selling Household Rice and Noodle Ration Coupons Leads to Arrest and Sentencing. Li Huijin is Sentenced to One Year and Six Months.

Li Huijin, a Cantonese landlord at No. 789 Haining Road, recently came up with a whimsical idea. After receiving the household rice and flour coupons issued by the Public Works Department, he sold them to peddlers and fellow villagers Huang Jirong and Nanjing resident Zhang Peiming at a high price. The case was discovered by the local Jia head, who reported it to the Huishi police station. Detectives were sent to arrest Li at his address and brought him and his wife, Ms. Mei, to the police station. They confessed that they had resold the rice and noodle coupons to Huang and Zhang for profit. The detectives also arrested Huang and Zhang one after another. There were as many as two hundred and fifty-six of these rice and noodle coupons. They were sent to the First Special Court, stating that they should be detained for detailed investigation. After verifying that the above numbers matched, the case was reviewed by Judge Lu in the Third Criminal Court yesterday. The lawyer representing the Legal Department of the Public Works Department filed a lawsuit based on charges of embezzlement and breach of trust, stating that the household rice was intended to help civilians make a living and was priced cheaply. It was wrong to resell the low-priced rice and flour to others at a high price for double the profit. He even embezzled the rice and noodle coupons, which were the food for his three tenants to barely survive on congee and noodles every ten days. It was a heinous crime. He requested severe punishment to warn the landlords of each household not to follow suit and take advantage of this unjustified black profit. As a result, after interrogation and judgment, Li Huijin was sentenced to one year and six months of imprisonment, Huang Jirong was sentenced to two months of imprisonment for assisting in the embezzlement, and Zhang Peiming was fined one hundred yuan. Li Mei was acquitted and released.

### Three Hundred Years of South Seas Storms

— Elector

The South Seas, the overseas homeland of the Chinese nation, is facing a new era due to the general retreat of Anglo-American imperialist forces. This is the time for the original inhabitants of the South Seas to start using their own strength to determine their own destiny! Especially our Chinese nation, due to its particularly close historical relationship with various parts of the South Seas, and the existence of the vast overseas Chinese with their political, cultural, and especially economic potential in various parts of the South Seas, cannot but pay special attention to its current situation and its future.

For three hundred years, the South Seas has become a paradise for pirates, and a colonial operation site for countries such as the Netherlands, England, and the United States! It has become a treasure trove for capitalist vampires, and at the same time, a hell on earth where local indigenous people and Chinese compatriots are oppressed and exploited!

The South Seas archipelago, or what Westerners call Indonesia, is composed of thousands of islands with a total area of more than two million square kilometers, located in a double arc between Asia and Australia. Before the end of the 18th century, its population did not exceed three million. The numerous races and ethnic groups on the islands were at different levels of social and economic development, speaking various languages and dialects.

Due to the advantageous terrain of the archipelago's location on the sea route between China and India, the ancient lands of culture, the indigenous peoples have long been influenced by China and India. Several areas of Java and Sumatra are surrounding the most developed countries in the Indian Ocean basin.

Indian and Chinese "military expeditions" repeatedly conquered and occupied individual areas of the islands. The Malays living along the coasts of the islands were formed by the mixture of local indigenous residents and "newcomers" from overseas expeditions. The Malays and Javanese stand side by side at the highest stage of development among the various ethnic groups in the archipelago, and their languages ​​form the most common language in the coastal areas of the archipelago.

The residents along the archipelago coast have long used their own unique ditch-digging methods to dig through the inland seas of the archipelago, completing transportation between individual islands. They also ventured on longer journeys, reaching India, Madagascar, and Africa. Chinese and Indian merchants also traded with the archipelago very early, purchasing various spices.

In the 13th to 15th centuries, during the Yuan and Ming dynasties of China, as a result of the Indian conquest, a grand Indian-Javanese feudal state was established in Java, several of which were very powerful and received tribute from many small ethnic groups on the islands. At the same time, China and India introduced irrigation systems, and agriculture began to develop on the islands. Javanese script, originating from India, began to appear, and the people of Java, Sumatra, and Bali also inherited religion, Hinduism, and part of Buddhism from the Indian conquerors, which occupied a dominant position in the most developed areas of the archipelago before the 15th century.

By the eve of the 18th century, Islam began to seize the positions of Hinduism and Buddhism on the islands, becoming the dominant religion in most parts of the Indonesian archipelago. However, in some areas, various religions coexisted and developed.

In the 16th century, the many powerful feudal states established by India in the archipelago declined, giving way to Islamic principalities. However, soon, the Dutch launched a colonial rule that lasted for two centuries, destroying the power of these principalities. The Netherlands East India Company monopolized all trade, cut them off from external markets, and deprived them of past income. They used various treaties to coerce the Javanese kings and feudal lords to provide local products.

Java, the most developed region of feudalism in the archipelago, where the kings had unlimited authority, just like in China, practicing the system of "all land under heaven belongs to the king, and all people within the borders are the king's subjects." Farmers had to pay not only land rent but also perform heavy labor.

The Dutch invasion strengthened feudal oppression, and peasant uprisings against local feudal lords and company spokespersons followed one after another, and various principalities (native states) also continuously fought against the company's plunder policies. The blood of this battle stained the entire South Seas history of the 18th century. The war from 1750 to 1763 was particularly heroic. However, the Dutch East India Company finally took advantage of the divisions between the principalities and the internal strife among local authorities to suppress the national resistance and expand its own territory. By the end of the 18th century, the Netherlands East India Company had seized most of the Javanese territory and began to exploit the natives. Later, in addition to Java and the small island of Madura, the Dutch called all the islands of Indonesia that had not yet been conquered "outer territories."

The "outer territories" retained many different social structural components before the end of the 18th century. In Borneo, Celebes, and other isolated inland areas of the archipelago, national systems were still retained. Among the most backward natives of New Guinea, the practice of cannibalism was still retained. The East India Company implemented a policy of plunder in the "outer territories."

However, since the withdrawal from the War of the Spanish Succession, the Netherlands has become a secondary colonial power. The hegemony in the East had to be given to England, whose economic development surpassed that of the Netherlands. The East India Company could no longer prevent the British from invading Indonesia. The British consolidated their position on the west coast of Sumatra, invaded Borneo, and attempted to take advantage of the difficulties of the war between the Dutch and the natives. As a result, the Netherlands East India's monopoly was broken. The Anglo-Dutch War (1780-1784) dealt the company the final blow. Its stronghold on the east coast of India fell into the hands of the British, and the Dutch territory on the west coast of Sumatra was surrendered to the British by the company's officials without a fight.

The 19th century was the era when Britain first contended for hegemony in the South Seas, followed by the United States.

In 1811, a British fleet of one hundred warships appeared near Batavia, and the Governor-General of India personally commanded the expedition. 12,000 marines occupied the colonial capital almost without resistance. The Dutch army retreated and scattered into the interior. When the British warships appeared near Semarang, Indonesian soldiers revolted, killing the Dutch officers, and the era of British rule in Indonesia began.

Britain made major changes in the methods of exploitation in Indonesia. In 1813, the abolition of the Sultanate and the annexation of its territory were implemented, with the Sultan relying on British subsidies to live. In the territory of the archipelago directly governed by the British, the power of the native chiefs was deprived, and the British also seized judicial and tax collection rights. The entire Java was divided into sixteen administrative regions, ruled by European officials appointed by the British. Solo and Yogyakarta, although retained as vassal principalities, completely lost their autonomy, just like the native states in India.

New methods of exploitation such as monetary taxes and land taxes appeared in the old modes of exploitation, but the old shackles remained. Handicrafts in Java and other places suffered serious blows, foreign capital began to invade the countryside, and the scope of extraction expanded.

After the collapse of the Napoleonic Empire, the Netherlands regained its independence and recovered its colonies, but did not recover Ceylon, the Straits Settlements, and British Guiana. In the movement to recover the colonies, it fought against Britain again. The people of Java and the vast Chinese compatriots in the South Seas took the opportunity to launch uprisings against the colonial vampires. The uprising from 1825 to 1830 in particular shook the colonial powers. The Dutch could not cope with the "too many" guerrillas, and the Javanese troops of the government army often turned to the side of the insurgents. This bloody battle lasted for five years. Finally, due to the wavering of the feudal lords of the vassal principalities, the Dutch's purchase tactics and deceptive reform policies took effect, and they conquered the uprising areas inch by inch.

After the Dutch suppressed the uprising and consolidated the position of the colonial regime, they implemented even more harsh exploitation, especially the notorious forced cultivation system. All farmers had to cultivate a certain portion of their land with export crops instructed by the government. In the compulsory process, they had to plant sugar cane, Indian indigo coffee trees, tobacco, etc., and hand over all the harvests to the government's warehouses in lieu of monetary taxes. In addition, farmers had to perform various public and private labor services for the government and officials of all sizes. Tens of thousands of farmers were driven to build seaports, castles, and private residences for high and low officials.

The British did not relax their operations in the South Seas archipelago. They established forces in Sumatra and other places, especially the construction of Singapore, establishing a position of great strategic and economic significance on the sea route from the Indian Ocean to the Pacific Ocean. The Netherlands was forced to make concessions to Britain. In order to stop British invasion of Sumatra, the Netherlands had to cede all the remnants of its own territories in India and the Malay Peninsula to Britain, and divide the territories in Southeast Asia equally with Britain.

However, Britain continued to advance aggressively, first establishing bases in North Borneo, in Brunei and Sarawak, placing these two countries under British control. The Dutch continued to resist. In 1851, the conquest of West Borneo began. Ruthless oppression aroused the resistance of Chinese compatriots. Our ancestors bravely resisted the Dutch regular army and the fleet that blockaded all the rivers. In 1854, the important city of Montrado was lost, and overseas Chinese were massacred, but the resistance was not destroyed. The Triads continued to lead compatriots and natives in resistance until 1856, when they were eliminated due to isolation and lack of support. However, uprisings continued to break out in places such as Banjarmasin in West Borneo.

By the mid-19th century, Britain had successively established colonial regimes in the Malay Peninsula, Sumatra, North Borneo, and Australia, dividing the power and interests in the Southwest Pacific with the Netherlands. However, the emerging United States also gradually advanced its power. By the end of the 19th century, especially with regard to the struggle for the Philippines, as a result of the Spanish-American War in 1898, the Philippine Islands, which the Spanish had managed for three hundred years, were completely occupied by the United States.

The entire second half of the 19th century was filled with the bloodshed of the European and American powers' scramble for Eastern, especially South Seas, colonies. The South Seas archipelago, as well as Annam, Burma, and the coastal areas of China, were plunged into a tragic situation of being ravaged and trampled upon. However, in this tragedy and pain, the vast South Seas residents and Chinese compatriots awakened, directly and indirectly struggling for liberation under the banner of "national self-determination." The history of the 19th and one-third of the 20th centuries is a tragic war history of oppressed nations resisting the extravagant desires of European and American imperialism. Especially after December 8, 1941, the forces of European and American imperialism were finally driven out of the South Seas and even the entire Pacific Ocean. The bloody history of more than three hundred years has revealed its final page. What follows will be the history of self-determination of our East Asian nations. How carefully and enthusiastically we must describe the brilliant future history!

### First Place in the January Essay Contest: My Life—Hospital Attendant (Part 1)

— Yi Qing

"Pay attention to everything and you will learn something." This was the admonition that Principal Wang gave to the 14 classmates who would no longer continue their studies at the junior high school graduation ceremony. He repeatedly comforted us, advising us not to be pessimistic because we dropped out of school due to economic problems. He sincerely explained to us that as long as we work hard, we can obtain valuable knowledge anytime and anywhere without paying any price. He listed many sages who completed their immortal feats in difficult and arduous environments. He encouraged us not to blindly believe the common saying, "Graduation means unemployment." He exhorted us to maintain a promising spirit. He instructed us to work hard in a down-to-earth manner. At the same time, he told us about a job opportunity, that a certain large hospital was recruiting 20 attendants with junior high school education. Finally, he instructed us that maintaining a job is not easier than finding one, and without perseverance, we will never achieve success.

So, I participated in this recruitment exam with great joy and was lucky enough to rank among the top. Since then, I have spent 18 months of regular life with the purpose of working to learn.

When I completed the admission procedures, put on the white uniform, and wore the No. 1 attendant badge on my chest, I waited with 19 companions for the distribution of work. The young administrator spoke kindly and cordially about the work of each department. He said that "attendants," as the name suggests, are dedicated to serving people and undertaking lower-level work for them. However, we must first recognize that all "work" is sacred. "There is no distinction between noble and humble in work, especially for hospital employees. The prerequisite qualifications must include a strong physique, keen senses, a philanthropic concept, sincere behavior, and a passionate embrace. Otherwise, one cannot fulfill their duties."

We work 10 hours a day, study and rest for 6 hours, and sleep for 8 hours. Every morning, we have 20 minutes of fitness exercises. Every week, we can take half a day off in rotation. Every year, we have two weeks of vacation. We receive a living allowance of 25 yuan per month and an average bonus of about 30 yuan. The hospital provides food and lodging, so it is enough to maintain personal living expenses and a savings of 3 yuan per month.

In order to promote the spirit of self-government, our group organized a fellowship association, mutually encouraging the weaknesses of our companions, collectively discussing the satisfaction we have with our work, and reviewing various lessons in a blitz manner. Sometimes, doctors and head nurses attend to guide us on basic common sense in terms of hygiene. Although we are already vocational youth, we still live a school life. We have indeed gained a lot of valuable knowledge without paying any price. This is most worthy of our gratitude for the hospital's generous treatment, because a stable life makes us feel more interested in our work.

We are in contact with patients all day long and are always at risk of being attacked by germs. Therefore, the hospital periodically injects us with vaccines and vaccinates us. We have a physical examination every six months. As a result of the third physical examination, two companions were found to have early-stage lung disease. After two months of recuperation, they recovered their health. Because of this lesson, we further maintain our own health.

Initially, I was assigned to serve in the outpatient clinic. At that time, the weather was very hot. In addition to routine patients, there were an average of four or five patients with epidemic diseases coming to the hospital for emergency treatment every day. I was busy cleaning and disinfecting non-stop. At the same time, there were quite a few patients who had taken poison. According to my diary statistics, there were a total of 27 times in three months, all of whom were women. Among them, 22 were due to family disputes. The most ridiculous time, a woman asked her husband to buy a pair of leather shoes, but failed to achieve her goal and swallowed less than one cc of opium ash. When she was sent to the emergency room, she closed her eyes and said nothing. Her family members were at a loss. After emergency treatment, it cost more than ten yuan in medical expenses, and she left with a smile. This clearly shows the low level of general knowledge and the demise of some social morals. At that time, there was a sigh that was both laughable and regrettable. Later, it became a source of information for after-work conversations.

### The Teacher of All Ages (13)

— James Hilton, translated by Yi Jin

"I certainly sympathize with you," Chips said.

"I hope you will. That is what brought me here to ask you. Briefly, my idea is this—if you feel like it, too, and can put your heart into it—how would it be if you came back to the school for a time? You still look perfectly suitable and, of course, you know the ropes. I don't want you to do a lot of hard work—you needn't strain at anything—just look round and do what you like. What I want of you, more than anything, isn't what actual work you can do—though that will be valuable, of course—it's the way you can help in other ways—just belonging to the school, that's enough. Nobody has ever been more popular than you were—are, even now—if anything threatened to go wrong, you could help to steady things. And there might be something of the sort going on..."

Chips, breathing quickly, and with a sense of warm exultation in his heart, answered, "I'll come..."

(14)

He retained his room at Mrs. Wickett's; indeed, he still lived there; but every morning, about half past ten, he put on his coat and muffler and crossed the road to the school. He found it all very suitable; the actual work was not taxing. There were a few classes in Latin and Roman History—old subjects—even the old pronunciation. The same jokes about certain conjugations—jokes that the new generation had not heard, and which, therefore, gained a success which gratified him. He felt like a music-hall star coming on to the stage for the last time after many encores.

It was wonderful, they all said, how quickly he remembered everyone's names and faces. They did not realize how closely, across the road, he had kept in touch with them.

He was, in a quiet way, a great success. He helped in all sorts of odd ways, that everyone knew and felt. And for the first time in his life he felt necessary—necessary to something, something that was close to his heart. There is no sublimer form of self-satisfaction, and this was finally his. (36)

### A Preview of "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle"

— Semi-Crazy

The long-awaited "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" finally held a preview yesterday (the 13th). The reporter was invited to get a sneak peek, so I will write down my impressions after watching it.

This is a rather long, narrative documentary. The story centers on Yuoda Yoshiichi, writing about how this loyal young man is inspired by the idea of ​​loyalty to the emperor and serving the country, and is determined to enter the aviation team preparatory training department to realize his dream of becoming a naval aviation soldier. The film depicts the life of the barracks, which is quite moving. We see hundreds of strong men doing gymnastics, swimming, sumo (i.e. wrestling), playing ball, rowing... and in these sports techniques, there is no place that does not contain implicit lessons of perseverance. The most memorable is the scene of rowing. Yuoda's team lost, and the captain asked them: "Do you know the reason for the defeat?" Yuoda replied, "Because the boat is not good." The captain said: "When the real war starts, can you claim that you have not been defeated because the weapons are not good?" In these places, we can clearly see the characteristics of Japanese military training. Their advantages lie in enduring hardship, being able to endure hard work, and absolute obedience, etc.

I think "The Hawaii-Malaya Sea Battle" is a documentary that lives up to its name. It goes without saying that the characters are relatively poor. The characteristic of a documentary lies in conveying an idea, a kind of consciousness, to the audience through the director's subjective selection in a concise and straightforward manner using pictures. After watching this film, we all feel the bravery and obedience of Japanese soldiers. If this film is successful, then this is its success.

### Heading Towards the Path of "Self-Reliance"

— Zhen

I remember someone saying, "The most pitiful and suffering creatures in the old Chinese family are women." Sisters with practical experience probably have to admit this statement. If I hadn't been born a daughter, no matter how difficult the family was, I would have had equal educational opportunities with my brothers. Unfortunately, I dropped out of school a few years ago because "daughters ultimately belong to someone else" and "why should girls read so many books!" However, the desire for knowledge and survival is an innate instinct, the only right of mankind to society. I want to survive, and I also want to learn. Limited by my inability to be independent, my parents could deprive me of the happiness of going to school during the day, but I believe that in the vast crowd, I will find a place to live and satisfy my desire for knowledge.

Perhaps "where there's a will, there's a way"! Last summer, through a friend's introduction, I finally passed the entrance examination for the Zili (Self-Reliance) Women's Night School at 392 Route MacTaggart. Although I have only studied for one semester, I feel sincerely satisfied. I think there must be many like me in society, so I dare to introduce some information about my alma mater to those who share the same pain.

Shanghai has everything. Hypocrites and professional philanthropists abound. Although I learned about "Zili" through a friend's introduction and knew that the authorities were quite historical educators of the people, I was still cautious and quietly observed their words and deeds. I remember once asking our "unpaid principal" (this term I only learned and confirmed later), "Why doesn't the school post more enrollment advertisements to attract more students?" He replied wonderfully: "Famous doctors with high medical ethics never advertise, and a good school should not rely on advertisements to recruit students." The economic situation of our school makes it impossible for the authorities not to do so, but looking at the facilities of the school for the past six months, none of them are about empty talk but focus on practicality. Sure enough, after the start of school, the classrooms were crowded with students.

Many volunteer night schools fulfill their obligations to students, but principals and teachers do not always fulfill their obligations. Our school is just the opposite. "It is very shameful that all of us are volunteers because we still collect a little miscellaneous fees from the students (a very small amount, ten yuan for junior high school, eight yuan for elementary school, and completely free for the poor - author's note), so we dare not put up the sign of volunteering." I remember the "unpaid principal" said this to us, but isn't this what should be? Our school is based on the principle of self-reliance, with "personality first" as its code of conduct. It is neither funded by private individuals nor under the direction of any institution or organization. Without a foundation and without subsidies, and with such expensive rent, it is appropriate for our students to share a portion of the expenses. Moreover, what the students pay is indeed only a part.

Although we pay very little, our benefits are very substantial. It can be said to be cheap and good. The principal is a chemist at a major pharmaceutical factory, and the physiology and hygiene education is given by a medical doctor. "Because there is no reward and the level is so high, the school's funding sources are very difficult." The principal often tells us this. Yes, because most of the students are adults who have dropped out of school, they are busy at work and take the time to study, which is completely different from those young ladies who enter school for diplomas. They cherish their time and also care for the school. When they encounter teachers who are not dedicated or whose level is not high enough, they kindly ask the principal to replace them. If the matter is true, the principal usually complies with the wishes of the majority.

Since we are based on the principle of self-reliance, all courses are mainly practical, eliminating the unnecessary and retaining the essential, teaching us how to behave in the world. Within the possible range, the authorities also introduce students to jobs, so that students can truly be self-reliant, sweat and earn their own meals in the family and in society, and be completely independent and free people.

### ### Hospital Doctors Offer Preferential Treatment to Elementary School Teachers

(1) Hangzhou West Lake Hospital is located next to Broken Bridge, with mountains in the back and a lake in front. The air is fresh. It is a natural sanatorium for treating lung disease, stomach disease, anemia, and neurasthenia. Elementary school teachers and student assistants holding "Shen Bao" securities receive special preferential treatment and pay attention to cultivation, and can study and read on their own without wasting their studies. Director Yang Yusheng, Shanghai Liaison Office, Friendship Medical Society, 129 Avenue Notre Dame.

(2) Wang Boyuan, Director of the Pingmin Obstetrics Hospital at 32 Ward Road, Tilanqiao, Hongkou, wrote: "Elementary school teachers are poorly paid. Once pregnant, they cannot afford to go to an obstetrics hospital and are bound to hire a midwife at random, which is very dangerous. Your newspaper has launched a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers, but is lacking assistance for childbirth. Our hospital is located in Hongkou and is willing to serve female teachers in the nearby area. If your newspaper has a childbirth assistance certificate and comes to contact us first, we can send someone to provide services, and the delivery fee can be waived, to fulfill our duty to serve teachers."

(3) National Physician Yang Bofan wrote: "Your newspaper's launch of a medical aid fund for elementary school teachers is truly a pioneering initiative to cultivate future talents and consolidate the nation's vitality. After hearing about it, I was very envious. Unfortunately, I am a poor scholar and lack the ability to assist. I deeply regret this. Fortunately, I have inherited medical knowledge and can slightly assess heat and cold. I am willing to do my best to contribute to the cause. I sincerely respond to this initiative. From now on, if teachers do not abandon me and entrust me with medical consultations, I will do my best to treat them responsibly. The amount of consultation fees, whether large or small, or even free, is not important."

### ### Mr. Shouzhuo Donates 2,000 Yuan to the Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund

Our newspaper's "Elementary School Teachers' Medical Aid Fund" received a generous donation of 2,000 yuan from Mr. Shouzhuo yesterday. Mr. Shouzhuo's spirit of mutual assistance is truly admirable.
