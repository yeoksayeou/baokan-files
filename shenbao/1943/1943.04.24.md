### Supporting on One Hand, Urging on the Other

The Nanjing National Government is the only government of China at present, and it is the government leading the comprehensive peace between China and Japan. Since the unfortunate incident between China and Japan occurred, until Chairman Wang led the peace movement, the National Government has overcome all difficulties and gone through untold hardships to create today's situation. Especially in the past two years, the correct theory of the peace movement has been promoted, and the facts of its performance have made the people in the peace zone realize that the National Government's dedication to the peace movement is entirely to reduce the suffering of the people's lives, preserve the vitality of the country's revival, and build a new China in the future. We acknowledge that the leading figures of the National Government do indeed cherish lofty ideals for the country and the people and dedicate themselves to the peace movement. As the saying goes: "Strong grass is known in a gale, and loyal ministers are recognized in troubled times." Although dirt can temporarily obscure a pearl, it will eventually reveal its precious light one day. Therefore, those who participate in the peace movement do not need to dwell on formal rewards for their contributions. The historical records of later generations will never confuse black and white or obscure right and wrong.

We deduce the truth of things by using calm, objective, and rational judgment. Deduction confined to temporary emotions and one-sided views of interests often backfires. We believe that the peace movement advocated by the Chairman meets the needs of the times. Unless one has ulterior motives, we believe everyone agrees with it or acquiesces to it. The so-called "ulterior motives" can be rephrased as those who oppose the peace movement, and we can summarize them into three types:

First, the Chongqing regime. Their resistance war began with Chiang Kai-shek's political speculation, attempting to survive by luck and maintain his dictatorial regime. However, since it was political speculation, they had to rely on Britain and the United States, which led to a failed outcome. They then continued with reckless actions out of embarrassment and anger, engaging in an endless dragging war, disregarding the suffering of the people, and willingly being exploited by Britain and the United States, remaining unenlightened until death.

Second, the Communist Party. They blindly implement the policies of the First International, completely disregarding the interests of the motherland. On the one hand, they intensify the pressure on the Chongqing regime to drag the war to the end, and on the other hand, they actively expand their political power. They will not give up until the motherland and the people "perish together."

Third, the defeatists and wavering elements in the peace movement. On the one hand, they participate in the peace movement as a cover; on the other hand, they create various obstacles to the peace movement to hinder its progress. They hang up the signboard of the peace movement while engaging in activities to fish in troubled waters, such as using the advantages of their positions to engage in hoarding or engage in business. To put it bluntly, they will be afraid when they see genuine and comprehensive peace, and they will lose the opportunity to fish in troubled waters. Therefore, their opposition is real, and their participation is false. This kind of person is the biggest obstacle on the road to comprehensive peace and also the enemy of those who truly dedicate themselves to the peace movement.

Therefore, we sincerely hope that the National Government, in its efforts to realize comprehensive domestic peace, must clearly see through which types of people are the real opponents, and especially be careful to guard against defeatists and wavering elements in its own camp and thoroughly eliminate them. Otherwise, their potential will grow, and it is very likely that they will eventually become a source of trouble. We dare to point this out solemnly from the standpoint of loving and protecting the government.

Since the National Government declared war on Britain and the United States on January 9, it must promote comprehensive peace internally and cooperate with its ally Japan to defeat Britain and the United States externally. The government's responsibility has been increased by another layer, and the demands on the people have naturally been increased by another layer. Moreover, every move of the government is closely related to the people. The government's affairs are the people's affairs, and the people's affairs are also the government's affairs. The government's measures should take the people as a prerequisite, and only then can these measures gain the support of the people. In this way, the government and the people can be united as one, and only then can they exert their total strength to promote comprehensive peace internally and strive for victory in the war externally. In order to create a force that unites the government and the people, we need to support the government on one hand, fearing that we are not sincere enough; and urge the government on the other hand, fearing that we are not strict enough.

The responsibility of our journalistic circles is to communicate the opinions of the government and the people, to announce the government's intentions to the people on one hand, and to convey the public opinions of the people to the government on the other hand. Our proposals are nothing more than based on the opinions of the general public. If you think that our advocacy of "improving political institutions," "clarifying politics," "reforming personnel," "thoroughly investigating speculation and hoarding," "separating officials and merchants," and various political, economic, and social reform suggestions are opposing the government, this view is really unacceptable. We also deeply believe that the wise authorities will not only not have this view but will also value our well-intentioned suggestions.

Only those who truly dare to offer honest advice are those who truly support the government; only a government that can truly accept all kinds of advice is a government that is worthy of sincere support; and only the people who truly dare to urge the government are modern citizens who love the country. We will reiterate tirelessly: "Support the government on one hand, fearing that we are not sincere enough; and urge the government on the other hand, fearing that we are not strict enough." This is to inform those who generally misinterpret the meaning of "support" and "opposition."

### Axis Forces with Favorable Terrain Determined to Hold Tunisia British Forces Launch General Offensive at Enfidaville Minefields and Traps Densely Laid Acknowledge Combat Difficulties

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It is learned here that after the British Eighth Army, commanded by Montgomery, launched a general offensive at Enfidaville on the southern end of the Tunisian front, the Tunisian front entered the decisive battle stage. British forces are now engaged in fierce fighting with the Axis forces commanded by the German General Rommel.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Allied News Agency correspondent Saito said: The final battle for Tunisia is now being fiercely fought by the British Eighth Army and the elite German Africa Corps commanded by Marshal Rommel. According to news received in Stockholm, the fierce fighting is currently taking place in the Enfidaville area. The British side once hinted that Marshal Rommel might follow the example of the Dunkirk campaign in the hope of preserving his troops, but now it is said that he is determined to fight to the end. British sources also acknowledged that the German army has dug trenches to hold fast and has a good supply of materials and ammunition. British sources said that General Montgomery's line extends eighty kilometers westward from Enfidaville, but also acknowledged that the entire area is full of German minefields, machine gun positions, tank traps, and other obstacles, and the German line's fierce artillery fire is also sufficient to show the German army's good equipment. London news acknowledges that it is very difficult to break into the defense lines from Tunis to Bizerte. Military circles in Stockholm said that no matter what the outcome of the Tunisian battle, it is generally a huge success for the German side, as the Axis forces have gained time to prepare for the Anglo-American attack on the continent. They pointed out that Europe is now an entire fortress, and eight million Axis soldiers are ready to depart.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Havas News Agency's military correspondent: The battle on the southern section of the Tunisian front continues to intensify. The right wing of General Montgomery's troops, after fierce fighting, has occupied Enfidaville and hopes to advance further north along the coast, but here the British army only advanced a few kilometers outside Enfidaville on Wednesday. The area of flat land between the coast and the mountains is not wide, and is still controlled by the Axis soldiers stationed in the highlands, so the right wing of the British Eighth Army cannot extend too far before its middle and left wings have made greater progress. But the middle and left wings of the British army have not been able to follow its right wing, and are now fighting on the southern and southwestern slopes, hoping to enter the mountains. As of Tuesday night, they had only gained a foothold in a few strongholds. The distance from there to the central area of the mountains is still far, and the central area is even higher and not easy to reach without great difficulty. The Axis forces there have extremely strong defensive positions and will resist step by step. The middle of General Montgomery is now fighting on the slopes, striving to enter the small waterway of the Dagaluna village inside the mountains, but has not succeeded. As of Wednesday night, the village was still in the hands of the Axis forces. The German army launched a fierce attack in the west, penetrating deep into the enemy's rear, so the British Eighth Army has very little chance to advance quickly. General Montgomery attempted to occupy the highlands northwest and west of Enfidaville. Since yesterday morning, the British and New Zealand troops have begun to attack. Because the terrain here makes it difficult to use tanks, the British army has used more artillery and aircraft. Extremely fierce fighting is still continuing. The French army, which was originally deployed at the junction of the British First Army and the Eighth Army, lost almost all the land it had gained last week due to a fierce counterattack by the German army. As of Wednesday, it was obviously resuming its advance towards Pont du Fahs and Djebel Zaghouan to slightly assist General Montgomery, but this move was powerless. On the western front of the Tunisian bridgehead, the British First Army made major preparations on Wednesday. General Anderson seemed to want to use this day to complete the thorough preparation for his large-scale new offensive, but the German army used strong forces to carry out reconnaissance attacks in the Mejez el Bab area, giving the British army a major hindrance. The British army was caught off guard and lost four artillery pieces and was captured in large numbers. After completing their mission, the German army withdrew safely. They prove that General Anderson has concentrated three British infantry divisions and one British tank division in the northern section of the western front, and in the second line there are American and French troops, so he also has superior manpower and material resources to prepare for a large-scale new attack in the future, only slightly inferior to what General Montgomery possesses.

### Axis Elite Troops Headed to the Front Line Prepare to Fight to the Death with the British

Stockholm, Sweden, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Before the anti-Axis forces launched their general offensive, they mobilized official propaganda organs to spread rumors that the Axis forces would repeat the tragedy of the Second Dunkirk and withdraw from the Tunisian front, but little did they know that after several discussions between German and Italian military officials, they had decided to defend the bridgehead of the African continent to the death. German General Rommel also pondered and exhausted his efforts, adopting the advantageous nature of internal line operations, determined to make the Tunisian front the Stalingrad of the Axis forces. According to a telegram from London, American Secretary of War, Patterson, strongly cautioned Americans not to be optimistic about the North African situation, saying that the anti-Axis forces would face even greater difficulties in fighting on the Tunisian front in the future and must endure great sacrifices. Another telegram from London said that the British newspapers also attached great importance to the North African situation and paid close attention to its trend. For example, the Daily Express reported that the British Eighth Army is currently engaged in fighting at Enfidaville and extending eighty kilometers west of it, but the Axis forces have laid mines and machine guns all over the area and dug trenches everywhere, and their ammunition is also very sufficient, so it is not easy for the British army to attack. Another telegram from London said that the British Eighth Army had broken through the Axis positions on the Enfidaville front, but the German authorities have denied this. It is heard that transportation from Sicily to the front has almost stopped. But the Axis forces are determined to fight to the death with the anti-Axis forces and have withdrawn all useless soldiers to the rear. The soldiers on the front line are all elite troops and have decided to defend their positions to the death on the line connecting the two ports of Tunis and Bizerte when necessary. Moreover, well-informed British sources unanimously believe that the entire European continent has now become a fortress, and the Axis forces' defenses are extremely solid. If the anti-Axis forces want to open up a second front in Europe, it is tantamount to fighting a tiger with bare hands or crossing a river without a boat. Everyone believes that the progress of the Tunisian front has a profound impact on the control of the Mediterranean Sea, and the progress of the situation in the past four or five weeks is particularly noteworthy.

### German Army Surprise Attack Yields Results in the Atlas Mountains

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It is reported that the Axis forces on the Tunisian front are still fighting bravely against about twice as many anti-Axis forces. According to the Axis military headquarters, in addition to achieving results in defensive battles on the 22nd, the Axis forces also launched a preemptive offensive west of Mejez el Bab and achieved considerable results. A summary of the war situation messages from various front lines is as follows: (1) On the southern front, the anti-Axis forces launched an unprecedented fierce offensive, especially the artillery's shelling was the most intense. On the 21st, as many as 50 shells fell in a small area alone. At present, the focus of the British Eighth Army's attack is the coastal area north of Enfidaville. In the area between Mejez el Bab and Bou Arada on the northern defensive line, the Axis forces carried out a large-scale surprise attack, advancing westward on the vast front line of stream valleys and hills in the Atlas Mountains, and have wiped out most of the enemy troops. Although the results of this battle achieved by the Axis forces have not yet been reported in detail, as far as it is known now, in addition to destroying six anti-Axis mortar positions, 11 British tanks, 4 armored reconnaissance vehicles have been intercepted and destroyed, and 400 anti-Axis soldiers have been captured, including 236 British soldiers. At the same time, in the Genolmans Road area, German shock troops also broke into the anti-Axis positions and captured 30 enemies, including a staff officer. In addition, the Axis air force closely cooperated with the ground forces on the entire Tunisian front. On the 21st, in air battles, 17 anti-Axis aircraft were shot down, including 4 bombers and several others. In addition, it also bombed advancing anti-Axis troops, barracks, and supply bases. It also raided the ports of Algiers and Philippeville. In the port of Algiers, a 5,000-ton transport ship was severely damaged. In addition, a 3,000-ton ship was also hit. At the same time, the port facilities and military supplies storage depots in the port of Philippeville were also bombed and caught fire.

### British and Americans Lose Over 4,000 Tanks in North African Campaign

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - According to the German military authorities: Since the start of the war in Libya in the autumn of 1940, up to April 28 of this year, the British army and other anti-Axis forces have lost a total of 4,500 tanks. It is heard that 2,734 of them were lost during the period from September 25, 1942, to April 18 of this year.

Stockholm, Sweden, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Stefani News Agency reported that news received here from the front in Tunisia confirms that the British Eighth Army has suffered significant losses in operations on the southern front. According to the Associated Press, ambulances are constantly shuttling between front-line first aid stations and rear field hospitals.

### Japanese Army in Shanxi Launches New Operation Against Chongqing Army Overcoming Perilous Terrain of Taihang Mountains

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to a telegram from a certain front-line location of the Japanese army in the Taihang Mountains in southern Shanxi, the local Japanese military authorities issued a statement at 2:00 p.m. today regarding the new operation launched by the Japanese army in Shanxi. The gist of the statement was: The local Japanese army, in cooperation with neighboring units, began a new operation against the Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group in the Lingchuan, Linxian, and Linqi areas near the southern Taihang Mountains, and had completely surrounded the Chongqing Army on April 20 and is currently annihilating it. As for the current battle situation, the Japanese army is making smooth progress throughout. In this operation, the Shanxi Communist Suppression Army and various armed groups on the Chinese side also bravely cooperated with the Japanese army in a spirit of living and dying together. The Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group is commanded by Pang Bingxun and is mainly composed of three armies: the 27th Army, commanded by Liu Jin, the 40th Army, commanded by Ma Fawu, and the New 3rd Army, commanded by Sun Dianying, with a total force of about 82,000 men, and is the Chongqing Army's last effort in North China.

(Another dispatch) According to a telegram from the southern Shanxi front on the 23rd: In order to eliminate Chiang Dingwen, "Commander-in-Chief" of the Chongqing's Ji-Cha War Zone, Pang Bingxun of the 24th Army Group, Ma Fawu of the 27th Army, and Sun Dianying of the New 5th Army, who are hiding in the Taihang Mountains on the border of the three provinces of Shanxi, Hebei, and Henan, the elite units of the Japanese North China Expeditionary Army secretly began operations. The Chongqing Army, which had previously attempted to make trouble in the triangular area of Lingchuan (Shanxi Province), Lixian (Henan Province), and Linhong (Henan Province), was plotting to take action. After the Japanese army began the suppression operation on the 16th, it first destroyed the Chongqing County Government Army entrenched in the mountainous area north of Xiuwu Jiaozuo, and then advanced north, overcoming the natural danger of the Taihang Mountains, and sweeping away the remaining Chongqing Army in various places. On the 22nd, it arrived at the important points of the Henan-Shanxi provincial border. Approaching Linhong, the stronghold of the Chongqing 24th Army Group, it is now only a matter of time before it falls. At the same time, it is echoing each other with the Japanese army units advancing southward, and advancing forward. In addition, the Japanese Army Air Force also took advantage of the moonlight on the night of the 21st to attack the Chongqing Army, bombing the defeated and remnant Chongqing Army in a panic and firing fiercely with machine guns, making it easier for the Japanese ground forces to attack. As of the 23rd, the Japanese army has narrowed the encirclement and is attacking from all sides.

Japanese Army in Taihang Mountains Occupies Linqi

Beijing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - A telegram from a certain location of the Japanese army in the southern Taihang Mountains on the 23rd said that elite units of the Japanese army broke into Linqi, a stronghold of the Chongqing Army, on the 23rd, and are currently clearing out the remaining enemies. Linqi is the forward base of the Chongqing Army and is the key to clearing the security of the Beijing-Hankou Line.

Beiping, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The goal of the new operation launched by the Japanese army in North China is to annihilate the Chongqing Army in the Ji-Cha War Zone. Since the early summer of the 28th year of the Republic of China, the Japanese army has launched operations in the eastern part of Shanxi Province and near Luan and Zezhou with the aim of annihilating the Chongqing Army in that area. Subsequently, between the end of that year and the spring of the 29th year of the Republic of China, it launched a winter offensive operation, inflicting a major blow on the Chongqing Army. In May of the 30th year, the Japanese army launched the Central Plains Battle again. At that time, the Chongqing Army left behind 42,000 corpses and 29,000 people were captured. At the same time, all the strongholds of the Chongqing Army in North China were destroyed in succession. In June of the 31st year of the Republic of China, during the battle in the Shanxi-Hebei-Henan border area, the Japanese army again annihilated the Chongqing Army's 27th Army. In this battle, Zuo Heng, the deputy chief of staff of the Chongqing Army's 18th Army Group, was also killed in battle, and Liu Yuexiang, the commander of the newly formed 5th Army's Provisional 3rd Division, also joined the peace movement. All the above suppression operations have thwarted the Chongqing Army's attempts. However, the main purpose of the Japanese army's operation this time is to annihilate the Chongqing Army's 24th Army Group. Although the Chongqing side lacks both manpower and materials, it has made great efforts to train this army.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - After Zhang Xingbing's remnant troops of the Chongqing guerrillas lurking in the Dongtai area were defeated by the 35th Division Commander of the National Army, Zhao Junshan, in cooperation with friendly forces, the security of the Dongtai area was restored. The general public, who had been suffering under the heavy taxes and miscellaneous levies of the Chongqing side, were able to rest and live in peace, and the local area gradually showed signs of revival.

Weekly War Situation of Japanese Garrison

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Garrison in China released a weekly war situation report on April 23, stating: The Communist bandits in various provinces of North China fear that the new policy of the Japanese side towards China will gradually develop and increase obstacles, so they are trying to disrupt the morale of the people in the security areas, especially for the Chinese organizations, focusing their strategies and making every effort to destroy them. However, the Chinese side's awareness is gradually increasing, and the Communist bandits' attempts have been defeated and shaken. Among the prisoners captured by the Japanese army in March, there were 1,834 Chongqing soldiers, and the number of bandits was more than twice as many, compared to the average difference of only one or two times in January and February. This shows that the number of Communist prisoners has gradually increased. Moreover, the number of prisoners and those who surrendered in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River has also increased, so the theory of resistance war has gradually collapsed due to the theory of peace. The new policy of the Japanese side has gradually made the people understand. However, on the other hand, the troops under the command of the deputy commander of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone were captured by the Communist bandits, and in the southern Lishui area of Jiangnan, there were even clashes between the Chongqing Army and the New Fourth Army. At this time, the Japanese Commander-in-Chief Hata inspected various places in North China and pointed out that in addition to determining the responsibility for combat and defense, all rebellious activities under the rule of the National Government should be suppressed. At present, a vigorous operation is being launched in Shanxi, and the future development of the situation in that area is worth watching.

### Minister Chen's Response to Reporters: Detailed Discussion of Various Domestic Policy Issues

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - A Central News Agency reporter recently visited Minister of the Interior Chen Qun and was granted an audience. Minister Chen responded to the reporter's inquiries on various domestic policy issues, as follows:

Question: After China's entry into the war, what is the focus of domestic policy?

Answer: Since China's entry into the war, the focus of the Ministry of the Interior's work has been to ensure public security. Therefore, police training is a top priority. Since the National Government's entry into the war, local security has become entirely our own responsibility. Thus, it is necessary to further train the police and strengthen local forces so they can bear practical responsibility. Currently, local police are directly responsible to provincial and municipal governments and are also supervised by the Ministry of the Interior, resulting in inconsistent training policies and educational standards. Furthermore, one significant shortcoming is the police's inadequate quality. The Ministry of the Interior, bearing the responsibility of supervising the police, will strive to improve this aspect in the future.

Question: May I ask for your views on promoting clean governance?

Answer: Clean governance is a necessary condition for political reform. If those in power are not incorruptible, then politics will inevitably be dark, and all national construction will be out of the question. Senior government officials have already held meetings on integrity, but these are only to exchange individual opinions. If all government officials practice integrity diligently, clean governance will certainly be achieved, and the people will enjoy prosperity and happiness.

Question: The government has recently dispatched personnel to punish hoarding. What are the Minister's observations on the results?

Answer: The practice of hoarding and speculation affects people's livelihoods and the national economy to a great extent. Chairman Wang decisively issued an order to severely investigate and punish such behavior to appease the public and prevent future occurrences. However, to sanction those involved in hoarding and speculation, one must resolutely disregard personal connections and avoid any leniency. As long as a few individuals who disrupt the market are severely investigated and punished, I believe no one will dare to test the law again.

Question: Is there room for improvement in the current implementation of partial material rationing?

Answer: The material rationing system must be balanced, adhering to the principle of not worrying about scarcity but worrying about inequality. The most ideal situation is when the quantity of materials can meet supply and demand. Even if the quantity of materials is not sufficient, the needs of the general public must be prioritized. We must show compassion for the common people and also consider the hardships of civil servants. Relevant authorities are currently planning measures.

Question: What are your opinions on youth training?

Answer: Youth training is organized by the New Citizen Movement Promotion Committee. I greatly admire those who are in charge. However, there is a simple psychological test for youth training, which is to make the youth listen to instructions and obey orders. If we order all the youth in the country to shave their heads, and see if they are willing to obey, that would be telling. All the students at Zhengshi Middle School, which I run, have shaved their heads. In friendly country Japan, youths in middle school, university preparatory courses, or higher schools all shave their heads. Before leaving university or starting work in society, they rarely keep long hair. In addition, it is necessary to strengthen their physical fitness and implement training, so that everyone is full of energy and physically strong. Only then can they serve properly, and not fail the original intention of training. Being able to do this would be considered an initial success of the training.

### German Leader Sends Telegram of Thanks: Chairman Wang Sends Birthday Greetings

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - April 20th was the birthday of German leader Adolf Hitler. Chairman Wang telegraphed his congratulations, and the German leader sent a return telegram of thanks. The text of the return telegram is as follows: "To His Excellency Chairman Wang of the National Government of Nanjing, I express my sincere gratitude for your congratulatory telegram on my birthday. Hitler, Supreme Headquarters, April 21, 1943."

### Zou Quansun Appointed to National Economic Committee

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - National Government order: April 23rd, Zou Quansun is specially appointed as a member of the National Economic Committee. This order.

The delegation leader An Ji-yun delivered a reply, stating briefly that all facilities in China in the three years since the return of the capital have been progressing rapidly, and the clean governance of Jiangsu Province is particularly admirable. If all provinces are like this, it is expected that China, Japan, and Manchukuo will all ascend to a bright future. At noon, Governor Li hosted a banquet, which was very enjoyable. In the afternoon, the delegation visited friendly agencies. After a dinner hosted by the provincial government, they left Suzhou for Shanghai at approximately 7:00 PM.

### Japanese Major General Tanihagi's Speech: New Trends in World War - The Greater East Asia War Shows Japanese Military Superiority, Creating the Most Glorious Page in Military History

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a telephone report from Sendai, Major General Tanihagi, head of the Army Press Department of the Japanese General Headquarters, gave a public speech at the Sendai Public Hall at 6 PM this afternoon. Entitled "Completing the Greater East Asia War," he explained the great military achievements of the Japanese army in combat and construction in the vast Greater East Asia region. He also pointed out that the United Kingdom and the United States now have great fear of Japan. Finally, he told the 100 million citizens of Japan to make further efforts with the belief of certain victory to complete the Greater East Asia War. The gist of the speech is recorded as follows: Recently, the authorities of the United Kingdom and the United States, in order to boost their morale, have created a false impression among their people. Therefore, they have repeatedly discussed issues such as peace and the post-war governance. Such remarks are not only pie in the sky, but also premature and therefore laughable. However, it also reveals their selfish and self-serving doctrine and exposes the United States' ambition to dominate the world. During the Southern Operation, the US military inflicted cruel punishment on wounded Japanese soldiers and abused Japanese residents everywhere. Their most blatant violations of international law and disregard for humanity were the daytime attacks on Japanese Red Cross ships. Furthermore, the British army repeatedly drove other ethnic groups into battle during operations, using their flesh and blood to resist ruthless bullets and protect their own safety. Moreover, they insulted civilians, plundered food, and so on, all of which exposed their evil behavior. As for the new trends in this World War, they can be divided into three points:

(1) Expansion of the Battlefield: This war is a decisive battle between two national groups with completely different worldviews. At present, apart from some neutral countries and Japan, which maintains a neutral relationship with the Soviet Union, the world can be roughly divided into two major parts: the Axis and the Anti-Axis. At the same time, the two groups are continuing to fight each other. After the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army launched a great operation to destroy the British and American strongholds in East Asia in a vast area, and the overall situation has now been determined.

(2) Speed of Operations: Recalling the Russo-Japanese War, the Japanese army began operations from the Liaodong Peninsula and the Yalu River area in late July, and the Battle of Fengtian was held in February of the following year, lasting about ten months. During this time, the Japanese army only traveled four hundred kilometers. However, in this Greater East Asia War, the Japanese army's Yamashita Corps advanced more than a thousand kilometers in the Malay Peninsula in just two months, showing that the speed of operations in this war is much faster than in the past.

(3) Scientification of the Military: For example, in the recent European war, the German army's capture of Poland and the battle in northern France were both blitzkriegs by German mechanized units. For example, when the Japanese army attacked the Sumatra giant port, it used paratrooper units and succeeded in one fell swoop. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the United Kingdom and the United States have fully felt the power of the Japanese military. The most notable example is the operation in the South Pacific from August last year to February this year, and the annihilation battle at the Mashu River in northern Nissi this March. Furthermore, in order to gain sufficient time, the Japanese army sent covering troops to advance to Guadalcanal Island in the Solomon Islands and various parts of New Guinea Island from August last year to February this year in order to build land bases and strategic strongholds in the occupied areas of the South. The brave battles of the covering troops really created the most glorious page in military history. The "Divine Warrior" characteristics and martial spirit of the Japanese army made the arrogant American army fearful and trembling. At the same time, the United States also recognized that their superiority has been fundamentally shaken. Furthermore, American public opinion also unanimously stated that it is unfavorable for the American military to fight against the brave Japanese army. All aspects of the United States recognize that it is difficult for the American military to achieve the final goal by capturing countless islands in the Pacific one by one. Because if the American military intends to reach Tokyo, it still needs a hundred years, and it needs hundreds of times more troops than the American military today. Furthermore, the British Indian army recently attempted to recover Masi River in Burma and began to attack, but its five brigades and one detachment were completely annihilated by the Japanese army. The other three brigades also fled in all directions, not only collapsing, but also losing their combat power. Therefore, the Anti-Axis forces are increasingly terrified of the Japanese army. Although the future of the Greater East Asia War is still distant and difficult, victory is already firmly in our hands. In short, this war is a sacred war of justice for the heavens and the earth, and all Japanese citizens should work hard to complete the war with a spirit of resolve to die.

### Japanese Aircraft Assault New Guinea by Moonlight: Increased Japanese Air Power in the Pacific: US and Australian Authorities Are Anxious

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a report from Melbourne: The Southwest Pacific Headquarters of General MacArthur announced yesterday that on the evening of April 21st, Japanese aircraft took advantage of the full moon to attack the Anti-Axis forces' positions in southeastern New Guinea again.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - According to a special report from the capital of Argentina carried in the evening edition of the Yomiuri-Hochi newspaper on the 22nd, the recent continuous offensives by the Japanese Air Force in the Southwest Pacific have caused great embarrassment to the US and Australian military authorities. All sectors in the United States and Australia have also unanimously demanded that the authorities re-examine the war situation in the Southwest Pacific. MacArthur has also had friction with US Navy Secretary Knox over this matter. It is reported that Admiral Yarnall, former commander of the US Asiatic Fleet, mentioned the war situation in the Southwest Pacific at a naval gathering in Princeton on the 21st of this month, strongly stating that the Japanese army's position in the Southwest Pacific is no longer something that the US Navy can break through with its own power. He meant that the Japanese army's attitude of securing the Southwest Pacific has great significance, and that it has already been able to determine the fate of the Pacific countries for the next fifty years. If the Japanese army is not driven out of China now, it may be difficult for the US Navy to annihilate the Japanese army on its own. But judging from the current situation, because the Anti-Axis forces have no effective offensive in China, the United States should extend the war as much as possible. During this period, it should use air force or submarines to fight against Japan. The great offensive adopted by the Japanese army in the Pacific is unprecedented in military history. During this time, the United States must use all means to hinder Japan from building economic countries in China, the Philippines, India, the Malay Peninsula, the East Indies, Australia, and New Zealand. Furthermore, Australian Ambassador to the United States, Edward, also made a speech in New York on the 20th, briefly stating that Australia is now directly threatened by the Japanese army. If the United States does not start an offensive now, Australia may never exist. Furthermore, the American Central Daily News also published a commentary criticizing Admiral Yarnall's views as being too weak, and advocating to start an offensive immediately. It meant that Japan's victory will dominate world history for a long time, and the United States should eliminate any difficulties and give Japan a major blow. In addition, the Chongqing Central Daily News also reported that it recognized that American Navy Admiral Yarnall had lived in China for a long time and was known as an expert on East Asia. It now also points out that the Anti-Axis forces have no effective offensive in China, which is enough to expose the unreliability of the United States in strengthening its aid to Chongqing. It meant that the Anti-Axis forces should immediately take offensive action against Japan. If Japan uses preemptive means to attack Asia, then the Anti-Axis forces will not only lose the opportunity to attack Japan, but also increase the possibility of being attacked by Japan. All the opinions that have been raised because of Yarnall's views are enough to show the confusion of the nurturing country in guiding the operation in the Southwest Pacific.

### United Kingdom and United States Lost 12 Million Tons of Ships Last Year

Capital, Argentina, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The governments of the United Kingdom and the United States, in light of the danger that the maritime lines of communication are being cut off as a result of the Axis navies carrying out a commercial destruction war, are currently engaged in studying countermeasures.

It is said that British officers, who feel caught in the middle, have also expressed their approval for this move.

Istanbul, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) - The oppression and interference of the Anti-Axis forces in West Asian countries has recently become more blatant, so the resentment of the natives is also deepening. According to a Cairo dispatch, the Egyptian public has recently strongly demanded the easing of the martial law areas set by the British army, citing the inconvenience of daily life, and this outcry has gradually spread to the whole country. However, the British military authorities, ignoring the current situation, have instead expanded the martial law areas to southern Egypt and set up two military law offices in Alexandria, completely ignoring the opinions of the people, causing the resentment of the Egyptian public to deepen further.

### Eastern Front Battle Situation

Rome, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to the Stefani Agency, Rome's "People's Daily" reported today: The Soviet offensive in the Kupiansk area has encountered strong resistance from the Axis forces, suffering heavy losses in both manpower and materiel, and has now temporarily halted its attack. The Soviet army mobilized numerous divisions, supported by a large number of powerful tanks and aircraft, and launched a sudden attack. The German defense line had to retreat three kilometers, but soon the German forces launched a counter-offensive, and the two sides maintained a balanced stalemate. The Soviet army suffered countless losses in manpower and materiel, shattering the initial enthusiastic hopes of the Soviet high command.

Berlin, 22nd (Central News Agency) - Last night, the German News Agency reported: On Wednesday, the German-led Allied forces took advantage of the clear weather to carry out local operations at three locations on the Eastern Front, all of which were successful. They continued to reinforce their positions in the Novorossiysk area, south of Kupiansk, and west of Kursk. The Soviet Air Force was unable to cope with the continuous heavy bombing of German aircraft. In the Kupiansk bridgehead alone, 51 Soviet aircraft were shot down by German fighter planes. In the past five days, more than 300 Soviet aircraft have been shot down in this area. On Wednesday, a total of 102 Soviet aircraft were shot down in the Eastern Front air battles.

### Mexico Opposes Sending Troops Overseas

Madrid, 22nd (Central News Agency) - The Spanish News Agency quoted a New York report that "The New York Times" commented on the meeting between the presidents of the United States and Mexico, saying that Mexico is unwilling to change its plans to cater to the intentions of the United States, because Mexico must maintain its autonomy and is unwilling to become an American colony. It also said that, apart from a small number of flight personnel who have been trained in the United States, Mexico is unlikely to send its soldiers to fight overseas.

### Slovak Leader Meets with Hitler

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German Führer's headquarters announced today that Führer Hitler met with the Italian Prime Minister two weeks ago, and recently held a meeting with Slovak President Tiso and other Slovak leaders at his headquarters. President Tiso strongly defended Slovakia's role in fighting on the German side and pledged to exert all efforts to achieve Axis victory. This lengthy discussion, following the meeting between Hitler and Mussolini from the 7th to the 10th of this month, adds another page to the sudden surge in diplomatic activity between the two countries. After the meeting, Hitler received Romanian Prime Minister and Hungarian Deputy Regent General Tausen, while Mussolini also discussed matters with Hungarian Prime Minister Kallay. During this meeting, Foreign Minister Ribbentrop and German Army Commander Keitel represented the German side, while Prime Minister Tuka, Interior Minister Mach, and Defense Minister General Catlo represented the Slovak side. Both sides discussed the fight against Bolshevism and the Anglo-Americans to liberate Europe, and their positions were coordinated.

### US Special Envoy to India Scheduled to Return Home

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency) - It has been learned that US Special Envoy to India, Phillips, will return to Washington at the end of this month to report on the situation in India. It is said that he arrived in New Delhi on the 22nd and is staying at the Governor-General's residence, planning to stay for several days and hold a frank discussion with the Indian Governor-General. According to reports from the "Nichi Nichi Shimbun" and the "Calcutta Gazette," it is rumored that the US government and the British government seem to be mediating to break the deadlock in India. However, the US government's superficial interference in the Indian issue has caused dissatisfaction among the British. Therefore, it will informally propose a compromise plan to the British government. At the same time, the Chongqing government is also seeking to approach the leaders of the Indian National Congress in order to break the deadlock in India.

### Evacuation of Children from Paris

Paris, 22nd (Central News Agency) - A special train carrying 1,000 French children left for the countryside of Calais last night. This is the first step to protect children from Anglo-American air raids. Prefect Bouffet and other famous officials jointly went to the station to see them off.

### British Aircraft Blindly Bomb, Germany Declares Retaliation Inevitable, 39 British Aircraft Shot Down in Raids

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 22nd: 39 British aircraft were shot down by German forces during the British air raid on Stettin and Rostock in northern Germany on the night of the 20th.

Berlin, 32nd (Central News Agency) - German Propaganda Minister Goebbels recently published an article in this week's German "Willingness Weekly" entitled "The British Air Raids on Germany." He strongly stated that German aircraft will use retaliatory measures to bomb Britain in the future, with the general idea being: I recently went to Essen to inspect the areas that were severely damaged by British air raids. I met with the affected citizens, and they were all silent, believing that it was most glorious for the country to endure sacrifices. At the same time, they hated the enemy's atrocities to the bone, and they were even more convinced that the final victory must belong to us. The enemy thinks that blind bombing can discourage the German people, which is purely a mistake. Germany has now strengthened submarine warfare and will use it to counter blind bombing by enemy aircraft. The losses suffered by Britain due to commercial destruction warfare are actually greater than the damage suffered by Germany due to air raids. However, submarine warfare does not target innocent women and children. Germany's response to air raids is not only defensive but is also seeking active measures. The German government and people will express their anger about the blind bombing by British aircraft at an appropriate time because Germany will definitely retaliate sooner or later.

### Wallace Visits South America, Arrives in Colombian Capital

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to news from the Colombian capital, US Vice President Wallace arrived in Bogotá, the capital of Colombia, yesterday on his tour of Latin American countries.

### US Congress Adjourns

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - Washington dispatch: The US House of Representatives adjourned yesterday for the Easter holiday and will reconvene on May 3rd.

### British MPs Protest South African Anti-Indian Laws, Frequently Question Amery, Indian Public Also Extremely Angry

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - According to London news, several British Members of Parliament yesterday expressed fierce criticism of the anti-Indian laws enacted by South Africa on Wednesday and frequently questioned Secretary of State for India Amery. The MPs demanded that the British government explain the bill proposed by the South African government and passed by the South African Parliament to prohibit Indians in Natal and Transvaal from purchasing real estate. Labour MP Sloan claimed that Indians are still members of the British Empire, and he wanted to know whether Secretary Amery, having praised the high quality of Indian troops fighting, had therefore made any representations to the South African government on this matter. Labour MP Sorensen also raised this matter, and Labour MP Ammon joined the protest, saying, "I have just received a protest telegram from the Natal Indian Association, which may be what the Minister wants to know." When the MPs shouted "Answer!" Amery only said that the matter had been discussed by the Indian government and the South African government. At this point, MP Sloan stood up and declared that since Secretary Amery could not provide a satisfactory answer, he would raise the matter again at an appropriate time after the parliamentary recess.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) - The South African Federal Parliament is currently deliberating a bill prohibiting Indians in the two states of Transvaal and Natal from purchasing land. This has a major impact on India, which is currently undergoing a fierce anti-British movement. The President of the All-India Muslim League, Jinnah, has stated that if the South African Federal Parliament passes the bill, the relationship between India and the South African Federation will be seriously affected. The National Congress Party has an even stronger attitude, fiercely attacking the South African Federal Government, saying that Indian troops are currently fighting the Axis forces on the Tunisian front to protect the safety of the people of the South African Federation. However, the Federal Government has presented this bill to Parliament to exclude Indians. This type of law clearly has a racial discrimination character. Furthermore, a special telegram from "The Times" on the 17th reported on Indian disturbances related to the bill, stating that India is extremely concerned about the progress of the South African Federal Parliament's deliberation of the land bill, and all levels of Indian people have expressed opposition to the South African Federation. The general public in South Africa has already strongly criticized Indians, and even without this law, it is almost impossible for Indians to buy land in South Africa. Therefore, Indians believe that the introduction of this bill is not based on economic reasons as claimed by the South African authorities but is clearly based on racial discrimination.

### Establishing a Unified War and Production Posture (I) Striving to Increase Production and Seize the Initiative in the War

Speech by Director of the Military Affairs Bureau, Sato

Starting at 9:00 AM on April 14th, at the Second Army Technical Research Conference held at the Ministry of the Army, Major General Sato Kenryo, Director of the Military Affairs Bureau of the Ministry of the Army, gave a speech to the 1,300 Army technical personnel in attendance, calling for the rise of scientists and engineers. The tasks undertaken by science and technology in the process of carrying out the war in the future are summarized in the following three points: (1) a leap in production, (2) an improvement and leap in war materials, and (3) the completion of measures that can fatally wound the United States and Britain. The following is the full text of the speech:

Up to today, Japan's operations have focused on speed, adopting an absolute offensive to build the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and consolidate the foothold for the decisive battle against the United States and Britain. In wars between all strong countries, if one side continues its offensive, it will eventually use all its strength to carry out its offensive at any time. On the other hand, the other party is forced to retreat, supplement and restore its combat power near its base of operations. Thus, the location of offense and defense changes from time to time. After each offensive and defensive battle, the location of the war changes once. This is the convention in war. Historical records prove this without fail. Even on the Egyptian front, we can witness this reality.

Although Japan has continued to adopt an unparalleled and rapid offensive on the vast continent and ocean of thousands of kilometers, the offensive and defensive situation has not changed to this day. We still maintain the offensive without ever falling into the defensive. Strategically, the whole world is amazed by this. However, recently, the enemy seems to have taken a stand before our pursuit. In the future, we must continue to advance. Therefore, in order to firmly grasp the initiative in the war, in addition to issues such as mental strength and military tactics, the key to victory or defeat lies in the issue of production capacity. Of course, the absolute amount of production capacity of the enemy and ourselves is greater on the enemy's side. However, as Prime Minister Tojo said in his policy speech: Since the start of the war, Japan has ensured the offensive, using the great value of strategic strongholds to increase our production capacity and quickly improve this production capacity so that it can counter the enemy's production capacity. This is an absolute task that will determine the future of the war.

Japan's original military resources have never been self-sufficient. Therefore, the development and construction of newly occupied areas are, needless to say, extremely important for future production. That is, ensuring and strengthening the current production posture of China, Manchuria, and the southern regions is the lifeblood of Japan's future production. However, this production posture must be consistent with the strategic posture of the decisive battle foundation of the Greater East Asia War. In other words, if the current strategic posture is unfavorable, it will inevitably destroy the production posture. Conversely, if the production posture is not solid, it will also hinder the strategic posture. In short, ensuring the unity of this war and production posture is an absolute issue in Japan's war guidance in the future.

There are two enemies who disrupt the unity of this war and production posture: one is aircraft, and the other is submarines. Today, aircraft have great power in combat. Especially in the ocean, aircraft can be said to be the throne of combat. This is evident from the past combat experience. Especially in the South Pacific, our traditional idea was that the battle on land was the army, and the battle at sea was the navy. The idea of separate operations by the army and navy must now be completely changed.

On the continent, the power of aircraft cannot be regarded as absolute. Therefore, there is no major change from the previous combat state. At sea, both sides set up air bases on the scattered islands, regarding this air base network as the backbone of the combat organization, and using it as the center to exert the integrated combat power of the army, navy, and air force. The increased combat power of aircraft has created a situation where the air base network is the backbone of the combat organization. He who has no air supremacy has no sea supremacy. How true are these words!

Therefore, at the beginning of the battle, the army and navy must first jointly capture the islands in the ocean and set them up as air bases, build solid defensive fortifications to defend them, and use them as supply bases. Air combat is the main role in the battle, and the battle of warships and the battle of land soldiers are carried out in parallel with air combat. Here, if there is a significant advantage or disadvantage in the air force between the enemy and ourselves, then the superior party uses its surplus power to destroy the other party's rear maritime transportation.

Therefore, the situation of the battle changes to a war between aircraft occupying the throne in battle and transport ships that are weak and powerless in battle. As a result, in addition to causing difficulties in the supply of the front-line troops, it also hinders the production posture due to the loss of shipping capacity.

Submarines are naturally also a major enemy of transport ships. The United States and Britain are constantly complaining about the Axis submarines. Although the power of aircraft has not yet occupied the absolute throne in land battles, China is often regarded as the enemy's air base, used to bomb our mainland and destroy maritime transportation. We take preemptive action to destroy them and strictly defend the mainland's air. These measures are important issues in ensuring our production posture.

From this point of view, in order to establish the two postures of war and production, the increased production of aircraft, which occupy the throne in battle, is an absolute necessity. If air combat power is superior, in addition to obtaining air supremacy and other strategic advantages, it can also use its surplus power to bypass the enemy's rear and destroy its transport ships,打击其給養與生產力. If air combat power is in an inferior position, then the above-mentioned situations are exactly the opposite.

The shipbuilding problem is the second most important problem in production expansion after aircraft. There must be mass production in shipbuilding, and in order to deal with aircraft and submarines, especially in order to replenish supplies from enemy aircraft attacks to the front line, in addition to increasing shipping capacity, there must be special research. Therefore, our country's increased production is first aircraft (the main weapons of the army and navy are of course included and are not an exception here); second is ships, followed by aluminum, iron, and coal, which are related to the increase in other military production. The wartime special case law for control of the air in the previous period also specifically proposed these five major industries.

Since last year, the government, led by the Prime Minister, has discussed all policies, and all political and administrative power has been concentrated on the point of production expansion. The officials and people also understand the government's intentions and work together to produce, and the effect has exceeded expectations.

In this year, the mass production of shipbuilding is gradually on track, and methods such as building wooden ships and salvaging sunken ships are actively carried out. Therefore, although the damage to ships is more intense than last year, the increase in ships can be expected in the near future. Similarly, aircraft, aluminum, iron, and coal have all achieved great success due to the consistent efforts of officials and people. This situation can of course be maintained in this year, and we hope to strengthen it even more.

We must pay attention to the characteristics of our country's production posture, which is the combination of the southern regions and China, Manchuria, and the Japanese mainland. That is, the key to production depends on maritime transportation capacity. The saving of shipping capacity must be limited to the increase in food products such as rice, other military-related products, and daily necessities for the people. In this way, we can free up shipping capacity to increase the production of the five major industries and other important industries, and we can increase combat power and strengthen the strategic posture and production posture. The people who are engaged in the production of military-related products and daily necessities, that is, the soldiers in the production camp, as well as other people who are not in this camp, and even in the family, should not only save gas, electricity, and coal, but also save everything as much as possible. Therefore, saving production resources and the shipping capacity for transporting these resources is also a part of production increase.

Since the autumn of last year, thanks to the consistent efforts of the government, officials, and people, the effect has been great and gratifying. And this long-term war of attrition, which is one of the characteristics of this war, can therefore be competent.

In the past, after each war, weapons underwent a degree of improvement and innovation. Before this war, general weapons, based on the previous European War as a standard, can be roughly divided into three types: pre-war type, war type, and post-war type. The changes in weapons in this war are very different from the past. It can be said that they are changing with each passing day. Now, let's take an example to see how the progress of weapons in this war affects the situation of the war.

In the North African war last summer, the Italian army conquered Tobruk overnight and drove straight into Egypt, with Alexandria in sight. The great success of this campaign was due to the Italian army's invention of weapons for warfare and the new improvement of the air-conditioning equipment of the tanks. The unexpected power of the Soviet army's attacks this winter was mainly due to the preparation of the Soviet army's tanks and anti-tank weapons, and the thorough training in the use of these mechanized units. Recently, a kind of machine uses ultra-short waves to predict the approach of enemy submarines and aircraft. Because it restricts the range of submarine activities, the approach of aircraft can be predicted hundreds of kilometers in advance, so the way to avoid its surprise attack has also improved. This kind of alarm can now even calculate the direction and distance of the aircraft and is connected to the anti-aircraft guns. It can shoot at the aircraft without seeing it, regardless of fog, clouds, or at night.

### Health Authorities Set Vaccination Procedures, Infants, Pregnant Women, and Patients Can Be Exempted, The Number of Daily Injections Must Be Reported

The free vaccinations by health bureaus in various districts have been underway for several days, and citizens from all walks of life have been very enthusiastic in applying for vaccinations. The health authorities have now strictly established detailed rules for various points of vaccination, which are as follows: (1) Due to the extraordinary times and the lack of materials, it is hoped that all materials and supplies will not be wasted to save resources. (2) It is hoped that the vaccine bottles and rubber tubes will be handled with care to avoid damage. Please return them after use. (3) When extracting the vaccine from the bottle, first shake the bottle thoroughly to disperse the cloud-like clumps into a uniform vaccine.

### Route 20 Trolleybus – Adjustment of Bus Stops – Terminates at Zhaofeng Village Station – Terminus Moved to New Village Entrance

Since the Shanghai Public Concession Tramway Company implemented express bus service on the first of this month, the efficiency of tram operation has been improved. It is learned that the tram company authorities have recently adjusted some bus stops. As of yesterday, the Zhaofeng Village stop of the Route 20 trolleybus has been completely abolished. (The tram company designated it as an express bus stop on April 1st, meaning trams would still stop there daily from 10:00 AM to 5:00 PM). It is also learned that the Yan'an Road stop of the Route 20 trolleybus has also been moved from the entrance of Zhaofeng Park to diagonally opposite the Nuit de Paris Café (New Village Entrance) on Yuyuan Road. However, its starting point remains at the entrance of Zhaofeng Park. The reason the tram company has designated two different locations for the terminus and starting point of the tram stop is to avoid excessive crowding when passengers board and alight.

### Anti-British and American Association Reorganized – Taken Over and Managed by the Ministry of Social Welfare – National Government Values Past Work

The Chinese National Anti-British and American Association in this city was established in the spring of last year. For a year, it has spared no effort in carrying out anti-British and American propaganda and public welfare work. It has been learned that the association will be reorganized in the near future. A reporter made a special visit to the person in charge of the association yesterday. According to the representative, the organization is purely a non-governmental group. For the past year, it has engaged in the anti-British and American movement from this position, and, thanks to the support of various parties, it has fortunately achieved a certain scale. Now that the National Government has clearly declared war on Britain and the United States, the association's anti-British and American stance has evolved from a popular movement into national policy. The association’s colleagues should henceforth fulfill this national policy as citizens. Therefore, a petition was submitted to the Central Ministry of Social Welfare to incorporate the work of the association into the government structure to unify authority. Minister Ding approved the request and dispatched Vice Minister Jian Jianwu to take over the association. Jian has arrived in Shanghai to handle the takeover. The association’s executives and staff believe that the anti-British and American enlightenment movement has come to an end, and they are grateful for the central government's recognition of the association’s past work and the responsibilities entrusted to them. Therefore, Secretary Wang Boyong, Director of Public Relations Li Guohua, Director of Organization Xia Huanxin, Director of Propaganda Liu Hanru, and Chief of General Affairs Yang Zhengzhi jointly petitioned the Ministry of Social Affairs to resign from their respective concurrent positions, so that they can each engage in anti-British and American work in their respective capacities. This has been approved, for which they are deeply grateful. Therefore, the association's current organization will be reorganized by the end of this month. From May 1st onwards, Vice Minister Jian will be in charge of everything. Although colleagues will formally leave the association, they pledge to adhere to their original aspirations regarding the overall national policy of anti-British and Americanism, earnestly implementing it in their respective positions until the complete eradication of British and American forces and the full achievement of the goals of the Greater East Asia War. Finally, the person in charge of the association also stated that the association's liaison officer, Mr. Toshisuke Yoshida, will also cease his liaison work from May 1st.

### Stamp Duty Rates on Pawn Tickets

The Shanghai Pawnshop Guild has issued a notice to all member firms stating that in the past, due to a lack of understanding of the stamp duty law, the stamp duty rates affixed to pawn tickets have been inconsistent, often resulting in unwarranted fines. The guild has now thoroughly investigated the stamp duty law and determined that pawn tickets should be affixed with stamps as stipulated in Item 19 of the tax rate table under the heading of loan or mortgage documents. That is, a stamp duty of 4 cents is affixed per 100 yuan, and any amount less than 100 yuan is also counted as 100 yuan (amounts less than 10 yuan are exempt from stamping). For example, 4 cents are affixed for amounts from 10 yuan up to 100 yuan, 8 cents are affixed for amounts from 100 yuan and above up to 200 yuan, and 12 cents are affixed for amounts from 200 yuan and above up to 300 yuan, and so on. All firms should comply to avoid penalties.

### Hongqiao Racecourse – Equestrian Competition – Divided into Elementary and Advanced Levels

The club has a total of 72 horses of various sizes, available for use by 67 male and female riders. It is said that riding enthusiasts have created a square, divided into several levels, to allow horses and riders of different levels to practice riding at designated times. For the sake of order and uniformity, the competition will be divided into elementary and advanced levels, based on the height of the obstacles to be jumped during riding. The difference in height between the two levels is 10 centimeters, which will be determined by the training supervisor after careful consideration of the usual training results. The competition will begin at 2:30 PM and end around 6:20 PM. The racecourse and jumping track are separated from the audience to avoid danger. However, to prevent any accidents, children under the age of six are prohibited. Furthermore, the audience should remain silent during the jumping events. Therefore, sensitive dogs should also not be brought to avoid causing disturbance. The location also features the Chanson Garden, with lush green grass and a riot of colors, making it a perfect embellishment for the grand occasion. Attending audience members can both broaden their horizons and escape the hustle and bustle of the city. Tickets are priced at 20 yuan per ticket, and student tickets are 10 yuan. They can be purchased from Mr. Platner at Siemens & Co., No. 233 Nanjing Road, or Ms. Hank, No. 261 Sichuan Road.

### Discussion on the Application of the "Protecting Wealth" Method (2)

The original meaning of the "Protecting Wealth" method has been explained in detail by Elder Layman Nie Yuntai, referring to the theory of waxing and waning of the natural order and the principle of cause and effect in Buddhism. The Nie family history has the beautiful story of "Mount Heng showing its spirit, Nanhai extending its blessings, celebrating the 70th birthday, and the seven sons becoming famous", which is a reward for "Mr. Yue Shan's medical assistance and charity". As the Great Learning says, "The benevolent develop themselves with wealth, while the unkind develop wealth with themselves." Doing good deeds and accumulating virtue can be a model for colleagues in the medical field.

No one can avoid the suffering of birth, old age, sickness, and death, and medicine is related to nourishing life, preventing aging, treating diseases, and saving lives. Therefore, it is necessary to deal with everything with benevolence and kindness. Those who practiced medicine in ancient times said, "No one sees the preparation, but Heaven knows the intention." They helped people according to fate, and offered medicine on the first and fifteenth of the lunar month. Even today, traditional Chinese medicine stores still offer special treatment on those days, which is a remnant of the past. As for wanting to be like Han Kang, selling medicine in the Chang'an market for more than thirty years without changing the price, it is no longer possible.

There is no other way to protect wealth: "Great wealth is determined by Heaven, small wealth is determined by man." Wealth made by man is selfish, while natural wealth is public. Material wealth is only flaunted at the time, while spiritual wealth can leave a lasting legacy. Therefore, morality and writing, merit and career, are all related to gold, jade, jewelry, fields, and houses. Today, those engaged in mental labor, such as teachers and honest officials, may have read thousands of books but cannot afford a few liters of rice or a few feet of cloth, and their poverty can be imagined. However, Yan Hui ate only a basket of rice and drank only a ladle of water, which others could not bear, but Confucius praised his virtue. Everyone has their own aspirations, and they enjoy spiritual happiness and do not want to possess material wealth. The learning of Laozi in our country is "non-action and guarding truth", and the Buddha's teaching is "observing emptiness and wonderful existence", not coveting man-made wealth but wanting to protect natural wealth.

Scientific methods are nothing more than following the principles of nature and exhausting human efforts to create all kinds of wealth. For example, Edison invented the light bulb, Watt invented the steam engine, and Stephenson invented the train, which increased the wealth of the world immeasurably. However, the application of scientific methods to various enterprises, such as the organization of cooperatives, where "everyone is for me, and I am for everyone", can alleviate the difficulties of public life. Or, such as the joint operation of insurance companies, "preventing losses through statistics and sharing risks through mutual assistance", can protect against all kinds of unexpected disasters. All of these have the meaning of protecting wealth.

Science is extremely broad and all-encompassing. The so-called natural science studies all things, and the so-called mental science studies all principles and thoughts. The universe and all its contents can be analyzed to the simplest form, with idealism and materialism. Materialism advocates equality, but there is still struggle. Idealism advocates peace, and only then can there be great unity. Therefore, the Eastern spirit of morality can protect wealth for a long time compared to the various sciences of the West. The drawbacks of Western material civilization emphasize private interests, only knowing how to plunder and compete with each other. As the ancients said, "If the heart is not benevolent, then parents and brothers can become foreign countries; if the heart is benevolent, then all things can be regarded as one body." Everyone seeking private wealth will create thorns on the smooth road, and all kinds of suffering will come together; everyone seeking public wealth will turn swords into ploughshares, and there will be endless happiness. It is especially hoped that the wise authorities will promote the spirit of the ancient sages. The Great Learning says, "If one family is benevolent, the whole country will be benevolent; if one family is yielding, the whole country will be yielding; if one person is greedy for profit, the whole country will be in chaos." Therefore, if everyone is greedy for private wealth, then great chaos will never cease.

Poverty and illness are the most tragic things in the world. We must first seek to make the people of the world not poor and not sick, and then our own wealth can be protected. Moreover, wealth is not a solitary, fixed, and static thing, but a constantly changing and fluid thing that is integrated into society. If the heart is enslaved, then one becomes a slave to wealth. If I can give wealth, then I am the master of wealth. Using social wealth for society is wisdom, and the use of the "Protecting Wealth" method should still be premised on the welfare of the people.

### Economic Circles – Commentary – Continued Thorough Investigation of Hoarding

According to a statement made to the Central News Agency yesterday by a person in charge of the Ministry of Finance: "...for the unfinished matters of the thorough investigation of financial institutions, if it is found that there are illegal speculation and hoarding, they will still be severely punished, so as to make the hoarders restrain themselves and the prices tend to be stable..." Indeed, this statement of making the hoarders restrain themselves can be said to be firm enough.

Since the government authorities realized that the soaring prices in Shanghai were purely due to speculation and hoarding, they took the action of jointly conducting a thorough investigation. Given the saying "the past can be pursued", whether the results of the past thorough investigation are satisfactory is for public opinion to decide, so I will not go into details. What we are now eagerly awaiting is to see the effectiveness of the continued thorough investigation of hoarding.

The most effective ways to eradicate speculation and hoarding are: (1) crack down on lending, (2) freeze warehouses, (3) thoroughly investigate stores. From the first point of view, since the authorities conducted a thorough investigation of financial institutions, the only somewhat satisfactory result was that various banks and money shops refused to provide speculative loans and simultaneously reduced outstanding debts. As expected, the hoarders were greatly frightened and came out of their lairs one after another, and market prices gradually declined. From the second point of view, now that the authorities are investigating the situation of stockpiles in various warehouses, all goods in any warehouse should be prohibited from moving, and the owners of the goods and their past movements should be strictly investigated. If there is suspicion of hoarding, the owners should be brought to justice and the goods should be confiscated. From the third point of view, the recent refusal of stores to sell goods is indeed a proof of deliberate hoarding, and many retail hoarders also use stores as their outlet. It is said that the establishment of many new stores is not for retail sales, but for storing hoarded goods, because storing goods in a store does not seem to be illegal on the surface! However, the establishment of such stores is precisely a smokescreen for hoarding, and a thorough investigation should be carried out at the same time, and the public should be encouraged to report such activities.

During the period of continuing strict investigation of hoarding, we would like to specially raise these points, in the hope that the thorough investigation of hoarding must be thorough, and the most important thing is to prevent the possibility of "spring breeze blowing again".

### Food Department Announces Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales Management Zones and Supervisors; All Rice and Grain Merchants Must Join Local Joint Operations Cooperatives

In order to adapt to the wartime system, stabilize food supplies for the people, enrich military provisions, and prevent speculation, manipulation, hoarding, and profiteering, the Food Department, based on the Provisional Regulations for the Management of Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui, has formulated organizational charters for city and county Rice and Grain Joint Operations Cooperatives, as well as a table of Rice and Grain Transportation and Sales Management Zones.

### Grain Trade Associations All Begin Preparations

In order to effectively manage grain administration, the Ministry of Food stipulates that trade associations and their federations organized for commodities managed by industries and businesses shall be governed by the Ministry of Food at the central level, and by the Grain Bureau at the provincial level, and to strengthen the structure, the designated industries are reorganized and must be completed as soon as possible. It is learned that trade associations for flour, miscellaneous grains, animal products, eggs and sugar, edible oils, and other industries have begun active preparations.

Flour Trade Association

Flour Trade Association: The Ministry has appointed Sun Zhongli as the preparatory director for the Flour Trade Association, and active preparations have begun. All businesses engaged in flour and bran must join the association and register by the 26th of this month. The registration locations are Room 403, Zhongfu Building for the flour group, and Room 110, Zhonghui Building for the bran group.

Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association

Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association: The Ministry has designated Fu Qiangeng as the preparatory director for the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association, and preparations have also begun. All businesses in the miscellaneous grains industry, whether new or old members, must register with the preparatory office at the Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association (3rd floor). Once completed, it will be established. Mr. Fu also serves as the preparatory director for the Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui Miscellaneous Grains Trade Association Federation, and preparations have begun. The preparatory office is located at Room 615, Pudong Building. All regional miscellaneous grains trade associations in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Anhui, and the two special municipalities of Nanjing and Shanghai must participate uniformly in accordance with the regulations to complete and unify the structure.

Animal Products Company

All businesses engaged in cattle, sheep, pigs, chickens, ducks, including lard, etc., must register with the association by the 26th of this month, after which it will be considered an automatic waiver of rights.

### Banks and Financial Firms to Convene Internal Market Meeting Near End of April; Temporarily Suspend Credit Lending

For credit lending businesses, banks and financial firms in the city set the end of April and the end of October as comparison periods each year. Companies and firms in all industries and businesses that borrow credit from banks and financial firms must settle their accounts on the day of the comparison period. For credit users who are indeed using the funds for normal business operations, the banks and financial firms will renew the loans within the possible scope, but interest must be settled in full. It is learned that the comparison period at the end of April of this year is approaching, and banks and financial firms have long been preparing for dealings with various companies and businesses. The Money Trade Association has also scheduled an "internal market" meeting on the 25th of this month to determine deposit and loan interest rates. It is heard that during this period for handling the comparison period at the end of April, banks and financial firms will temporarily suspend credit lending, so the financial situation in the city has tightened recently.

### Deposit Reserve Funds for Banks and Financial Firms Limited to Be Paid Up by End of Month

Last year, according to the provisions of the "Provisional Measures for the Management of Financial Institutions" announced by the Ministry of Finance, the Central Reserve Bank instructed all banks and financial firms in the city to deposit reserve funds for term and demand deposits into the bank in accordance with the percentages stipulated by law (5% for term deposits and 10% for demand deposits). By the end of last year, the banks and financial firms had deposited the reserve funds for term deposits in full. However, due to various reasons, the banks and financial firms have not yet fully deposited the reserve funds for demand deposits. It is learned that after the Central Reserve Bank urged the payment of the outstanding reserve funds, they will be fully paid up by the end of this month (April), and it is also heard that when the banks and financial firms pay up the reserve funds, they will all pay in full in cash.

### Trade Associations for Ten Industries Limited to Be Established Within Month

In order to comply with the requirements of the wartime economic policy program and the various clauses of the Provisional Regulations on Trade Associations of Industry and Commerce, the Shanghai Special Municipal Economic Bureau will adjust and reorganize all old economic organizations that are not suitable for the wartime economic system. It first designated the initiators and conveners of trade associations for ten industries, including the cotton industry, and instructed them to prepare for organization and establishment within a limited time, and report to the authorities for approval. Except for the trade associations of the nine industries of cotton, yarn shops, cloth, coal shops, coal ball, firewood and medicine, industry, oils and fats, cigarettes, matches, soap and candles, and tobacco leaf sales, which have successively held initiator meetings, passed association charters, and scheduled to hold inaugural meetings before the end of this month, the trade association of knitted goods industry has now been ordered to be canceled, the organization has stopped, and the initiators have been redesignated to organize the cotton weaving factory industry trade association within a limited time.

### Translated Commentary: The Problem of Hoarding and the Responsibility of the National Government

The only way to eliminate the ills of hoarding and profiteering is to promote Shanghai's production activities and smooth the purchase and distribution of materials. In short, to seek to improve Shanghai's economic activities and make them transparent, the remedy is to investigate and deal with speculators who hoard and disrupt the economy. We hope that the lower-level institutions of the Commerce and Trade Commission will be deployed in an orderly manner and operated smoothly as soon as possible, which is also an effective means of achieving the above objectives. At the same time, regarding the crackdown on hoarding, we believe that the National Government still needs to fully reflect and make the greatest decisive decision before re-launching.

Last time, the National Government issued an order to thoroughly investigate hoarding, and the general public suffering from high prices cheered. The point that should be paid attention to now is to thoroughly eliminate it. Standing on the people's position, we have to make the following two points to the National Government: We hope that the National Government's crackdown on hoarding is not for factional struggles, and should be out of the purest and most selfless motives, in order to stabilize people's livelihoods and revive the economy, and to use sufficient courage and meticulous preparation to re-launch to solve this problem. At the same time, regarding the National Government's internal hoarding and profiteering incident that some people have called for, the National Government should take appropriate measures to investigate whether it is true. As everyone said, "One cannot be an official and a businessman, or a businessman and an official." In addition, it is also necessary to announce that the Reserve Bank has not deviated from the scope of legitimate business and lent hoarding funds, so as to dispel public doubts and leave no room for the people to instigate anti-government remarks. This is the political responsibility of the National Government to the people in times of national crisis.

### City Appearance

— Yale

Everything visible in a city can be called "city appearance." The quality of city appearance is extremely related to public perception and also affects morality. In this so-called cultural hub of Shanghai, under the public eye, the bizarre city appearance is truly a sight to behold. However, there are situations that hinder public perception and harm morality, which have "been around for a long time." But there is a tendency for people to "become more intense with each passing day," so it is no wonder that the local authorities are now rectifying the city appearance.

The work that the authorities have already started is repairing roads, clearing garbage, and cracking down on obscene advertisements and frivolous notices. The former not only "enhances the appearance," but also makes the roads smooth, making it safe to walk. Clearing garbage can avoid smoky and foul odors. As for the latter, it can not only maintain good morals, preventing citizens from being dazzled by the colorful and inexplicable notices on the walls, or even thinking about things they shouldn't, but also prevent waste of paper, which is a small help to legitimate cultural needs.

There is naturally a lot of work to be done in rectifying the city appearance; if only these two aspects can be done well, good results can be achieved, and at least the city appearance can be renewed. Other things, such as maintaining order on public vehicles and prohibiting spitting, although long noted by the authorities, require the cooperation of citizens to achieve good results. However, the problem of overcrowding on vehicles leading to disorder can also be said to be half due to the lack of transportation. And the continued popularity of spitting can also be said to be half due to the lack of knowledge and public spirit among citizens. The transition from lack to adequacy is a gradual process.

Since the city appearance is everything visible in a city, then the "appearance" of citizens can certainly be part of the city appearance. Therefore, I think that the people seen on the road are either "worried" or " haggard"; few have a "radiant face." This is probably due to a lack of "vitamins," and perhaps other reasons. But this is not the scope of this article.

If the rectification of the city appearance is done well, I think the faces of the citizens will soon be filled with joy.

### How to Eat Tofu?

— Wang Shuai

"Tofu has the price of meat" is true, but compared to the current price of meat, it is still much cheaper, so I say be content and eat tofu!

Speaking of tofu, it is a truly quintessential Chinese nutritious food. Its invention dates back more than two thousand years, and the inventor is the famous King of Huainan of the Han Dynasty, Liu An. With such a background, tofu is not a lowly thing.

Its raw material is soybeans. After soaking, grinding, filtering, boiling, and adding brine and gypsum, it is ready to solidify. This is really a scientific manufacturing process!

Unfortunately, tofu shop owners don't advertise (there have been soy milk advertisements). They should imitate the current advertising agencies and promote it as much as possible. I am afraid that the value of their promotional text is more vigorous than those who tell the truth to sell fake medicine. From the nutritional value, plant protein is not as good as animal protein, but the nutritional value of tofu may not be weaker than meat. Every 100 cubic centimeters contains 7 to 8.5 cubic centimeters of protein, 1 to 3.5 cubic centimeters of fat, and 1 to 2 cubic centimeters of carbohydrates, and all kinds of vitamins. Because gypsum is added, it has calcium. Children eat more, their teeth and bones can be healthy, and they can develop normally: pregnant women eat more, they can prevent the calcium in their teeth from being absorbed by the fetus to make bones and decay. Patients with rickets and tuberculosis eat more, they can gradually eliminate the symptoms and become normal. There is not much crude fiber, easy to digest, it is most suitable for patients after illness, children, gastrointestinal diseases, and patients after surgery. And there is no dead toxin. It is a non-nucleoprotein, unlike nucleoproteins that can stimulate the kidneys and liver, so people with kidney disease, heart disease, and edema are best to obtain protein from tofu.

The same family of tofu also includes soy milk, dried tofu, tofu skin, fried tofu and stinky tofu, etc., whose functions are roughly the same.

In terms of culinary arts, there are many varieties. To give a few obvious examples, tofu with Shandong green onion is fragrant and can strengthen the lungs. Tofu with yellow croaker is seafood and can be considered meat. It can be used to make hot and sour soup with tomatoes and pickled mustard greens, which is good for appetizing. Like this, you can turn over more, so as to avoid the "disgust" of eating the same dish for a long time.

### Independent Spirit

— Mengling

Opening the window, a piece of tender green faces the sun, a small bird chases and skims over the crows that are building nests. It is already spring.

But although spring is in full swing, we are not just singing a few songs to welcome spring, and taking a few steps of green, and then think "spring is ours." That is the way of the small bird. We should learn from the crows, to have an "independent spirit, to use our own strength to build our own nests."

That's right, youth is the time in life with the most "vitality" and "vigor." It is when young people often misunderstand that by relying on temporary emotions and doing unintentional things, they can be considered to have "vitality" and vigor.

The most lacking thing for young people in the workplace is the ability to be "automatic." They all raise their heads and put their hands in their sleeves, and everything needs others to do the puppet work. They move only when pulled, and don't move without being pulled, evading responsibility and being perfunctory. They talk about having great ambitions, but great ambitions must start from small things to achieve the goal!

As for the young people in the family? On the one hand, it is due to the doting of the parents, who arrange everything for them, thinking that the children have no automatic ability, and it is better to do it for them than to teach them to do it slowly. But they don't know that this automatic ability will not grow without cultivation. On the other hand, it must also be attributed to their own laziness. They must understand that their parents will not follow them for life and do things for them.

What about the young students? That automatic spirit also seems to have followed the social unrest and corruption, and has declined together. The teacher stands, the students sit, the teacher turns a page of the book, and the student also turns the page. The book is due tomorrow, so we'll talk about it tomorrow. As for cleaning the classroom and tidying up the dormitory, there are school workers, ringing the bell to eat, ringing the bell to sleep, beautifully called "regular life?"... Decades of education have created a standard lazy thing (but there are also diligent ones).

But how can we develop an independent spirit? As long as we can understand the relationship between this independent spirit and the achievement of a lifetime. We must train, starting from small things in daily life, to find things to do, and with things to do, we should have the ability to arrange plans, and we must review them at any time, be responsible, and humbly accept well-intentioned corrections. These points are the most basic independent training for students and professional young people. Otherwise, even if you are determined to be independent, it is useless.

Is spring ours? Dear friends, I will tell you a piece of news, that nest has been built by the crows yesterday with small branches that they have held in their mouths one by one.

### "Humor" and "Satire"

— Meng Lin

Humor is an important key to the "art of living." A person with reason and cultivation usually has the skills of humor. If used properly, it can often allow us to obtain satisfactory results when solving various problems in personnel matters.

When humor comes, it is not only the most intelligent moment, but also the most pleasant moment; it is also the most "genuine" moment. Not only will the person who is humorous show naked emotions, but also the person who accepts his humor will immediately show his true feelings. If a few people are sitting there depressed, they especially hope that a humorous person will go to warm up the situation. Humor is also the most effective tool to eliminate tension, small-mindedness, and great anger.

If a person is rich in humorous personality, it can make all the pride, sorrow, and resentment that often bother him not approach, and make himself feel relaxed and comfortable.

Carlton once said, "I often feel that humor is like the oxygen in the air we breathe, it creates and maintains human laughter. It can certainly create other more important things, but laughter comes first."

As for why we want to "laugh," there is no need to explain it. What people need is a happy life. With a happy mind, we can start to create a career.

But although "humor" is good, if it is too sharp, it becomes "satire." If "satire" is used well, on the one hand, it can make yourself win, and on the other hand, it can also make others strive for progress because of your "satire" to avenge this shame. But I think satire is a great enemy of "friendship." It can never increase friendship, which seems to be fundamentally contrary to the original intention of "humor."

Therefore, it is better to turn humor into encouragement and be a true art of living than to turn humor into satire. Use sincere humor to encourage your friends, so that good advice is not unpleasant to the ear. Use open humor to handle things, so that reason can be clear, and when you hit a wall, you can turn out a new path to achieve the goal.

In order to have true humor, satire should be despised.

### Upward · Drill

— Xiao Lin

Everyone has a strong enterprising spirit and wants to achieve further achievements than now: Originally, people's hopes are endless. Schopenhauer has these few sentences in his essay on the world's troubles: "...Why are people such insatiable animals? Every desire is satisfied, and the seeds of new desires are planted. Therefore, the desires of all individuals are almost endless..."

With these continuously generated hopes, of course, we must work hard to achieve them, so there are two ways to satisfy the enterprising spirit, namely, "upward" and "drill."

The so-called "upward" is a completely relying on one's own strength, hard work, for the sake of lofty ideals, so usually try to cultivate themselves, spur themselves on, and seriously live a meticulous life... Of course, where there is a will, there is a way. One day, they will be appreciated, praised, and respected and get the success they deserve and realize the hope they deserve.

As for "drill", it is completely different. Like a pointed eel, drilling everywhere, as long as there is an opportunity, they will try to be opportunistic, flatter, seek a way out, take advantage of every opportunity, and drill every hole. They will do everything possible to please their superiors, and speak human words to humans and ghost words to ghosts. Once they get ahead, they will swagger around, and as for what colleagues and friends, they have long been thrown out of their minds... This kind of person is too common.

Drilling is ultimately an extremely despicable and shameful behavior. Some people with "popularity" certainly disdain to do it. Of course, true success depends on true knowledge. How can the bright road be compared with drilling!

### Reality

— Zongwen

The past is not worth recalling, and the future is not worth predicting. That is to say, reality is immortal, and only the present moment is the most worthy of cherishing. Living for a day means working hard for a day and striving for a day. Only by grasping reality can life have meaning and value.

### The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children Carries Out Various Important Works

— Huang Jingwan

The General Association for the Relief of Women and Children of China was founded in the third year of Xuantong, specializing in rescuing lost and abducted women and children. It built a shelter near the Jiangwan Railway Station. During the January 28th Incident, the shelter was destroyed, and it moved to Renyi Shanhui at No. 92 Xinqiao Street in the French Concession. According to the report by Mr. Xu Qianlin, Li Sihao, Zhao Jinqing, Qu Ziliang, and other responsible persons, the important works of the Association are as follows:

(1) "Detection": The Association employs honest and reliable detectives who secretly go to ports and railway stations to rescue abducted women and children.

(2) "Announcement of Foundlings": When abducted women and children and abandoned children are brought to the Association, advertisements are placed to find their families. Their families only need to provide a reliable guarantor to claim them, without any charges.

(3) "Repatriation": For abducted women and children who can provide detailed addresses, the Association will send them back to their hometowns at its own expense, without any charges.

(4) "Custody": Abducted women and children who have no family to claim them or cannot be sent back to their hometowns will be cared for and educated by the Association as if they were their own.

(5) "Vocational Training": When women and children in custody reach a certain age, the Association introduces them to designated factories or businesses for vocational training, so that they can become self-reliant.

(6) "Adoption and Matching": Those who lack heirs or wish to marry can apply to the Association, providing a reliable guarantor and following the adoption and matching regulations carefully.

The Association has been established for more than thirty years, rescuing more than 12,000 women and children. Apart from those who have been successively sent back, claimed, adopted, matched, and trained, there are currently more than 150 people in the three shelters (Children's Shelter, Boys' Shelter, and Girls' Shelter), many of whom are sent by the police stations of the two concessions. Currently, the cost of living is at least 90,000 yuan. In this time of high prices, there is not enough clothing, and not enough food to eat, and they are in extremely difficult circumstances. The Association lacks funds and has no permanent property. The required expenses depend entirely on donations. Now, we appeal on their behalf, earnestly requesting philanthropists from all walks of life to sympathize with the orphans and the poor, for there is no better accumulation of wealth than the accumulation of virtue. Generously donate, and jointly support this good cause, so that these hundreds of helpless women and children can survive. The merit is immeasurable. (General Association: No. 92 Dongxinqiao Street, French Concession, Telephone 40955; Girls' Shelter: No. 979 North Chengdu Road; Donation Collection Points: China Bank (Beijing Road), Tongrun Qianzhuang (Tianjin Road), China General Chamber of Commerce Bank (No. 7 Huangpu Bund).

Assisting with the Aftermath of Poor Woman Gao Ruan's Death: Colleagues from the Dehua Bank wrote: "Having read in your newspaper about Gao Ruan's revival and subsequent death, we feel deeply saddened and regret that we could not help sooner, and we feel uneasy. For the sake of the woman's funeral arrangements, we are sending the previously collected sum of 205 yuan in Central Reserve Certificates in advance." Also, dentist Qin Jinkun contributed 200 yuan for the funeral expenses. The above donations, totaling 405 yuan, have been personally delivered by our office to Mr. Gao Weiren, the woman's husband, with our thanks.

(Note) The deceased is gone. Our office will no longer collect donations for Gao Ruan. Those in the city who are happy to do good deeds are requested to donate generously to our poverty relief fund.

Lost and Found (1) A photographic tripod. If the owner can describe the brand, it can be claimed at the basement of the Great New Company. (2) A bunch of keys was found at the tram stop at the intersection of Seymour Road. The owner should contact Lu Jinlin, a senior student at Jueyuan Yuyuan Yuhang Middle School, to claim them. (3) A bicycle license, French 7035, English 12577, was found. The owner should go to Mr. 　at No. 57 Bisun Road, Shanghai Telephone Company, to claim it.

Selling Flowers to Help the Poor: Mr. Kong Zhiqing, a potted plant enthusiast, will hold a bonsai exhibition at No. 165 Haige Road on the 25th of this month, donating one-tenth of the proceeds to this newspaper's small loan fund.
