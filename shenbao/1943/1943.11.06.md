### Greater East Asia Conference

The Greater East Asia Conference, which has attracted worldwide attention, began yesterday in Tokyo. News of this grand gathering was never revealed beforehand, which shows the calm and prudent attitude of the authorities of various countries, preparing to sincerely interact with each other, lay bare their beliefs, and earnestly discuss common goals and common problems. This is completely different in terms of sound and color from the so-called "Big Three Anglo-American-Soviet Conference" that had been clamoring for a long time, but ended in failure and was changed to a meeting of the foreign ministers of the three countries. Moreover, the "Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference" had just concluded amidst the Anglo-American cunning and the contradictions of sleeping in the same bed but dreaming different dreams. The Great East Asia Conference, where we Asians are united as one, immediately opened its curtain. If it is said that the Great East Asia Conference was held to answer them, then overestimating them would be an inappropriate analogy. We can say that the Great East Asia Conference is a sincere discussion to complete common goals in an atmosphere of unity, using facts to shatter the deceit of the British and Americans. Therefore, the Greater East Asia Conference and the Three-Nation Foreign Ministers Conference are also completely different in terms of outcome.

This Greater East Asia Conference includes representatives from six independent countries—China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, Burma, and the Philippines—and seven entities, including the Provisional Government of India. All are administrative heads who bear actual responsibility in their respective countries, making it an unprecedentedly important conference in history.

Since the allied nation of Japan advocated the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, it has not hesitated to fight against Britain and the United States, because the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States in East Asia are the biggest obstacles to the construction of a new order in East Asia, and they must be completely eradicated first. In the past two years, the forces of Britain and the United States have gradually been destroyed, and they have further assisted Burma and the Philippines in achieving independent nation-building, and the Provisional Government of India has been established, allowing the East Asian nations to completely break away from the aggressive shackles of Britain, the United States, and the Netherlands, and to liberate themselves. Furthermore, with Japan as the center, an allied front of various countries has been formed.

Thanks to the leadership and struggle of the allied nation of Japan, the ideal of Asia for Asians has now been fully realized. Therefore, the external form of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere has in fact reached the highest ideal state. We believe that the direction of future efforts should not be how to form the outer shape of the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but how to consolidate the inner quality of the Co-Prosperity Sphere. The main topic of this conference should also be this.

The formation of the outer shape of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is by no means easy. The allied nation of Japan has led the arduous task and devoted itself to it, which is especially evident to the people of East Asia. However, the consolidation of the inner quality of the Co-Prosperity Sphere is ten times more difficult and complex than the formation of the outer shape. If the inner quality is not consolidated, then the outer shape is particularly fragile. The preservation of the outer shape depends on the consolidation of the inner quality. How to consolidate the inner quality cannot be borne by Japan's independent strength alone. Each country has its own responsibilities. First, each country in the Co-Prosperity Sphere should stand on an equal footing of obligation and contribute its strength to consolidate the Co-Prosperity Sphere, but this is by no means a formal distribution, but an actual burden. Therefore, the strength of each country should be developed evenly, so that there is true and substantial cooperation. Second, each country should openly and frankly reveal its own weaknesses, and jointly discuss how to cooperate and strengthen them. Strengthening the strength of each country is strengthening the strength of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere.

In our editorial on May 1 this year, we put forward the "Expectation of the Pacific Charter." In order to build a new order in East Asia, in order to complete the independence and liberation of the countries and nations of the Pacific, unite and strive for the victory of the Greater East Asia War, and achieve this goal, we urgently need a glorious banner—the Pacific Charter—to mobilize every East Asian to work hard. Secondly, after winning the victory, we need a fundamental law suitable for common requirements and common ideals—the Pacific Charter—to serve as a work guide for realizing the new order of Greater East Asia. This Greater East Asia Conference is undoubtedly the time to decide on the Pacific Charter.

In order to win the victory in the Greater East Asia War and in order to complete the construction of the new order in East Asia, we respectfully wish the Greater East Asia Conference a smooth and complete success!

### Meeting of the Greater East Asian Nations Grandly Held in Tokyo Awaiting the Swift Completion of the Great Undertaking of Reviving East Asia

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. After the establishment of the Provisional Government of Free India and the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese alliance, the six countries of China, Japan, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines have made great progress in liberating Asia and reviving East Asia. At the same time, the political machinery of the new order of Greater East Asia has also been completed. In order to quickly achieve this common goal, it is necessary for the countries to unite as one at this time, and to specifically declare to the world the ideals of Asia and the beliefs of Greater East Asia. Therefore, the government representatives of the six countries of China, Japan, Manchukuo, Thailand, the Philippines, and Burma have decided to hold the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo recently. At that time, Kuntala Bose, Chairman of the Provisional Government of Free India, will also attend. Regarding this matter, the Japanese Information Bureau announced at 2:00 p.m. on the 4th as follows: The countries of Greater East Asia have stood on the solid foundation of compassion, friendship, mutual assistance and cooperation, and are jointly fighting for the completion of the common goal. For the sake of sincere consultation on the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia, it was decided to send representatives to hold the Greater East Asia Conference in Tokyo. In addition, the representative of the Provisional Government of Free India will also attend the meeting due to his public duties in Tokyo.

### Japanese Prime Minister Tojo Elected Chairman The Atmosphere of the Meeting Tense and Enthusiastic

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The Greater East Asia Conference has been solemnly held at the conference site here from today. Representatives of the six independent countries of China, Japan, Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma, and the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, gathered together, representing the general will of the billion people of Greater East Asia, and launched an unprecedented grand event in history. Inside the venue hung the national flags of various countries. All forty-six representatives and attendees from various countries arrived on time. The meeting started at 10:00 a.m. First, Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo delivered the opening speech, and then the election of the chairman was held. Prince Wan Waithayakon of Thailand proposed that Prime Minister Tojo, the representative of Japan, be elected as the chairman. As a result, the motion was unanimously passed. Then Chairman Tojo took the chair in the center, with Wang Jingwei, the President of the Executive Yuan of the National Government of our country, on his right, Zhang Jinghui, the Prime Minister of Manchukuo, and Ba Maw, the Prime Minister of Burma, on his left. On the left were Prince Wan Waithayakon, Advisor to the Prime Minister of Thailand, Laurel, the President of the Republic of the Philippines, and Kuntala Bose, the Chairman of the Provisional Government of India, all sitting side by side or facing each other. In addition, the attendees from various countries took their seats in the designated seats behind the representatives of their respective countries, and then entered the conference stage, sincerely stating their opinions on the fundamental strategy of completing the Greater East Asia War and building Greater East Asia, but only the representatives of each country were allowed to speak first. They spoke in order according to the assigned numbers of each country. In the morning, Japanese Imperial representative Prime Minister Tojo and Chinese representative President Wang of the Executive Yuan spoke successively. After a short break at noon, they had lunch together. The meeting resumed at 1:00 p.m., and then the representatives of Thailand, Manchukuo, the Philippines, and Burma spoke in order. The representatives of various countries listened attentively to the speeches, and the translations of the speakers were translated into their respective national languages. The atmosphere of the meeting was extremely tense and enthusiastic.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The Greater East Asia Conference reopened this afternoon, and representatives from various countries continued to deliver speeches. First, Prime Minister Zhang of Manchukuo gave a speech, and then President Laurel of the Philippines delivered a speech, expressing the enthusiasm and belief of the newly reborn Philippines, which lasted about an hour. After a short break at 2:45 p.m., it reopened at 3:30 p.m. Finally, Burmese Prime Minister Ba Maw delivered a speech, and the first day's schedule ended at 4:30 p.m.

### East Asian Nations Rise Up, Cooperate to Complete the War Main Points of Prime Minister Tojo's Speech

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 5th. The main points of the speech delivered by Japanese representative Prime Minister Tojo at the Greater East Asia Conference are as follows: In the past few centuries, the British Empire has acquired vast territories around the world through its policy of aggression and conquest, and wants to permanently maintain its superior position in various parts of the world, causing other countries to confront and fight each other. At the same time, the United States also took advantage of the turmoil in Europe to not only establish hegemony in the Americas, but also extended its hand to the Pacific and Asia by taking the Mexican-American War as an opportunity. Furthermore, taking the First World War as a turning point, it shared with Britain the ambition to jointly dominate the world. After the outbreak of this world war, the United States further coveted North Africa, Africa, the Atlantic, Australia, the Near East, and India, wanting to take the place of Britain. The so-called establishment of international justice and safeguarding world peace advocated by Britain and the United States is to promote the division and confrontation of European countries, so that the colonization and exploitation of Asian colonies can continue permanently, in order to maintain their selfish view of order.

British and American Policies: Aggression and Exploitation

The policies implemented by Britain and the United States towards Asia involve aggression in politics and exploitation in economics. Furthermore, under the guise of education, culture, etc., they cause various ethnic groups to lose their national character and conflict with each other in order to achieve their goals. Therefore, the survival of various countries and ethnic groups in Asia is constantly threatened, they lose a stable order, and the normal development of people's livelihood is hindered to this day. The open-door and equal-opportunity doctrine they call for is based on the fundamental concept of colonizing East Asia. This is actually a means they have adopted to achieve their non-hope of invading East Asia. Within their own territories, they often implement closed doors to various ethnic groups in East Asia, making opportunities unequal and hindering trade, only seeking the prosperity of their own interests. The ambition of Britain and the United States to dominate the world can be said to be a misfortune for mankind and the root of the world's troubles. Looking back, uprisings for liberation have constantly arisen among various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia. However, they were either suppressed by the violent force of Britain and the United States, or they failed due to their vicious divisive policies. Therefore, Japan's participation at this time is what Britain and the United States hate and fear the most. Therefore, they have always adopted a repressive attitude towards Japan, and at the same time schemed to divide Japan from the various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia. This is the essence of their East Asia policy.

Rising Up and Dealing for Survival

Because they want to maintain the enslaved state of East Asia, they regard the rise of any family in East Asia or the unity of various countries and ethnic groups in East Asia as unfavorable. In recent years, this kind of ambition of Britain and the United States to enslave East Asia has become increasingly blatant and dangerous. They instigated the Chongqing side to obstruct the diplomatic relations between China and Japan, and eventually caused the unfortunate Sino-Japanese Incident, and used various means to try to hinder the resolution of the incident. After the outbreak of this European war, they used the excuse of the war to hinder the path of peaceful commerce, and then squeezed out an economic break that was essentially no different from war. At the same time, they strengthened their military equipment around East Asia, wanting to force our country to submit. At this point, the stability of East Asia was severely threatened. The Empire, regardless of this attitude of Britain and the United States, still tried to prevent the disaster from spreading to East Asia, and endured self-respect, wanting to resolve the situation through peaceful negotiations. However, Britain and the United States did not show any sign of introspection or mutual concession, but instead intensified their intimidation and oppression, bringing the Empire's survival to the brink of danger. In order to survive and defend itself, the Empire was finally forced to rise up. At this point, it confronted the evil forces that challenged East Asia, crushing everything that hindered it. In order to establish lasting peace in East Asia, it is moving towards the path of decisive battle. After the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Empire's army and navy, with their bravery and good fighting skills, drove the aggressive forces of Britain and the United States out of East Asia in less than half a year.

Full of Fighting Spirit with One Heart

The countries of Greater East Asia either declared war and fought side by side with the Empire, or closely cooperated to complete the war. Today, the self-awareness and enthusiasm of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia have filled the heavens and earth of Greater East Asia. Internally, they believe in each other and harmonize with each other. Externally, they destroy the counterattacks of Britain and the United States in order to seek self-survival and self-governance, so as to establish lasting stability in Greater East Asia. This war is a great decisive battle to improve the rise and fall, survival and death of the entire nation of Greater East Asia. Only by winning this war can the various ethnic groups of Greater East Asia permanently ensure their survival in the heavens and earth of East Asia and share the joy of a co-prosperity land. The completion of the Greater East Asia War is the establishment of the new order of Greater East Asia. It is only natural that Britain and the United States will use their material and military strength to launch a counterattack against Greater East Asia. Therefore, today, the countries of Greater East Asia have all exerted their full strength to completely crush the counterattack of Britain and the United States, and further complete the war and ensure the stability of Greater East Asia. At this time, the Empire has stood in a favorable strategic position gained in the decisive battle and continues to implement its majestic operations. Domestically, in order to respond to this majestic operation, it is preparing the domestic situation. Recently, in order to make the domestic situation decisive, the people of the whole country have fought together with unwavering determination under the conviction of one hundred million hearts and a certain victory, and have been implementing the Greater East Asia War throughout. I am sure that the countries of Greater East Asia that you represent will also be determined to echo the Empire, exert their full strength to destroy Britain and the United States, and seek to permanently stabilize Greater East Asia.

Basic Views on Building East Asia

Now, I would like to state the basic views of the Imperial Government on the construction of Greater East Asia. I am convinced that enabling all countries in the world to get what they deserve, supporting each other, and sharing the joy of co-prosperity with all nations is the most effective and practical way to establish world peace by establishing the foundations of each country, forming bands of co-existence and co-prosperity, and at the same time establishing harmonious and joyful relations with other countries. It is an undeniable fact that the countries of Greater East Asia have close relations in all aspects. Therefore, I am convinced that the countries of Greater East Asia will cooperate with each other in this relationship, ensure the stability of Greater East Asia, and build an order of co-existence and co-prosperity. This is the common mission of all countries. The order of co-existence and co-prosperity in Greater East Asia is based on the inherent moral spirit of Greater East Asia, which is fundamentally different from the old order of Britain and the United States. Because the old order of Britain and the United States is dedicated to their own prosperity, they do everything they can to deceive and exploit. The new construction of Greater East Asia, based on morality, has already been realized step by step during the war. But what about the British and American policies towards India?

Laying the Foundation for Indian Independence

Today, Britain's oppression of India has become increasingly fierce, and recently the United States has also harbored ambitions towards India. The conflict and alienation between them and the Indian people are becoming increasingly intensified. The suffering endured by the four hundred million people of India is beyond words. The unprecedented famine that occurred in India recently was also caused by Britain and the United States. This is something that even Britain and the United States themselves admit. Today, those with aspirations in India have all been imprisoned, and countless people are starving and living in despair. The tragedy is the greatest tragedy in the world and is a matter of common indignation to mankind. All the nations of Greater East Asia are indignant at the miserable situation in India, and at the same time, we cannot ignore this fact. At this time, Indian patriot Jiangtela Bose resolutely rose up, and people inside and outside India also rose up in response. This is how the establishment of the Provisional Government of India and the foundation of Indian independence were laid. The Empire has previously declared to China and foreign countries that the Empire is determined to provide all cooperation and support to India's struggle for independence. I am sure that the countries of Greater East Asia will also sincerely cooperate with India's struggle for independence. The policies taken by Britain and the United States towards India today are fundamentally different from what they proclaimed in the Atlantic Charter. To this day, they are really unable to justify their claims. However, we are not surprised to see their contradictory phenomena, because the world has long been accustomed to seeing the contradictions in the words and deeds of Britain and the United States, and knows that deception and disguise are the nature of Britain and the United States.

Increased Confidence in the Final Victory

No matter what the enemy wants to do, as long as the Empire and the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate and fight together, they will surely be able to liberate Greater East Asia from the shackles of Britain and the United States. If the countries of Greater East Asia cooperate with each other, the revival and prosperity of Greater East Asia can be expected in the near future. Today, the countries and nations of Greater East Asia have united together to work together to realize the ideal of co-prosperity for all nations and build Greater East Asia. Looking back at the situation in Europe, the allied nation of Germany has strengthened national unity and is working hard to destroy Britain and the United States and build Europe with unwavering confidence, which is commendable. The Greater East Asia War is actually a holy war that reveals evil and demonstrates righteousness. The great righteousness is obvious, and our righteous army is invincible, so victory will eventually be ours. This is what we firmly believe. At this time, the Empire deeply expresses its respect for the great enthusiasm of the countries of Greater East Asia to wholeheartedly cooperate with the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, it expects the countries of Greater East Asia and the allied nations of Europe to strengthen their cooperation and deal with the increasingly fierce war situation, overcome all difficulties with unwavering confidence and indomitable fighting spirit, implement the Greater East Asia War, which is our common mission, and complete the construction of Greater East Asia, so as to contribute to the establishment of true world peace.

### Strong Unity of One Billion People A Landmark Page in East Asian History

Central News Agency, Nanjing, 5th. The Greater East Asia Conference, which aims to unite the billion people of East Asia, brought together responsible representatives from the six major countries of East Asia in Tokyo, Japan. It laid the foundation stone for the construction of East Asia and heralded the world's morality. It is not only a landmark page in East Asian history, but also unprecedented in world history. Just a week after the conclusion of the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, when our country is deeply celebrating the completion of independence and autonomy, President Wang of the Executive Yuan is again visiting Tokyo with his entourage to attend the Greater East Asia Conference. He is meeting with the highest-ranking responsible personnel of the various countries and nations of East Asia to sincerely discuss the completion of the common war, the strengthening of East Asian unity, and the promotion of co-prosperity. Therefore, the legacy of the Father of the Nation's Pan-Asianism can be realized. Today, the countries of East Asia are each making close cooperation in their natural state and forming a strong cooperative axis. By fiercely attacking the Anglo-Americans who are clamoring for a counterattack, they can shatter their ambitions to invade East Asia again and completely break their dreams of dominating the world. The construction of Greater East Asia is based on Eastern morality and aims at the co-prosperity of East Asia, with the aim of establishing a cornerstone for world peace. Therefore, it can be said that the opening of the Greater East Asia Conference is enough to show the determination of the billion people of East Asia to unite as one, destroy the Anglo-Americans, complete the construction, and advance.

### Representative Wang's Speech in Japan Declares Our Government's Determination to Share the Responsibility of Completing the War and Reconstruction

Tokyo, 5th (Central News Agency) - Mr. Wang Zhaoming, representative of the Republic of China, delivered a speech at the Greater East Asia Conference as follows: The Greater East Asia Conference, of great significance in world history, is being held today in the capital of our allied nation, Japan. Having just heard the speech by Prime Minister Tojo, I am greatly inspired. The British and Americans began their presence in East Asia centuries ago. In this critical period, thanks to Japan's military strength, as well as its political, economic, and cultural power, the aggressive ambitions of the British and Americans have been contained, ensuring that East Asia is not divided and occupied by them. Recently, Japan launched the Greater East Asia War, shattering the aggressive forces of the British and Americans in East Asia. Their naval and land bases in the Western Pacific and the South Seas have been successively defeated and occupied by the Japanese navy and army. Japan has gone further, based on the spirit of benevolent hegemony, advocating the coexistence and co-prosperity of the various East Asian nations, assisting them in achieving independence and autonomy, fulfilling their patriotic aspirations, enabling them to fulfill their roles and exert their utmost efforts to share the responsibility of completing the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. I express my greatest respect for Japan's noble and great aspirations and its brilliant achievements. At the same time, I extend my greatest respect to our long-standing friendly nations of Manchukuo and Thailand, as well as the newly emerging nations of Burma and the Philippines, and the Provisional Government of India, for their firm determination and vigorous efforts to share the responsibility of the Greater East Asia War and the construction of Greater East Asia. The Republic of China, as a member of East Asia, is truly honored to have this opportunity to express the National Government's determination and efforts regarding the completion of the Greater East Asia War and the direction of Greater East Asia's construction.

Breaking the Shackles of Aggressive Forces

Dr. Sun Yat-sen, the founding father of the Republic of China, had a lifelong aspiration to enable China and East Asia to break the shackles of British and American aggressive forces and achieve independence and autonomy. Based on this aspiration, he struggled throughout his life until his death forty years ago. In the month or so before his death, he gave two speeches in Kobe, Japan. One was on November 28th of the 13th year of the Republic (1924), speaking about Pan-Asianism. In this speech, he explained that Asia is the birthplace of the most ancient cultures. However, in the last hundred years, it has been invaded by the British and Americans, gradually weakening, with almost no completely independent nations. However, at the extreme of weakness, a turning point suddenly appeared, which was the Meiji Restoration of Japan. The Meiji Restoration is the reason why Japan became an advanced nation in Asia and is also the cornerstone of Asia's revival. Asian nations should work together with Japan, an advanced nation, based on Eastern Wangdao culture, to defeat the Western hegemonic culture, completely drive out the aggressive forces of the British and Americans, and achieve the independence and autonomy of Asian nations through the unity of Asian nations. Only in this way can the entire Asia be transformed from decline to revival. Another speech, also given in the same year on a certain day of a certain month, was about Japan's abolition of unequal treaties with China. In this speech, he explained that China and Japan are like brothers. Japan had previously been subjected to the shackles of unequal treaties, but through vigorous self-improvement, it was able to break these shackles and become an advanced nation in the East and a powerful nation in the world. China is now also struggling to abolish unequal treaties and hopes that Japan will vigorously assist in China's liberation, which is also the liberation of Asia. The above two speeches were the last speeches of Dr. Sun Yat-sen in his life. After that, Dr. Sun Yat-sen fell ill in bed and eventually passed away in Beijing on March 12th of the following year. At the time of his death, he left a will to his comrades, asking them to continue to struggle based on this will in order to see the day of success. Unfortunately, after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen, his will was not realized. The relationship between China and Japan not only did not improve but deteriorated day by day, and finally, the incident occurred in July of the 26th year of the Republic (1937), twelve years after the death of Dr. Sun Yat-sen.

Soldiers and People Will Eventually Return

At this time, the discord between China and Japan was seen by the British and Americans as the best opportunity to sow discord, fearing that the Sino-Japanese incident would not expand or prolong. Our comrades saw that Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will had not been realized and that the relationship between China and Japan was deteriorating day by day, and they were extremely saddened, almost falling into the abyss of despair. Fortunately, the Japanese government soon announced its policy of ending the incident, stating that Japan's goal was not the destruction of China but the prosperity of China, and that Japan expected China to share the responsibility of building East Asia. Japan also resolved to assist China in fulfilling its wish for independence and autonomy. Our comrades, hearing Japan's true intentions, knew that there was still hope for improving Sino-Japanese relations and realizing Dr. Sun Yat-sen's will. Therefore, they first advised the Chongqing authorities to abandon resistance and restore peace. When their advice was not heeded, they were forced to leave Chongqing and work for the peace movement. Finally, the National Government returned to Nanjing, openly advocating Sino-Japanese cooperation and making the greatest efforts to revive East Asia together. As mentioned above, the British and Americans sowed discord in the Sino-Japanese incident with the intention of expanding and prolonging it. Since the return of the National Government to Nanjing, these means have become even more intensified. The British and Americans have used every possible means to entice Chongqing to resist and obstruct peace. Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the British and Americans, in view of the setbacks and disappearance of their power in East Asia, have become even more eager to use Chongqing to contain Japan. This is a fact known to the world. However, our government is certain that the British and Americans' attempt will surely fail. Why? Because both the soldiers and the people in Chongqing adhere to the teachings of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Since January 9th of this year, Japan has returned concessions to China in advance, abolished extraterritoriality, and, in particular, recently replaced the Sino-Japanese Basic Relations Treaty with the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty, and abolished all attached documents. The Pan-Asianism advocated by Dr. Sun Yat-sen has seen the light. Dr. Sun Yat-sen's hope that Japan would assist China in abolishing unequal treaties has become a reality. Even if the British and Americans entice and obstruct in every way, they will not be able to stop Chongqing's awakening. Even if they are temporarily restrained, Chongqing will one day realize that relying on the British and Americans is a betrayal of East Asia and a betrayal of Dr. Sun Yat-sen. Both the soldiers and the people will eventually have a day of returning, and this can be determined.

Ensuring Security and Increasing Production

During this most critical period, the National Government can only affirm its consistent policy and intensify its efforts, on the one hand, to promote the awakening and return of the soldiers and people in Chongqing to complete unification, and on the other hand, to establish a model in the areas where political power can reach. Its work has about three key points: First: rectifying thought, second: ensuring security, and third: increasing production. The so-called rectifying thought is to thoroughly eliminate the ideology of British and American individualism and utilitarianism and replace it with the Eastern spirit of morality, focusing on the goals of East Asians and restoring the original appearance of East Asians, striving with one heart and one mind for the coexistence and co-prosperity of East Asians. The so-called ensuring security is to recognize that the rear area of the Greater East Asia War must be secure so that the frontline soldiers of the allied nations have no worries and can further transport troops to the front lines, sharing the hardships of the allied soldiers. The so-called increasing production is to give all economic and financial plans a focus, increasing the power of the decisive battle. Although it only emphasizes increasing local products, it also includes the meaning of conserving consumption and utilizing waste. The above three items are the key points of the National Government's work in cooperating with the Greater East Asia War. At the same time, the National Government recognizes the meaning of war as construction. In the war, with the determination to share weal and woe, and to live and die together, it forms East Asian comrades with East Asian compatriots, resisting the common enemy of the British and Americans and shattering their aggressive spirit, and cooperating with East Asian compatriots to undertake the construction of East Asia. Regarding the Greater East Asia War, what we seek is victory. Regarding the construction of Greater East Asia, what we seek is co-prosperity. Specifically, each East Asian nation must love its own country, love each other's countries, and love East Asia together. As for China, our slogan is to revive China and defend East Asia, because China must achieve independence and autonomy in order to have the ability to share the responsibility of defending East Asia, and at the same time, East Asia must be well-defended so that China's independence and autonomy can be guaranteed. Therefore, we must strive to make our own country an independent and autonomous country and at the same time make our own country a strong member of East Asia.

Unite and Create a New World

The countries of East Asia each have their natural characteristics, so it is necessary to ensure their independence and autonomy, and at the same time respect each other's independence and autonomy. The countries of East Asia also have a common goal, so they must work together with one heart and one mind towards a common goal in order to achieve coexistence and co-prosperity. Japan, an advanced nation, has already shone the light of its independence and autonomy on the world, and now it is willing to assist all East Asian countries in achieving independence and autonomy, uniting them and working together towards a common goal. I believe that after political independence and autonomy are achieved, as long as the diplomatic policies are consistent and the military shares the same hatred of the enemy, the common goal will surely be achieved. As for culture, advanced Japan has indeed achieved the three key points of basing itself on its own culture, promoting Eastern culture, and absorbing world culture. We truly admire this. I firmly believe that all emerging countries will be able to strive together, and China should devote all its efforts to the revival of its culture. Cultural harmony and creation are essential for close unity among nations. For example, Buddhism once communicated the ideas between India and Britain, shining a unique light in the history of Eastern culture. As for the economy, the countries of East Asia can complement each other based on the principle of mutual benefit, and there are endless ways to find mutually beneficial methods. For example, British cotton is needed by many neighboring countries, and gasoline, rubber, tin, etc. from various parts of the South Seas can also be supplied to many neighboring countries. As long as we think from the perspective of mutual assistance, we can really solve everything, fundamentally reducing the exploitation policies and monopoly policies that the British and Americans have always relied on, and creating a new world that is in line with humanity. If the above can be achieved, the welfare of the countries and nations of East Asia will have endless benefits. Not only will the co-prosperity of East Asia be effectively guaranteed, but world peace will also be laid on this foundation. These bright prospects are ahead, waiting for the countries and nations of East Asia to step forward hand in hand.

Expanding the Scope of the Co-prosperity Sphere

Finally, I have a few words. Chinese people in Thailand, the Philippines, and in the former British colonies occupied by Japan total no less than seven or eight million. These overseas Chinese are treated kindly by the governments of the host countries and work shoulder to shoulder with the people of the host countries, putting in a lot of effort and sweat in transportation development and resource development. This effort and sweat is integrated with the people of the host countries bit by bit, which has a great promotion for the people of East Asia. The Chinese people have their shortcomings, but they also have their strengths. Peace, honesty, diligence, and ethics, sharing the joys and sorrows with the people of the host countries, the result of sharing weal and woe, adopting each other's strengths, and making up for each other's shortcomings have become inseparable partners. I firmly believe that through this Greater East Asia War, it will be more tempered and perfected. I also firmly believe that it will be able to contribute to the Greater East Asia Co-prosperity Sphere day by day. Recalling the joint declaration of Japan, Manchuria, and Thailand on November 30, 29th year of the Republic (1940), it has already established an axis on the East Asian continent. Now, the Greater East Asia Conference has the participation of Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines, and the chairman of the Provisional Government of India is attending. The scope of the Co-prosperity Sphere has further expanded. After stating my views, I sincerely wish the participating countries prosperity and the people happiness.

### Anglo-American-Turkish Conference, Germany Pays Special Attention, Turkish President's Speech Is Thought-Provoking

Berlin, 5th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a German news agency, the Turkish Foreign Minister's trip to Cairo will involve not only talks with British Foreign Secretary Eden, but also the participation of U.S. Secretary of State Hull, according to recent news. The British and American public believe this will guide major decisions and is closely related to the Moscow Conference. The Turkish press emphasizes Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu's trip, considering it to be of an informal nature. The Daily Express's comments clearly express Britain's attitude, stating that if the anti-Axis forces have the right to use Turkish air bases and pass through the Dardanelles, the war will enter another stage and shorten the war by several months. The Daily Mail said that Turkey will provide the anti-Axis powers with some facilities to attack major parts of Europe, just like the former Hague provided the Azores to Britain. The Daily Express also hinted that Turkey would be pressured and threatened to strengthen its power, and it is not known whether it will stop supplying Turkey with weapons and ammunition. However, how Turkey will react to actions that trap it in sin remains to be seen in the future. Political circles in the capital are closely watching the differing assessments between Britain, the United States, and Turkey regarding the purpose of the Turkish Foreign Minister's trip to Rome, and President İsmet's recent speech that Turkey will maintain its neutrality at any cost is also valued by Germany.

### Section Chief Hirota Discusses the Moscow Conference - Determines No Effect

Central News Agency Report: The joint press conference hosted by the Japanese Land, Sea, and Overseas Authorities in Shanghai was held as usual yesterday (5th) at 3:00 p.m. on the fifth floor of the Huizhong Hotel. Hirota, the information section chief of the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy, ​​attended with Vice-Consul Fukuma. Lieutenant Ogiwara attended from the Naval Reporting Department. First, Vice-Consul Fukuma introduced the reporter group and reported that Ogiwara had been promoted to the rank of lieutenant, and all the reporters present congratulated him. Then, Hirota, the head of the Information Department, made an important speech on the results of the meeting held in Moscow by the representatives of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. The detailed explanation lasted two hours before it ended.

The Content of the Announcement Is Extremely Empty

Minister Hirota first said that the Moscow conference of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, finally announced its conclusion on October 30. From the point of view of this conference, it has successively issued its joint communiqué and declaration. After our comprehensive conclusion of the war, the announcements it issued are extremely empty, and even more useless propaganda. Therefore, after our detailed study of the conference of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, the content is unrealistic and extremely boring. Therefore, we feel that any meetings held repeatedly on the anti-Axis side are of little value, and their conclusions are even more ineffective. Then, according to the so-called communiqué announcement, the cases discussed at this conference can be divided into four points: First, the permanent European Advisory Committee organized by the representatives of the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, is located in London (the anti-Axis powers named it the European Advisory Committee because of the establishment of the Mediterranean Advisory Committee). Second, close coordination should be made regarding the execution of the war. Third, to establish an international security system. Fourth, an agreement on the occupied areas. When we look at these four points, in the second point of the communiqué, the item that close coordination should be made in the execution of the war, since it concerns the war, no detailed content has been published. The remaining three points seem to be consistent in principle, but in fact they can be said to have no special resolutions, and the content is extremely empty.

The Alliance of the Three Countries Is Full of Flaws

First, let's look at the detailed statement of the third point of the communiqué, "Establish an International Security System," which is quite simple. In principle, it seems to have reached a consensus, but we are quite surprised by the so-called communiqué and declaration announcements issued. On the principle that this simple issue was discussed at their meeting, no minimum conclusion was reached. Therefore, there are considerable differences of opinion among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. We feel that it is necessary to re-examine the so-called common goal of fighting the war. Looking at the content of the "Organization of the Permanent European Advisory Committee" mentioned in the first point, the original three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, concluded an alliance, but the ambassadors of each country are stationed in London and can contact each other at any time to discuss any issues. From this point of view, the so-called "Permanent European Advisory Committee" is superfluous and there is no need to organize it. If there is a need to establish the council, it shows that the alliance of the three countries is full of flaws, reflecting the lack of communication.

Mutual Suspicion, Discord in Appearance

Next, regarding the issue of establishing an international security system, referring to their situation, the Organization of the League of Nations has long ended in history. Today, this establishes an international security system, in fact, obviously following the existence of the League of Nations. I think that the representatives of these three countries specially held a meeting in Moscow, which is superfluous. If there is really a need to discuss this issue, the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, can fulfill their obligations to the League of Nations, but there are still elements among them who oppose rebuilding the International War Alliance. Secondly, regarding the agreement on the occupied areas in Europe in the fourth point, it has completely exposed the ambition of the capitalist powers to occupy Europe, but any nation in Europe does not want the anti-Axis powers to occupy Europe. This fact is extremely clear. At the same time, there is suspicion and distrust among the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union. Even if a principle agreement can be reached, it is of no special significance at this meeting and is really a stain on the meeting. Especially what is said in the communiqué regarding the clause of examination, it has been decided that the three countries, Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union, agree that they will not allow each other to station troops in their respective territories, and the three countries do not have the sincerity to trust each other. Therefore, looking at these three points, there is no special important meaning, so the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is really pathetic. Then, Hirota said again: Although they are nominally allied countries, in principle they seem to be moving towards unity, but in fact they are in discord in appearance, and they have never been unified in their fundamental position. Therefore, the alliance of the three countries is difficult to unify, and the conclusion of the Moscow conference is not only meaningless, but also of no value. Then they will gradually see it. Finally, Hirota said that before defeating the common enemy, Japan and Germany should still strive for the final victory after the changes in the war.

### Municipal Bonds to Be Redeemed and Drawn on Schedule

The Shanghai Special Municipal Bonds issued by the Shanghai Special Municipal Government in 1942 have paid interest twice in November of last year and May 5th of this year. In accordance with the regulations of the bonds, November 30th of this year is the date for the first redemption and the third interest payment. The Bond Fund Management Committee recently held a meeting and decided to hold the first redemption lottery on the 15th of this month on the fifth floor of the Bankers Association. Notices have been sent to the relevant authorities, and representatives will be dispatched to supervise the scene at that time to show seriousness. It is also learned that when the first and second interest payments of the bonds were made, some of the interest payments had not yet been collected. Now that the third interest payment period is approaching, the bondholders can go to the paying institutions (Shanghai Central Trust Bank, Shanghai Fuxing Bank) to collect them together to avoid long-term losses.

Economic Circle Comments

### Trial Filming

The Chinese Merchants' Exchange is a stage for Shanghai's economic circles. The reopening of the Chinese Merchants' Securities Exchange is the resumption of activities on that stage. However, from the initial ribbon-cutting to the subsequent noise and excitement, none of the actors took to the stage, causing millions of viewers to strain their eyes in anticipation. It turned out that the host, Director Liu, believed that the drama was not yet ready for performance. Rather than staging a performance that would be met with boos, it was better to delay the premiere and conduct a trial run first. The same principle applies to movies. Before producing a film, a trial shoot must be conducted. The main conditions for a trial shoot are, on the one hand, that the director's command is decisive and flawless, and on the other hand, that the actors are focused and disciplined. "Discipline" is a golden rule for all dramatic actors. Otherwise, if their behavior is not typical or excessive, the film will not achieve the desired results.

If a trial shoot is conducted before the exchange opens, the directors during the trial period will be the directors and supervisors, the actors will be the brokers or agents, the script will be the Chinese stocks that have been approved for listing after investigation, and the acting rules will be the detailed regulations of the exchange. According to this hypothetical scenario, the directors and supervisors must be rigorous and precise in their supervision and guidance, the brokers must be disciplined in executing the opening, the listed Chinese stocks must not be allowed to change erratically, and the exchange's business regulations must not be allowed to become mere formalities. In short, the purpose of the trial shoot is not only to rehearse the steps and order of opening the Chinese stock market, but also to test whether the formal Chinese Merchants' Securities Market can adhere to the spirit of the times, operate according to the principles of trading, and develop from a position of assisting the national economy.

### Banks with Insufficient Capital Must Increase Capital Within the Year; Failure to Do So Will Result in Merger or Closure

The Ministry of Finance, in order to effectively implement financial control policies and rectify economic institutions, has recently issued a circular to banks with insufficient capital, requiring them to increase their capital in accordance with the new regulations within one and a half months. If they still fail to increase their capital by the end of this year, they will be given appropriate penalties, and in serious cases, they may be ordered to close down.

According to statistics,

there are 268 banks in this city with a total capital of 50,351,218.3 yuan. Among them, 36 have a capital of 5 million yuan or more, 31 have a capital of 3 million yuan or more, 37 have a capital of 2 million yuan or more, 38 have a capital of 1 million yuan or more, and 22 have a capital of less than 1 million yuan. Therefore, within the period from July to the end of this year,

the number of banks increasing their capital

has reached as many as 95. In addition to the fact that some have already increased their capital, the rest are rushing to complete the procedures for increasing their capital, with a deadline of the end of December. According to the new regulations, the capital of banks and native banks is 6 million yuan, with 3 million yuan paid up. General commercial banks with trust departments must have a minimum paid-up capital of 5 million yuan, of which 3 million yuan is for the banking department and 2 million yuan is for the trust department. If they fail to increase their capital in accordance with the law by the deadline, they will be merged or ordered to close down.

### Sharp Increase in Deposits in Shanghai's Financial Institutions

Since the National Government implemented wartime economic policies, the various industrial and commercial organizations in this city have been undergoing overall consolidation, which has been entirely completed. The degree of material unification has reached a new level, and the use of funds has become more active. The business dynamics and capital flows of financial and various industrial and commercial institutions (including banks, native banks, and trust companies) are more prosperous than in the past. In particular, after the guidance of practical work, there has been much improvement. It is reported that, to date, the deposit and loan businesses of various financial institutions have increased by more than double compared to before, and the reason for this is that they all emphasize investing in production and construction projects.

### Stock Trading on the Exchange Temporarily Limited to Spot Transactions

Supervisory Committee Sends Personnel to Monitor

The Shanghai Chinese Merchants' Exchange, after holding a resumption ceremony on September 29, has been actively preparing for the layout of the market. Now that the major affairs have been completed, it has been decided that formal trading will begin on the 8th of this month. A total of 108 types of listed stocks have been approved by the Exchange Supervisory Committee. According to a Central News Agency reporter's inquiry to the Exchange, the Ministry of Industry has already issued business licenses to 29 brokerage firms, allowing them to enter the market for trading at that time. The applications of 71 more brokerage firms are being processed and will be issued successively to allow them to operate. The market now has 200 pairs of telephones for brokers, which can be fully installed by tomorrow or the day after. Stock trading starting on the 8th will be temporarily limited to spot transactions. During the trading period, the Supervisory Committee will also send personnel to monitor the market to prevent speculative and illegal trading activities.

### Non-Industry Personnel Not Allowed to Enter Trade Association Markets

Recently, it has often been discovered in various trade associations in this city that non-industry personnel are混入into various markets, engaging in black market buying and selling or lending outside the scope of permitted activities. This situation not only disrupts market order, but also has a significant impact on the market. Therefore, various trade associations have specifically stipulated that in the future, personnel entering the market must present a membership card or entry permit. At the same time, members must absolutely abide by the association's charter and the laws and regulations promulgated by the government when trading in the market. Members who violate the law will, once discovered, be expelled from the market and have their membership revoked.

### Brief News

They include discussions on monetary policy, the spirit of Japanese industry during wartime, Chen Jizhi's analysis of the background and impact of purchasing cloth, Jian Shu's analysis of wartime economic trends in various countries. Starting next year, it will be changed to a monthly publication.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday, Chinese stocks rose first and then traded sideways. Because of the stock market, the confidence of all parties is increasing, and new stocks are being proposed more vigorously. There is a lot of buying activity. Fuxing and Jinglun socks, Jiu'an Industrial, China Film, and Standard MSG are all being raised by major players, resulting in significant increases. Most department stores, such as Wing On Company, and stocks such as Wing On Textile, are seeing less momentum. Buying interest in the new medicine industry gradually intensified at noon. Stocks in industries such as real estate are all making upward progress. The tobacco company alone saw weakness. Trading was quite active throughout the day. The shares of each industry are listed below.

Rongde Textile continued to see significant trading volume in buying activity, rising half a Guan. Zhongfang and Xinhe traded sideways. Meiya also saw a slight increase. Lunhua Dagong also saw strong bidding. Tianlun Xinfeng and other textile stocks saw higher prices. Hongsheng Weaving remained flat. Jingfu Socks rose significantly above the face value. Zuilun also rose. China Silk also saw buying activity.

Department Stores: Wing On Company fell back after Guan, ultimately trading flat with Sincere and National Goods Company. Underwear also rose and then returned to flat.

New Medicines: Xinya Pharmaceutical Factory rose and fell quickly in the morning, ultimately trading flat. After 11 o'clock, buyers immediately pushed it up. In the afternoon, it gradually rose to a level outside Da Guan, ultimately rising half a Guan. Zhongfa followed suit. Xinyi and Xinxing Pharmaceutical Factory also saw an increase. Wuzhou Zhongsi and Jiufu Pharmaceutical all saw price parity.

Sanyou Industrial and Baoan Glass also saw strength.

### Commercial Summary

The public bond market was even less active yesterday, with declines increasing. This is because the stock market will open next week, and public bonds will have no place. Whether off-exchange trading will continue as usual is still uncertain. Bing bonds were initially firm, but later the supply completely exceeded demand, and the market situation gradually declined. In the end, it fell significantly compared to the previous day. The other four types, A, B, D, and E, remained flat, which was very different from the stability of Bing bonds. This is because Bing bonds still have futures trading, which is why they fell sharply first. The interbank call rate remains at 1.5 cents, unchanged by the Money Industry Association.

National Forum

### Improvement of Administration in the Western District of Shanghai

—

The First, Third, and Western Shanghai Police Bureaus of this city have been officially merged since the first of this month to complete the construction of Greater Shanghai and unify the city's police administration.

This is naturally an exciting event. However, the unification of Greater Shanghai is not only based on the unification of police administration. True unification also requires the complement of administration. Regarding this point, the citizens are all eagerly expecting the authorities to implement it as soon as possible. Here, from the perspective of the residents of the Western District of Shanghai, we offer some opinions:

Strengthening the Baojia Organization – The Baojia organization in the Western District of Shanghai has always had little connection with the police bureau. Therefore, citizens often experience great inconvenience in registering household movements, deaths, and births. Three months ago, a family of six moved from Beijing next door. If they had moved into the First District, then issues such as citizen certificates and food rations could probably have been completed within ten days at most. However, today, three months later, they have neither received a residence permit nor the right to receive food rations. In order to receive a residence permit, they first asked the Baozhang for a residence permit application form. The Baozhang said that it had not been issued yet and told them to go to the police bureau to get it. When they got to the police bureau, they were told to get it from the Baozhang. They ran back and forth between the Baozhang and the police bureau no less than seven or eight times, but because of the lack of communication between the two, they still have not received it. This is undoubtedly a great loss for the residents of the Fourth District of Shanghai, especially in the event of an exercise. A citizen without a residence permit can easily be misunderstood. Therefore, in the midst of the unification of the city's police administration, we hope that the authorities will improve the relationship between the Baojia and the police bureau in the Western District of Shanghai. The most effective measure to improve is undoubtedly to adopt the existing advantages of the First District.

Improve the Rationing System – The rationing of food in the Fourth District of Shanghai is implemented by the Nanshi Food Bureau. About a month ago, the Food Bureau conducted a household census in order to strengthen the rationing mechanism. Since then, new households wishing to obtain food rations must bring their residence permit to the Food Administration to apply. This system is originally a strict and effective measure. However, because it is easy to obtain a residence permit in the Western District of Shanghai, new households often feel unable to apply. Therefore, we hope that the relevant authorities will improve the application method. As far as we can see, it may be possible to have the Baojia chief guarantee the proof. This point has already been implemented in the First District. It is also necessary to completely unify the rationing quantity with the First and Eighth Districts.

The above two points are the two most urgent issues for the residents of the Western District of Shanghai to solve. We hope that the wise authorities of the First District will pay attention to this.

### A Further Discussion on the Coal Briquette Profit Issue

— Wei Jun

The author wrote an article in this forum on the 29th of last month entitled "On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control." Chen Shi Yuanjun published an article entitled "After Reading 'On the Issue of Coal Briquette Control'" in response, with earnest words. However, Zong Yuanjun did not understand the truth, relying only on general rumors and common-sense estimates of costs, which inevitably scratched an itch without getting to the point.

The main reason for this coal briquette panic is actually due to the authorities' reduction in coal allocation. According to the allocation quantity of the Coal Association: the average allocation quantity in the first half of this year is almost three to one compared to the four months in the second half of the year. The allocation quantity in July and August is also 1.5 to 1 compared to September and October. During this peak month when the demand for coal briquettes is increasing, how can manufacturers not panic when they obtain such scarce raw materials?

As for the fact that coal briquette manufacturers wanted to increase prices but were rejected by the authorities, perhaps there is some truth to it. However, the manufacturers' use of the excuse of repairing machinery to reduce production as a countermeasure is only a temporary phenomenon.

Regarding the coal briquette manufacturing cost analysis table listed in the previous article, it is based on the principle of each ton containing standard ingredients (85% coal dust, 25% coal ash and yellow mud). Zong Yuanjun said that the coal and electricity used in the furnace have not increased in price since last spring, and that coal dust and electricity have even decreased in price compared to before. This is indeed true. However, the sharp increase in the cost of shipping and labor, repair depreciation, and administrative expenses cannot be denied and is also a fact.

Based on general statistics, a more accurate analysis of the current cost of manufacturing coal briquettes by manufacturers is as follows:

Raw Material Cost: Shandong coal dust (30%) 109.50 yuan, Jiaozuo coal dust (55%) 198.00 yuan. Freight and shortage 75.00 yuan, coal ash (25%) 25.00 yuan, yellow mud (25%) 12.50 yuan.

Expense Cost: Coal baking (Daventaikou coal is calculated at 5% per ton of briquettes) 37.50 yuan, water and electricity 7.80 yuan, labor and food 48.00 yuan, interest 8.00 yuan, repair depreciation 80.00 yuan, administrative expenses 40.00 yuan. Manufacturer's profit 28.70 yuan.

Total 670.00 yuan

Note: The cost is based on the principle of standard ingredient raw materials per ton (coal is 85%, coal ash and yellow mud are 25%).

According to the lowest estimated price in the above table, the net manufacturing cost is 641.3 yuan. If it is wholesaled to small retailers at 670.00 yuan per ton, a net profit of 28.70 yuan can be obtained. However, compared with the cost of coal briquettes with standard ingredients, the current wholesale limit price of 550.00 yuan per ton is a difference of 91.3 yuan. In Shanghai, where profit is the only goal, what manufacturer is willing to continue production? Therefore, in addition to directly requesting the authorities to increase prices and being rejected, they will reduce the coal content, increase the amount of coal ash and yellow mud, and lower the quality to gain a small profit. It is undeniable that this is the common situation of general coal briquette manufacturers today. Therefore, the quality of coal briquettes purchased in the market these days is indeed very different, and coal briquette manufacturers do have unspeakable difficulties.

Therefore, the author deeply hopes that the authorities can re-legislate the profits of manufacturers. The prerequisite is that the products can meet the prescribed standards, so that both citizens and manufacturers can obtain common benefits.
