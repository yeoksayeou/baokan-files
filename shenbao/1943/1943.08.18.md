### Unfolding the Work of Purchasing Yarn and Cloth

Since the National Government explicitly ordered the purchase of existing cotton yarn and cloth in Shanghai, entrusting the National Commercial Control Association with full authority to handle the procurement, all parties have paid close attention to this matter. As the Japanese Asahi Shimbun editorial stated (see today's translated comments), "It is the first step towards resolving the current greatest difficulties of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihoods." Because this measure, if thoroughly implemented and further practiced with rational distribution, will stabilize a portion of people's livelihoods, and the revitalization of China's economy can naturally be expected. Conversely, if it cannot be thoroughly implemented and rational distribution cannot be practiced, then the results will naturally make it impossible to achieve the stability of people's livelihoods and economic recovery. The Asahi Shimbun editorial also stated, "If the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, saving China's economy will be difficult. Therefore, effective and appropriate use must be taken with special care." This is completely consistent with our, and it can be said, the common feeling of most Chinese people.

"From the perspective of operational interests, it seems that Japan cannot unconditionally relinquish them, but under the major premise of Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China, it would be a mistake to interfere with these trivial issues with a profit-only mentality." The Asahi Shimbun further explained the frank purpose of the friendly nation regarding this measure, and therefore, the expectations for the National Government are particularly earnest.

Let us look again at the statement issued by Ambassador Gu after the National Government announced the order, which fully expressed cooperation and support, and the purchase of yarn and cloth owned by Japanese merchants, in coordination with our measures. The Japanese side has now established a temporary Yarn and Cloth Management Office by the Central China Trade Federation to handle the procurement, and the implementation of the procurement regulations has also been approved by the Shanghai Office of the Japanese Embassy. Therefore, the procurement work on the Japanese side will be implemented earlier than ours.

Although our implementation of the procurement work has been specially set up by the Commercial Control Association as an office for purchasing cotton yarn and cloth, specifically responsible for handling it, the selection of the director was initially carefully considered, and then it was decided to hire Mr. Nie Lusheng, but Mr. Nie humbly declined, so it officially started yesterday. On the one hand, we hope that the office will start its work as soon as possible; on the other hand, we hope that Mr. Nie will strive to overcome difficulties. Because the person in charge of the office must have deep qualifications and experience in the cotton industry, as well as a clean and noble character and a spirit of serving the public. Now that Mr. Nie has both, he is naturally the most ideal candidate, and the authorities of the Commercial Control Association are sincere in their persuasion and strong retention. For the sake of the future of stabilizing people's livelihoods and the future of economic recovery, Mr. Nie has already dismissed his intention to resign and has taken office, and we will look forward to the smooth implementation of the procurement work.

Finally, we further hope that all owners of cotton yarn and cloth will correctly recognize the trend of the times. The government's decree on purchasing cotton yarn and cloth will not be changed. Therefore, the attitude of waiting and watching will not benefit oneself, and should not be held. Unexpected hopes will not be realized, and should not be held. Only by broadening one's mind, looking at the overall situation, abiding by industry rules, and obeying orders can one succeed. On the one hand, for the difficult problems that may arise for oneself, one can also give their opinions to the authorities for a reasonable solution.

### Methods to Strengthen the Chinese Economy

The National Government, at the Provisional Supreme National Defense Conference on the 9th, decided on the Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, taking the first step towards resolving the current greatest difficulties of economic recovery and stabilizing people's livelihoods.

The purpose of the National Government's resolute implementation of this policy is to use inventories as lubricants to gradually guide the Chinese economy into productive activities. That is to say, the first step is to supply the purchased cotton products to the countryside in exchange for rice, wheat, cotton, etc., in order to streamline the collection of agricultural products. The second step is to strive for the revitalization of the textile industry and other urban light industries through the fair distribution of these agricultural products, and to guarantee the maintenance of the production of important mining industries. These industrial products are used to exchange for the collection of agricultural products. In this repeated cycle, China's economic strength will be greatly increased, and at the same time, it will seek to stabilize people's livelihoods, enhance the political power of the National Government, and increase its contribution to the execution of the Greater East Asia War. This is the goal of this policy.

Under the current situation, there is absolutely no other way to realize the revitalization of the Chinese economy. In this sense, we express our joy at the National Government's decision, and at the same time, we hope to recruit all talents and devote their full strength to thoroughly implement this policy.

But conversely, this method can be said to be the last resort. If the purchased materials cannot be used effectively, saving China's economy will be difficult. Therefore, effective and appropriate use must be taken with special care. On this point, we absolutely trust the National Government's ability and efforts and leave it to them to handle. China has an extremely complex and erratic public sentiment that deviates from reason. Only the Chinese themselves have the ability to grasp this subtle and complex fluctuating psychology and implement appropriate policies according to the time and place. Of course, from the perspective of operational interests, it seems that Japan cannot unconditionally relinquish them, but under the major premise of Japan's promotion of a new policy towards China, it would be a mistake to interfere with these trivial issues with a profit-only mentality. This is proof that the National Government's decisive action this time can achieve the greatest results. (翔: Translated from the August 11th Western Asahi Shimbun)

### The Imperial Japanese Headquarters Announces the War Results of the Air Force's First Attack on the Enemy Airfield in Papua

Tokyo 17th (Central News Agency) The Imperial Japanese Headquarters announced today: Our air force attacked the enemy airfield in Papua, seventy kilometers from Lae, on the 15th and 16th.

The Japanese air force launched another long-range attack on August 15th and 16th, making a surprise attack on the enemy airfield in Papua, New Guinea for the first time, achieving great results. In this battle, a joint formation of Japanese fighters and bombers flew to the enemy airfield in Papua at 8:25 on the 15th, and immediately launched a fierce attack on more than 20 enemy Bell (P-39) and Curtiss (P-40) planes and 10 transport planes that were on air alert there.

In these two battles, the damage inflicted on the enemy was not only the shooting down of 32 enemy planes and the destruction of 5 enemy planes, but also, at a time when the United States was suffering from a shortage of air force personnel, the loss of enemy air force personnel in this battle was at least 50 or more. Such damage to the enemy army can be said to be even greater than the loss of its planes.

More than half of the American casualties in the Solomon battle

Tokyo 17th (Central News Agency) The war in the Solomon Islands has become increasingly fierce recently, and American losses have also been increasing daily. It is said that the total number of wounded and sick soldiers has reached 60% of the entire army. According to the statements of an American officer of the 42nd Division of the American army captured near New Georgia Island recently, and the records in the numerous documents confiscated, the actual situation is already clear. According to this investigation, the American 43rd Division, under the command of Major General Hester, landed on Rendova Island on June 30th. The number of troops was approximately 10,000. The American forces attacking the New Georgia Island area consisted of five to four enemy divisions, including a naval team, totaling approximately 45,000 to 60,000. Since the American landing, approximately 30 days ago, approximately 10,000 have been killed or wounded. The total number of those who have lost their combat effectiveness due to malignant malaria and mental illness has reached 60% of the total strength.

### The New Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy, ​​Kishi Ichiichi, Gives a Speech

Chinese and Japanese People Are Determined to Move Forward in Building the Future of Greater East Asia

Nanjing 17th (Central News Agency) The newly appointed Counselor and Director of Intelligence of the Japanese Embassy in China, Mr. Kishi Ichiichi, met with the Chinese press corps at the Embassy at 3 p.m. on the 17th. More than 20 reporters from various newspapers attended. Mr. Kishi answered the questions raised by the reporters in detail. The main points are recorded as follows: (Question) What are your aspirations at the beginning of your term? (Answer) I have been dedicated to the work of Sino-Japanese cooperation for half of my life, and my determination is very firm. This time, I am appointed as the Director of Intelligence of the Embassy, ​​and I deeply hope that Minister Lin of the Ministry of Propaganda of the National Government and the officials of the Ministry of Propaganda, especially the people in the friendly press, will give me guidance so that I can complete the mission entrusted to me. (Question) What are your views on general construction? (Answer) Nanjing has been affected by changes, and construction has been frustrated. However, since the National Government returned to the capital, it has been actively engaged in restoration and construction. At the time of the ongoing war, there are certain obstacles to completing the construction of Nanjing. I deeply hope that the municipal authorities will overcome all difficulties and actively promote it, so as to achieve success as soon as possible. As for the necessary conditions for construction, it should be carried out in both material and spiritual aspects. (Question) Are there any differences in opinion between the people of China and Japan regarding the construction of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere? (Answer) I believe that China and Japan should share the responsibility for revitalizing China and defending East Asia. If we look back at President Wang's remarks, this will prove that there is no difference of opinion between the people of China and Japan. Even if there are some differences of opinion between the people of the two countries regarding the construction of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere, the people of the two countries should be aware of the spirit of sharing weal and woe and living and dying together. They can also abandon their small differences and return to mutual cooperation, and move forward courageously towards the construction of Greater East Asia. (Question) Although traditional thinking has been influenced by Anglo-American thought in recent years, there is no hope of cleansing and correcting this. Chinese youth should now recognize the importance of the new era, sweep away the past thoughts of being immersed in the United Kingdom and the United States, and unite the youth of Japan and even the youth of all East Asian countries to advance towards the construction of a new world. (Question) What are your opinions on the construction of Greater Shanghai? (Answer) The construction of Greater Shanghai cannot be completed in a short period of time, but it can be implemented step by step according to the plan, and it can be seen that it will be a great success soon. In the near future, Greater Shanghai will become the economic center of China in name and reality, and the trade hub of the entire East Asia will also be located on the Shanghai Bund.

### New National Movement Outline - Lecture 3 (Continued)

— Wang Jingwei

Hard Work, Endurance, Courage, and Diligence

Article 6, the so-called disciplining. Its greatest significance is nothing more than protecting good people and eliminating bad people. Without discipline, good people will also turn bad. With discipline, bad people will also improve. Chinese people have always been accustomed to comfort and casualness. Upon hearing about disciplining, nine out of ten will shake their heads, yet it is absolutely necessary.

Article 7 speaks of frugality and production, extending from frugality and production to integrity. If an individual lacks integrity and a society lacks an atmosphere of integrity, there can be no talk of frugality or production. Where does the root of integrity lie? In being public-minded and forgetting self-interest. Being thrifty with oneself to enrich the country is the greatest meaning of integrity. Being able to be thrifty with oneself to enrich the country in peacetime enables one to sacrifice oneself to save the country in times of crisis. Being able to be honest and brave, corruption inevitably leads to cowardice.

In a protracted war, the nation whose people are most capable of enduring hardship and toil will be the closest to victory and will obtain victory. Why are individuals willing to endure hardship and toil? Because they are determined to be thrifty with themselves to enrich the country, and for the sake of the country, they will not hesitate to sacrifice themselves. What is there to fear? However, the so-called thrift and sacrifice are not passive but active. Because one is thrifty, the country becomes enriched; because one sacrifices oneself, the country is saved. For example, clothing and food are becoming increasingly difficult to obtain day by day. What is the reason? Communist bandits harass, first with guerrilla tactics, then with scorched earth. The countryside is devastated, and arable land lies barren. In addition, the Communist bandits carve up China into several small pieces. Transportation is cut off, and production stagnates. This is the reason for the lack of domestic production. Before the Greater East Asia War, taking food as an example, rice was imported annually from India, Annam, Thailand, and other places, with a record high of over 1.2 million tons and a minimum of 800,000 tons. Wheat was imported from Argentina, Australia, Canada, and other places, with a record high of over 1 million tons. Taking clothing as an example, cotton was imported from India, America, and other places, often exceeding 2 million metric tons. Since the war began, transportation has been temporarily interrupted. This is the reason for the shortage of foreign imports. The above reasons are unavoidable. However, why is it that other countries, under these unavoidable circumstances, can make controls work and fixed prices work, while China encounters obstacles everywhere? Some say that black markets also exist in foreign countries. That is true. Foreign countries also have black markets, but the black markets in foreign countries are like a snow-white tablecloth with a few black spots, insignificant. In China, however, the brushstrokes are large; a snow-white tablecloth has turned entirely black, with only a few white spots. What is the reason for this? It is nothing more than the difference between being public-minded and forgetting self-interest and being self-interested and forgetting the public good.

Students, forgetting the public good is forgetting the country. Forgetting the country will inevitably lead to the country's demise, without waiting for others to destroy it. If we want to be followers of the Three Principles of the People, to implement the New National Movement, and to strive to participate in the Greater East Asia War, so that China can be liberated from the war victoriously, from government officials to students, to the masses of all kinds of society, in peacetime, we must be thrifty with ourselves to enrich the country, endure hardship and toil, and in times of crisis, sacrifice ourselves to save the country, with courage and diligence. Apart from this, there is no other path to take. Under the lamp on August 13, 1943 (End of full text)

### Hsing-Ya Group Conference Passes Resolution of Gratitude to the National Government

Hsinking, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) The Hsing-Ya Group Conference, when it continued its second-day meeting on the 17th, unanimously passed a resolution of gratitude to the Government of the Republic of China. The resolution stated, in essence: Since the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Government of the Republic of China has consistently and actively cooperated based on the belief of sharing weal and woe with Japan. In January of this year, it resolutely declared war on Britain and America, determined to share life and death and to achieve victory. This is extremely firm. Because the Greater East Asia War is a holy war to eliminate the forces of Britain and America and liberate our Asia, your country's cooperation with Japan can be said to be based on the great ideal of Asian unity, sufficient to concretely express the spirit of Hsing-Ya, and the future of Hsing-Ya construction is limitless. Now, as comrades of Hsing-Ya gather together to exchange friendly words, we express our gratitude for the immense cooperation of your government with a unanimous resolution, and we respectfully wish your country prosperity and express our gratitude.

Hsinking, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) The Hsing-Ya Exchange Lecture Conference was held at the Hsinking Commemoration Hall at 7:00 PM on the 17th. Chinese representative Zhou Xuechang (Mayor of Nanjing), Japanese representative General Takahashi Mitsuyoshi, and Manchurian representative Minister of Education Lu Wen successively gave speeches, elucidating the determination of the Hsing-Ya nations to destroy England and establish a co-prosperity sphere. The thousands of listeners were deeply moved.

### Battles Increasingly Fierce in Belgrade Area, German Counterattack on Kharkov Front

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Havas reports: The German High Command announced in a war bulletin that the enemy's various local offensives in the Kuban bridgehead area and the middle reaches of the Donets River front have all failed. In the Belgrade area, the Red Army's offensives are becoming increasingly fierce, but after our infantry's heroic hand-to-hand combat and fierce counterattacks, they have been repelled. During this, our tank units and assault teams penetrated the enemy's flanks, encircling and annihilating the enemy's main force. The Red Army's offensive in the Orel area has weakened. In the Vyazma area, the Bely area, and the Lake Laiva area, the Red Army has increased its attacks, but the enemy is suffering heavy losses in both personnel and equipment everywhere. Yesterday alone, the enemy lost 193 tanks. Our air force is assisting the army, especially the southern and central armies, and has been quite successful in attacking enemy stations and deploying troops.

Berlin, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Colonel Hama, a military correspondent for the German News Agency, said: The battle of Belgrade has been going on for six weeks. Last Sunday, German tanks carried out a concentrated attack, resulting in an important tactical success. After several days of hard fighting, the German army has encircled a large group of Soviet troops, including about 100 tanks and several motorized rifle regiments. The Soviet troops of this group are now squeezed into a small area and are gradually being annihilated.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central News Agency Telegraph) Moscow reports: A bulletin issued by the Soviet Information Bureau last night acknowledged that German infantry and tank units launched a counterattack in the Kharkov area yesterday, but the bulletin did not specify the exact location of this counterattack.

Stockholm, Sweden, 17th (Central Press Agency Telegraph) According to Turkish newspapers, the Soviet army's losses in manpower and materials are completely beyond expectations. This was revealed by anti-Axis and neutral countries from Moscow to Istanbul. Reliable sources say that the Soviet army's losses in the seven months of this year totaled two million dead, wounded, and captured. The Soviet army's winter offensive resulted in 1.5 million deaths, and the summer offensive resulted in about 500,000 deaths. Moscow is extremely disappointed that it has suffered heavy sacrifices but has still not been able to overcome the resistance of the German army on the Eastern Front. On this day, France was attacked, and three bombers and eight fighters did not return to their bases afterward.

### Details of German-Italian Talks

Content of Talks

Germany and Italy recently held a meeting in northern Italy. The German side was represented by Foreign Minister Ribbentrop, Chief of the General Staff Marshal Keitel, and the new Italian government was represented by Foreign Minister Guariglia and Chief of Staff Ambrosio. They seemed to have carefully discussed the Axis relationship after Mussolini's resignation and the countermeasures for the war situation in the future. During the meeting, the Italian representatives reported on the process of the recent change in the domestic system and requested the understanding and recognition of the German government. At the same time, they also discussed extremely important operational issues regarding countermeasures for the increasingly urgent war situation in southern Europe. According to general observation, the Italian army, in defending the Italian mainland against the anti-Axis forces attacking from Sicily, requires at least 10 German divisions and 1,000 air force planes as reinforcements. The question is how many troops the German army can assist with. The German side believes that the Eastern Front cannot be abandoned absolutely, especially in the current situation when the Soviet army is exerting its fierce offensive power, so it cannot withdraw a large number of troops from the Eastern Front. However, after Mussolini's downfall, Italy's resistance may be on the verge of disintegration. As long as the Italian people express their determination to continue the war, the German government may draw a considerable number of troops to Italy depending on the situation on the Eastern Front. After reviewing the overall war situation, the German government seems to have decided to reinforce Italy with considerable troops.

Details of the Coup

Regarding the details of the Italian political change, there are also various rumors from the enemy side. Naturally, there are many uncertainties among them. Based on the information obtained from reliable sources, the general outline is as follows:

Dissatisfaction with the Fascist regime's war policy was expressed within the Italian government and the military. Even within the military, some people did not agree with Mussolini's war policy. This unstable situation had long been rumored among the Italian people. Since the Axis forces were forced to retreat in Sicily, the British military entered the Italian mainland day by day. The food situation also became increasingly difficult. Therefore, the anti-Mussolini sentiment among the Italian people gradually intensified. The intention of some people in the military to ask Mr. Mussolini to resign became even more pronounced. On July 24th, when the British and American forces entered Sicily, the situation became extremely urgent. Moreover, even within the Sicilian front, people opposed Mr. Mussolini emerged. With the situation becoming so critical, it was impossible to draw troops to the Italian mainland when the decisive battle on the Eastern Front was approaching. Therefore, Mr. Mussolini had no choice but to agree to conduct a joint Italo-German operation against the Allied forces in southern Italy. On the same day, upon receiving reports that the British and American armies were approaching Rome, he abruptly returned to Rome. At that point, Count Grandi, who opposed Mr. Mussolini for party reasons within the Sicilian front, demanded a public vote of no confidence from Mr. Mussolini, passing a resolution demanding Mr. Mussolini's resignation. (Note: Translated from the August 11th edition of the Eastern Asahi Shimbun)

Outlook on the Situation

Regarding the recent meeting between the new officials of the Italian government, the Asahi Shimbun commented on August 1st as follows:

On July 19th, the two giants, Hitler and Mussolini, met in Bologna, northern Italy, to come up with a plan to save Italy. Besides obtaining more powerful assistance from Germany, there was no other way. Under these desperate circumstances, Mr. Mussolini left Rome on the 17th and went to Feltre, a border town north of Bologna, to meet with Hitler, presenting the facts of Sicily and requesting reinforcements. During that meeting, Hitler refused to call the joint meeting he had promised earlier. Mr. Mussolini strongly opposed the convening of that meeting. Excluding the period from 6:00 PM on July 24th to 3:00 AM on July 25th, Mr. Mussolini first reported the beginning and end of his meeting with Hitler, followed by Count Grandi claiming that the failure to obtain sufficient German assistance in Mr. Mussolini's North Italian negotiations led to the political failure, and convened the first important German-Italian meeting in a certain place with a discussion vote of 19 to 7. It is very common for the heads of diplomacy and military affairs of the country to hold consultations, but the meeting after the change of the Italian government is for the future of the cooperation of the two countries in the midst of the raging war), so it is truly worthy of attention.

In all wars, no matter how much the superficial glory shines, there are always deep and great regrets inside. The European war has reached an extremely important period since last month. The back-and-forth is originally a common thread of war, but now, on one side, the blitzkrieg has stopped, and the total offensive posture is like the collapse of a great river. On the other side, the anti-Axis side takes the tactic of individual strikes and advances step by step. First, they fight the German and Italian armies in Sicily. If they succeed, they will cross the Strait of Messina and head north. At the same time, they will bombard the German and Italian countries with fierce firepower. However, the German and Italian armies, since they often face this situation, are willing to cooperate. With the collapse of the people's morale of the two countries, those in power cannot help but gather to discuss and implement measures to deal with the newly emerging situation.

Originally, Anglo-Saxon propaganda was extremely clever, a kind of psychological warfare that disturbed people's minds. But the arrogant England is now hoping that the defeated two countries will remember the relationship between the previous war and this war and deeply study its meaning. Assuming that the United States and the United Kingdom were to win, this would choose two brutal countries.

Then, the dismembered beating of the German and Italian countries will make their people no longer have the possibility of regaining their strength. This is not imaginable. Perhaps some people predict that Europe may be at risk of becoming red, but the United States and the United Kingdom will be satisfied only if they achieve the goal of controlling the world, and the interests of the various nations of the European continent are not in their eyes at all. Even if there is a risk of becoming red, just give each a small room for a while. If it cannot be solved slowly, perhaps consider using other methods. In short, in the so-called war of being eaten, no retreat is allowed, with beginnings and no ends, so the current urgent task, in addition to suppressing the total force of war and igniting the will to war, should be viewed from a high place, exerting the greatest force to narrow and utilize the war power. (Note: Translated from the August 11th edition of the Fourth Regional Newspaper).

### School Opening Dates in the Urban Area

The education authorities of this city stated that the school opening dates for the autumn semester have been unified for all schools in the urban area and Districts 1 and 8. Middle schools are scheduled to open on the 24th of this month, and elementary schools on the 22nd. The subsidies for private schools in District 1 that were approved and issued by the former Municipal Council will continue to be issued, and they will be further cared for. The second installment of subsidies for this year has already been notified to the schools that should receive them, and they can take their receipts to the Education Office to claim them from today onwards.

Reasons for Poor Student Performance

The academic performance of students in Shanghai schools has generally declined. The reasons for this are no more than the following: 1. Unsuitable teaching materials. The national textbooks currently adopted by various schools are indeed the most ideal textbooks to meet the needs of the current situation, but after careful study of their content, there are also places that should be improved. 2. Unsuitable curriculum standards. The pace of teaching often does not match the level of understanding of the students. 3. Teachers cannot attend classes on time, and principals take a perfunctory attitude. This is because prices are rising every day, life is difficult, and teachers' monthly income is too low. Therefore, they have no choice but to take on more hours to earn more income to maintain their livelihood. Students' academic progress is greatly affected. The authorities are most concerned about the last point and have decided to gradually find ways to improve the treatment of teachers and staff. After their lives are stabilized, they will be able to teach with peace of mind.

### Various Offices in the Urban Area Temporarily Use Old Seals, News Prevention Has Not Been Issued Yet

Since the implementation of the takeover of the two concessions, the administration of Greater Shanghai has become unified.

The details have already been reported in the newspapers. It has been learned that although the district offices have been established, they will temporarily use the old seals before the new seals are received.

### Adhesive Paper for Glass Windows, Various Districts Notify One After Another

The police authorities recently notified various stores to vertically paste strips of tough paper on windows and glass doors and windows. This was first implemented in the Old Gate District, and starting yesterday, the various Baojia districts in the First District have followed suit. The Baojia heads separately notified the stores and residents in their respective jurisdictions to handle the matter in accordance with the law. As for the pasting method, it varies slightly depending on the situation, but the purpose is to prevent the glass from breaking. It has also been learned that other districts outside the First District seem to be preparing to handle the matter in succession.

### Egg Rationing Measures

Regarding the egg rationing matters, it is learned that all the eggs will be allocated on the principle of half to the export group and half to the domestic sales group. If either party needs more or less, the board of directors of the association will decide to temporarily change the allocation. When duck eggs are needed for export, the export group will be allocated up to 50 percent. If there is no need for export, all the duck eggs will be allocated to the domestic sales group. Preserved eggs and salted eggs will all be allocated to the domestic sales group. The association allocates eggs to its members, but egg merchants who only have purchasing power and no egg shop facilities, even if they join the association as members, have no allocation rights. Egg allocation is divided into direct allocation and indirect allocation. Direct allocation is directly allocated by the association to its members on a regular basis. Indirect allocation is available to retail egg shops, those who sell eggs in addition to other businesses, and egg vendors in this city who register to apply for allocation. Egg prices are divided into five types: A, B, C, D, and E. The association will announce them on a regular or daily basis. Egg prices are subject to change, either up or down. When prices rise, the board of directors of the association will stipulate the announcement to be implemented within the specified date. When prices fall, the board of directors of the association will announce the purchase.

### Swatow Disaster Relief Society's Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition Completed Successfully

Most of the Calligraphy and Paintings Donated by This Newspaper Have Been Sold

The Swatow Disaster Relief Society held a charity calligraphy and painting exhibition for three days. The venue was provided free of charge by the Ningbo Association. Most of the exhibits were donated by the North China Emergency Relief Calligraphy and Painting Charity Exhibition organized by this newspaper. During the three-day exhibition period, more than 2,000 people visited, and sales amounted to about 80,000 yuan. The horizontal scroll "It is Most Joyful to Do Good" handwritten by the president of the society was purchased by Zhou Guoshi for 3,000 yuan. The Eighteen Provinces Scenic Map painted by elderly Wu Xingfen, originally valued at 30,000 yuan, was bidded up to 36,000 yuan by Chaozhou merchant Wang Longzhang. The money, after sending 6,000 yuan to the Shanghai charity organization, will be used for disaster relief in Swatow. The works of famous artists such as Mayor Chen, Minister Ding, Layman Ye, Xu Lang, Zhang Qihou, Tai Geng, Wang Chao, Wu Ou, Tian Zhouxiang, Feng Kai, Liu Jiao, Sheng Li Fangyuan, Jin Mengshi, Hong Shuan, Zha Haiju, Chen Tianxiao, and Xiao Kangshi were all sold.

### First District Revision: Rules for Subleasing

The First District Public Office, in order to revise the rules for subleasing house licenses, hereby issues a public notice stating: Upon investigation of the rules for subleasing house licenses, this office has decided to revise them starting from September 1st of this year, so as to make them applicable in a more appropriate manner, extending to shops, and not limited to residences. The revised articles are as follows: Article 3 (A) If the subleased house is used for business purposes, the profit obtained by the licensee shall not exceed 50% of the rent paid to the owner. As for the amount of house tax, license fee, water and electricity fees, and other expenses (if any) paid by the licensee, all shall be handled in accordance with the third article.

### Public Servants: No Exemption from Taxes

The Datong News Agency reports, according to the "Times" newspaper, the "Times" reporter learned yesterday that the First District Public Office, in order to investigate any government offices or any individuals or cooperative warriors employed by the First District Public Office who evade the 10% surtax on lodging and meals and the 2% retail tax on goods, specially posted a notice yesterday to strictly prohibit such behavior. All are requested to pay attention. At the same time, it is hoped that all relevant personnel will report any violations of the law at any time. According to investigations, some staff members of the First District Public Office falsely claimed in hotels and restaurants that public servants have the right to tax exemption and refused to pay taxes. In fact, the scope of official tax exemption currently only refers to official use, and individual employees working in government offices do not have the right to tax exemption. Restaurants, cafes, etc., have been notified by the authorities that they should not allow any public servants to enjoy this special privilege in the future. Any individual who refuses to pay taxes by force should be taken to the public office immediately. This method also applies when paying the 2% retail tax on goods. Purchasers of official goods must hold official certificates before they are allowed tax exemption. This certificate must be left in the store after the purchase for the First District Public Office to review. Finally, it is clearly stated that the claim that employees employed by the First District Public Office and the National Government have the right to tax exemption is completely false.

### Seeking Citizen Opinions on the Facilities of Greater Shanghai Municipality

August 1st is the day when Shanghai's municipal administration becomes unified. The new construction of Greater Shanghai Municipality after this day is of great importance to Shanghai's future and the welfare of its citizens. Therefore, the direction of municipal administration deserves the attention of citizens. And the quality of facilities, before the establishment of a representative body, should be expressed by citizens with utmost sincerity.

It is planned to publish on the first day of each month, starting from September. All citizens who have opinions on the dynamics, advantages, disadvantages, progress, and regression of various aspects of municipal facilities should write them into text and send them to the editor's office of this newspaper before the 28th of the previous month (the deadline for submissions for September is the 28th of this month). We will compile and disclose them. If there is a need for confidentiality, we will also forward them to the municipal authorities for reference. However, the content of the text must be truthful and the description concise and to the point. Absolutely no empty talk is allowed.

### Office for Purchasing Yarn and Cloth Officially Established Yesterday; Chief and Deputy Chief Took Office Simultaneously

The Central News Agency reports that the National General Association of Commerce, under orders to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, has completed preparations for its office, which was officially established yesterday. The Director, Mr. Tu Lusheng, and the Deputy Director, Mr. Cao Boquan, repeatedly declined, but after repeated retention by Chairman Tang, they both arrived at the association at 10 AM yesterday (the 17th) to take office simultaneously. They are temporarily working at the association's address and are actively and carefully drafting a distribution plan for cotton yarn and cloth for implementation. All cotton yarn and cloth purchased from Chinese and Japanese merchants will be distributed uniformly and handled in the same way, without distinction.

Cloth Purchase Prices to be Decided in the Short Term

It was learned recently from relevant sources that the National Defense Council has only decided on the price of one type of cotton yarn for purchase, that is, 10,000 yuan per bundle of 20-count double-strand blue yarn. The prices of all other types of yarn and cloth have not yet been decided. However, there are more than a hundred types of yarn and cloth, and even within the same type, there are differences in quality. Therefore, the decision on purchase prices must be extremely thorough. Accordingly, the relevant authorities have now decided on a principle, that is, 10,000 yuan per bundle of 20-count blue phoenix yarn will be the standard for all types of cotton yarn, with increases or decreases accordingly. The yarn price will also be the standard for various cotton cloths to determine the amount of the purchase price. As for goods of inferior quality, prices will be determined separately to ensure fairness. The relevant Chinese and Japanese authorities plan to establish a "Price Review Committee" in the short term, and then proceed with the purchase based on the decided prices.

### Shanghai West Police Bureau; Zhao Zhijia Succeeds as Director; Pan Da Promoted to Municipal Government Counselor

Pan Da, Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, has been transferred to be a counselor of the Municipal Government. The vacancy has been filled by the Municipal Government appointing Ji Zhijia to take over. The transfer ceremony was held on the 17th. After the new Director Zhao took office, he immediately spoke to the police officers, encouraging them to work harder and provide better service. He said that he would abide by the Mayor's instructions and try to improve their treatment. He also hoped that they would carry forward the spirit of the police and create well-being for the people of Shanghai West. It is also heard that Director Zhao is a graduate of the police academy and has served in the police force in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Jiangxi, Beijing, and Shanghai for a long time. After returning to the capital, he successively served as the Director of the Police Affairs Department of the Ministry of Police Administration, Deputy Director-General of the Police Administration Department of the Ministry of Interior, and Director of the Police Affairs Department. He has written many police books.

Pan Da Publishes on His Handling of Police Affairs in Shanghai West

Since Pan Da, Director of the Shanghai West Police Bureau, has been in charge of police affairs in Shanghai West for two and a half years, he has achieved remarkable results. Shanghai West was once known as a "den of thieves," but now it has become a paradise. Now Mr. Pan has been promoted to the position of Senior Counselor of the Municipal Government of this city. It is learned that Mr. Pan studied political economy at St. John's University twenty years ago and was highly regarded by President Bu Fangqian. After leaving school, he served as an accountant and held important positions in the business community, and also served as a special policeman in the Public Concession for more than ten years. He is talented in both literary and military affairs and is good at making quick decisions. He has now resigned from his police duties and is fully engaged as a counselor to the Municipal Government. The reporter visited him and received the following statement:

The Bad Name of "Den of Thieves" is Eliminated

I have always studied political economy and also liked to study police affairs. Before the incident, I served as a special policeman in the Public Concession for more than ten years and have some knowledge of police affairs. On February 1, 1941, the Nanj Government and the Public Concession signed the Shanghai Four Special Police Agreement, establishing the Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters, which was the beginning of China's recovery of extraterritorial police power. I was appointed Director of the Headquarters by Mayor Chen and with the love of friendly countries. At that time, the Shanghai West area was extremely chaotic, with opium dens lining the streets and bandits robbing in broad daylight. With the guidance of Yongchangguan and the efforts of all police officers, all the evils in the area were almost completely eliminated within a few months. Citizens were able to live and work in peace, and the bad name of "den of thieves" in Shanghai West was eliminated from then on. In addition, household surveys, the holding of flat rice, the mediation of factory unrest, and the implementation of price controls were all carried out diligently. At that time, there were specialists of Chinese, British, and Japanese nationalities in the Headquarters. Through timely adjustments, they were able to cooperate with each other and smoothly implement policies.

The Security of Shanghai West is More Established

On May 1, 1942, the agreement to abolish extraterritorial road rights in Shanghai West was officially abolished and completely recovered, which was the prelude to the recovery of the concession. The Shanghai West Special Police Headquarters was reorganized into the Shanghai Special Municipality Shanghai Four Police Bureau, and I have been the director to this day for more than a year. During this period, the security of Shanghai West has been further established. In addition to requiring police officers to perform their duties diligently, I have also encouraged them to study, established libraries, and opened sports fields to cultivate their body and mind. Currently, most of the officials are graduates of police academies or have received special training. Even the lower-level male and female police officers are often trained and have considerable knowledge of academic and technical subjects. All police officers can perform their duties honestly and with integrity and serve the country and the people. Now that the concessions have been recovered and the administrative power of the entire city of Shanghai is completely unified, the transitional mechanism set up to recover extraterritorial police power should be withdrawn. I can now relieve myself of my responsibilities and avoid mistakes. I am even more fortunate to be able to serve at the Mayor's side and seek to improve my knowledge. Although I dare not say that I will achieve success and reward, I can be pleased. However, I have served in Shanghai West for more than two years and have been spared any major mistakes. This is due to the tolerance of my superiors, the assistance of friendly countries, the understanding of the people, and the encouragement of friends. Therefore, I will never forget my gratitude.

### The Premise for Strengthening Production Activities

Since the authorities' management committee abolished speculation, the floating capital in the market has been moving towards normal channels. Especially after the recent forceful implementation of suppressing prices and cracking down on hoarding, the powerful elements in the financial world are trying to induce floating capital into the production sector, which presents a significant phenomenon. This situation naturally needs to be nurtured and developed.

After the decision to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, a great impetus was given to the economic sector. As far as individual enterprises are concerned, it may have been hit, but as far as the entire production activity of Shanghai is concerned, it is undoubtedly sufficient to expand it.

Since the strengthening of production activities is the key to economic recovery, the authorities should remove old difficulties and strive to achieve it. Everything related to the transportation of raw materials, the supply of power and labor, and the guarantee of sales should be facilitated as much as possible. Sufficient financial assistance is also extremely important. If the proper conditions are met, active assistance should be provided. This is the most effective method to stimulate production and also contains the effect of promoting lower prices. Its impact is very large.

The most important thing to promote production activities is to guarantee the safety of capital. At the same time, the state of psychological anxiety must also be eradicated. How to ensure the safety of capital depends on the authorities collecting practical opinions, conducting sincere discussions, and establishing concrete measures. In addition, the Japanese side should actively support and provide loyal advice to the fundamental policy of economic recovery in Central China to achieve its mission. (Abridged translation from the Continental New Daily, August 17)

### Materials Investigation Committee to Hold Three Meetings; Will Continue to Investigate Other Hoarded Materials

The Materials Investigation Committee is investigating hoarded materials in this city. The first step is to investigate cotton yarn and cloth. After the Chinese and Japanese investigators led investigators to complete the investigation of the cotton yarn and cloth stored in 233 public warehouses in the first, eighth districts, they continued to investigate the yarn and cloth stored in 70 private warehouses. It is estimated that all investigations can be completed within this week. At the same time, they are also reviewing the investigation reports of the investigators. When unregistered cotton yarn and cloth are found, they will be reported to the competent authorities for disposal. It is reported that the committee has now scheduled to hold a third official report meeting on the 20th of this month to report the investigation results and put them to discussion. In addition, they will discuss further investigation work. As for other materials...

### Procedures for Applying for Transfer of Materials from Three Provinces and Two Cities

When important materials are transferred from the three provinces and two cities to other regions, it is necessary to first apply for a transfer permit from the local competent authorities, and then apply to the Approval Affairs Group of the General Association of Commerce for the issuance of a transfer approval certificate based on the permit. However, the association only issues transfer approval certificates to shippers who have joined the local trade association as members. Otherwise, it will not be approved. Recently, in order to make it clear to merchants and residents in various places regarding this application procedure, the General Association of Commerce has transferred the administrative Yuan to the North China Political Affairs Committee and the provincial and municipal governments and special district administrative offices outside the three provinces and cities, respectively, and instructed the competent authorities to inform the applicants of this requirement when applying for transfer permits, so as to avoid complications.

### Newly Established Insurance Companies Not Allowed to Register

According to the Insurance Interpretation of the Ministry of Industry, these newly established insurance companies are all those that have completed the registration procedures before the deadline.

### Funds to Support Various Industries from Bank Associations; Central Reserve Bank Agrees to Provide

The Central Reserve Bank and the Bank United Reserve Committee and the Money Industry United Reserve Bank are adjusting the funds of the industry and stabilizing the market. They agree to supply funds to manage lending and maintain the industry. The entire financial situation has become stable. The shortage of funds is not as tight as in the past. Small banks have been adjusted and have become stable. Therefore, in addition to the shutdown of the Jiangsu and Zhejiang Enterprise Bank, other companies have not suffered unfortunate incidents. Yesterday, it was learned that in order to consolidate their own foundations, each bank and association has reviewed the issue of loans and strictly followed the three restrictions issued by the Ministry of Finance and the new loan method passed by the silver and money industries. The mortgage loans for goods have been particularly tightened. Food, yarn, cloth, and daily necessities are completely rejected. They will try their best to reduce credit loans. However, if each industry needs funds for the development of livelihood projects, the bank and association will still approve the loan as appropriate and set the maximum loan amount based on the actual situation of each industry. As for the funds needed by each bank and association to support each industry, they will be supplied by the Central Reserve Bank and then loaned by the bank and association to each industry. It is said that the interest rate is lower than usual. The bank and association that receive the funds supplied by the Central Reserve Bank must report the loans they handle to the Central Reserve Bank for inspection.

### Rationing of Matches Still Pending Approval

The matter of rationing matches in this city, by the association, is said to have come to a conclusion. The total number of households in the city and the amount of allocation have been meticulously calculated. Generally, the allocation amount per period is usually around 1,000 cases. It is currently being submitted to the Commerce and Trade Control Board for approval. Once approved, it will be implemented. Therefore, the black market price of matches imported from Japan has been plummeting drastically.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Gold and Silver: Gold ornaments are still not being exchanged in gold and silver shops. The price for foreign transactions fluctuates inside and outside the customs area, causing uncertainty. It initially rose within the customs area in the morning, but returned by midday, with a slight overall increase compared to yesterday. Taels of fine silver are at the small customs area.

Public Bonds: Unified public bonds are slightly recovering in the market. Types A, B, and C are outside the 19th customs area, Type D is at 18, and Type C is above 23. All bonds have increased by several yuan.

Rice: The food market in Shanghai is declining, and households are mostly selling off their stocks, making the situation slightly flat and sluggish. Du rice has fallen to the 19th customs area, general rice is around the 9th customs area, soybean cakes have fallen by more than ten, and other items have also fallen.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday's decline initially weakened before suddenly rebounding around noon, a change that was unexpected. Initially affected by selling pressure, it was later absorbed by investors taking advantage of low prices. New accounts were actively buying, pushing the price up in the afternoon. The decline from the noon break was almost entirely recovered. Various speculations and rumors resurfaced, and morale in all quarters turned upward again. New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory of the New Pharmaceutical Industry first broke into the 100 customs area, but was forcefully pushed out of the customs area by powerful accounts at noon, although it was still slightly lower than the noon price of the previous day. China-France rebounded after breaking the 7 customs area, and Xinyi also experienced a slight increase overall. New Star remained within the 3 customs area, Scientific Chemical had few transactions, and Xinxin of the department store industry returned to the 4 customs area significantly. This was likely due to the rapid rise over the past two days, with share prices already high after subscription, leading to profit-taking. Wing On and China Emporium each saw small declines of dozens. In Chinese Underwear, there were many sellers within the white customs area. Jingfu shirts saw prices enter within the 4th Pavilion, with brisk trading. The market had turned firm by noon. Jinglun continued to decline slightly, within one or two customs areas. Guan An Department Store opened at half a hundred. Wing On Textile Factory of the weaving industry saw the most severe decline, falling to the 14 customs area. Although it stabilized later, it still experienced a small decline of half a hundred. Wuhe traded outside the 4 customs area. Hongsheng and Great China Weaving both saw rebounds. Other stocks, including Jiaxin, Guoxin, and Xinfeng, also recovered later. Great China Matches retreated into the 4 customs area. Nanyang Tobacco Company stabilized at the 6 customs area at noon. Zhabei Water and Electricity of the public utility sector saw small fluctuations of dozens. China Merchants Electric Company reported firmness, and Public Utilities Motor Company maintained a stable trend. The prices of Commercial Press and World Book Company of the cultural industry remained flat. China Bookstore retreated to the 1000 customs area. Yongxiang Printing and Dying, Jinling Paper Mill, Standard Paper Products all traded above the previous day's price.

### Shanghai in the Summer of 1943

— Yuan Ying

Prologue

Air conditioning, electric fans, ice cream, soda, watermelon…

Swimming pools, sunglasses, Hong Kong shirts, yellow shorts…

The scorching sun is high, extending its boundless arms, casting fiery light, fiery heat.

The asphalt melts, and a dark light flickers on the ground…

1943 has arrived in Shanghai.

Dance Halls

Charming lights, confusing music, hot embraces, colorful indulgence.

A Westerner in a white uniform plays the piano, sweating as he draws out beautiful melodies. A pink girl sings "Roses, roses bloom everywhere…" in front of the microphone.

Late at night, dragging their tired bodies, carrying slender waists, tricycle after tricycle disappears into the dim streetlights.

Restaurants

"Come on! One more glass!"

"No! I really can't anymore!"

"What does it matter? Drunk? Make a call to Yangzi, or Nanjing! Come on: cheers!"

"No! I have something to do tomorrow!"

"What important thing… In this day and age, be happy while you can! As long as there are women…"

The electric fan stirs the thin silk shirt, and the glasses are raised again in laughter….

Tea Rooms

"Open! Ah! Yao Er Si, Seven points, small:" The sharp female voice trembled.

"This time it must be small!"

"No, it's been small four times in a row… I say this time it's big!"

"…"

Although the electric fan is spinning constantly, people are still sweating, constantly sweating nervously, sweating hotly, sweating coldly….

"Open! Ba Ah! Liu Liu Er, Fourteen points, big:"

Those who bet big receive the thrown banknotes, showing satisfied smiles. Those who bet small tremble and throw down their only stack.

Swimming Pools

Red and green, men and women, immersed in the water, lying on the chairs; laughter flies up from the water, male voices, female voices; songs float from the rattan chairs, lightly, softly….

"Miss Xu, are you coming tomorrow?"

"Mr. Gao! How about you?"

"I will definitely come! How about you?"

"What if it rains?"

"I'll still come!"

Shake hands and say goodbye, see you tomorrow.

Theaters

"Sold Out"!

"A riot of colors!"

People are crowded inside and outside the entrance, the scent of powder, the smell of sweat.

The ticket office is surrounded by several flesh walls, young girls sweating non-stop waving their arms, tickets are being torn off constantly…

"Five balcony tickets!"

"Six downstairs tickets!"

"Two tickets!"

Ticket prices, 20 yuan, 25 yuan, 30 yuan…

Soda Fountains

Ceiling fans make a faint noise, flashing white light.

Waiters carry trays, darting back and forth like梭魚…

"Hey! Two ice creams!"

"Hey! Boy! Two bottles of soda!…"

"…"

Iced soda cools people's hearts, cools people's blood….

Roads

The scorching sun covers…

Under the long banners of "Summer Bargain Sales," flow heads of various kinds of people, all kinds of different decorations, and all kinds of figures.

Hong Kong shirts, yellow shorts, sunglasses, yellow "leather" wallets, white "leather" shoes, painted toenails, revealed in the openwork places,

colors, yellow, green, blue, white, an eye-dazzling sight….

Thunderous cars drive by, and the scorching wind can't remove the emerging sweaty smell.

Watermelon sellers show off their tricks

"No sweetness, no money, hey… one copper coin buys a piece! Hey!…"

Could it be that we have really returned to ten years ago?…

### Bugle

— Lan Yi

Midsummer Night!

Shooting stars fly out of the Milky Way;

Casting a coquettish smile. I caress the tarnished,

The copper-green bugle,

And again stirs up undulating emotional ripples, profound and distant thoughts!

I vaguely recall the drawn-out sounds in the dawn breeze.

The heroic bugle sounds,

When will the heroic sound that welcomes dawn be blown again?

Confined in the shed, the rusty bugle!

! Loan Subsidy

### Comfort

— Liang Meng

Everyone needs comfort, especially young people who are wandering in pain.

If one blindly pursues comfort and indulges in it, comfort will become a insidious enemy.

People need love, but if one is merely drunk in this circle, regret will follow.

Comfort must be transformed into encouragement, driving people to strive for success.

### Summer Night Chat about Cicadas

— Xu Huiguang

Spring breeze and peach blossoms, autumn rain and梧桐 trees. Every season, nature deliberately renders it without the slightest carelessness; what adorns summer is the sound of cicadas chirping loudly in the green trees:

The gradually increasing temperature on the thermometer, coupled with the cacophonous cicada sounds outside the window, gives people a feeling of heat. What makes me more cordial is the joy of playing in my childhood. Listening to the cicada sounds, I think of my younger brother in my hometown or my companions, holding long bamboo poles, and sweating while catching cicadas!

Three or four weeks later, carrying a book, I returned to the dormitory to sleep. The light in the room was dim. The windows were all open. The moonlight outside the window was like water, and the sparse shadows of willow trees swayed on the white walls. Several friends were lying on the bed, talking about everything under the sun. I turned on the light.

"Swish…!" With a sound, suddenly a cicada flew in from outside the window, circling the light, flying and bumping around.

"Thud!" With a sound, it fell from the wall to the ground. I hurried over to catch it.

"Zhila…," the cicada vibrated its thin wings, and my heart was filled with joy.

"Let it go!" Humanitarianism and the selfishness of childhood intertwined in my heart, making me hesitate.

My friends seemed very happy too. Talking shifted to the cicada, most of them advocating letting it go. So I stretched my hand out the window and threw it into the sky.

"Swish…!" The cicada still flew in from outside the window, circling the light, flying and bumping around, and finally fell to the ground again. Releasing it and it flying back in happened three times in a row. Finally, I turned off the light and let it go. Lying in bed, thinking about this little animal's love of light, I tossed and turned and couldn't fall asleep.

Loving light is the nature of most animals. Even the slightest like bees and flies, the scene of them flying around on glass windows makes people feel moved! Cicadas love light, but because of blindly pursuing it, they are more likely to be destroyed. Children take advantage of their weakness of blindly pursuing light, tying a circular wire ring to the long bamboo pole for catching cicadas, attaching a cone-shaped paper bag to the wire ring, and cutting off some of the tip of the bag with scissors, revealing a small hole to let in light. When the paper bag covers the cicada, the cicada feels darkness and rushes to the light, entering the tip of the bag, and it is trapped in the small tip of the bag, being caught with "no place to display its heroism."

Seeing cicadas makes me think of moths. Although people have different opinions, these little lives pursuing light, the spirit of sacrificing themselves and stepping into fire without hesitation, is enough to move people!
