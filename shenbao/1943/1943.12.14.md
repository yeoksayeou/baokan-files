### Benefiting Without Great Expense

Since the handover of the Shanghai concessions, four and a half months have passed. Recalling the fervent joy and deep expectations expressed by people from all walks of life at the beginning of the handover, it is evident that citizens undeniably care about municipal affairs. This newspaper considers serving as the voice of the people its duty. In addition to following the contributions of various sectors to municipal affairs, it also summarizes all the details of improvement into three major guidelines: first, conveying public opinion; second, employing talented individuals; and third, rectifying official corruption. It aims to achieve effective governance through well-defined principles. The citizens themselves, not the municipal authorities, are directly affected by good governance. However, improving municipal administration is the responsibility of the municipal authorities, not something individual citizens can accomplish. Therefore, it is only natural for citizens to express their suffering, and it is also within the authorities' duty to listen and adopt their opinions. However, it is also common for citizens to express their opinions frankly due to their firsthand experiences of suffering. At the same time, municipal authorities should be very careful with every word and action under special circumstances. Reforms must be carefully considered, and citizens should also understand the authorities' difficulties when their hearts are willing but their strength is insufficient. Officials and the people are originally one, and their close unity can not only achieve twice the result with half the effort but also remove all obstacles to restoring brightness with common strength. In any case, major and long-term problems may inevitably take time. Four months is only a hundred and several dozen days. Seeking significant achievements too quickly may be inappropriate, especially today. Therefore, we assume that the issues identified or discussed in the previous four or five months are under consideration by municipal leaders. Perhaps there are still some difficulties preventing their implementation. We should wait for the right time and refrain from being repetitive. Here, we only mention a few trivial matters that can benefit the citizens greatly with a little effort from the municipal authorities.

Shanghai's streets are known for their cleanliness among Chinese cities. However, recently, dirt has accumulated on sidewalks for days without being cleared. The areas around trash cans are littered, making it necessary to hold one's nose even in winter. This not only damages the appearance but also affects hygiene. Citizens who experience this firsthand cannot help but speak out. This is the first point.

The purpose of public transportation is to serve the public. Any inconveniences to the public should be eliminated. For example, how to maintain order on buses and trams, and how to ensure that drivers and ticket sellers are polite and courteous, all require rectification. The respective companies are directly responsible, and the municipal authorities, who are responsible for supervision, should also make their best efforts to improve the situation. Citizens rely on the convenience of public transportation for their livelihood, something that officials may not be able to imagine. This is why they cannot help but speak out. This is the second point.

Setting up checkpoints at junctions is necessary during extraordinary times. Their purpose is to ensure public security, not to harass the people. Therefore, relevant regulations should be displayed in prominent places so that people know what to do. If there are violations and punishments, the enforcers have a basis, and the punished are also convinced. The municipal authorities may not be aware of everything, and citizens who experience difficulties in their travels cannot help but speak out. This is the third point.

The above three points only focus on the most trivial aspects of travel, presented to the municipal authorities for improvement, hoping that they will not be hindered or shelved again. If the municipal authorities can consider the suffering of citizens in their travels and strictly order their subordinates not to make excuses, results can be achieved quickly. We are willing to wait and see.

### Fierce Battles Unfolding in the Area Between Shinhama and Zonggu River; Large Formations of Japanese Aircraft Attack Ramu Valley

The Chongqing side has dispatched the 58th, 71st, and Provisional 2nd armies, which are mobile units of the 9th War Zone, to rush north to assist. These secondary aid troops had not yet formally confronted the Japanese army when they lost their will to fight. Although the supervisory teams were urging them tightly, they were cowardly and did not move forward. Instead, they constructed positions on the mountain tops to avoid Japanese artillery fire. On the contrary, the Japanese army skillfully carried out encirclements, gradually shrinking the encirclement. The Japanese army air force also cooperated with this and continuously bombed the Chongqing army's positions, inflicting heavy blows on the Chongqing army. Currently, this secondary Chongqing army is also in the same situation as the initial aid troops, gradually facing the crisis of being annihilated.

### Ministry of Finance Actively Preparing Next Year's National Government New Budget, Determining That Revenue and Expenditure Can Maintain Balance

Nanjing, 13th (Central News Agency) - Chen Zhishuo, Vice Minister of Finance, met with Chinese and foreign reporters at the ministry at 3:00 PM yesterday (the 13th). He patiently answered various questions from the reporters regarding the National Government's budget for the coming year and the recent policies of the financial authorities. The full record is as follows:

"The National Government's New Budget for Next Year" The Ministry of Finance has been actively preparing the National Government's entire budget for next year for a long time. However, the price index has now increased again, and next year's budget is expected to be twice as high as in the past. It is planned to slightly increase the military expenditure, but at most it will not exceed 60%. All detailed plans are currently being actively reviewed. This procedure will be completed within this year.

"Recent Situation of Surveying and Coordinating Rural Finance" Under the current wartime system, rural production is the lifeblood of the country. Therefore, increasing agricultural production is an urgent task. However, in order to increase agricultural production, it is essential to survey and coordinate rural finance. The Bank of Communications is currently solely responsible for agricultural loans. The total amount of the first phase of loans was 10 million yuan, and the period was several months or even half a year. The results were very good. The bank is now planning to continue the second phase of lending, with the amount still being 10 million yuan, which can be realized soon.

"Circulation of Central Reserve Bonds in the Suhuai District" The Central Reserve Bond is the National Government's sole currency, and it has been operating smoothly since its introduction. In order to adjust the monetary system in the Suhuai area, the authorities stipulated that the Central Reserve Bond would be used in conjunction with the United Reserve Bank Bond in the Suhuai Special Zone, starting on December 1st. Although it has been implemented for only a short time, the situation is quite good. Circulation and other aspects are relatively smooth. It is rumored that prices in the area have risen since the two currencies were used together, which is an inevitable phenomenon after the implementation of the two currencies. It is believed that after the entire adjustment, it will definitely be able to achieve stability.

"The Increase in Reserve Bonds Affects Prices" Recently, various types of bonds in Shanghai have risen sharply, which has a significant impact on social finance and a correlated relationship with rising prices. The Ministry of Finance attaches great importance to this and has also consulted the Ministry of Industry to pay close attention to its development. When necessary, effective measures will be discussed to conform to the National Government's intention to stabilize finance.

"Construction Public Bonds of 600 Million Yuan" Regarding the funds for the Ministry of Construction to develop water conservancy and increase production, the authorities plan to issue construction public bonds in installments (assumed name), with a total planned amount of 600 million yuan. The detailed methods are being actively formulated. It will be issued in installments. The first phase may first issue 100 million to 200 million yuan to revitalize rural water conservancy and encourage increased production.

"Fiscal Revenue and Expenditure Maintain Balance" The National Government's fiscal policy initially adopted a balanced budget, then changed to a focus on key areas, and now it has shifted to basing revenue on expenditure. Because next year's expenditure will increase by about onefold, revenue must also increase by about onefold. The objects of increase are tariffs and consolidated taxes. The method of increase is to gradually change the previous collection based on quantity to collection based on price to increase revenue. In short, the government now has a method to raise funds, and the revenue and expenditure for next year can definitely maintain balance.

"Trust Banks Absorb Floating Capital" Trust banks have been working tirelessly to stabilize social finance since July 1st of this year. Currently, most banks have completed capital increases. Three banks have been punished with the revocation of their business licenses because they do not comply with the regulations promulgated by the ministry. As for rumors that the government intends to merge the various banks, the authorities have not considered this at this time. Regarding the government's current plan to absorb floating capital from various regions for the development of inland industries, the detailed plan is being jointly formulated by the National Economic Commission, the Ministry of Finance, and relevant departments such as the Ministry of Industry and the Ministry of Construction. A meeting will be held soon to discuss preparations, and this issue will soon have a concrete decision.

### Tank Battle Unfolds in the Southern Part of the Eastern Front, Proving the Strength of German Reserve Forces

Stockholm, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to reports from Haitong News Agency, the Reuters correspondent in Moscow stated: The tank battle in southern Russia has continued for a month and has now reached its peak. Both sides are now concentrating the most troops and artillery to fight to the death. Last night, 200 German tanks launched a fierce attack in a narrow area of the Soviet front. Marshal von Manstein also mobilized reserve troops to push the Soviet army back to Kiev. The German army shows no signs of fatigue, so there will inevitably be continued battles in the future. To the south of Kremenchug, the three armies of the Soviet army in the Krivoy Rog area are fighting fiercely with the German army. The German counterattacks are fierce, demonstrating the strength of the reserve forces.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - The German military authorities announced on the 12th that the Soviet army attempted to land and reinforce troops northeast of Kerch from the Taman Peninsula at night, but was repelled by German coastal reconnaissance teams. 12 landing craft were sunk and 4 were severely damaged.

### Turkey Will Not Cede Bases to the Allies and Will Abide by the Montreux Convention

### Reinforcements for the Anti-Axis Forces, Preparing for a New Offensive; German Troops Defend Rome from Impregnable Terrain

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a report from Huitong News Agency: There has been large-scale troop movement in the rear of the Anti-Axis front in Southern Italy, seemingly assembling forces in preparation for a new offensive. The Anti-Axis reinforcements newly arrived in Southern Italy include large contingents of tanks and artillery, all currently concentrated in the Mignano area. Based on the movements of recent days, the U.S. Fifth Army clearly appears to be preparing to launch a new offensive, with its target seemingly aimed at advancing along the Cassino highways. Several weeks ago, after the German rearguard retreated from San Pietro Infine, the minefields laid by the German forces proved effective in hindering the enemy's advance. Repeated enemy attacks north of Monte Trocchio have been repelled, with the heaviest losses suffered by the enemy north of Venafro. The British Eighth Army's activities on the Moro River are currently limited to localized offensives, attempting to expand its bridgehead.

Berlin, 13th (Central News Agency) - According to a Huitong News Agency report, following the Anti-Axis forces' 100-day struggle in Southern Italy, the Swedish newspaper *Svenska Dagbladet* made a brief commentary stating: "The Anti-Axis forces will hardly be able to celebrate Christmas in Rome." The London *Daily Express* stated that the losses suffered by the German forces during this period were extremely difficult because the German side used very few troops in this theater. In other words, the Anti-Axis forces have failed to tie down a large number of German troops in Southern Italy. According to German soldiers who have fought on the Eastern Front, the battles on the Eastern Front and in Italy are equally fierce, subjecting their bodies and minds to immense torment. Manpower and resources on the Eastern Front are dispersed across a battlefield stretching thousands of kilometers, while in Southern Italy, they are concentrated in a mountainous area spanning only 1-3 kilometers. Since the Anti-Axis forces began their offensive in late November, the British Army has advanced approximately 15 kilometers along the Sangro River and Moro River, and the American forces in the west have advanced approximately 30 kilometers. Although the U.S. Army has recently overcome the difficult terrain of the Liri Valley in its advance towards Rome, the terrain in the west is still advantageous for the defending forces because the Liri Valley is only about 1 kilometer wide and is separated from the sea by mountains as high as 1,000 meters, making the surrounding high mountains advantageous for the defending forces.

### China Central and Shanghai Electric Power Companies Announce Measures for Implementing Restrictions on Electricity Consumption

Central News Agency reports that China Central Hydroelectric Power Company, which supplies electricity to the Central China region, and the military-managed Shanghai Electric Power Company (including the West Shanghai Electric Power Company) will implement electricity consumption restrictions for all users starting from December 1st. This is an unavoidable measure to cooperate in completing the Greater East Asia War due to the scarcity of coal, the primary resource for power generation. Coal is the most important resource for enhancing combat power. The electricity consumption restriction will affect the total electricity output by approximately 30%. The regulations for the restriction measures have thoroughly considered the importance of various industries to the current situation, enhancing combat power, and stabilizing people's livelihoods. The different electricity consumption limits set by the two companies are listed below:

However, the restrictions in the table above will still maintain a minimum consumption limit of 25 kWh per month in the Nanjing and Shanghai areas and 20 kWh per month in other areas.

Category Description

Category 1: All military uses and those necessary for maintaining public order. Category 2: Planned industries and others necessary for cultivating combat power (Category A) Those with special needs and other important factory business premises, designated separately. (Category B) Those not listed in Category A and the same-industry associations, and others specifically designated as such. Category 3: Ordinary uses that do not belong to Categories 1, 2, or 4, and those for electric heating and electric lights. Category 4: Those used for decoration or luxury. Managed in two categories, A and B (Category A) Those that should be strictly restricted. This category includes all types of restaurants, teahouses, coffee shops, barber shops, beauty salons, and all entertainment venues. (Category B) Those that should be prohibited. This category includes artistic electric decorations, neon lights, advertising lights, garden lights (excluding public ones), electric irons, and electric heating for greenhouses (excluding medical uses), etc. For electric lights, (Category A) residential use, (Category B) other. For electric heating, (Category A) residential cooking use (according to the fuel situation in Central China), (Category B) greenhouse use (same as above).

Consumption Limit Standards

The standard for the consumption system is calculated based on the month with the highest consumption between October of the 31st year of the Republic of China and October of this year in the supply area of China Central Hydroelectric Power Company, and based on the month with the highest consumption between August, September, and October of this year in the supply area of Shanghai Electric Power Company and West Shanghai Electric Power Company. The company will notify each user of this standard quantity in advance. Those who exceed the specified consumption limit will be charged an increased electricity fee as follows:

If the amount exceeded reaches 10% of the standard quantity, the excess electricity bill will be tripled. If the amount exceeded is between 10% and 20%, the fee will be increased sixfold. If the amount exceeded is over 20%, the fee will be increased twentyfold. If electricity usage exceeds the limit more than twice, the consumption limit will be reduced or the power supply will be directly suspended, in addition to the fines levied according to the previous regulations. The reason that the allocation to the Central China Hydroelectric Power supply area is looser than that of the Shanghai Electric Power Company is because the Shanghai Electric Power Company area has already implemented considerable restrictions since September of last year due to the scarcity of coal allocation. The current restriction on electricity consumption is indeed due to the increasingly scarce coal supply. It is known that this move will not only deeply affect the production of various Chinese industries, but also cause inconvenience to general electricity users. However, for electricity users in the Shanghai and Nanjing areas, a minimum limit of 25 kWh per month will still be maintained. Other areas will also have 20 kWh per month, so there will be no obstacle for users who use less electricity. In addition, for production enterprises necessary to enhance combat power, an increase may be allowed as necessary, depending on the situation of the coal supply. The same will be done for the establishment of new factories. However, luxury and wasteful places such as restaurants, teahouses, nightclubs, gambling venues, barber shops, and beauty salons will be subject to strict restrictions, and the electricity supply for all electric decorations, beautiful advertisements, and electric heating used in bathrooms and greenhouses will be suspended. Although the impact of this electricity restriction is great, it is indeed an unavoidable measure in these difficult times. It is hoped that users in all sectors can adhere to the principle of saving resources and use even a small amount of electricity most effectively and reasonably, whether at home or in the factory. If they continue to consume electricity arbitrarily as in the past, then stricter restrictions may be imposed in order to cope with the situation.

### Issuing 500-Yuan Notes is Absolutely False: Finance Minister Zhou Issues Statement

Central News Agency reports that recently, there have been rumors in the city that the Central Reserve Bank will issue 500-yuan notes. This rumor has been gaining momentum, and people even spoke of it as if they had seen it with their own eyes. A Central News Agency reporter, considering that this matter concerns financial trends, specially paid a visit to Finance Minister Zhou, who is also the President of the Central Reserve Bank, who was visiting Shanghai the day before yesterday (the 11th), in order to understand the truth. He was granted an audience and said that this matter was purely a groundless rumor. Because the issuance of the bank's notes is very sound, there is no need to issue 500-yuan notes. He has repeatedly stated in previous talks that he deeply hopes that the public will not lightly believe rumors and cause unnecessary disturbances.

### Petition from the Citizens Welfare Association: Return of Charitable Surtaxes for Allocation to Effective Charitable Organizations

The Citizens Welfare Association of this city, recently submitted a petition to the Municipal Government regarding the allocation of surtaxes previously collected by the Refugee Relief Association to local charitable organizations with proven track records. The document stated: "It is noted that since the outbreak of the war in the 26th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1937], refugees have sought shelter in dense areas. Initially, the Shanghai Joint Relief Association, formed by various charitable organizations, raised funds for their sustenance. Subsequently, when these charitable groups faced difficulties in providing sufficient aid, the Refugee Relief Association was jointly established by Chinese and foreign business communities. With the consent of the former Shanghai Municipal Council of the International Settlement, a 5% surtax was levied on restaurants and hotels, and approximately a 10% surtax on entertainment, to finance relief efforts. In the spring of the 30th year [of the Republic, i.e., 1941], as refugees gradually dispersed, the former Municipal Council and the French Concession Council, citing budgetary constraints, appropriated these surtaxes for their own use, incorporating them into their regular budgets, hindering all relief endeavors. In the spring of the 31st year [of the Republic, i.e., 1942], British council members, anticipating the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War and their inability to remain in their positions for long, proposed a 2% additional surtax when retiring without proper pensions. The revenue from this item was quite substantial. As a result, they achieved their desired outcome upon retirement, and the council accumulated a significant surplus. Given that the aforementioned budget is already secured, the previously established surtaxes, originally intended for relief purposes, should be returned for the benefit of the people. Shanghai's charitable organizations, which derive their resources from the people and use them for the people, have achieved remarkable successes but are facing financial difficulties that threaten their sustainability. It is requested that the Mayor instruct the relevant departments to promptly review and approve a plan for the unified allocation of these surtaxes, originally levied for relief, to benefit the impoverished. The undersigned humbly awaits your prompt action. Respectfully submitted to Chen, Mayor of the Shanghai Special Municipality."

### Submission to the Ministry of Welfare Requesting the Establishment of a Marriage Registration Bureau

Recognizing the increasing decline of marital customs, the association has also submitted a request to the Ministry of Social Welfare to establish a dedicated bureau for marriage registration, to emphasize ritual education and restore social mores. The document states: "Marriage is the foundation of human relationships and the origin of the continuation of life in the world. Since the Xia, Shang, and Three Dynasties, our country has established rites and created music, placing equal emphasis on marriage and funeral ceremonies, one to ensure a proper end, and the other to promote harmony. The significance of marriage, as transmitted through the Three Rites, is found in the 'Meaning of Marriage' in the Book of Rites, and the rites for scholars and officials are detailed in the Book of Etiquette. The betrothal ceremony is mentioned in the Book of Songs in relation to King Wen of Zhou's marriage to Tai Si: 'He divined for her auspiciousness, and personally welcomed her on the Wei River.' In Zuo Zhuan, Duke Zhao of Jin stated, 'A great state should not be mismatched.' The ancients placed great importance on marriage. In the Jiangzhe region, known for its sericulture and wealth, customs surrounding marriage have become increasingly extravagant, with expenses exceeding those of the rest of the country. Initially, wealthy families engaged in elaborate betrothal gifts and dowries, leading to a competition of wealth. Subsequently, this trend has spread, and even families of modest means follow suit, even at the cost of selling property or taking on debt for their children's marriages. Furthermore, the richness of the dowry has become the standard by which mothers-in-law treat their daughters-in-law, while the bride's family demands excessive betrothal money, 'door-opening fees,' and 'dowry transport fees' from the groom's family, each deliberately making things difficult for the other. In addition, in traditional marriages, the parties involved do not know each other beforehand, relying entirely on the decisions of their parents and the words of matchmakers. While many marriages result in harmony and lifelong companionship, there are also cases of incompatibility, leading to separation and divorce. Furthermore, women who are stubborn often suffer from depression due to unhappiness in their marital homes, while men keep concubines and engage in extramarital affairs, leading to family strife, all due to a lack of proper consideration at the beginning of marriage. Since the founding of the Republic, it has been recognized that it is necessary for both parties to establish friendship beforehand, and mutual affection is certainly better than blind marriage, but the number of divorces is even greater. Why is this? Because in the past, couples still had rites and teachings to maintain harmony, and the poor were content with their lot. Now, marriage is often based on money, and poverty leads to estrangement, a common occurrence among all levels of society, which is indeed lamentable. Currently, while there are formal marriage certificates and reports of household registration changes, government offices do not have a dedicated agency for marriage registration. According to the Rites of Zhou, 'The matchmaker manages the separations of the people, records the year, month, and day names of all men and women above the age of adulthood, and instructs men to marry at thirty and women at twenty. All those who marry or divorce wives or sons are recorded. (omitted) For all marriages and betrothals, the value of silk and currency shall not exceed five liang.' This shows that marriage registration was practiced in the Zhou Dynasty, and the Rites of Zhou stipulated a limit of no more than five liang to curb extravagance and avoid delays due to financial issues.

Your Ministry presides over social welfare, and marriage is an essential aspect of human life. We propose the establishment of a dedicated bureau to handle marriage registration matters, similar to the duties of the matchmaker in the Zhou Dynasty, to promote ritual education and suppress undesirable customs, in line with the respectful and solemn intentions of the Three Dynasties. This is what our society and people earnestly hope for. Respectfully submitted to Ding, Minister of the Ministry of Social Welfare."

### Local Real Estate Merchants Expand Inland Business

Land Prices Soar Along the Two Railways

Local real estate companies and merchants have experienced an extraordinary boom in business recently, reaping substantial profits. In particular, over the past six months, the extensive activities of large and small companies along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways have generated profits that are often unimaginable to outsiders. The latest situation is described below.

Idle Capital Turns to Real Estate

Local idle capital is abundant. In the past, it was mainly used for hoarding goods. Since the authorities began to severely crack down on hoarding at the beginning of this year, a large amount of idle capital has sought alternative outlets. In addition to a portion flowing into rural areas to engage in the purchase of agricultural products, a portion has turned to buying and selling real estate. Among them, merchants with a broader vision have developed activities in major cities along the Shanghai-Nanjing and Shanghai-Hangzhou railways, such as Nanjing, Suzhou, Wuxi, Kunshan, Songjiang, Jiaxing, and Hangzhou, engaging in large-scale activities inland and daring to buy real estate. The profits obtained have been very substantial. The amounts over the past six months are quite considerable.

### November Clearing House Statistics

The Shanghai Bankers Association Clearing House has released the clearing house figures for November, which show an increase compared to the previous month. The total clearing amount was $2,684,242,835.41 in cash, and the total collection amount was $4,756.58. The collection amount for member money shops was $8,258,106,000.20, foreign banks was $658,347,115.74, and other banks and money businesses was $2,078,263,378.09, for a total of $18,435,541,682.75.

In particular, the surge in the prices of small textile stocks is the most significant. The price of Fongs is broken through the big level. Innerwear, Hongxing, and Tongji are the most sought after, while Yong'an and Zhenchang are flat. The increase of China Film is also considerable. China-France Pharmacy rose by five and a half yuan amid rumors of capital increase. Great China Matches sought luxury at high prices. Among financial stocks, Zhejiang was at 2,550 yuan, Jin Cheng at 1,550 yuan, and Jieye at 1,450 yuan, all with openings. Dalu was at 14,500 yuan with buyers.

### Market Summary

Government Bonds: The market was weak again yesterday, with slight rebounds that were bound to suffer setbacks. The recent stable prices have been unusual. The market sentiment is difficult to gauge. Yesterday, the initial trading of Category C bonds was stable, but it gradually declined after opening. The closing price was lower than the previous day. Categories A and B both fell, while Category E was uniquely good. The low price of medium-term bonds was due to excessively high prices in the previous days, and the high price of Category E was due to the need for spot goods. It is still nothing more than the relationship between supply and demand.

Interbank Lending Rate: The interbank lending rate of the Money Business Association yesterday morning was 18%, unchanged.

Daily Necessities: Soap is still weak and unable to rise. Matches are sometimes firm and sometimes weak, with narrow sales channels and little price fluctuation. The path for foreign candles is increasingly large. Because the goods are claimed, the price has risen sharply, reaching the large level, and there are not many supplies, so the market is likely to rise.

Cigarettes: Reappeared on the market, because all parties are firm on the rumors of profitability, the prices have risen consistently.

Food: Yesterday, the prices continued to rise, because rice merchants still use the excuse of rising production prices and difficulties in transportation, and the thicknesses are all out. The arrival of goods is interrupted, and the price will be pushed up again.

Medicinal Materials: Yesterday, because the owners are calling high, the line is firm and not rising.

### The Destruction of Law and the Corruption of Morality

— Zhou Raoying

After reading Mr. Qingtiandong's "The Sanctity of Law" (Shen Bao Weekly Review, December 12), I had several thoughts:

First, in China, from the late Qing Dynasty to the present century, it seems impossible to discuss what constitutes morality and what constitutes law. Especially now, after the incident [referring to the ongoing war], it seems as if the war has broken people's hearts. Recalling before the incident, acts of violating the law and corrupting morality were done secretly by people who were despised. "Uniformed officers" did not openly collect protection fees from small vendors selling "wonton," "tofu brain," and "shoe shine," and "gangster thugs" did not transform themselves into officials. The buying and selling of official positions and the law was not done without any scruples. The war has caused unimaginable psychological changes in people. Many people seem to have immunity for doing things that destroy the law and corrupt morality, but if this continues, even those who do not take the path of petty corruption will only be destroyed along with them!

Second, the Japanese are very concerned about Chinese affairs, but Mr. Yoshida is truly the first person I have seen who cares about law and morality with such sincerity. I do not know Mr. Yoshida, but for this point alone, the Chinese should express their gratitude. After reading Mr. Yoshida's work, I am truly willing to serve as his follower. If morality and law cannot establish a foundation, all of the country's political, military, economic, and cultural efforts will be like building a tower on sand, and will never see real results in one's lifetime. The entire country cannot progress, and what help can it give to East Asia? This is a concern for China, and also a concern for East Asia, a concern for Japan! Therefore, regarding China's problems with morality and law, I have always advocated that Japanese people should also pay attention. For example, corruption among officials and the open operation of opium dens cannot be thoroughly resolved by the Chinese side without the assistance of the Japanese side. Now that Mr. Yoshida is so enthusiastically bringing this up, I cannot help but congratulate China. And I want to congratulate Japan even more!

Third, since the destruction of law and the corruption of morality are shared concerns of China and Japan, then I believe that we should work together to find a way to save the situation. Fortunately, there are precedents to follow, such as military alliances and economic cooperation, which have already been implemented. Cultural communication is also being realized step by step. In terms of morality and law, clear communication is naturally out of the question. We must not bring the practice of collecting protection fees from small vendors and grocery stores in Chinese streets, or the buying and selling of official positions, to Japan. Nor can we promote opium and gambling in Japan. However, the integrity, dedication to duty, and loyalty of Japanese officials, soldiers, police, and police can be transplanted to China, which can fundamentally save China. As for how Japan can help China in terms of morality and law, that is a very abstract question. I don't think China can also establish a "China-Japan Morality Association." But we think, if various Japanese organizations and individuals in China can pay more attention to the moral and legal issues in China, especially when interacting with Chinese people, they must pay attention to whether their Chinese friends or Chinese subordinates are involved in fraud or crime, or use themselves as a backer to commit organized and planned crimes. Japanese people's attitude towards Chinese people is that Chinese people can be let loose, while Japanese people themselves must be strictly restrained. In fact, the general attitude of Chinese people is that the crimes committed by Chinese people who are close to Japanese people, or Chinese people under the influence of Japanese people, are all recorded on the heads of Japanese people. Wouldn't this create a great injustice in history? Therefore, Japan should not have boundaries and should be determined to promote morality and law as a whole. Especially Japanese people who come to China to work must adhere to the sincerity of "being good to others" and must not be negligent in being used by Chinese villains, resulting in the unjust situation of condoning Chinese people to do evil.

Fourth, I have thought about the corruption of morality and law for many years, and I believe that this responsibility does not lie with the lower class, but with the upper class. If we consider the role of politics, then this responsibility should be borne by the rulers, and those outside the government cannot be held accountable. Although the decline of morality and law has been going on for a long time, it did not start today. However, those in power must bear the responsibility of reversing the decline. Throughout Chinese history, most of those in power are eager to protect their own positions. Sometimes, they even reach a critical turning point. In order to seek advancement and unwilling to retreat, they do not hesitate to personally do things that destroy the law and corrupt morality. This is the case for those in power, not to mention those outside the government. It is appropriate that the entire morality and law are declining. Regarding the rectification of this country's governance, I have long advocated that we should start with a rational organization of officials. Only with an organization can officials have guarantees, and only then can they seek progress. Otherwise, everyone will be "ruling for five days," without any assurance for the future, and it will still be a dead end. Before World War I, the corruption of officialdom in countries such as Britain, the United States, Germany, and France was not much different from China today. After the establishment of official organizations, they gradually progressed. Of course, the establishment of official organizations must be cautious, but the real progress of Chinese morality and law must be after the establishment of official organizations. Because officials cannot govern themselves, how can we talk about self-government for the people? Because officials cannot be democratic, how can the government talk about democracy? This is the fundamental key to national progress!

There are still many things that are too simple above, but I was sincerely admiring Mr. Yoshida Suoyu's article and rashly said so many careless words because of impulsion. I respectfully seek the guidance of Mr. Yoshida and other concerned parties.

In the spring of the year when Makoto was eight years old, he entered the local Yawata Elementary School, which is the predecessor of the current Yawata National Elementary School in Yoshida.

"Listen to the teacher carefully!"

On the morning of his first day of school, his mother handed him a new towel as she said this. Because he had many older brothers, he could use their old schoolbag, skirt (worn in Japanese formal attire, translator's note), and textbooks, but the hand towel and student hat he was asking about were brand new.

In that place, there was no custom of mothers holding their sons' hands and sending them directly to school.

Makoto silently followed his older brother, Taro, who was in the third grade, through the school gate for the first time. What he liked the most was carrying his lunchbox in his schoolbag!

During recess, older students would wrestle. Most of the new students tremblingly played on the swings and rode on wooden horses.

Makoto watched the lively scene and simply smiled happily. The ruddy complexion on his pale face revealed his clean, adorable, and thin teeth. He was truly the epitome of a "handsome boy" from the local dialect.

"Tani's son is like an apple."

One of the precocious children had already captured the characteristic of Makoto's face. Children from the south do not know that apples can also be green. Makoto, with his smooth, round eyelids and rosy cheeks, did indeed look like a striking apple from a fairy tale—as if it had grown eyes and a nose.

"Apple! Apple!"

Although he was being teased, Makoto remained silent and smiled happily. From that day on, the nicknames "Apple" and "Makoto Apple" continued until the end of his adolescence.

However, "Apple" was not just observing the children's games. When he was invited, he gladly joined their companionship. Because he was heavy, he did not particularly like gymnastics, but he was good at wrestling. His small body did indeed have a strong will that supported him to the end. Takashi, on the other hand, was not like that. He would fall down if he was bumped from any direction.

"Takashi—try your best!"

Makoto, on the other hand, was accustomed to it and cheered him on.

Going to school was the most enjoyable thing. Taking a lunchbox and playing with many children—if there was any hardship, it was that the responsible teacher was particularly strict. If the homework was not done well, they would get a "chestnut shell." "Chestnut shell" meant hitting the head with knuckles, which was not very painful.

However, before the first graders welcomed the first New Year, because Emperor Taisho passed away, the schools all hung national flags with black ribbons and were dismissed early. (Six)

### Buddhist Soup Kitchen Maintains Relief Work

Since its establishment on August 1 last year, the Shanghai Buddhist Soup Kitchen has been providing aid to more than 3,500 impoverished people. By the summer of this year, problems arose in the purchase of food and fuel, and the scope had to be reduced to 2,000 servings of porridge. However, this winter, rice and firewood are expensive, and the difficulties of the poor are even greater than in previous years. The relief work cannot be stopped, but the savings of the association are about to be exhausted. Fortunately, with the continued donations from many great philanthropists, it has been able to maintain itself until now. According to the calculation from August 1 last year to the end of November this year, the economic expenditure totaled 842,753 yuan and 8 cents. If the source is smooth, it will be expanded again. If you are willing to donate, please submit it to Shen Bao, Xinwen Bao, Qian Tai Bank on Sichuan Road, Jin Cheng Bank Trust Department, and the factory in Guandi Temple, Old Fourth Gate.

### Please Sponsor the Foguang Sanatorium for Medical Consultations

— Huang Jingwan

The Foguang Sanatorium at 123 Lantian Road (Masinan Road) in this city was founded by Layman Ma Wenwo. It has Western and Chinese doctors in all departments, and the internal organization focuses on Buddhist education. In addition to the established outpatient department for medical consultations and medicine dispensing, an voluntary outpatient department and a spiritual treatment department have also been established. Such kindness is rare. It is hoped that enthusiastic people will spread the word widely. Also, since the cost of dispensing medicine is increasing daily, donations are welcome.
