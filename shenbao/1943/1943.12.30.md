### Prospects for the 84th Japanese Diet Session

The 84th session of the Japanese Diet was convened at the House of Peers at 10:00 AM on the 26th of this month. On the 27th, after passing a resolution thanking the Emperor for his address and resolutions of gratitude to the Army and Navy, the Diet adjourned for the remainder of the year, with a scheduled reconvening for a plenary session on January 21st of next year. This session of the Japanese Diet coincides with a period when the world war is advancing towards a decisive stage. It also follows the victory in the naval and air battles around Bougainville Island. The Japanese people are in a state of extreme excitement and tension, and the main task of the Diet is to promote national unity to win the war.

As the decisive battle situation becomes increasingly significant, there are unlimited expectations for the 84th Diet session, which will resume in late January next year. Prime Minister Tojo, in his report on the war situation on the 27th, clearly pointed out the most important direction for the Japanese people's efforts: "What must be particularly noted now is the importance of reinforcing the war effort, with the focus on the production and transportation of resources." (Central News Agency, Tokyo, 27th) This is the core of the "strengthening the domestic decisive battle posture" movement that Japan has been intensifying in recent months, and also the main content of the budget and legislative bills that will be decided upon when the Diet reconvenes. According to Prime Minister Tojo's report, the production of resources has seen considerable progress due to the enthusiastic cooperation of the entire Japanese nation, with aircraft production significantly increased. In terms of transportation, "no regrets can be expected" due to close cooperation with the Navy and the efforts of the people in the rear. In the future, when the 84th Diet session continues to deliberate on the budget and other legislative bills, it will surely enable the strengthening measures for the domestic decisive battle posture to achieve even greater results.

Recently, enemy propaganda based on their strategies, from the Cairo Conference declarations regarding Japan to the so-called encirclement and counter-offensive posture against Germany since the Tehran Conference, all indicate that the future situation will become increasingly severe. However, this kind of propaganda is not enough to shake the Axis powers, especially the allied nation of Japan, in the slightest. Prime Minister Tojo said plainly in his report to the Diet: "The enemy's anxiety and hasty attempt to counter-attack is self-evident, which is a good opportunity for us to destroy the enemy. Therefore, this attitude of the enemy is actually beneficial to us." Therefore, he hoped that "all military personnel and civilians will firmly believe in victory, display a strong spirit of attack, and advance resolutely in the war with unwavering determination." We firmly believe that the 84th session of the Japanese Diet, which will reconvene on January 21st, will make a significant contribution to strengthening the overall goal of "all Japanese united in mind to achieve the war objectives."

Because we have entered the decisive stage of the war, we must strengthen our domestic posture to win. To strengthen the domestic posture, we must obtain the cooperation of the entire population. Japan deeply feels this need, so after each Diet session, there is a tangible manifestation of strengthening the domestic posture. Since the Greater East Asia Conference, Japan's mission has become even greater: on the one hand, to defeat the enemy's counter-offensive; on the other hand, to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration. Therefore, after this Diet session, we will see even greater cooperation between the Japanese government and people to strengthen the domestic posture. Looking back at our country's participation in the war in recent years, our mission is the same as that of our allies. However, our work in promoting cooperation between the government and the people and strengthening the domestic posture lags far behind. We have not even established a popular institution similar to the Japanese Diet to promote cooperation between the government and the people. However, the task of participating in the war cannot be shirked. We hope that the government and the public will pay attention to this and unite and cooperate as soon as possible to strengthen the wartime posture, jointly strive for victory, and fulfill the obligation to implement the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration.

### Glorious Air Battle at Rabaul: Japanese Naval Air Force Achieves Victory, US Forces Forced to Retreat from Aloei Front

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 4:00 PM on the 29th: Our naval air units encountered approximately 50 attacking enemy fighters near Rabaul on the 28th and shot down 31 of them (including 10 unconfirmed). Our losses were 3 aircraft that did not return.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - After enemy forces established bridgeheads in the southwest and northwest of New Britain Island, they suffered great losses due to relentless bombing by Japanese aircraft. However, their ambition to seize Rabaul has not been easily abandoned, so they have repeatedly attacked Rabaul and Japanese bases in that area for days. At dawn on the 28th, 50 enemy fighters attacked Rabaul again. The Japanese naval fighter squadron immediately intercepted them, and after a fierce air battle, shot down 31 enemy planes, accounting for six-tenths of the attacking enemy planes. This demonstrates the bravery of the Japanese air force. On the 27th, the Japanese air force intercepted 50 enemy planes over Rabaul, shooting down 23 of them. The Japanese only lost 3 planes in that battle. Since the enemy planes landed at Magas Corner on the 15th, up to the 28th, approximately 519 enemy planes have attacked, of which 182 were shot down by the Japanese naval air squadron, nearly one-third of the total number of enemy planes.

Central News Agency, Lisbon, 29th - According to a report from the anti-Axis base on New Guinea Island: The Southwest Pacific anti-Axis command announced on the 28th that the advanced units of the US forces in that area were forced to retreat from the outposts near Aloei due to a fierce counter-offensive launched by the Japanese garrison at Magas Corner from three directions.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - According to a report from a certain South Pacific base, the enemy attacked Buin and Shortland Island on Bougainville Island on the 28th with approximately 100 carrier-based aircraft and bombers. The Japanese naval air squadron immediately intercepted them, shooting down 4 planes. Japanese losses were minimal.

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - According to a report from a certain South Pacific base, the Japanese naval air force raided the Finschhafen enemy airfield on New Guinea Island on the night of the 28th. Two locations were hit and caught fire, and another location had flames rising into the air. All Japanese aircraft returned safely.

### Japanese Army's Winter Offensive Achieves Significant Results, Adopting Blitzkrieg Tactics

Central News Agency, Hankou, 29th - The Japanese Central China Army's winter offensive operation, which began on November 2nd, has been progressing with the force of a raging tide. Within a vast area of 300 kilometers east-west and several hundred kilometers north-south, it fiercely attacked the Sixth War Area of Chongqing, destroying ten armies, totaling 28 divisions, and completely annihilating them. The central area of Chongqing's defense has achieved great results, completely achieving the goal of shattering Chongqing's defense capabilities. The Japanese operational forces resumed their original posture on December 25th.

Implementing Inland Offensive Operations

This time, the Japanese army used blitzkrieg tactics to implement inland offensive operations. It was not an attempt to seize a city or town, but to shatter the combat power of the Chongqing army and annihilate the Chongqing army's defensive positions near Changde, so as to completely destroy the root of Chongqing's resistance, the Sixth War Area. Therefore, the blow to the Chongqing camp was very heavy. The Japanese army destroyed 28 divisions of the Chongqing army, and annihilated the defensive positions built near Changde, which took several years and cost hundreds of millions. This is enough to show the world the strong combat power of the Japanese army. The Sixth War Area of Chongqing, south of Changde, has almost no reserves. The Chongqing army completely lost the ability to block the Japanese army's breakthrough. In order to rescue Changde, they sent reinforcements twice from the Ninth War Area of Chongqing and the Nanchang area. The first time, the 10th, 99th, 100th, and 3rd armies of Chongqing were annihilated by the Japanese army in the southern region of Changde. The second time, the Provisional 2nd, 59th, and 72nd armies of Chongqing also feared the power of the Japanese army. The Japanese army used skillful operations to destroy them everywhere, and ultimately did not allow the Chongqing army to achieve the goal of rescuing Changde. Also, the annihilating battle that broke through the Changde defense line, after unfolding over a vast area for two months, has hinted that capturing Chongqing is not impossible.

Large Number of Cannons Among Captured Goods

In addition, there is another special point, that is, the number of cannons captured among the spoils of war has increased compared to past operations, totaling about 158 mountain guns, rapid-firing guns, and mortars. This is a significant increase compared to the past. For example, in the First Changsha Operation, there were 70 cannons, in the Second Changsha Operation, there were 85 cannons, in the Yichang Operation, there were more than 40 cannons, in the Dabie Mountains Operation, there were 6 cannons, in the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Operation, there were 130 cannons, and in the Jiangnan Annihilation Operation, there were 90 cannons. There are two main reasons why the Japanese army captured such a large number of weapons: one is that the Japanese army implemented blitzkrieg encirclement and a sudden attack on the Chongqing army; the other is that it implemented a thorough invasion of the interior and came into contact with the elite Chongqing army, annihilating them.

Japanese Imperial Headquarters Announces Battle Results

Central News Agency, Tokyo, 29th - The Japanese Imperial Headquarters announced at 2:00 PM on the 29th that our army units have been operating in the western region of Dongting Lake since November 2nd, destroying the main force of the Chongqing army in the Sixth and Ninth War Areas, which are the roots of Chongqing's resistance, and completely destroying the Chongqing military facilities near the key point of Changde in that area. Our operational forces, after fully achieving their intended objectives, resumed their original posture on December 25th. The comprehensive results of this operation are as follows: The damage inflicted on the Chongqing army includes the bodies of 32,747 Chongqing soldiers recovered, and 14,325 prisoners captured. Near Changde, 60 enemy planes were shot down. The main captured goods include 158 cannons, 657 heavy machine guns, 6,356 rifles, and 2.36 million rounds of various bullets. Our losses include 1,666 killed in action.

### Reasons for the Resignation of Chen Cheng, Commander of the Yunnan-Chongqing Army

Central News Agency, Guangzhou, 29th - The reason for the resignation of Chen Cheng, the supreme commander in Yunnan, is said to be that when the Japanese army was fighting on the Nu River, Lord Mountbatten, commander of the Southeast Asia Command, adopted a lukewarm attitude, watching the Chongqing army fall into difficulties and doing nothing to help, which angered Chen Cheng. Above the air, it was prepared to intercept, and the Japanese aircraft immediately engaged in fierce fighting with it. After about 20 minutes, eight Chongqing aircraft were shot down (one of which was not confirmed), and seven North American P25 aircraft, two P40 aircraft, and one P40 aircraft parked on the ground were bombed and caught fire. At the same time, five P25 aircraft were destroyed by bombing. All Japanese aircraft returned safely to their original defense area.

### North of Kirovograd, German Defensive Battles Proceed Smoothly, Large Tank Battles Unfold West of Kyiv

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German News Agency Report: On Sunday, the German army north of Kirovograd disregarded the stubborn resistance of the Soviet army and launched a daring offensive, achieving an important victory. German infantry and tank detachments penetrated deep into the salient of the Soviet front during the assault, moving the German front line eastward, thereby greatly shortening the front line. Northwest of Kryvyi Rih, German advances continued to progress. Although the Soviet army strengthened its resistance, it was ineffective. The enemy attempted to stop the German advance with a counter-offensive, but these attempts were suppressed by the German mobile artillery units and assault guns. During the winter struggle for Zhytomyr, the Soviet army ordered its main tank formation south of the Kyiv-Zhytomyr highway to break through the German line to the south and southeast, immediately unfolding a large-scale tank battle at the mouth. However, the German defenders adopted elastic tactics and finally intercepted the Soviet advance, preventing a breakthrough. Some German units that had previously been surrounded by the enemy have returned to their own line with weapons and equipment.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - According to Havas' military reporter, Sextus, the Soviet army continued to concentrate its offensive on Vitebsk on Monday, encountering strong German resistance. The enemy's frontal offensive did not seem very fierce, but its flank pressure was significant. The German counter-offensive has contained the enemy's flank offensive, and fierce fighting is now underway. At the same time, the large-scale offensive launched by Soviet General Vatutin west of Teterev on Christmas Eve has expanded to Korosten and Zhytomyr. The Berdychiv area (south of Zhytomyr) seems to be the enemy's main target.

### Anti-Axis Military Activities Are Mostly a Prelude to the Invasion of Europe, Observations of German Military Experts

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - According to Havas' military reporter, Sextus, General Eisenhower's appointment as the Supreme Commander of the European invasion force, and President Roosevelt's prediction of bloody battles, are not enough to indicate that the invasion of Western Europe is imminent. Both events are a political and psychological preparation to help Roosevelt himself participate in the fourth presidential election. However, several recent military actions can be seen as a prelude to the anti-Axis invasion of Europe, such as the enemy air force's intensified bombing of key German coastal positions along the English Channel, the concentration of ships in southern England, the increased activity of British transportation, and the start of the Soviet winter offensive. The invasion of Western Europe is likely to correspond with it. The enemy's plan seems to be to wait until the Soviet winter offensive has attracted the main force of the German reserve army to the Eastern Front to assist in the fighting, and then launch an invasion of Europe to take advantage of the weakness. In any case, the distance between the launching of the eastern and western offensives will not be too far, and the enemy is also well aware that the advantage of one side fighting on the inner line lies in implementing a strategy of defeating the enemy one by one. Therefore, the enemy is unlikely to give Germany this opportunity, so the invasion of Western Europe must be imminent.

### British Landing on Four Small French Islands Fails

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German News Agency Report, Military News: British special landing forces attempted to land on Sark Island near northwestern France in the English Channel yesterday, but were unsuccessful. This is the second similar attempt by the British in three days. When the enemy approached the beaches of the island, they heard several heavy explosions, followed by raging flames. It was thought that the landmines had shown their effectiveness. After investigation, it was found to be the case, and the body of one British soldier was found. The German defense forces did not need to take action.

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - The German News Agency has learned from authoritative sources that the German light fleet and British naval units have been engaged in combat in the Bay of Biscay for several days. Air force units have also joined the battle. Both sides have suffered damage. A British cruiser that was preparing to join the battle was hit and severely damaged, and immediately left the area.

### Troops Under General Teggor Will Participate in Combat

Central News Agency, Berlin, 29th - German Headquarters announced: On the 27th of the Southern Italian front, only the western sector saw localized fighting. Anti-Axis forces attacked north of Venafro with superior forces. After fierce fighting, the German army lost a high ground. In the eastern Ortona area, after severely damaging the anti-Axis forces in the past few days of fighting, the German army retreated from Ortona, which had been reduced to ruins, and defended new positions in the northwestern suburbs of the city.

Central News Agency, Rome, 29th - German News Agency Report, according to the London Times: Anti-Axis bombers dropped heavy bombs on the outskirts of Rome at noon yesterday.

### The Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee Passes Two Important Proposals: Increasing Food Production and Fiber Raw Materials

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee held its eighth general meeting at the Prime Minister's official residence on the afternoon of the 28th at 2:00 PM. Prime Minister Tojo, in his capacity as president, along with various cabinet members and committee members, discussed and responded to consultation proposals regarding measures for increasing food production in the Greater East Asia region and measures for increasing the production of fiber raw materials in the Greater East Asia region. The proposals were unanimously passed by all attendees, and the meeting adjourned at 4:00 PM.

Tokyo, 29th (Central News Agency) - The Japanese Information Bureau announced on the 29th the following key points regarding the policy outline for increasing the production of renewable raw materials, to be discussed at the Greater East Asia Construction Review Committee's general meeting in December of this year:

The summary of the food production increase policy in the Greater East Asia region is as follows: Food production in the entire Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere will be increased to accommodate the growing population within the sphere. The fundamental aim is to ensure the Greater East Asia region's ability to navigate the current situation by increasing food self-sufficiency in various regions within the Co-Prosperity Sphere. In the regions centered around Japan and Manchuria, an emergency increase in food production will be implemented, aiming for complete food self-sufficiency. Therefore, detailed strategies will be implemented in each region regarding major food plans and aquatic and livestock production plans.

The summary of the raw material production increase policy in the Greater East Asia region is as follows: Regarding the comprehensive increase in fiber raw materials in Greater East Asia, a resolute effort will be made to ensure the successful completion of the Greater East Asia War and to thoroughly implement a policy of self-sufficiency in fiber resources. For cotton, hemp, silk, wool, and various other fiber resources, comprehensive plans for Greater East Asia and individual plans for each region will be established, and detailed production increase plans will be implemented based on the type of fiber resource.

### Unease Within India

Since the end of the rainy season, news of the advance of the Indian National Army led by Chandra Bose has been circulating. Simultaneously, the joint military operations of Britain, America, and Chongqing in India have intensified. Following the establishment of the United Southeast Asian Command, there was the Cairo Conference, and then the meetings between Mountbatten and Wedemeyer in Delhi. Important figures have been arriving constantly, turning the Indian continent into a fortress for the anti-Axis front, forcing India to take up weapons it did not want to, and plunging 380 million people into a maelstrom of hunger and oppression. The Delhi radio, under the control of Anglo-American imperialism, uses deceptive propaganda to conceal the truth from the people. The requisition of military rice is being forcibly pushed forward at the expense of two million starving people. However, on the other hand, news of the Indian National Army's advance in East Asia, although suppressed, is gradually seeping into the population, stimulating the vigorous secret movements of the domestic vanguard. Especially within the military, impatient rebels have reached 100,000, and the organizational system, relying solely on money and power, is shaking and trembling. Aside from the low-key actions of various political factions observing the situation, the people are eager to escape the heavy oppression and unease of their lives, and a rebellion against British imperialist domination is imminent. This article attempts to dissect the reality of Anglo-American-Chongqing military cooperation playing out on the stage of India, observe the increasingly active movements of various domestic political factions as the political season arrives, and examine the food problem, which is a matter of life and death for all of India, and its subsequent development.

The first noteworthy point is the plan for the close coordination between the Southwest Pacific and Southeast Asian armies. The meetings between Chief of Staff Sacharand, Mountbatten, Wedemeyer, and Mountbatten in Delhi indicate that the enemy's overall counter-offensive operation is extremely active and suggest some changes in its scale.

The Enemy Intends to Invade from the Sea

It is already known that the enemy has announced contact with Japanese forces in northern Burma and Arakan. In addition to this land-based counter-offensive, they intend to invade from the sea to recapture Burma. Mountbatten, who is training "surprise landing forces," intends to initiate an operation with the understanding of the Southwest Pacific Allied forces, and this intention is becoming increasingly apparent.

The recent increase in the proportion of American military forces in India is an undeniable fact. The increase in American influence over India, which was pointed out during the Arakan campaign this spring, can no longer be concealed. The Chongqing forces stationed in Assam are supplied with equipment and training by the United States. Of particular note is the world's longest regular air route between the US and India.

This air route crosses the Atlantic from Ohio, passes through the Mediterranean via Turkey, and reaches Karachi in India, requiring a total of eight days. This is because the Australian air route has been blocked by the Japanese military, so a new route was established in addition to the air routes through Australia and North Africa. The actual effect of this new air route is questionable. Its main objectives, in addition to replenishing the command system for generals and transporting aircraft, are to transport engines that India cannot produce and to organize the US-Indian Air Force.

Reinforcing the Chongqing Army Stationed in India

Thus, due to the changes in North Africa and the Mediterranean, the United States, with its vain ambition to dominate the world, is increasingly exposing its intention to place the innocent people of India under its control. Noteworthy in this trend is the reinforcement of the Chongqing army stationed in India. The enemy previously announced that approximately 100,000 soldiers were being sent from Chongqing to North Assam via the perilous Yunnan-India air route, where they were trained by American officers and equipped by the United States, and deployed to attack the so-called New Assam-Burma road. And recently, this deployment has been further strengthened. The Chongqing army, active in the unscrupulous schemes of Britain and America, is now being dispatched to the forefront of reopening the "New Assam Road." This is merely a sacrifice for empty talk. Chiang Kai-shek, eager to protect his own regime, has finally placed his army under the control of the US military, leaving it stationed in a distant foreign land, leaving a major stain on East Asian history.

The details of the new Assam-Burma road promoted by the enemy are not yet clear, but it likely refers to the route previously used by caravan traders and the mule road in northern Burma built by the British army invading Yunnan. The hope of opening this route is about to vanish, and it is feared that not a single soldier will be able to cross the Nu River.

It is said that Mountbatten accompanied Chiang Kai-shek and his wife, who had returned from the Cairo Conference, to inspect the troops stationed in India. This shows the enemy's precautionary measures against Chongqing's potential defection. Earlier, Delhi Radio reported that Soong Mei-ling had been appointed as the honorary director of the Calcutta Famine Relief Committee and that the 5 million rupees in relief funds sent by Chongqing had arrived. In reality, although this fund was nominally provided by the Chongqing government, it was later collected from the people through forced apportionment. The frantic collaboration between Chongqing and India is entirely dictated by the strategies of the United States and Britain.

As such, due to the increased proportion of American forces and the relocation of the Chongqing army, the forces deployed on the eastern Indian border have reached a considerable number. Recent intelligence from East India also indicates the addition of black African soldiers and a focus on the Gurkha troops.

Earlier, Auchinleck had inspected Punjab, and then, in late November, Wavell inspected the Northwest Frontier Province. These facts show how much the enemy values the Gurkha troops and how much they want to gather people from the Himalayan border regions in large numbers.

Desertions from the Indian Army

Currently, within the Indian army, there are several daily instances of soldiers deserting in order to return to farming due to rising agricultural prices. At the same time, rampant abuse by officers, theft, bribery, and other despicable acts are widespread. Anglo-American military cadres are encountering unexpected difficulties in handling these incidents. In this situation, the militarization of Ceylon is noteworthy. Recently, in order to strengthen transportation links with mainland India, the process of acquiring the saturated South Indian Railway is underway, in an effort to strengthen military transportation. After the strengthening of India's military base, it is clear that there will be a fierce crackdown on domestic political factions, especially vanguard factions. The publicly disclosed activities of Indian political forces are low-key. The All India Andhra Mahasabha held a congress, followed by the All India Muslim League and the Hindu Mahasabha each holding congresses to welcome the arrival of the political season. The Muslim League, which has considerable influence, continues to express its closeness to Britain.

In fact, the possibility of various states moving towards a coalition movement is quite strong, so it seems that there is a connection to the Hindu Mahasabha. As such, as a result of Jinnah's injury, the president of the Hindu Mahasabha, Chaibagar, expressed his intention to resign, so it can generally be said that it has a pro-British tendency. But we believe that the tendency to lean towards the Muslim League may not succeed. In short, the first step of a coalition cabinet must begin with a population survey. The ratio of Muslims and Hindus in Bihar, Orissa, Assam, and other places may not have been clearly investigated.

In addition, there is the "Rajagopalachari Movement," the so-called observers outside the prison movement, which is currently operating secretly. The activities of other small parties are still low-key. Wavell considers it too early and has not taken any political action, but among the low-key activities of various factions, the secret movement of the vanguard is unique, spreading throughout India and becoming increasingly intense. The continuous waves of terror and strikes illustrate this potential. Committees at the local, district, and city levels, composed of elites from various factions aiming for revolution, have also established units and are deploying trained personnel to launch labor strikes. The opportune moment for Bose's overseas movement is being actively cultivated.

The most interesting thing in this turbulence is Gandhi's wife's illness in prison. If there is no possibility of release now, it is expected that unexpected disturbances will occur.

The Seriousness of the Food Problem

Finally, let's look at the food problem that is spreading throughout India. Although the British and American armies have provided some assistance, the scope is small and a drop in the bucket, unable to alleviate the severe famine. In terms of prices, food prices have increased sevenfold, and general prices have increased fivefold. Black markets are rampant in the city, and recently they have spread to fuel, with people openly robbing coal in broad daylight. Fuel shortages have caused factories to reduce operations, leading to strikes. Transportation is extremely difficult, the food shortage is becoming more severe, and it is stimulating price increases.

The Secretary of State for India, Amery, announced in Parliament that the Indian government was providing meals for 2 million people daily. But now that check cannot be cashed and has been temporarily suspended. He is only announcing empty words about the arrival of Australian wheat ships or the assistance of the army to deceive the public.

In short, the Anglo-American-Chongqing cooperation in India, which is the opposite of the fundamental demands of India itself, is encountering many difficulties and lacking spiritual cohesion. These events illustrate the future destiny of India. (翔: Translated from the Western Sunrise News, December 18th)

### Retail Tax is a Direct Tax; Price Gouging is Prohibited; Relevant Authorities to Discuss Measures

Central News Agency - Regarding the special consumption tax to be implemented by the Ministry of Finance, the retail tax rate has been set at 4%. In the past few days, some merchants have been spreading rumors about the tax rate, taking the opportunity to raise prices and seek illegal profits. Shao, the director of the Tax Bureau, believes that such illegal behavior easily stimulates price increases, unsettles people's minds, and greatly affects people's livelihoods. He also points out that the 4% retail tax is a direct tax, directly levied on the buyer, and not borne by the intermediate merchant. However, ignorant merchants have arbitrarily increased prices by 30% to 40% or more, which is completely inappropriate. It is reported that Director Shao plans to discuss measures with relevant authorities to strictly correct this situation, in order to restore prices to the levels before mid-month and to order police officers to conduct secret inspections at any time. If there is any deliberate violation, they will be dealt with according to the law in order to maintain people's livelihood and prevent abuses.

### The Destitute People's Work-Study Center Hosted a Tea Party for All Sectors; Exhibition of Destitute People's Achievements and Works

The Shanghai Destitute People's Work-Study Center, run by the Shanghai World Red Cross Society, has been established since May of this year, combining education and training, and has achieved a certain scale. A tea party was held yesterday afternoon at 3:00 PM at the center in Caohejing to entertain all sectors, and an exhibition of the destitute people's achievements and works was held. Over one hundred people attended, including Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, Director Sun of the Bureau of Social Welfare, Yan Huiching, Zhang Yipeng, and Zhao Jinqing.

Chairman Reports on the Progress

The event began with a speech by Chairman Li Sihao, who briefly stated that the center began preparations in December 1932 and, after several discussions with the city authorities, finally got underway on the 2nd of this month, starting construction and installing equipment. At the end of May, it began to take in over 500 destitute people, providing education and moral transformation to eradicate their bad habits. Among them, there were many with excellent skills and expertise in mechanics, electricity, rotary, textiles, sewing, and other crafts. Based on their character, they were promoted to assistant technicians. The rest were taught according to their aptitudes or sent to major factories in other areas for training. In addition, the selection of clerks, attendants, hygiene personnel, hairdressers, bathers, and general workers, as well as the inspection of food and the distribution of vegetables, were all based on nutritional needs. However, due to the current soaring prices, the center relies on the support of people from all walks of life.

Guests from All Sectors Gave Speeches in Succession

Secretary-General Zhao, representing Mayor Chen, followed with a speech, briefly stating that the city government had long recognized the large number of destitute people in Shanghai. Fortunately, the Red Cross Society was engaged in civilian work and work-study production, allowing them to be self-sufficient and self-supporting, and becoming useful citizens. He expressed great admiration for this satisfactory achievement. Then, Mr. Zhang Yipeng gave a speech, briefly stating that before coming to the center, he had imagined the destitute people as still retaining their original appearance, but after a real visit, he felt that they had all transformed into good citizens, which was extremely gratifying. Next, Mr. Zhao Jinqing said that the center's achievements in such a short period of time were due to the enthusiasm, responsibility, and active production of the members of the Red Cross Society. Mr. Ling Xianwen said that the plan for receiving and caring for the destitute people had been in place for two years, and now that such effective results had been achieved, he hoped that everyone would make the greatest effort in the future. Finally, Mr. Chen, the president of this newspaper, briefly stated that the views expressed by everyone just now were very sincere. If society could train a non-productive person to become a productive person, this would be the most positive work. He expressed his deep respect for the enthusiasm and efforts of the members of the Red Cross Society. At the same time, he hoped that the government and local people would continue to encourage and assist them so that this undertaking could be sustained and expanded.

Editorial

### Vocational Training for Refugees

The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, operated by the World Red Cross Society, has been established for half a year, accommodating more than 500 refugees and teaching them skills to enable them to produce. Yesterday, the center hosted a visit for people from all walks of life and exhibited refugee-produced goods in order to attract the attention of the community.

"Refugees" are purely destructive elements in society, they are parasitic elements, and to put it strictly, they are the dregs of humanity. How to accommodate and train refugees who cannot produce, and make them into productive elements, is the common obligation and responsibility of the authorities and the community. Now is wartime, a time when we need to increase production and conserve consumption, especially when we need to use the maximum manpower on the one hand and save the maximum material resources on the other. Therefore, making purely consuming refugees learn skills and become productive elements is a social work of utmost urgency.

The Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center is the one undertaking this work, which is objectively very important. Although the center has only been in operation for half a year, its achievements are already quite remarkable, further proving the necessity of this work and its help to society.

We hope that the government authorities and enthusiastic people in the community will pay attention to the importance of "vocational training for refugees" in increasing production, conserving consumption, and improving social appearance, and jointly contribute money and effort to assist the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center in expanding its work, and if necessary, establish branch centers, so that there is not a single refugee in the city, and every refugee becomes a productive element.

### Citizens' Thrift Society to Be Reorganized Today

The reorganization and establishment meeting is scheduled to be held today (30th) at 11:00 am at the Ningbo Tongxiang Association. All members of the association are welcome to participate freely without restrictions. Ding Mocun, Minister of Social Welfare, will personally attend. Zhang Yipeng will chair the meeting.

### Dance Hall Business Hours Shortened by One Hour

Central News Agency report: In response to the capital's youth and student anti-smoking and gambling movement, the youth and students of this city held a righteous demonstration parade the day before yesterday (27th). All dance halls in the city were ordered to close. It is now learned that the First Police Department has decided to rectify the dance halls, stipulating that from today onwards, the business hours will be reduced by one hour each night, and all dance halls must close by 11:00 pm. At the same time, orders have been issued to the relevant branch bureaus to investigate the current situation of the dance halls and submit reports for verification.

Dance Hall Employees Petition to Resume Work

Furthermore, after the dance halls in this city were ordered to close, more than 3,000 employees and dancers petitioned the First Bureau yesterday morning (29th) to resume work in order to maintain their livelihoods. They also sent representatives to meet with Deputy Director Su. Deputy Director Su, along with Chief Secretary Zhao and Director of the Administrative Department Lu, received them and explained the significance of the ban in detail. Considering the livelihoods of the employees, they were temporarily allowed to resume business, but the business hours must be shortened, and they must cooperate with the propaganda work for youth and students and not obstruct it.

Economic Office Comments

### More on Consumption Special Tax

The previous day, we discussed the wartime consumption special tax, believing it to be the best policy for regulating wartime finance. For consumption items that are harmful to the public, such as smoking, gambling, and dancing, an extra tax should be levied as much as possible. Although it cannot completely eliminate these vices in an instant, it can still be used as a means of prohibition through taxation. As for all commodities related to people's daily lives, in this time of rising prices and declining livelihoods, we should not forget the intention of caring for people's livelihoods when levying special taxes. In other words, we must plan for both aspects in order to be reasonable.

According to the tax authorities' response to the Central News Agency reporter the day before yesterday, the retail tax rate has been decided to be 4% ad valorem, while major food necessities will be exempt from tax. From this, it seems that the authorities are indeed able to consider the current hardships of people's lives when levying the wartime consumption special tax. However, some unscrupulous merchants are again using the excuse of levying consumption special tax to arbitrarily raise prices, with some raising prices by 30% to 40% or 50%. It is not known how many commodities necessary for people's daily lives are included in this, and how many people who are struggling to survive at the lowest standard of living are affected. The special tax has not yet been levied, but the rate of price increases has already been ten times the tax rate of the new tax. This is the most serious phenomenon in the announcement of the wartime consumption special tax, and it urgently requires a clear statement from the tax authorities and strict suppression from the control authorities in order to live up to the people's obligation to pay the wartime consumption special tax.

### Bankers Association Held General Meeting Yesterday to Revise Articles of Association and Fill Vacancies on the Board of Directors

The Shanghai Special City Bankers Association held its 14th general meeting of members at 3:30 pm yesterday (29th). More than 200 people attended, including directors, supervisors, and representatives of 170 member banks. Standing Director Ye Fu presided over the meeting, and Secretary-General Lin Kanghou of the association reported on the association's affairs for the past six months (i.e., six months). The following important cases were then passed:

Approval of Important Cases

Approval of the membership of 14 banks, including Lih Tai, Shanghai Xingye, and Huatong; Approval of the withdrawal of Jiangzhe Enterprise Bank due to closure; Approval of the resignation of Director Chen Zhitang and the replacement by alternate Director Sun Zhongli; Approval of the final accounts for the current and previous terms and the budget for the upper term of the 33rd year; Approval of the Board of Directors' resolution to levy a special fee for the upper term of the 33rd year, with each bank paying a special fee of 200 yuan per month; Approval of the application for membership from four banks, including Huaan and Fushi; Approval of the draft revision of the association's articles of association; Temporary proposal: Due to electricity restrictions, it was decided that from January 1, 33rd year, the business hours of each member bank will be changed to 10:00 am to 3:00 pm, and Saturdays will still be 10:00 am to 1:00 pm, and the money industry association should be notified to implement this uniformly.

Report on Association Affairs

Secretary-General Lin reported, stating briefly: In the past six months, the government has promulgated several laws and regulations concerning the financial industry, among which the amendment of the bank registration regulations is particularly important. In the past, the capital of the silver and money industry was less than one million yuan, but according to the current amended regulations, the total amount must be at least six million yuan. If also engaging in trust business, an additional capital of two million yuan is required for each. Therefore, most new banks must handle capital increases, and the deadline is set for the end of this year. The association, considering that some banks and firms may not be able to complete the process in time, requested an extension of six months with the money industry street. Recently, we received instructions to extend it to the end of March of the 33rd year. In the past six months, the Shanghai financial market has generally been stable. During this period, the association's joint reserve association has revised the interbank lending measures. In addition, the government's implementation of the purchase of yarn and cloth is indirectly related to the mortgage of the industry, so we sent a letter to the Commerce and Trade Control Committee to set up a pledge right and notified each bank to handle it as scheduled. The Banking Association also revised and improved the warehouse receipt transfer method, notified each bank and firm to accept and make reserve deposits, handled prize-winning time deposits, stipulated the method of abolishing forward capital, and appointed members of the small group for revising the articles of association. Since July, 18 banks have applied for membership successively. As of now, there are 170 members, representing 622 people.

Revision of Articles of Association

The association passed the following articles in Chapter III, Article 3, Chapter IV, Article 12, and Chapter VII, Article 40 of the articles of association: Chapter III, Article 3: Any bank legally organized with completely Chinese capital within the Shanghai Special City area, registered with the Ministry of Finance and Industry, and having a business license and formally opened for business for more than six months, may join the association as a member with the introduction of two members of the association and after approval by the board of directors. Chapter IV, Article 12: The association shall, in accordance with the Provisional Regulations and Implementation Rules for Industrial and Commercial Associations, each member bank may send one to three representatives depending on the number of people it employs, but no one may serve as a representative of two members at the same time. Anyone with one of the following circumstances may not be a representative of a member of the association: (1) Someone outside the industry (2) Someone without capacity for civil conduct (3) Someone deprived of civil rights (4) Someone expelled from the association (5) Someone declared bankrupt and not yet restored. Chapter VII, Article 40: The association's expenses are divided into the following four items: (1) Membership fee: each member pays 3,000 yuan once (2) Monthly fee: each member pays 200 yuan per month (3) Special fee (4) Fixed fund.

### Flour and Wheat Committee Temporarily Suspends Wheat Purchases

Central News Agency report: The Flour and Wheat Professional Committee of the Commerce and Trade Control Committee has decided to temporarily suspend wheat purchases before the adjustment of the technical work of wheat purchase is completed, in order to adjust the steps. Yesterday, the person in charge of the committee issued a statement saying: In order to enable flour and wheat operators to develop healthily, strive to increase production, and enrich people's food, the committee has formulated a wheat purchase plan and approved the price of wheat in the producing area at 350 yuan per 100 market catties. At the same time, the price of flour bran is stipulated in order to balance the value of raw materials and products. For several months, thanks to the guidance of the competent authorities and the cooperation of operators, the work has been smooth and gratifying. However, recently, due to the stimulation of general prices, the price of wheat has risen sharply, making it difficult to purchase raw materials. However, the committee has decided to maintain the aforementioned approved wheat purchase price and has repeatedly stated this. Because flour is also a major food for the people, if the raw material increases, the price of flour will inevitably increase, directly affecting people's livelihoods and affecting general prices. The committee started purchasing in early July and has been purchasing for six months so far. The results have all reached the planned quantity. In addition to supplying flour bran to the people of Huazhong, special needs have been completely paid. The planned output to North China and other regions has also reached eight tenths. Currently, most flour mills still have inventory, so there is no need to increase the wheat purchase price. Now, in order to carry out the plan, complete the price stabilization policy, and increase purchase efficiency, the committee has prepared a new and more advanced plan for the technical aspects of wheat purchase. Before the implementation of the plan, the purchase work will be temporarily suspended. As for barley and yuan wheat, the designated commissioned merchants were once designated to purchase due to special needs, and the number of purchases has reached a considerable amount, so purchases are also temporarily suspended. However, grains are all controlled materials, and free movement and arbitrary hoarding are not allowed.

Management Measures for Small-Scale Machine Plants

In addition, the committee has also prepared management measures for small-scale machine plants and stone grinding mills and submitted them to the Commerce and Trade Control Committee for promulgation and implementation. Registration procedures are currently being carried out. In the future, the allocation of electricity to each member factory will be reviewed by the committee and forwarded to the Alliance Huazhong Electric Power Company for execution. Operators who cooperate with the control will be discussed with the authorities to allocate flour, cloth bags, coal, machine oil, and purchase funds to provide them with full assistance. All plans are being planned and implemented in order to do our best to enrich people's food and stabilize prices, so as not to fail the original intention of the establishment of the committee.

### China Stock Daily Expands, Renovates, and Relocates to New Address

Yesterday, the stock exchange was the last half-day of business for the year. China stocks rose first and then fell back. The market initially continued the upward trend of the previous day.

### Charity Sale of Medicine and Needle Relief

Mr. Yu Shaozhang wrote yesterday, saying: "At a time when the cost of living is soaring, medicines are especially expensive. Therefore, most patients feel that good medicine is unavailable, not to mention poor patients. I, out of a desire for human mutual assistance, would like to ask you to distribute 30 needles (one large box) of Cardiazol heart tonic, produced by the German Knoll Pharmaceutical Factory, from the remaining excess of 66 needles, to various benevolent organizations or charitable hospitals and enthusiastic social service doctors, so that patients who are unable to purchase them can use them, and sell the remaining 36 needles (one large box plus six needles) for charity, donating half of the proceeds to your newspaper's student loan fund and the rest to poverty relief funds."

### General Overview of the Work of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center

(1) Preparation Process The center began preparations in November of the 31st year of the Republic of China. After several joint meetings with municipal authorities, the organizational methods and the amount of expenses to be shared were determined. The location was temporarily borrowed from the Caohe Refugee Vocational Training Center. Due to various reasons, after several negotiations, it was finally settled in February of this year. Then, we began to work with workers and repair, and separately installed equipment. On May 28th of this year, we began to accommodate refugees.

(2) Organizational Outline Regarding the management and execution issues of the center, the municipal authorities have previously agreed that the municipal authorities will jointly organize the Management Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, with nine members. One chairman, one vice chairman, and other members are responsible for all matters of the center. The committee will organize the Executive Committee of the Shanghai Refugee Vocational Training Center, prefixed with the eight characters "Operated by the World Red Cross Society." Eleven executive committee members were publicly elected, and the executive committee members then elected a chairman and a vice chairman to handle all matters. Famous people from all walks of life are invited to be honorary members. In addition, a general affairs section is attached, with one director and two deputy directors. Finance, training, health, craft, and shelter distribution committees are also organized, and specialized personnel are hired to serve as members of each committee.

(3) Collection Method The standards and number of refugees to be collected were previously agreed upon by the municipal authorities. Municipal authorities in each district dispatched personnel to collect them on the streets, regardless of gender. The age range is 18 to 45 years old. However, those suffering from mental illness, infectious diseases, venereal diseases, and those who smoke opium or heroin are not allowed to be admitted. The number of refugees sent in by each district is determined according to the proportion of donations pledged by each district, allocated in a ratio of 6:4:3. Before collecting refugees and sending them to the center, each district will first notify the center and dispatch a doctor to jointly examine them. Those deemed suitable for sending to the center will then be sent to the center for accommodation. The number of admissions is temporarily set at 1,000. The Shanghai Special Municipality should send 308 people, the First District (former Municipal Council) should send 461 people, and the Eighth District (former French Concession) should send 231 people. Since the beginning of accommodation, excluding those who do not meet the admission requirements and those who are successively removed and those who guarantee themselves out of the center, the actual number of refugees admitted is 526.

(4) Training Policy Training refugees cannot be compared to other education. They are generally lazy by nature, not specialized in production, and some even enjoy begging, and are unrepentant of self-degradation. After collecting people, it is not easy to change their habits without disciplined training and moral influence. However, among them, there are also talents who have studied normal school and middle school, and those who have skills in machinery, electrical, wheelbarrow, textile, sewing, and miscellaneous arts. The center will appoint those whose character is slightly pure as staff members of the center, or promote them to assistant technicians. In addition, after national training is successful, they can gradually become useful talents for society. The main points of the implementation of training are listed below:

A. Spiritual Training The cultivation of the refugee's personality focuses on the training of virtues. The center promotes spiritual training based on the creed of the New National Movement, inspires the refugee's self-esteem and remorse, and guides them towards the path of improvement. It is supplemented by various entertainment activities and their aspirations, so that they have a considerable interest in work and production. The training items are as follows: Spiritual talks Lectures by celebrities Ceremony training Leisure activities Virtue training The above items are the responsibility of the Training Committee in conjunction with the director of the center. In addition, newspapers and art exhibitions, chess competitions, song practice, and drama performances are also held.

B. Physical Training Refugees have been living on the streets for a long time, and their bodies are mostly unhealthy. According to the doctor's examination report, most of them lack nutrition and vitamins, and anemia is a common symptom. The prescription is solid in diet and nourishment, and physical training is also very important for production efficiency. The center has actively trained for this issue, and as a result, the health of the refugees has gradually recovered, and those with sallow complexions have turned plump. The training items are as follows: Morning exercises National martial arts Tai Chi boxing wrestling Track and field Other physical education equipment (To be continued)

### Navy

— By Iwata Toyoo, Translated by Hong Yang

Youth (6)

News of the establishment of Manchukuo spread throughout the world. The May 15 Incident occurred in Japan. But those matters were too significant and their meanings too profound for a fourteen-year-old to fully understand. He only happily lived his new junior high school life.

Since the story of the Three Brave Soldiers, Mr. Ogata became the most popular teacher. The homeroom teacher, Mr. Hara, was also a good teacher. As for Mr. Oshima, who was skilled in kendo, he was quite different. With thick eyebrows, fierce eyes, a height of five feet eight inches, and a weight of twenty-three kan (each kan is roughly equivalent to 100 Chinese taels, so twenty-three kan is about 140-plus catties - Translator's Note). With a stern face, he was a teacher to be feared upon sight. But unexpectedly, he was very gentle, serving as both the head of the judo club and the head of the kendo club (both judo and kendo are Japanese martial arts), holding the 5th dan rank in kendo and an even higher 6th dan rank in judo. Consequently, the young men held him in great awe.

"It is said that Mr. Oshima is a descendant of Lord Saigo."

After hearing such rumors, some students made a big fuss about it.

All the new students wanted to join Mr. Oshima's kendo and judo clubs. For some reason, the majority wanted to join the kendo club. Due to equipment limitations, the school put in a lot of effort to allocate students to the different clubs. From the beginning, Zhenren wanted to join the judo club. One reason was his confidence in wrestling, and another reason was that judo, which involves hand-to-hand combat without weapons, suited his nature. Moreover, Mr. Ogata, whom he admired, was the director of the judo club. Longfu, after much deliberation, finally joined the kendo club.

The handsome and decisive Principal Kawada delivered a speech to the new students at the end of their first month.

"I am from a family of sweet potato farmers..."

Despite his humble claim of not being born in the castle town, his manner was refreshing and elegant, completely different from that of the other teachers.

"The principal's Western-style suit is tailored in Tokyo, and the style is excellent,"

Fu judged. The elegance of having lectured on Western history at Gakushuin University in Tokyo for many years still remained. He could not be compared to the badger principal described in Soseki's "Botchan" novel.

The head teacher, Mr. Iguchi, had a special quirk. Whenever there was a ceremony or sports day at the school, Mr. Iguchi would always say that it would definitely not rain. As a result, he often got drenched because he didn't bring rain gear. Even so, he never changed his belief.

There was also a teacher who made a very good impression on the students. That was Major Kikuchi, the assigned military officer. He had not been at the school for long. With sharp eyes like a hawk and a dark face, anyone who saw him could not help but feel his extraordinary passion and fighting spirit.
