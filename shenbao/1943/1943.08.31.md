### Increased Production Requires Catching Up

Recently, those discussing China's economic problems invariably focus on issues such as grain prices and increasing production. The grain problem is, in fact, a part of the broader issues of prices and production increase. Therefore, broadly speaking, the core of China's current economic problems lies in prices and increased production, two sides of the same coin. This is because increased production is a major factor in adjusting prices. To thoroughly resolve the price issue, one must actively engage in increasing production. This clear economic principle is already understood by everyone, and the government has long established it in the overall economic policy framework. Logically, with "increased production" established as a national policy by the government and understood by the people, it should be smoothly implemented. However, upon closer examination, has the agricultural sector promoted increased production plans? Or has the industrial sector promoted increased production plans? Or is it just that plans remain plans, and reality remains reality? Looking at the current state of production in Shanghai's industrial sector alone, let alone increasing production, even maintaining the existing output is proving problematic, which is truly regrettable.

Yesterday's newspaper reported that when Chairman Wang visited and inspected the Zhenjiang rural areas, he answered questions raised by journalists, saying: There has always been a significant divide between the old Shanghai concessions and the inland areas. The Qingxiang region produces rice, while the five million residents of Shanghai consume it. The Qingxiang region farmers grow cotton, while Shanghai factories spin and weave cloth. There is a black market for yarn and cloth, and the cotton farmers who painstakingly grow cotton cannot afford to buy cloth. The rice farmers who painstakingly harvest rice cannot afford to buy cloth even after exchanging the rice for money. This proves the separation between the old Shanghai concessions and the inland areas. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the government should actively promote a unified economic policy. The Qingxiang region has abundant agriculture, while Shanghai has abundant light industry. A comprehensive plan should be made to develop agriculture in the Qingxiang region to match the development of light industry in Shanghai. Agriculture is what the Qingxiang region should strive for, and industry is what Shanghai should strive for. It is firmly believed that after the recovery of the concessions, a unified economic policy will be smoothly implemented.

Upon careful examination of what Chairman Wang has revealed, it is nothing more than an expectation that producers in both industry and agriculture will strive to produce in their respective positions, connecting rural agriculture with urban industrial production, to realize a unified economic policy. We believe that the industrial production sector in Shanghai will greatly agree with this proposal, and it can even be said that they have been seeking it. This is because the phenomenon of either maximizing or halting production is not something the industrial sector itself desires, but rather something they are forced to do due to environmental constraints. We sincerely hope that while the government advocates increasing production and expects Shanghai to strive for industrial production, it must also pay close attention to the causes hindering production and use political power to remove these obstacles. If the causes hindering production are not thoroughly removed first, then the phrase "increased production" will ultimately become mere lip service.

We should also look back at how our allied nation Japan values increased production, never relaxing its efforts at any time or place. They maximize the utilization and operation of resources, equipment, and labor, which are most needed for increasing production, and consequently achieve good results. However, they believe that although each factory has exerted its full capacity as an individual unit, the overall capacity from the perspective of comprehensive relationships has not yet been fully utilized. Therefore, the government has decided to implement a plan to achieve comprehensive efficiency and amend relevant laws to adapt to it. This practical, meticulous, and realistic approach should serve as a wake-up call for our government and industrial colleagues, prompting us to emulate it bravely and catch up. Whether it is to enhance combat power to achieve victory or to regulate prices to stabilize people's livelihoods, the implementation of increased production plans is crucial and cannot be achieved through empty advocacy.

Editorial

### Comprehensive Utilization of Various Productive Forces

The Japanese government has decided on "the plan for dispatching workers between factories and workplaces" and has revised the Labor Adjustment Ordinance and the National Conscription Ordinance. From now on, with simple procedures, support for laborers will be provided randomly from general factories to affiliated factories or factories of the same type, and mines. The existing labor force will be given a wide range of activities. This will greatly contribute to opening up a path in the dead end of labor problems in enhancing production.

Needless to say, the various existing forces in materials, equipment, and labor, which are currently needed for increased production, should be utilized and operated to the maximum extent. Until now, each factory has already been working very hard to respond to the call for increased production, and as a result, the achievements in increased production are quite impressive. However, it must be noted that although the full capacity of each factory as a unit has been utilized, the maximum efficiency has not yet been achieved from the perspective of the overall relationship. Originally, in factories with comprehensive characteristics, the full capacity of cooperative factories as units exists, but the maximum efficiency has not yet been achieved from the perspective of the overall relationship. Originally, in factories with comprehensive characteristics, etc., they are the lower-level organization. There are probably very few cases where all parts are manufactured by the factory itself! Therefore, no matter how much the general factory exerts its full capacity, it cannot be said that the real maximum capacity has been exerted if the affiliated factories do not follow suit with the same degree of progress. One of the bottlenecks in increased production lies here.

Under the current circumstances, there can be no greater efficiency in the general factory. Further increasing production cannot but depend on the improvement of subcontracting factories. Moreover, this is not just a labor problem. Even from a technical point of view, or from the perspective of the management policies of the heads of subcontracting factories, there are not a few areas that need to be improved.

Furthermore, many general factories in Tokyo have most of their affiliated factories in the Osaka-Kobe area, or vice versa, general factories in Osaka-Kobe, and affiliated factories in Tokyo. This complex relationship did not start today, and the chaotic situation is even worse due to transportation difficulties. These bottlenecks must be found ways to break through. The extension of the factory, or part of the general factory, is integrated with the general factory. Appropriate measures should be requested from this comprehensive perspective. Following the comprehensive utilization of labor this time, powerful comprehensive and subordinate relationships should also be established in technical and management issues. At the same time, there should be mutual communication and cooperation between factories of the same type, and there should be no waste in the utilization of materials and equipment in the overall national production mechanism.

### Important Discussions Held Yesterday to Review Domestic and International Situations; Japanese Senior Officials Host Luncheon for Government Leaders

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Since the start of the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese government has repeatedly invited senior officials and the President of the Privy Council to the Prime Minister's official residence to explain and discuss the war situation and various domestic and international situations. This time, the senior officials hosted a luncheon for government leaders to discuss the current situation. The luncheon was held at the Peer's Club on the 30th. The attendees from the senior officials' side included Count Reijiro Wakatsuki, Admiral Keisuke Okada, Mr. Hirota Koki, Duke Fumimaro Konoe, Baron Kiichiro Hiranuma, General Nobuyuki Abe, Admiral Mitsumasa Yonai, and President of the Privy Council, Mr. Yoshimichi Hara. The attendees from the government side included Prime Minister and Army Minister Tojo, Navy Minister Shimada, Foreign Minister Shigemitsu, and President of the Planning Board Suzuki, etc. After lunch, various discussions were held on domestic and international situations and various issues until after 1:00 PM, when the meeting adjourned.

Director General Amau Explains the Situation

Tokyo, 30th (Central News Agency) – Director General Amau of the Japanese Information Bureau met with reporters from various countries stationed in Japan at the Information Bureau at 11:00 AM on the 30th for the first official meeting since taking office. He explained in detail the current world war situation and the actual situation of the Greater East Asia construction. He then answered questions from the press corps, stating that the Axis powers of Japan, Germany, and Italy have the firm conviction of certain victory against the Anglo-American attempts to end the war in the short term. The main points of his speech are recorded as follows: We would first like to express our deepest condolences on behalf of the Japanese people on the passing of His Majesty King Boris III of Bulgaria, and mourn His Majesty's great achievements and contributions.

The Construction of East Asia is Vigorously Advancing and the Defense Posture is Solidified

Looking back at the situation since the fourth, the Anglo-American side has consistently been plotting to reverse the declining war situation and implement political schemes. Conversely, on our side, we have repeatedly achieved construction results throughout the Greater East Asia region. In the military aspect, we have solidified our belief in certain victory. In the political aspect, China has established its complete sovereignty, Burma has become independent, and the indigenous people of Indonesia have participated in politics. Significant progress has been made in major events such as the restoration of the original identities of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. In the economic aspect, the foundation of co-prosperity is becoming more and more solid due to the heartfelt cooperation of the various countries and ethnic groups in Greater East Asia. In the cultural aspect, there was also the Greater East Asia Writers' Conference held the other day, which brought together representatives from the literary circles of various countries to discuss the creation of Greater East Asia literature. Under this situation, the common defense posture of Greater East Asia has been solidified, and measures to protect the future political and economic prosperity are being implemented day by day.

The Weakness of Anglo-American Forces is Clear in the Western European Theater

Germany is sometimes on the offensive and sometimes on the defensive on the Eastern Front, and is generally on the defensive in other aspects. This is because Germany also has strategic key points, which allows it to do so. In fact, there is no time in the war when it is all offensive. It is natural to adopt defensive strategies from time to time. Although the Anglo-Americans have repeatedly called for a Second Front, the weakness and lack of vitality of the Anglo-American armies have long been clear in this war. The German and Italian newspapers have also repeatedly pointed this out. This is because the Anglo-Americans were fighting in trenches in Europe during the previous war, but at that time they were centered on the French army, so they could wait for the German army to attack without launching an offensive. Today's Anglo-American army cannot cooperate with the French army, so it is forced to launch an offensive in Europe. The Anglo-Americans have greatly boasted of the victory in the Sicilian campaign, but according to the German side, the Anglo-American forces have already lost one-third of their main force, and there are criticisms within the Anglo-American countries that the Sicilian campaign lasted too long. In addition, the New York Times and the British Daily Express have also made such criticisms. Therefore, the Anglo-Americans are concerned about the loss of human lives and consider it to be the most distressing aspect of the war.

The Axis Alliance Remains Unwavering

The relationship between Japan, Germany, and Italy has always been friendly and strong as it is today. Although Italy has undergone a previous political change, it has consistently adhered to the Tripartite Pact and the treaty of no separate peace, and has formally notified us of its cooperation in the war. Although the Anglo-Americans have attempted to alienate Italy from Japan and Germany in order to seek a separate peace with Italy, judging from the attitude of the Italian officials and people and their national character, it can be seen that their attempt has failed. The psychological state of the Italian people now is: "A city that has been destroyed can be rebuilt, and a land that has been occupied can be restored, but international credibility cannot be restored once it is lost."

Japan Does Not Attach Importance to the Anglo-American Conference

The longer the war lasts, the greater the damage to the Anglo-Americans, and the greater the domestic unrest will be, and it will also cause conflicts within the government and conflicts between the government and parliament, especially in the United States. The conflicts within the US government are intensifying, and the decline in economic power has led to an increase in national anxiety. In addition, the US military, which is fighting all over the world, has repeatedly caused problems of disregard for ethics. In view of this situation, the enemy should want to end the war as soon as possible. However, the Axis side is currently launching planned attacks, enduring the enemy's counter-offensives, and waiting until the end to give the Anglo-Americans a fatal blow. In addition, Director General Amau of the Information Bureau stated in the past regarding the Quebec Conference: It is inevitable that the heads of the belligerent countries will meet. Even in this war, there have been standing conferences. His statement is even more ambiguous. Even the Anglo-American newspapers are not very concerned about it. For the time being, we will not lightly discuss the so-called First Pacific or First/Second Front. We do not consider it a problem, because it is not appropriate to suddenly point out the weaknesses of the opposing belligerent countries during the current period of war.

### Implementing Offensive Operations; Japanese Air Force's War Results: 33 American Planes Destroyed

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Air Force stationed in China has repeatedly launched preemptive strikes against the US Air Force and rear bases stationed nearby, and has also inflicted heavy blows on the invading US Air Force. The comprehensive war results from the 20th to the 28th of this month are recorded as follows:

Offensive Operations

The targets of the attacks were the Chongqing military factory zone, including the military facilities in Wanxian and the ships near the Litou Shipbuilding Sandouping area, and the Guilin, Hengyang, and Lingling airfields. The war results obtained were that the Chongqing H factory zone was bombed and caught fire, the military facilities and docks in Wanxian were bombed and caught fire, and in addition, one 1,000-ton ship was sunk, four other ships were destroyed, two 500-ton ships were sunk and destroyed, and many other ships were sunk and destroyed. Eight P40-type aircraft were shot down (three of which have not yet been confirmed), five P43-type aircraft (three of which have not yet been confirmed), and fourteen aircraft of unknown types (six of which have not yet been confirmed). The Japanese side lost five aircraft that did not return.

Defensive Operations

The war results were that eight enemy B24-type aircraft and seven P40-type aircraft were shot down (three of which have not yet been confirmed). Ground fire shot down four enemy P40-type aircraft (one of which has not yet been confirmed), for a total of nine aircraft (four of which have not been confirmed). The Japanese side lost two aircraft due to self-destruction and one aircraft that did not return, for a total of three aircraft. A total of thirty-three aircraft were shot down and destroyed, (six of which have not yet been confirmed). Although the Japanese aircraft lost eight aircraft this time, the enemy was shot down and destroyed thirty-three aircraft due to the fierce attacks and interceptions of the Japanese aircraft. The ratio between the two sides is four to one, which shows the absolute superiority of the Japanese aircraft.

### Japanese Troops Land at Sandu Ao in Fujian Province

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) – The Japanese Naval Landing Forces learned that the US military intended to use Sandu Ao in Fujian Province as a submarine base. On the 28th, with the assistance of seaplanes, they launched a preemptive strike and landed at Sandu Ao in Fujian Province. They are currently mopping up the remaining enemies.

### London Reports: Major War to Unfold; Roosevelt and Churchill Plan to Meet Again

Berlin, 30th (Central News Agency) – Dentsu News Agency reports that a German political report states: A telegram from Quebec says that British Prime Minister Churchill has decided to postpone his departure from the United States in order to fish in the Canadian mountains. Although Churchill enjoys fishing, this fishing trip is even more necessary, as Churchill is no longer young and has been extremely exhausted both physically and mentally after prolonged contact with Roosevelt. It is appropriate to take a short break in the mountains, and American newspapers report that Churchill and Roosevelt are scheduled to meet again within the next week. If so, then the Quebec Conference has clearly not yet ended, but has had to be temporarily suspended due to the mental exhaustion of the participants. At the same time, London is rife with rumors that Roosevelt and Churchill are waiting for the major war to unfold this weekend in order to issue a joint declaration. The so-called major war refers to the Second Front. Moscow has probably put the greatest pressure on the Quebec Conference, so the United Kingdom and the United States have had to be forced into action.

### Central Executive Committee Resolves to Reorganize the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters; Appoints Liu Yangshan as Chairman

Liu Yangshan is currently the Deputy Minister of the Central Organization Department, Political Counselor of the National Government, Deputy Director of the China Youth League, and Central. The Central government's appointment of senior officials to preside over the Shanghai Municipal Party Headquarters after the recovery of the concessions is of profound significance. Therefore, all parties have great expectations for the future of party affairs in Shanghai.

### Dissatisfaction with Japan-First Policy: Soviet Union Launches Diplomatic Counteroffensive; Recalls Ambassador to the United States, Litvinov

The Soviet Union has suddenly recalled its ambassador to Washington, Litvinov. While the important British-American talks are taking place in Quebec, and the whole world is watching the tenuous relationship between Britain, America, and the Soviet Union, this recall of Litvinov has stirred up a great deal of ripples on the calm waters. This is the biggest shock received by the political circles of Britain and America, and the relationship between the Soviet Union and Britain and America may progress with an unpleasant impression in the future as the war develops.

According to a United Press dispatch, about five hundred people, including the British and American political and military authorities, headed by Luo and Qiu, and about two hundred journalists, gathered together, and were happily holding talks to defeat the Axis powers. The news was like a bomb explosion, making the people present look at each other in dismay.

Why were they so shocked? Let's look at the reasons for recalling Litvinov speculated by Britain and America themselves:

Quebec Conspiracy

First, the Quebec Conference was a general military conference, and after the general content was reported to Moscow, Stalin immediately ordered Litvinov to resign. Britain and America speculated that this was because Stalin was dissatisfied with the content of the Quebec Conference resolutions. The immediate opening of a second front in Western Europe, which the Soviet Union has repeatedly requested, was regarded as non-existent in this conference. Britain and America are using a position that is beneficial to themselves to carry out an offensive on the European continent, such as the Italian offensive and the Balkan offensive, which is not what the Soviet Union wants. What he asked of Britain and America was to land immediately in Western Europe, at least to make Germany withdraw sixty divisions from the Eastern Front. The Soviet Union has had this hope for two years, but the British and American talks did not take it into account at all. The Soviet Union is single-handedly resisting the main force of the German army, and has been exhausted. This summer, it tried its best to launch an offensive to stop the German army, originally hoping that Britain and America would open a real second front during this period, but it has not been implemented. As a result, the Soviet Union could not bear it any longer. This unavoidable reality of the Soviet Union has become an irony to Britain and America. Behind this recall of Litvinov, there is a hidden possibility of peace between Germany and the Soviet Union, which is used as a threatening gesture.

Britain and America do not think that the Soviet Union's combat power is so urgent, but make the Soviet Union fight alone with Germany, waiting for them to be hurt on both sides, and reap the benefits. In the Soviet Union's view, this policy is the root cause of accumulating poison.

Strengthening the Far East Front

Second, according to speculation from the United States and neutral countries, one of the focuses of the Quebec Conference was to discuss strengthening the Pacific Front. In order to strengthen this Pacific Front, it was not necessary to entertain the Soviet Union, which maintains neutrality with Japan. However, in the Soviet Union's view, making the Soviet Union responsible for the war against Germany, while the United States focuses on the war against Japan, is naturally dissatisfied, so the recall of Litvinov is Stalin's expression of dissatisfaction with the British and American policies.

Comprehensive general observations, the contents of the Quebec military conference resolutions: to meet the Soviet Union's requirements for a second front, formulate a continental offensive plan; to strengthen the naval, land and air forces of each front; the offensive plan against Japan in the Burma battlefield and the Pacific Front; military and weapons assistance to Chongqing. Other political issues will be discussed later. Speaking of the fundamental policy of Britain and America, they do not want the Soviet Union to still have a very strong force at the end of the European war, but expect Germany and the Soviet Union to be hurt on both sides. Therefore, if they deeply attack Germany, they cannot but confront the powerful Soviet Union after the war, which is what Britain and America want to avoid. Moreover, even if the second front is opened in Western Europe as the Soviet Union hoped, the German National Defence Forces have reserved sufficient surplus strength, and there is a risk of being counterattacked. Therefore, the time is still early. It is better to take advantage of the opportunity that Germany and the Soviet Union are currently fighting to the death to free up forces and transfer them to the Pacific Front. This policy is naturally not tolerable for the Soviet Union, so the Soviet Union has launched this diplomatic counteroffensive.

Turkey's "Giant Mulet Report" also made the same view. The report said that Stalin was very dissatisfied with the British and American shift to the Japan-first policy, and recalled Litvinov, who had been known for his merits, in anger, which was the first warning. It further stated: "It is impossible to know what actions the Soviet Union's bold attitude will take in the future, but no matter what, the Soviet Union will finally decide to act independently, and the diplomatic rhetoric and other methods of Britain and America will be powerless."

Recall of Ambassador to the UK

Third, some people think that the recall of Litvinov was due to disagreement with Stalin. Some officials in Washington said: "Litvinov's resignation has been intended for a long time, but it has caused a commotion because it is happening now." This statement can also be used as a reference. However, the Soviet ambassador to Britain and the United States. First, there was the recall of Ambassador Maisky to the UK, and now there is Litvinov's resignation. Moreover, Litvinov's successor was promoted to the embassy counselor at the young age of thirty-nine. The weakness of the Soviet Union's Allied diplomatic representation lineup is obvious.

The official communication of Britain and America treats Litvinov's resignation as if nothing happened. "The recall of such British and American experts as Maisky and Litvinov to the Kremlin is our reality." The London Times said: "The old Litvinov has not been in good health recently." It said that this move has no special significance. However, in the current major situation, the bold actions taken by the Soviet Union can be said to make the serious situation even more serious. The Soviet Union's demands include not only the post-war European issue and the handling of the London exile governments, but also many others. But the biggest is "the issue of immediately opening a second front." If this request is accepted, the Soviet Union will be prepared to hold a three-nation meeting with Britain and America to discuss other issues.

Britain and America are engaging in coordination

The British and American sides seem to have encountered an insurmountable obstacle. That is to say, before the problem enters the realm of political tactics, the issue of military affairs as a temporary condition will be put aside and cannot be moved. If Britain and America ignore this clear attitude of the Soviet Union and proceed with the British and American policy according to the scheduled plan, what kind of events will occur in the European war situation? What will be the result of Eden-Wells' visit to Moscow? The gap that has appeared in the British, American, and Soviet openings after the end of the Sino-Japanese War has already involved the profound issues that will occur between these three countries after the war. Its future is extremely noteworthy. (Xiang: Translated from the Berlin phone call of the West Asahi Shimbun on August 25)

### Grain Purchase and Distribution to be Handled by the Commercial Control Association; Special Institutions Being Organized, Personnel Already Internally Determined

According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, the Materials Control Planning Committee held its sixth committee meeting in Nanjing on the 26th, and resolved to adjust the grain purchase institutions in the future. According to a reliable source from the Central News Agency: This case has been integrated, and in the future, all matters concerning grain control, purchase and distribution will be handled by the Commercial Control Association. The personnel have been internally determined, and personnel with rich experience in the grain industry will be responsible for the preparation. Because grain collection, transportation and distribution have not been fully perfected, it is expected that under the strong control and unification, grain management will be able to meet the needs of people's livelihood.

### "Counterfeit Banknote Identification Table" Unreliable; Refer to Newspaper Reports

Recently, there are so-called "counterfeit banknote weaving tables" on the road, selling to everyone. There are many counterfeit banknote numbers listed on it, but according to the person in charge of the Central Reserve Bank, the counterfeit banknotes that have been discovered and confirmed are only 10-yuan banknotes with D——A, D——B, D——C, D——D prefixes and S suffixes, 5-yuan banknotes with D——P, D——N prefixes and D suffixes, etc. The overseas banknote identification table sold on the market is actually unreliable. The identification points published in the newspapers on the 28th of this month should still be used as the standard. If you need these identification points, or have any questions, you can go directly to the bank on the Bund to ask for them.

### Minister Hirota Returns to Shanghai; Talks About Impressions of Returning to Japan

According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, Hirota Yoji, the information minister of the Japanese Embassy, ​​returned to Japan in mid-August to negotiate important matters with the Ministry of Foreign Affairs. He has now completed his mission and returned to Shanghai on the 27th. When Mr. Hirota received foreign reporters yesterday, he stated his impressions of staying in Japan for about two weeks as follows:

Diligent Service

Under the war, the focus of Japan's national economic power is concentrated on industry, which is natural, but on this point, I deeply feel that the wartime life of the Japanese people is indeed better than others. Although it is difficult to explain this in detail, an example can be cited, such as the diligent service of students. This diligent service system has been implemented for several years. Students who are currently studying engage in diligent service after school or during holidays. Whether in rural or urban areas, it makes a great contribution to supplementing the shortage of labor. Although this matter is very trivial, it can show the Japanese people, even the student class, are enthusiastic about the industry.

Calm Attitude

The most profound impression I gained during my stay in Japan was that the attitude of the Japanese people under the decisive battle was very calm, and the victory or loss of the war could not affect them. Judging from the current war situation, it cannot be said that it is necessarily beneficial to the Axis powers, but the Japanese people observe the development of the situation with a calm and composed attitude. I have studied why the Japanese people can maintain a calm attitude and self-confidence. After deep consideration, I can roughly obtain the following points: First, the Japanese people are all aware that the Greater East Asia is a large-scale and long-term operation. Recognizing that the victory or defeat of the war is not enough to affect the final victory of the war, local problems can never sway the people's self-confidence. Second, the Japanese people have the greatest determination for this war. Not only the officers and soldiers of the army and navy on the front line, but also the men, women, old and young of the people, are willing to sacrifice their lives for the country. Regarding the tragic and tragic situation of the Battle of Attu Island as announced by Oyama, the national people of Japan and the United States have the desire to follow the officers and soldiers of the army and navy on Attu Island and sacrifice their lives for the country.

War Belief

Third, the Japanese people have a solid belief in the justice of this war, that is, this war is unavoidable. Therefore, from the standpoint of all the peoples of the world, this war is also extremely conducive to justice. The Japanese people I met were filled with this kind of spirit between their layers. The Japanese people have the above-mentioned determination and conviction, so although the war is becoming more and more fierce, and life is becoming more and more uncomfortable, their minds and bodies are healthier, and they face the situation with a smiling attitude. Therefore, from the outside, Japan under the war is dark at night on the streets, air-raid shelters are dug everywhere, clothes are becoming simpler, and lunch boxes are also more frugal, but further observation of its content can feel that the spirit and aspirations of the Japanese people are not inferior to those of a few years ago.

### Insufficient Supplement of Rice and Flour; Miscellaneous Grains Will Be Sold Starting Tomorrow; Also Borrowed from the Rice and Grain Distribution Office

The miscellaneous grains issued this time are divided into (1) barley, (2) naked barley (that is, unmalted raw barley), (3) sorghum, (4) red sorghum. This batch of miscellaneous grains is also borrowed from the Central China Rice and Grain Distribution Office. They are being milled by Shunfeng on Xinzha Road, Hengkang on Zhabei Guangfu Road, and Hengyi on Mei Baike Road. All milling can be completed today, and they will be sold on September 1.

The Allocation Section Notified the Rice Shops Yesterday

The Rice Flour Allocation Section of the Economic Department of the First District Office notified the rice shops yesterday, saying: "The office announced on August 3 that it sincerely invited Taiwan to negotiate. Now that the validity date of the rice purchase certificate of the 45th joint ticket has been changed to September 5, the rice purchase certificate of that period should be returned to the office on Tuesday, September 7. In addition, the validity date of the second miscellaneous grain purchase certificate is September 5. Please return the miscellaneous grain certificate of that period to the office together with the 45th rice purchase certificate on Tuesday, September 7. The 45th flour certificate must be returned to the office on the originally scheduled September 1.

Rice Tickets Must Be Claimed Before the Deadline

The West District Rice and Grain Office of the First District recently sent a letter to the Lianbao chiefs, stating that from September 1, the head of the household must claim the rice tickets according to the date indicated on the back of the housing donation ticket. Otherwise, they will be punished. The Baojia chiefs of the district have issued separate orders to the heads of households to follow.

### The Municipal Government Reiterates the Prohibition; Measures to Restrict Banquets; Must Be Strictly Abided by Starting from September 1; All Citizens of the City Should Practice Economy

According to the Central News Agency in Shanghai, the Shanghai Special City Government recently issued a notice, stating that from September 1 of this year, the banquet restriction measures of the National Government should be strictly followed. Both restaurants and banquet hosts must strictly abide by and strictly abstain from violations. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be punished without exception. At the same time, it sent a letter to the New Movement Promotion Branch to assist in publicity, and ordered the first, second, and third police bureaus to instruct all types of restaurants to comply. The notice is recorded as follows: For the sake of the notice, at this time of material shortage, in the autumn of rising prices, all of our people should strive to save. However, recently, rice boxes and banquets have become increasingly extravagant. A banquet costs the assets of middle-class people. There is wine and meat in the mansions, and bones on the roads. Reflecting on oneself, one should not be at ease. Restrictions should be strictly enforced to restrain vulgar customs. The National Government had already promulgated the banquet restriction measures and ordered them to the whole country, but after a long time, they were ignored and the implementation was ineffective. Now that the concessions have been recovered, the prohibition should be reiterated. From September 1 of this year, the city's restaurants must strictly abide by and must not exceed the limits. It is also hoped that all citizens of the city will strictly abstain from violations, so as to do their best to save and show their enthusiasm for serving the country. Anyone who is found to have violated the rules, whether it is a restaurant or a banquet host, will be punished without exception. In addition to sending a letter to the Shanghai Branch of the New National Movement Promotion Committee to assist in publicity, and separately ordering the first, second, and third police bureaus to instruct all restaurants to comply, this notice is hereby issued for public knowledge.

Two Measures for Chinese and Western Banquets

(Attached) Excerpts of two banquet restriction measures of the National Government are as follows: (1) For banquets using Chinese dishes, a table for more than ten people shall not exceed the following quantities: Less than ten people shall be reduced accordingly, six side dishes (regardless of whether they are cold dishes, hot dishes, or vegetarian dishes, regardless of whether they are large or small plates, all are limited to six colors). Two sweet dishes, four rice dishes, one soup, fruit, and tea. If four assets are used, the following quantities shall not be exceeded: (1) Soup, (2) Soup, (3) (4). Fish dishes accompanied by vegetarian dishes, (5) sweet dishes, (6) fruits and tea. (1) All banquets shall be based on joint invitations.

### Commentary: Restrictions on the Supply and Sale of Goods

In order to do its utmost to eliminate hoarding and strive for balanced supply, the authorities have already ordered all companies and firms to moderately restrict the sale of any goods and not to allow them to be purchased in large quantities. This announcement of restrictions on the supply of goods forces us to say a few words.

At a time when the general prices in this city are already on the right track, the prices of food have mostly risen in a straight line, which has the most serious impact on people's livelihood. Fortunately, the authorities are determined to stop this, and price limits have been established in the central hubs for the supply and sale of daily food, such as vegetable markets, for compliance. Otherwise, the vegetable market will only become a place for "individual runners" to profit and will no longer be a food supply for the citizens.

The reasons why food prices in Shanghai only rise and do not fall are, firstly, due to the scarcity of sources, and secondly, due to the frequency of supply. Just look at the owners of restaurants and taverns, and the extremely extravagant rich households; wherever they go, they only care about returning fully loaded, without calculating the price. Assuming that in addition to restricting the prices sold in the vegetable market, if we can also consider the situation and restrict the quantity sold, then not only can the state of demand exceeding supply be eliminated, thereby promoting the decline of food prices, but also the "economical dishes" that we want to promote can be promoted in major restaurants and taverns, thereby breaking the bad habits of extravagance and luxury during the war. Wouldn't this be killing two birds with one stone? Therefore, restricting the sale of goods is not only a condition for implementing the rationing system but also a force for promoting the thrift movement.

### Inspection of Financial Affairs Office Rectifies Loans from Money Shops, Responsible for Inspecting Savings Business

The Financial Affairs Inspection Office of the Central Reserve Bank, in view of the Ministry of Finance's measures to restrict loans from money shops, had already issued a notice to the money shop associations to forward it to all financial institutions for handling. Now, among the accounts listed in the loan sub-account details sent to the office by various financial institutions, there are many that comply with the Ministry's orders, but there are also many that conflict with the Ministry's regulations. Therefore, in order to reorganize the loan business of various financial institutions, it has ordered them to find ways to recover the loans that have already been issued but do not comply with the Ministry's orders, and to report them at any time for verification.

In addition, the Financial Affairs Inspection Office, under orders to be responsible for inspecting the business of savings banks and collecting a guarantee of one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits, has already sent letters to various branches to forward to various savings banks for compliance. Now, an excerpt of the Savings Deposit Guarantee Reserve is as follows:

Deposit Method:

(1) The savings loan guarantee reserve shall be at least one-quarter of the total amount of savings deposits, equivalent to government bonds, treasury bills, and other reliable collateral. The total amount of deposits stipulated in the preceding paragraph shall be based on the total balance at the end of each half-year. (2) The Central Savings Bank may, when necessary, hire experts to assess the value of the various collateral items of the guarantee reserve. (3) The Ministry of Finance may, at any time, entrust the Central Reserve Bank to inspect the business content of savings banks and the actual situation of all their assets. (4) Savings banks may apply to exchange the same type of collateral items for the various collateral items of the guarantee reserve at the end of each month. When the value of the collateral items in the preceding paragraph fluctuates excessively, the Central Reserve Bank may order the savings bank to make up the difference or return the excess. (5) The Central Reserve Bank shall, at the end of each month, present a list of the guarantee reserves deposited by savings banks to the Ministry of Finance for record.

Economic Management Section Adjusts Association Registration

The Economic Group Management Section of the Economic Department of the First District Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality has been formally established and has begun operations, continuing to handle various tasks of the former Public Works Bureau's Association Section.

It also limits the time for associations and groups that have been dissolved to surrender their previous licenses in order to comply with the law; otherwise, they will be banned.

As a result, both sides are approved. In order to seriously uphold the original intention of donors who enthusiastically support education, this newspaper is conducting an investigation into this situation. It hopes that the authorities of various schools will do their best to assist, and also hopes that if any of the students applying in groups have the above situation, they should immediately decide to receive the aid from any one organization.

### Three Days in Zhenjiang

— Liu Hanru

In order to complete the task of rural pacification, the Jiangsu Provincial authorities designated Zhenjiang and its surrounding counties as a special zone in March of this year and implemented rural pacification work, with the goal of completing the planned steps in stages by the end of August over a period of six months. Reporters from various newspapers were specially organized into a sightseeing group to go to Zhenjiang for on-the-spot investigation. This reporter was fortunate to be able to stay in Zhenjiang for three days and report to those concerned about the rural pacification areas in the countryside and towns.

Rural Pacification Area

The Zhenjiang rural pacification area includes Danyang, Jintan, Jurong, and Jurong counties. It was established starting in March of this year. The first step of rural pacification work is to establish a blockade line to remove undesirable elements within the line. The Zhenjiang District blockade line is 2,730 kilometers long. Starting in early March, bamboo materials were collected. Construction began on March 10. According to the designated blockade line, the bamboo fence was built in one and a half months. The entire district was surrounded by fences to implement the work of ensuring that good citizens who abide by the law can resume a life of peace and contentment.

In order to prevent undesirable elements from sneaking in and out and to control the smuggling of materials, 57 checkpoints were established along the blockade line, with 550 workers assigned. To carry out the inspection work.

Within the rural pacification area, all administrative and educational work must be started from scratch. From the beginning of rural pacification to the completion of the predetermined goals, there are two aspects of work to be done within the six-month period: negative and positive. Specifically speaking, military sweeps, establishing blockade lines, compiling and checking Baojia, registering self-renewal households, and reporting undesirable elements are all part of the negative aspect. Training township and town chiefs, training Baojia chiefs, establishing self-defense corps, organizing guard work, and considering people's livelihoods and adjusting the economy are all part of the positive aspect. According to officials in charge, the above-mentioned tasks have generally reached the point of completion.

The purpose of rural pacification is to enable people to live and work in peace, and to enable people within the district to defend, govern, and support themselves. 7,965 workers were mobilized to complete various scheduled tasks within the limited six-month period. The perseverance of the presiding authorities and the diligence of the workers are commendable.

Tour of Jianbi

Jianbi Town and Dantu Township belong to the fourth district of Zhenjiang County. We once set out to visit. Along the way, villages and towns had self-defense guards watching the main roads, implementing the "three selfs" rural pacification policy. Jianbi is a small, insignificant town with more than 50 stores. Restaurants and taverns occupy about 10 of them. Fish, meat, and vegetables are piled up inside the stores, and there are many diners. This reflects the relatively stable life of the people in the town. Rice stores are piled high with white rice, selling for about 120 yuan per dan, and pork sells for 36 yuan per catty.

The Jianbi Town Self-Defense Guards have X hundred members, all of whom have received military training. During the inspection, their marching, drills, and basic military movements were quite proficient. At the same time, we also saw a security drill. From the discovery of bandits to the routing of bandits, various actions in between were swift, brave, and agile. Coordinated with the local garrison and the local police brigade, their advances, retreats, and maneuvers were vividly realistic.

Self-Defense Spirit

In Zhenjiang City, we participated in two major inspections of the First District Self-Defense Corps, with a total of three squadrons. Their uniforms were neat, and their marching was orderly. The self-defense guards each have their own occupations, and they enthusiastically receive training in their spare time, acquiring basic military knowledge to protect their homeland. Therefore, we know that the self-defense capabilities of the rural pacification area are quite strong.

Establishing security and improving people's livelihoods are the two major goals of rural pacification. In terms of security, we have gained some understanding, which is that people in the rural pacification area can now live in peace and no longer suffer from the harassment of bandits as before. Regarding the work of improving people's livelihoods, according to the report from the county government officials in charge, they have started by abolishing exorbitant taxes and levies. In the past six months, they have abolished the Fuxing Tax, the Jiangmian Tax, and the farmland donations, etc., in addition to the national tax. No local taxes and levies have been added. In addition, suppressing commodity prices, assisting in silkworm rearing, and planning to increase production are all implemented to improve people's livelihoods, guiding them to bravely advance on the road to "self-sufficiency."

Rural Pacification Cadres

The actual person in charge of rural pacification is Director Yuan Xueyi, and the Deputy Director and Magistrate of Zhenjiang County, Xiu Ming, are both full of vigor. Their performances are youthful, lively, and decisive. This group of officials led nearly 8,000 workers, fought hard for half a year, cleared out the remnants of the Communist army, and enabled the people of Zhenjiang to embark on the road to rebirth.

Social Atmosphere

Zhenjiang City is a major station on the Beijing-Shanghai Railway. Because it is close to Nanjing and Shanghai, the social atmosphere is also similar to that of Nanjing and Shanghai. It is necessary for the authorities in charge to quickly rectify it.

The Dadong Ou Arena is an entertainment venue that imitates the Gaole Arena in Shanghai. Ordering plays, female singers sitting with guests is like Shanghai and Nanjing. Here, we can see generous guests who are not stingy with spending thousands of gold coins. It is said that there are also guests who call from home to order plays, ordering female singers to go to their residences to serve them. Among these guests, it is also heard that some are civil servants. "Diligence and thrift" is what the chairman often instructs the people, and "thrift to cultivate integrity" is the code of conduct for political personnel. We only hope that what we have heard is not true. In the spirit of the Spring and Autumn Annals' criticism of the virtuous, we hope that civil servants will quickly change their ways if they are in the wrong.

National Forum

### On Starting a Consumer Cooperative for Teachers and Staff

— Ma Zhonglai

I am a teacher, having taught at universities and secondary schools for over ten years. It's not that I'm tired of it; I long ago chose education as my lifelong career, and I have a great interest in it. However, in recent years, I often feel troubled and pained. Last semester, I taught thirty-four hours a week at two universities, and my monthly income was still less than two thousand yuan, while my expenses were more than three thousand. I was constantly strapped for cash and had to budget carefully. Every time I heard about a price increase, I was alarmed. If my wife became ill, I would be even more at a loss. I thought to myself, I am educating other people's children and cultivating talents for the nation, lecturing and gesturing all day long, but the compensation I receive is not even as good as that of a rickshaw puller. This society is too unfair! The threat to my livelihood has disturbed my mind, and the worry about food and clothing has exhausted my spirit. This has further affected my work. To worry about making a living, my mind is not focused; with too many classes to teach, there is not enough time. I deeply feel that the effect of my work is far from what it used to be. I am aware of the great responsibility I bear and the importance of the work I do, but I cannot do it wholeheartedly, even though I have tried my best. The anxiety felt by a person who carries the heavy burden of life every day, a person who is constantly threatened by the pressures of life, a person who is dissatisfied with his own work, a person who holds the guilt of "misleading the students," is something that others can never understand. I believe that this anxiety and pain are felt by every teacher in Shanghai.

Recently, Mr. Jiang Shoutong suggested establishing a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, which is indeed a good way to solve some of the financial difficulties of teachers and staff. I sincerely hope it will be realized soon. "It's hard to twist a rope from sand at the beginning." The number of teachers and staff in Shanghai, including those in universities and primary and secondary schools, is not small. Usually, they have no organization and are not connected. Now, to have a consumer cooperative is like twisting a rope from sand, not an easy task. Moreover, many teachers are influenced by traditional ideas and inherited habits, ashamed to talk about profit, content with simple living, or indifferent, watching for success or failure. School authorities often do not think about the future of education and the livelihood of teachers, and are even more afraid of complications that could harm their own interests, or they procrastinate or obstruct and sabotage. In order to quickly establish a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff, I have the following suggestions: First, a few enthusiastic teachers should organize a temporary preparatory meeting to draft a plan. On the one hand, advertise to teachers and staff in Shanghai, sending out letters for registration, specifying in the registration letter the name, school, position or course taught, home address, family size, and number of shares subscribed. On the other hand, request assistance from people in the community and negotiate for the allocation of necessary items. When there is considerable progress, convene a general meeting of members, elect responsible staff, and discuss the implementation plan. The plan should be based on the number of people who join and the circumstances, either by school or by district. The Shen Bao on the 24th had the collective opinions of fifteen teachers, or perhaps those few should be asked to prepare the work, not declining the responsibility, hoping they won't be too modest.

I also have a point to make, which is that even if a consumer cooperative is established, it may not solve the financial difficulties of teachers. Because there are many things that still need to be bought from retail stores. The gap between teachers' salaries and prices is really too far. Let me make a comparison: before the war, university salaries were two and a half to three yuan per hour, and the cost of living was 120 yuan per month; last semester, salaries were twelve to fifteen yuan per hour, and the cost of living was more than three thousand yuan per month. Salaries have increased fivefold, the cost of living has increased thirtyfold, and prices have increased, to say the least, a hundredfold. Limited clothes have already been worn out, and meager savings have already been used up. Exhausted, unable to continue, is the situation teachers are in now. Unable to live in peace, how can they enjoy their work? The decline in educational efficiency and the decline in students' levels are undeniable facts, phenomena that we are extremely heartbroken about. The impact is not yet visible, but in the future, it will have serious consequences, which is so dangerous for the country and the nation. But what can we do! As the Shen Bao editorial on the 25th said: "To improve education and increase efficiency, the most basic thing is to start with improving the lives of teachers and increasing the salaries of teachers." I think teachers' salaries should be increased at least twenty times compared to before the war. Increasing teachers' salaries will inevitably lead to an increase in students' tuition fees, which may be criticized. Indeed, poor parents are already unable to afford their children's education, but there are also students who spend lavishly, wasting endlessly. A pair of leather shoes, a suit, or a few fewer trips to the theater, dance hall, or restaurant would be enough to pay for a semester's tuition with money to spare. Even if tuition is increased to 1,500 yuan, it is only thirty times what it was before the war. In the past, a journey that cost a dime by rickshaw now probably costs no less than five yuan. I think tuition can be increased as much as possible, but the number of free places for poor students must be increased, and scholarships should be given to students with outstanding achievements, because poor families cannot afford to study, not only because they cannot afford the tuition, but also because the daily expenses of clothing, food, and books far exceed the tuition. I hope that school authorities will seriously consider this point when deciding on teachers' salaries and students' tuition fees.

To lay the foundation for the country, to cultivate the strength for recovery, and to improve educational efficiency and stabilize the lives of teachers, please school authorities not to neglect the big picture for the sake of small gains; please people in the community to give sympathy and understanding; please all teachers not to become criminals of education for the sake of noble empty names, and rise up to discuss. Let us all work hard to improve education for the country and the nation!

Eliminating Opium and Gambling

### Advocating New Entertainment for the People

— Wan

In recent years, tens of millions of people have lost their homes and property or even their lives due to opium and gambling. After the takeover of the two concessions, the municipal government is very determined to ban opium and gambling in the city and will soon order their closure. Dance halls and bars will also be restricted and closed early. This is an exciting sign. From now on, the dark side of Shanghai will be thoroughly cleaned up, replaced with a new look, and the people's entertainment will be guided to the right path. It is hoped that all sectors will actively promote various new entertainment activities to create new citizens with healthy bodies and minds. It is also hoped that the original site of the dance hall will be converted into a public gym, a public entertainment hall, etc., where various facilities are added and provided to the public for free entertainment.

### Zhou Bichu's Charity Oil Painting Exhibition

The proceeds will be used to help the families of overseas Chinese in Xiamen and Gulangyu. People from all walks of life have been enthusiastic to visit and purchase. However, the exhibition period is too short. The fellow villagers have re-negotiated with Zhou Bichu and agreed to extend the exhibition for another three days until September 1st. The time is from 1:00 PM to 7:00 PM.
