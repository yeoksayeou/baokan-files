### The Pressing Problem of Food Supply

Since the government announced the order to purchase cotton yarn and cotton cloth, although a small number of commodity prices have fallen, the price of rice and grain, which is most important to people's livelihood, has not fallen. We can assert that if the price of rice and grain can also fall, then commodity prices in general will definitely be able to fall across the board. According to past experience, the rise in various commodity prices and their speed are extremely abnormal, sometimes rising with rice prices as the center, while other times falling simultaneously regardless of rice prices. However, it is undeniable that fluctuations in rice prices have a major impact on other commodity prices.

However, today, if we abandon theoretical economic explanations and analyze purely based on facts, we can prove that the prices of "food"—that is, rice—and "clothing"—that is, yarn and cloth—two major daily necessities for people's livelihood, are the centers of all commodity prices, but each exerts a major effect. If the prices of "food" and "clothing" rise or fall in unison, then the rise and fall of all commodity prices will also be fully consistent. If the prices of "food" and "clothing" rise or fall inconsistently, then the rise and fall of all commodity prices will also be inconsistent. For example, in the past, rice prices fell back, but yarn and cloth did not, so some commodity prices fell accordingly, while others did not, which resulted in the passive rebound of rice prices. Now that yarn and cloth have fallen back, but rice prices have not, some commodity prices are falling, while others are not. If we now hope that all commodity prices will fall across the board, we must first promote a drop in rice prices so that it is consistent with the drop in yarn and cloth prices.

If our above analysis does not contradict the facts, then, to demand a comprehensive drop in commodity prices, we cannot but first demand a drop in rice prices. We must first ask: Why did rice prices rise nearly twofold at the turn of June and July? Why is household rice being reduced and postponed? Regarding the latter, although there was a report from the Datong News Agency yesterday, the person in charge cannot shirk their responsibility for the reasons conveyed. If these two problems cannot be resolved, it will cause great disappointment to the people, and they will wonder: To what extent will the prices rise? How long will the postponement last? How much will it be reduced?

The general speculation is that the reasons for this are: transportation obstruction, preventing smooth delivery; insufficient rice and grain production; and mismanagement, inadequate handling, the so-called "human error." To remedy these three shortcomings, we believe:

In terms of transportation, we should ask our ally Japan for as much assistance as possible. We hope that our Japanese friends, with a long-term vision of Sino-Japanese cooperation, will absolutely value the Chinese people's food problem. An ancient Chinese sage said, "The people regard food as their heaven," which shows that the importance of food to the people is unparalleled. The competent grain authorities should have complete management and command rights over the transportation of rice flour for the supply of people's food.

Insufficient grain production is naturally the root cause. Increasing food production has long been established as a national policy. The relevant competent authorities only need to formulate an overall plan and implement it as soon as possible. We should all first make use of wasteland, open spaces, and gaps to plant as much rice, wheat, and miscellaneous grains as possible to make up for the deficiency.

If there is mismanagement, then we advocate adjusting the organization as soon as possible, recognizing the absolute importance of the people's food problem, and not passively delaying and making mistakes. Moreover, the National Federation of Commerce Associations is the only economic regulatory agency with commercial autonomy, so managing food regulation seems to be its inherent responsibility. Since the current rice management agencies have not been able to handle matters perfectly, it is natural to merge them into the Federation of Commerce Associations to take over and take sole responsibility. Or the Federation of Commerce Associations should select impartial people from society to preside over the handling. We must ensure that the people's food problem is resolved reasonably.

The provinces of Jiangsu and Zhejiang, especially the area near Shanghai, are abundant rice-producing regions. If the regulation of rice and grain in this area is at a loss, then the future of the people's food supply is uncertain, and runaway inflation and social unrest are lurking here, which is really too dangerous. After supporting the government's policy of purchasing yarn and cloth, we must urge the government to attach importance to the people's food supply, promptly determine food policies, strengthen regulatory agencies, and improve procurement and distribution methods. Adjusting the people's food supply and stabilizing the people's livelihood truly depend on this!

### Trends in the Eastern Front War

The advancement of the Eastern Front has become tense with the aggravation of the Italian war situation. Therefore, the Eastern Front is closely related to the overall European war situation. Although Britain and the United States in Italy and the Soviet Union on the Eastern Front have each launched counteroffensives against the Axis powers, careful observation reveals that their pace may not be consistent. Regarding the puppet regimes of various countries exiled in London and the Second Front issue, the divide between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is not only exposed in the opposition and contradictions of political opinions, but also in the depth of the opposition, as evidenced by the absence of Soviet representatives at the Quebec Conference.

In addition, strategically speaking, the Italian Front and the Eastern Front not only lack close ties but often contain political intentions and restrain each other. However, from the perspective of the overall European war situation, these two fronts ultimately have direct and significant connections. Therefore, the future development of the Italian war situation will have a significant impact on the recent progress of the Eastern Front.

The central region of the Eastern Front first became the main battlefield of the German-Soviet front this summer, and then extended to the entire front. In this central region, Orel and Belgorod mutually form prominent and curved shapes within the lines of the German and Soviet armies. The German and Soviet armies have been fighting fiercely in this curved area for a month this summer, and what is most noteworthy is that the German army has suddenly withdrawn from Orel in a planned manner. Anti-Axis institutions and the general public have pointed to this as an indication of the Soviet offensive, even saying that the German army has encountered a serious situation.

Regardless of whether this withdrawal is planned, Germany has implemented it based on a major decision. However, it is too early to determine the decline of the German army based solely on this. We believe that this decision by the German army is to establish a favorable front, minimize the consumption of combat power, and increase the surplus of war power. Therefore, rather than saying that it is the result of the Soviet Union responding to the actions of Britain and the United States, it is more accurate to say that Germany is voluntarily withdrawing from the protruding parts, avoiding sacrifices, straightening the front line, and putting itself in a favorable position. This fact shows that the current military goals of Germany and the Soviet Union are extremely different.

However, the Soviet Union is still taking advantage of the momentum to advance rapidly, aiming to recover Smolensk, Bryansk, and Kharkov, and the Second Front in the south and the bombing of various parts of Europe are also becoming increasingly intense. If Germany can quickly shorten the Eastern Front, adopt a favorable defensive line, and make good use of the surplus power freed up, then Germany's position on other fronts may not be able to shift to a more favorable situation.

### Japanese Aircraft Attack Guilin, Shoot Down Five American Planes

### Intense Fighting in the South Pacific, America Admits to Hardship

Following the landing on Rendova Island, the American forces continued to land on New Georgia Island, and their offensive has been hindered by the valiant resistance of the elite Japanese forces for over forty days. During this period, the American forces have mobilized superior land, sea, and air forces to repeatedly attack, but have not achieved significant results. A spokesperson for the anti-Axis forces in the Southwest Pacific described the hardship of the American forces: "American infantry units are engaged in fierce fighting with the Japanese forces. The Japanese garrison, although subjected to intense attacks from the sea, land, and air, does not appear to be demoralized. The resistance is becoming increasingly fierce." The August 9th issue of the American Times Weekly reported on the hardship of the American forces on New Georgia Island:

"The battle is progressing extremely slowly, with no hope. Why is this the case? The reason can be found in the following facts: Because the American forces hold overwhelming superiority in the sea and air, the commanders of the ground units hope to use indiscriminate bombing and artillery fire to open a bloodless path for the infantry to advance. This expectation has become a dream. The Japanese army occupies many underground holes that can withstand bombing. These holes are created using the craters left by bombs to form permanent caves and earth mounds, shelters, etc. If the American forces want to take action, they must first thoroughly eliminate these positions. The Japanese bravely infiltrate and remain in the American positions, so snipers appear in the American positions from time to time and engage the American forces. This has never been seen before. The shooting accuracy of these snipers is very high, so there are many casualties. Even well-trained units are often overwhelmed. The unfamiliar climate and the morale of the new units are exhausted by these attacks by the Japanese army." (Xiang: Translated from the Buenos Aires-Keijo dispatch of the Western Mainichi Shimbun, August 14)

### German Forces Withdraw from Kharkov According to Plan

Military Facilities Completely Destroyed

Heavy Fighting Still Underway Northwest of Kharkov

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German High Command announced on the 23rd that German forces completely destroyed the military facilities in the city of Kharkov on the night of the 22nd and withdrew from the city according to plan without being hindered by Soviet forces. Kharkov has lost its value as a transportation center as it has been repeatedly seized by German and Soviet forces during past battles. After the German forces withdrew from Kharkov, the front line has been shortened, so it can exert its effect more fully.

Kharkov has now changed hands for the fourth time in less than two years. The city fell into German hands four months after the start of the Eastern Front war in 1941. The German forces occupied the city for six months, and then it was recaptured by Soviet forces in February of this year, only to be reoccupied by German forces a month later. Now it has once again fallen into Soviet hands.

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The German military headquarters reported today that the German special tank division is currently clearing out an encircled enemy force northwest of Kharkov. The number of enemy prisoners and German war spoils is also increasing sharply. Although the Soviet forces are reinforcing other war zones on the Eastern Front, they have all been repelled. Yesterday, the Soviet forces lost a total of 409 tanks and 73 aircraft.

Buenos Aires-Keijo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to a dispatch from Quebec, Roosevelt and Churchill spent the entire day on the 21st discussing shipping issues. According to a Reuters report on the Quebec talks, the matters decided so far are as follows: A new agreement on the loan of weapons will be concluded in London soon, and the loan of weapons to the Soviet Union will be increased. In order to reduce German forces on the Eastern Front, a new offensive will be launched in Europe. Bombing of Germany and Italy will be intensified. However, it is not yet clear whether a decision has been made to launch a landing operation in Western Europe.

Buenos Aires-Keijo, 23rd (Central News Agency) – Secretary of the Army Stimson arrived in Quebec yesterday and immediately held discussions with representatives of the American military. Chongqing Foreign Minister Soong Tzu-wen also arrived at the location at the same time.

### Food Shortage in India is a Serious Problem

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – The Indian government, in accordance with the resolution of the former Central Legislative Assembly, has decided to implement a food rationing system in Indian cities and notified the various local groups on the 22nd regarding the implementation of food rationing measures. According to a Reuters dispatch from New Delhi to the Times, the food shortage in Bengal has reached 2 million tons.

It is reported that hundreds of people are starving to death in the province every day.

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency) – According to news received here today from Calcutta, the municipal authorities there have had no choice but to cable Prime Minister Churchill and President Roosevelt, who are attending the Quebec Conference, requesting that food be transported from Australia, Canada, and the United States as soon as possible to alleviate the food panic in Calcutta and throughout Bengal. It is said that because of the food shortage, hundreds of Indians are dying of hunger every day. According to a broadcast from New Delhi, as the food panic is becoming increasingly serious, the Bengal Relief Committee has decided to provide 1 million rupees for famine relief. Currently, 35,000 people are being provided with food by public canteens, and another 50,000 people receive bread every day. The Bengal provincial government is now opening 400 stores where people can buy food with ration coupons.

### Second Phase Training Camp, North China Representatives Arrive in Suzhou

### Subtle Relationships Among the Soviet Union, the United States, and Britain

Lisbon, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch received here, the new Soviet Ambassador to the United States, Gromyko, does not have a strong reputation among the general public. He has served as a counselor at the Soviet Embassy in the United States since 1939. Informed sources also consider him a capable diplomat, but his name has rarely been mentioned in connection with Soviet cooperation with Western countries.

Moscow, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – On the 22nd, all Soviet newspapers published the news of the Soviet Union's replacement of its ambassador to the United States. The Soviet government authorities strongly stated that although the ambassador has been replaced, the friendly relations between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union will not undergo any changes. They also expressed that even though the Second Front has not yet been formed, the Soviet government will maintain friendly relations with the United States. However, Soviet newspapers are strongly demanding the formation of the Second Front and have expressed dissatisfaction with the attitudes of Britain and the United States. The European war situation in the next four months will be centered on the Second Front, and the relationship between Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union deserves close attention.

Tokyo, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to observations by authoritative sources here: The Soviet government previously replaced its ambassador to Britain, Maisky, and now, during the Quebec Conference, it has replaced its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. This clearly indicates the Soviet Union's deep dissatisfaction with Britain and the United States. Furthermore, Britain and the United States have not been reassured by the fact that the Soviet Union maintains friendly relations with Japan based on the Japanese-Soviet Neutrality Pact. However, in view of the fact that losing the Soviet Union would make unified operations impossible for the anti-Axis alliance, they have decided to dispatch special envoys from Britain and the United States to the Soviet Union after the conclusion of the Quebec Conference in order to strengthen friendly relations. However, the Soviet Union's undisguised antipathy towards Britain and the United States, taking the Quebec Conference as an opportunity, is quite noteworthy.

Lisbon, 22nd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a Washington dispatch received here, the American political circles were unexpectedly shocked by the news of the Soviet government's recall of its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. Washington political circles hope that the State Department will make a statement within the next few days to reassure people. In addition to wanting to know the Soviet government's motives for recalling Litvinov, Americans are even more concerned about his future whereabouts. This 67-year-old Soviet diplomat served as the Soviet Union's Foreign Minister for ten years. In 1939, he was suddenly dismissed from his post. The following month, he was expelled from the Central Committee meeting of the Communist Party. After the outbreak of the German-Soviet war, he was responsible for negotiations with Britain and the United States and was subsequently appointed as the ambassador to the United States until today.

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a London dispatch received here, London political circles made no comment yesterday on the Soviet Union's recall of its ambassador to the United States, Litvinov. The British Broadcasting Corporation only reported the facts of this important diplomatic change without adding any commentary, simply stating that this was the Soviet Union's second recent change of its diplomatic personnel. The first, obviously, refers to the recall of Ambassador Maisky to Britain.

Political Disputes Within the Allied Camp

Berlin, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – A Hague News Agency diplomatic correspondent stated that Berliners generally believe that the Soviet Union's sudden recall of Litvinov must have been completely unexpected by Roosevelt and Churchill, causing them considerable surprise. Therefore, they are refusing to comment and are still exploring the background to this move. Stalin is now forcing Britain and the United States to accept what has already become a reality. One can imagine the internal strife within the Allied camp. However, the political disputes of the enemy are not enough to cause any consequences for German policy, because the internal struggles of the Allies will never cause Roosevelt, Churchill, and Stalin to ease their hostility towards National Socialism, and Germany's determination to fight to the end will not change. Berlin political figures say that the recall of Litvinov is sufficient proof that the strategic coordination among Britain, the United States, and the Soviet Union is impossible. Stalin also does not believe in the promises of Roosevelt and Churchill, taking them to be true, because what Stalin needs is concrete action, not empty promises. The so-called opening of the Second Front, especially after the Sicilian campaign, has greatly disappointed Stalin. The prevarication of Britain and the United States is the main reason for Stalin's recall of Litvinov this time.

### Swedish Foreign Minister Declares Determination to Resist Aggression and Vigorously Maintain Absolute Neutrality

Stockholm, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – Foreign Minister Guenther, in a speech in Karlskrona on Sunday, reiterated Sweden's determination to maintain peace and absolute neutrality. He vigorously asserted that the Swedish nation is determined to resist any aggression. He stated: "Whoever attacks us or seeks to drive our country into war is our enemy." The Foreign Minister also discussed the dangers of Sweden becoming isolated by not participating in the war, but he stated that this danger can be overcome by Sweden's sincerity and efforts to build a peaceful world. Finally, the Foreign Minister vigorously asserted that the future peace must be a fair and far-reaching peace, which is extremely important for Sweden.

Nanjing, 23rd (Central News Agency dispatch) – According to a report submitted by the Executive Yuan based on a report from the Ministry of Education, Mr. Li Xiaoshi, the chairman of the board of directors of the Shanghai Private Nianci Free Primary School, has donated a total of 204,000 yuan for the school's operating expenses, and a factual statement has been prepared, specially forwarded for review and an order of commendation. Li Xiaoshi's donation of a large sum of money and his enthusiasm for promoting education are commendable and should be commended to inspire others. This is hereby ordered.

### The Truth About the Greater East Asia Decisive Battle (2)

— Colonel Kurihara

Characteristics of the Bloody Battle in the Solomon Islands

Modern warfare has the nature of a war of attrition. Recently, weapons have advanced remarkably, and the war preparations of both the enemy and our side have become highly sophisticated. At the same time, the scale of the war has expanded, and the consumption of ships, weapons, and military supplies is naturally considerable.

If we examine the war between the two major land powers of Germany and the Soviet Union, which is considered a typical modern land war, we can see how enormous their consumption is. According to the statement issued by the German authorities on June 18 this year, reviewing the second anniversary of the start of the war, the Red Army's losses in the past two years were 5.55 million prisoners, 36,000 tanks, 50,000 artillery pieces, and over 20,000 aircraft. Naturally, the issue of replenishment to compensate for this enormous consumption has become very important. That is, a war of attrition inevitably becomes a war of replenishment. The length and difficulty of the supply route have an impact on the war situation. The fact that the German-Soviet war has advanced and retreated repeatedly in the past two years is due solely to the lengthening and shortening of the supply routes of Germany and the Soviet Union, which affects the strength of the two armies. This fact can very well indicate how important replenishment is for consumption and how important the strengthening of rear production capacity is for replenishment. The above-mentioned German-Soviet war is a typical modern land war, but a war of replenishment conducted across the ocean contains various elements. Recently, the British and American forces' North African campaign, the landing operation in Sicily, and the Pacific offensive and defensive war are all major wars of attrition with very long maritime supply routes. Because the fierce battles between the enemy and our side are not only on the front lines but also very fierce in the destruction of supply routes behind the lines, the victory or defeat of this supply war has a great impact on the front lines, which is an inevitable trend. Therefore, we must ensure this maritime supply route. To ensure the maritime supply route, a large number of various types of ships are absolutely necessary. Furthermore, for the safe navigation of ships, it is even more necessary to secure sea control, and to achieve this goal, it is crucial to secure air superiority.

Currently, our country is making every effort to increase the number of ships. One is to enhance the transport capacity for production and war, and the other is to advance the war of replenishment to a favorable position. Furthermore, the rapid advancement of land transport capacity is nothing more than to remedy the inadequacy of maritime transport capacity, which is the lack of ships. Furthermore, by providing food domestically, it is possible to free up huge ships with a tonnage of 100,000 tons to replenish weapons and materials to the front lines, which is a quantity that cannot be ignored. Whether this quantity can be replenished to the front lines has a great impact on the war situation.

National Awareness of the Current War Situation

At present, the American counterattacks in the Solomon Islands and New Guinea are very fierce. The American soldiers are defeated when they are wounded, and they cannot be flustered by minor injuries. They should do everything possible to continue fighting until they defeat the enemy.

This great power of Japan certainly includes the strength of the soldiers on the front lines, but this power is the sum of the strength of 100 million people. Your attitude, your daily actions, are the posture of the great power that is about to defeat the enemy on the stage. Striving for self-sufficiency in war food and working hard to increase food production is to stop transporting food by sea, thereby freeing up ships to replenish more important materials and necessary weapons and ammunition to the front lines. This is the only reason. Assuming that five koku of rice is equivalent to one ton, then increasing domestic rice production by 500,000 koku will also boost the morale of the soldiers, which cannot be underestimated. However, I had already anticipated that the enemy's counterattacks in this area would be fiercer, which is inevitable in strategic terms and not surprising. The current Pacific war situation centered on this area is like two of the greatest strongmen wrestling on the stage today. Both sides are evenly matched, and they cannot be careless with even slight determination. Observing the current strategic situation, our side has taken control of the key areas of Greater East Asia, which means that our side has established a favorable position for fighting on the inner lines. Under this favorable situation, defeating the enemy is not difficult. However, from the Burmese-Indian border to Manila, Java, Sumatra, New Guinea, the Solomon Islands, and the Aleutians in the north, the enemy has the possibility of attacking from anywhere along the very long periphery of Greater East Asia. Full vigilance is required. Since the enemy also regards itself as the greatest strongman in the world, the entire nation must not be negligent in the slightest and must not be overly optimistic. We should strengthen our war preparations and allow the enemy, whether it is Britain or the United States, to attack any location on the periphery of Greater East Asia. We should use our strength to engage them in that area and defeat them. Not only that, the enemy's strategy is to attempt to use air raids to bomb the key areas of Greater East Asia and then bomb the important industrial zones, ports, and railway trunk lines of the Japanese mainland, using this method to hinder rear production activities and disrupt the thinking of the people. Because of this, it goes without saying that full facilities and the overall awareness of the people are needed to deal with the other side.

Recently, on the European front, the British and American air forces have repeatedly bombed the important production areas of Hamburg, Essen, and the Italian capital Rome on a large scale. They are watching the Japanese mainland and the key areas of Greater East Asia, waiting for an opportunity to carry out large-scale bombings. As I have said before, modern war is a war of attrition, so the enemy will seize any good opportunity and use all means to destroy the rear production structure and depress our war capacity. Using aircraft for large-scale surprise attacks is a common means used by the other side, and vigilance against this point must not be relaxed for a moment in the future.

Secondly, what should be emphasized regarding air raids is the use of submarines to disrupt maritime supply routes. Due to the special nature of submarine warfare, it is almost impossible to capture and annihilate all enemy submarines. Among the ships that our side transports, there are those that are particularly important in completing the important task of maritime replenishment. However, in order for our side to complete the Greater East Asia war and to achieve the economic construction of Greater East Asia, it is absolutely indispensable to ensure the complete maritime traffic routes of Greater East Asia and to ensure the replenishment routes above. Vigilance against enemy submarines must be stricter with ships and aircraft, and further increase the number of ships. No matter what, we must ensure maritime replenishment capacity, and we must absolutely seek victory in terms of replenishment and deployment. As I have said before, we must further strengthen the favorable strategic position that our side occupies, and ensure the maritime supply routes within the Greater East Asia sphere, so that the replenishment of the front-line soldiers is completely flawless, and that they can fully advance the war of the front-line soldiers, which is our ultimate victory. Now is the time for the entire nation to rise up. With such an unwavering belief in victory, 100 million people will unite as one and contribute their total strength to the war. Our victory is expected.

The United States, taking the defeat at Pearl Harbor as a turning point, has comprehensively reorganized its domestic system. So far, it has drafted young people as young as 18, and university students have been sent to the front lines long ago, holding guns and flying airplanes, active on the battlefield. The national conditions are different from ours. They already have over 100,000 female soldiers. Britain has drafted young people as young as 16, and these young people are fighting on the front lines. From this point of view, you should rise up today and compare yourselves with them. Japanese students have only recently begun to volunteer for the army and navy, which seems a bit too late.

I often use tug-of-war as a metaphor for war. During tug-of-war, first, the flagman who gives the instructions must coordinate the beat and wave the flag in the same direction at the same moment. The people participating in holding the rope must coordinate with the flagman, pull the rope in the same direction with all their strength. If, at this time, the method of waving the flag is not unified, and some of the people pulling the rope do not use their strength, or pull the rope in the opposite direction, then victory can never be achieved. The wartime system is the same. The flagman in the guiding position assesses the situation, and everyone should coordinate the beat, guide the people, spur on the people, and each person should obey their guidance, use the maximum efficiency, and exert their strength, and concentrate this strength on completing the war. Among them, no one should hold grievances or harbor discontent.

The United States calls this war "a war for survival." This great war is a gamble on the rise and fall of the Yamato race, a great war of no compromise, a war that cannot be lost absolutely. The fronts are gradually becoming more serious. The enemy is elated by the recent counterattacks and will surely take further action. Our side must further exert a high degree of national strength, strengthen our war capacity, and smash the enemy's attempt to counterattack.

Mayor's Banquet

Central News Agency, Shanghai dispatch: Yesterday at 7:00 PM, Mayor Chen hosted a banquet at the International Hotel to fete Minister Aoki and his entourage, including Director-General Takeuchi, Counselor Imai, Reporting Secretary, and Secretary Agosunago. Those invited to accompany them included 32 Japanese figures such as Lieutenant General Nagatsu, Lieutenant General Kinoshita, Minister Tajiri, Major General Kondo, Major General Kinoshita, Consul General Yano, Counselor Okazaki, Counselor Wataru, and Advisor Funatsu. On the Chinese side, there were 29 people including President Liang Hongzhi, Foreign Minister Chu Minyi, Minister Ding Mocun, Minister Luo Junqiang, the heads of the various bureaus and offices of the municipal government, and economic figures such as Zhou Zuomin, Tang Xianmin, Huang Xianggu, and Qian Dakui. During the banquet, Mayor Chen gave a speech, stating: "Your Excellency Minister Aoki, distinguished guests, today, after Shanghai recovered the two concessions in August, Minister Aoki, who is in charge of the new policy, has graced Shanghai with his presence, which makes me and the people of Shanghai very grateful and excited. Recalling when Minister Aoki was hired as an economic advisor to the National Government, he solved many problems and achieved many successes, his achievements are remarkable and people miss him very much. Later, he became the first Minister of the Greater East Asia Ministry, and he made many plans for the independence and freedom of the various ethnic groups in Greater East Asia, which is not only fortunate for China, but also fortunate for all the ethnic groups in Asia. Recently, China's finances have tended to stabilize, and the economy has regained its vitality, thanks to Minister Aoki's greatest efforts. In the future, we, both Chinese and Japanese, officials and civilians, will cooperate sincerely and exhaustively to enrich the content of the new policy and stabilize the steps of the new policy, not allowing difficulties to discourage our will, and not allowing obstacles to hinder its progress. I firmly believe that the future of China and Japan will surely bear good fruit, and the Greater East Asia War will surely be victorious. Shanghai is the economic center of China and the great rear area of the Greater East Asia War. As for my concerns about Shanghai, production must be increased, and prices must be suppressed. This is not only necessary during wartime, but also necessary for the national economy and the people's livelihood. I deeply hope that Minister Aoki will provide more assistance so that my beliefs can be realized, and then the future of China and Japan and the future of Shanghai will have unlimited development. I thank Minister Aoki for his presence and wish Minister Aoki good health." Minister Aoki then gave a reply, saying: "I have been ordered to come to China this time to inspect the progress of the new policy towards China, and to exchange opinions on Sino-Japanese issues with all of you and the important figures of the National Government, and to hold various cordial talks with Japanese people in China. Passing through Shanghai, I am very grateful for the invitation of Mayor Chen tonight, and I am deeply delighted to reunite with old friends. The progress of this inspection is good, and I am deeply impressed by your country's dedication to reconstruction. China and Japan are adjacent to each other, and the history of friendship is very long and profound, and there should not be any differences. The new policy of Japan is nothing more than to restore the relationship between the two countries to its original state. Recently, I traveled to Southeast Asia, and the people there have a strong idea of building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. There has been good cooperation in various aspects such as economic stability and security. The independence of the Philippines will be realized soon, and I deeply hope that independence and self-preservation can be completed as soon as possible, so that the establishment of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere can have a more powerful guarantee. As for the construction of the new Shanghai, I am especially concerned about it. Yesterday, I visited Mayor Chen and was impressed by his aspirations for building the new Shanghai. I greatly admire this lofty ideal, and we must actively assist, so that Shanghai will not only be the economic center of China, but also a link of friendship between China and Japan. I would like to take advantage of the host's toast to wish the construction of Greater Shanghai a success, and for the health of Mayor Chen and everyone."

### Rice in the Forty-Fifth Period Unsold, Sales Order Not Yet Issued

The Datong News Agency reports: Today is the last day for selling rice for the household registration in the forty-fourth period, ending at 6:00 PM, and sales will cease. It is understood that the sales order for rice for the household registration in the forty-fifth period has not yet been issued by the Rice Flour Procurement Section as of yesterday. This is because they must wait for the Rice and Grain Joint Operation Cooperative to notify the exact amount of rice supplied for this period before it can be issued. The total amount of rice supplied by the Joint Operation Cooperative for the household registration in the 18th and 2nd districts for the months of July and August is still less than 60,000 bags. Otherwise, not only could the previous shortages be fully compensated, but the sales quantity could have been adjusted earlier.

Economic Commentary

Economic problems are complex. Whether one studies economics or manages finances, one must use a calm mind to critically assess and handle them. Impatience and arbitrariness are to be avoided. Furthermore, one must use facts as evidence to arrive at definite and unshakeable conclusions. Currently, the economic volatility in Shanghai is extreme, and the general population is living in a state of anxiety. This is highly regrettable and requires immediate correction.

We believe that the following three points should be noted:

Pay attention to numbers: When a problem arises, one must first pay attention to the increase or decrease in its numerical value. Use numbers to determine whether to accept or reject, and do not make judgments based on rumors.

Base on facts: Rumors are often unfounded. The source of all information must be verified with the original agency or location to determine if it is based on evidence and has a source. Otherwise, one will inevitably be fooled and suffer losses.

Analyze the rationale: When a fact is released, one must first inquire whether it is reasonable and feasible. One must also compare it with past experiences and scenarios, and consult widely before making a judgment. Otherwise, relying solely on personal prejudices to make criticisms and speculations will inevitably lead to errors.

Aquatic Products Administration Plans Fishery Loans

The Aquatic Products Administration is actively planning fishery loans to alleviate the economic pressure on fishermen and to encourage increased production. It is understood that the implementation plan for these loans has been finalized and will be submitted to the Ministry of Food to request approval from the Executive Yuan before being implemented. In the future, it will benefit fishermen, help increase production, and contribute to the establishment of a wartime economic system.

The plan's content is as follows: First, establish a loan headquarters in Shanghai. If necessary, establish branch offices in various fishing areas to ensure widespread coverage. The initial fund for the first year is tentatively set at 1 million national currency. For the second year, request an additional appropriation of 1 million yuan to expand the loan amount. If this is still insufficient, fisheries construction fees can be used as collateral to borrow 2 million yuan from banks, or cooperate with the Shanghai Fisheries Bank to concentrate funds for lending.

Loan recipients are limited to legitimate fishermen, such as [blank] marine fishing boats, ice-fresh fishing boats, river fish customers, and fish farmers. Fish collectors and storage warehouses are strictly prohibited from receiving loans to prevent hoarding. Loan types are divided into two categories: credit loans and mortgage loans. Loan allocation is divided equally between marine fisheries and freshwater fisheries, each accounting for 50%. Each loan will be for a period of six months, with a small interest rate.

In addition to cash, the repayment method also allows for the use of fish catches to offset the price, thereby avoiding losses due to price depreciation during the period, and demonstrating the government's utmost concern for the fishermen.

Western Medicine Rationing Plan Not Yet Decided

It is widely rumored in Shanghai that Western medicine will soon be subject to centralized rationing. The rationing method will be similar to the rationing of cigarettes by the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association. The first step is for Chinese and Japanese pharmaceutical factories to jointly form a rationing agency, which will then survey all pharmacies in the city, classify them into A, B, C, and D grades, and then distribute goods according to the grades. This news has attracted much attention from all parties. According to investigations, several Chinese and Japanese pharmaceutical manufacturers had discussed this matter two weeks ago, but a concrete plan has not yet been decided. This is because there are many types of Western medicine with different uses. Before implementing rationing, a detailed rationing method must be carefully decided to avoid problems. If rationing is implemented and a black market emerges, as with cigarettes, with small vendors lining up to buy while patients cannot purchase medicine, the serious consequences will be unimaginable. At the same time, after the establishment of the General Commercial Control Association, the centralized rationing of various goods in this city should logically fall under the purview of the association and should not, like the China Central Tobacco Rationing Association, establish a separate agency to implement rationing independently. Therefore, looking ahead, there are still various problems with the establishment of a Western medicine rationing association. It is also reported that some Western medicine manufacturers have already independently implemented a rationing system. This rationing system has not been authorized by the relevant authorities, nor has it been publicly announced to society or revealed its details. Therefore, it is unknown whether there are still problems. In short, the centralized rationing of Western medicine is an important task, but since our country has the organization of the Commercial Control Association, this task should be borne by the association. Others should not overstep their authority, and the Commercial Control Association should not ignore it.

This Year's Tobacco Leaf Production Estimated at Approximately 5.2 Million Guan

Regarding the Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative, The Local Education Sector Expresses its Solemn Stance

Mr. Jiang Shoutong's proposal to establish a consumer cooperative for teachers and staff in this city has been taken seriously by all sectors. Teachers and staff themselves certainly hope it will become a reality, reducing their living burden. People in society who understand the principle also express their sympathy and urge its realization. This newspaper previously expressed its willingness to collect opinions from all parties and publish the essentials, in order to pool ideas and discuss together. Now, Zhu Sihuang, Li Quanshi, and 15 other professors have submitted collective opinions, which are disclosed as follows. The professors are speaking from the standpoint of educators, expressing a shared sentiment that is profound and solemn. It is hoped that all sectors will pay attention. -Editor's Note

After Mr. Jiang Shoutong proposed the organization of a "Shanghai Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative" on the 19th of this month, he has successively obtained the support of all parties. From the standpoint of educators, we are willing to contribute the following opinions:

First, it is absolutely necessary to establish a permanent Shanghai Teachers and Staff Consumer Cooperative to eliminate the exploitation of middlemen. In particular, at present, the rise and fall of all prices are being manipulated by merchants who hoard and speculate. In order to reduce the burden on teachers and staff and stabilize the lives of teachers and staff and their families, the organization of a cooperative is not only necessary, but also an urgent self-defense measure.

Second, precisely because this is a self-defense measure related to the teachers and staff themselves, our standpoint must be pure. Apart from solving the living difficulties of teachers and staff, there is no other purpose or side effect. Even the accumulated funds or profits that the cooperative itself should obtain are not allowed to exist. Our slogan is: "Every penny is used on the teachers and staff!"

Third, the original plan was for each member (teacher or staff) to invest 200 yuan, with 100 yuan being borrowed from the school administration and 100 yuan being paid by each member. This may be unaffordable for elementary school teachers and staff, so for elementary school teachers and staff, we propose halving the amount, while their rights should be the same as those of middle and high school teachers and staff.

Fourth, in order to save on the operating expenses of the cooperative, the investigation work and distribution procedures can adopt a school unit system. That is, the investigation, collection, and distribution work is carried out by the school authorities, and the cooperative stands in a supervisory position.

Fifth, the establishment of the cooperative should be expedited and divided into the following steps:

    The newspaper should temporarily set aside a space to serve as a reader mailbox for the organization of a teachers and staff consumer cooperative, where readers can express their opinions and nominate candidates for the preparatory committee.

    After a week, the nominated candidates will be announced and summarized, and each school will make a public decision.

    Once the preparatory committee is established, it should first negotiate the allocation of goods and the issuance of procurement certificates.

    If there is hope for allocation or procurement, the registration and investment procedures for teachers and staff in each school should be carried out.

    Appeal to the public for donations.

    Start procuring materials and implement distribution.

The important and far-reaching cause of education is closely related to the national life and the future of the country. We dare not boast of the sanctity of our work, but we dare not neglect the mission of the times. We are very grateful for all external personnel assistance, but we dare not easily accept it. We are willing to use our own strength, through automatic organization, to make up for the deficiencies in our lives. We believe that the citizens of the city will certainly give their greatest sympathy.

Signatories (in order of number of strokes in surname): Zhu Sihuang, Li Quanshi, Zhou Dexi, Ji Yingbo, Hu Jiefeng, Geng Danru, Chen Kemei, Chen Songmao, Lu Zhaoji, Sun Shengzeng, Gao Maoxun, Jiang Zaihua, Pan Leshui, Dai Qixin, Gu Zhongyi.

A Visit to the Yangjingbang Catholic Church (4)

Free Clinics, Free Medicine, Free Food, Free Clothing

The biggest ills in society are poverty and disease. The Yangjingbang Catholic Church is doing its best to provide relief to the poor and sick by offering free clinics, free medicine, free food, and free clothing.

Behind the Catholic Church, at the entrance of a small alley called Yong'an Street in the slum area, hangs a wooden sign that says "Ren Shan Tang Children's Clinic." From time to time, the cries of children can be heard, which is one of the free clinic and free medicine initiatives sponsored by the Catholic Action Association of the Catholic Church, specializing in treating poor children. The doctors include traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Mr. Wang Yisan and Western medicine practitioner Mr. Zhou Weiliang, who both volunteer their services. About 40 to 50 patients are treated every day. It has always been completely free, but now, due to the high cost of medicine, each patient is charged a nominal fee of one yuan, but the extremely poor are still exempt.

The Catholic Charity Clinic is the first initiative of free clinics and free medicine launched by the Yangjingbang Catholic Church, with a history of more than 70 years. It is now attached to Ren Shan Tang in Hongqiao Lane in the city. Traditional Chinese medicine practitioner Wang Yisan lives in the hall and regularly provides consultations. According to Sister Pan, the actual achievements last year included 43,741 outpatient visits, 51,049 prescriptions, 835 house calls, 10,713 free consultations and medication for prisoners, 14,675 free consultations and medication for infants at Renji Nursery, and 16,800 free consultations and medication for the Renji Charity Hall. It can be seen that the actual benefits to society are truly significant.

On South Datong Road, New Gate Road, on a bustling city street, like some kind of ornament, there is a two-story "Catholic Charitable Clinic." It is already crowded with patients seeking treatment by 8 a.m. Men, women, the old, and the young, with festering hands and feet, like an exhibition of diseases, the

### Cotton Yarn and Cloth: Purchase Starting Yesterday

The purchase office is located at the Racecourse of the National Commercial Control Association. Following the order to purchase cotton yarn and cloth, a purchase office for cotton yarn and cloth has been established. Starting yesterday (the 23rd), it will handle the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth within the Shanghai area in accordance with the directives of the Executive Yuan, the promulgated Provisional Regulations for the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cloth, the Implementation Outline, and detailed rules, and will also handle the supplementary registration of cotton yarn and cloth as ordered.

Application for Sale

The association has announced the following procedures: All owners or occupants of cotton yarn and cloth within the Shanghai area (including merchants of all nationalities other than Japanese) should fill out four copies each of the application for sale and the summary of sale for all their cotton yarn, grey cotton cloth, or processed cotton cloth, and submit them to this office or send them through the respective trade associations (application forms and summaries can be obtained from this office). All cotton yarn and cloth that has not been registered with this association should be registered at the same time as obtaining the application for sale and the summary by obtaining a registration form from this association. When submitting the application for sale and the summary for processed cotton cloth and grey cotton cloth not manufactured by yarn factories, two samples of the goods should be attached.

Business Report

Retailers of cotton yarn and cloth should obtain blank business report forms from this office, fill in the monthly sales of yarn and cloth for the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and submit them to this office together with the application for sale and the summary for review. Factories that use yarn and cloth as raw materials for manufacturing or processing should obtain blank business report forms from this office, fill in the monthly usage of yarn and cloth for the first half of the 32nd year of the Republic of China, and submit them to this office together with the application for sale and the summary for review.

Upon receiving the registration form for supplementary registration, this office will stamp it with a seal and return one copy to the registrant for safekeeping.

Exchange Certificate for Deposit Slip

After the cotton yarn and cloth for which sale has been applied has been inspected and approved by this office, the amount of the price has been determined, and the inspection and acceptance have been completed, this office will notify the applicant within five days to exchange the notification for a special fixed deposit exchange certificate from this office, and then collect the special fixed deposit slip from the Central Reserve Bank. All applications for sale, summaries, business reports, and registration forms for supplementary registration must be submitted to this office within fifteen days from today (deadline September 6). Overdue applications will be dealt with according to law. It is reported that the Yarn and Cloth Purchase Office moved to the Racecourse on Route Maréchal Foch yesterday.

List of Members of the Assessment Committee

The National Commercial Control Association's Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchase Office has been established for many days and is now beginning to carry out the purchase work. According to Article 5 of the Organizational Outline of the office, the quality and price of the purchased yarn and cloth will be assessed by a separate Cotton Yarn and Cloth Quality and Price Assessment Committee. It has been learned that the candidates for the committee have been recommended by the United Association of Cotton Product Industries and have been formally appointed by the Commercial Control Association yesterday. The names of the members are Bu Boxun, Xu Xiuxiao, Ping Qibo, Mi Wenjun, Qin Defang, Wu Shihhuai, Chen Shouyi, Yang Yuelin, Wu Xinqi, Ying Yuanzai, Gong Dingluo, Zheng Weizhang, Zhou Rongsun, Fang Weiping, Zou Zhaolin, Guo Zhongkang, Wu Mingyong, and seventeen others.

150,000 Pieces Still Unregistered

The government authorities announced the compulsory purchase of cotton yarn and cloth regulations in this city on the 9th of this month, and nearly half a month has passed. The investigation of the inventory in public and private warehouses in this city has already been completed by the Materials Investigation Office. It is reported that there are currently more than 700 public and private warehouses in the city, with a total of 194,839 pieces of cotton yarn stored, including 79,718 pieces belonging to Japanese merchants. However, aside from the registered cotton yarn, more than 150,000 pieces have not yet completed the registration procedures with the relevant authorities. In order to protect the rights and interests of the holders of this cotton yarn, the Materials Investigation Office has decided to extend the registration deadline by fifteen days. If registration is not completed after the deadline, regardless of nationality, it will be unconditionally confiscated. The disposal of cotton cloth is completely the same.

Cotton Yarn Allocation Plan Undecided

Furthermore, regarding the allocation of yarn and cloth after the purchase, it was rumored yesterday that it would be implemented soon. According to official sources, the yarn and cloth allocation plan is still being formulated. The authorities are paying close attention to this matter, but it seems too early to determine the date of implementation. Technical issues such as the allocation quantity have not yet been finalized. The saying that each person consumes ten yards of yarn and cloth per year is only an estimate of past yarn and cloth consumption and is not necessarily the amount to be allocated in the future.

### Welfare Cup Charity Soccer: Friendship Loses 1-2 to Italian Navy Team; Ball Sold Three Times for 220,000 Yuan

After the match, the prizes were awarded by Committee Chairman Cen, Minister Luo, Secretary-General Zhao, Shen Siliang, Shao Chang, Yuan Ludeng, Wen Lanting, Minister Ding, and others. As a result of the match, Friendship lost 1-2 to the Italian Navy team due to the weakness of the forward line. Both sides began to clash. The Italian Navy's five forwards penetrated deep into the defensive zone. Friendship's goalkeeper, Xian Han, saved a goal, preventing the team from conceding a corner kick. Lian Sheng’s attack was lost. Friendship tried to counterattack, but it was difficult. The Italian Navy's offensive was strong. In the fifth minute, Ling Weitai made a small test and Friendship lost again, making it 2-0. In the twenty-fifth minute, Fei Chunjie went straight through the line, picked up the ball well, and Meng Liang headed it desperately, but the ball went inches past the post. After several passes, the team was penalized for a handball. Zheng Yingquan lost the free kick. At the end of the first half, Friendship was down by two goals. During the second half, Li Yichen of Friendship shot the ball into the net in the chaotic situation. The ball was declared invalid and was considered off-side. After 12 minutes, the Italian Navy's Stephen fouled and Song Lingsheng kicked a 12-yard ball and the goal was scored. Friendship had a revival, but the Italian army has a tight defense. At the end of the hour, the Friendship lost to the Italian Navy by the score of 2 to 1.
