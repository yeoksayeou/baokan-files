### New Mission to Defend the Pacific: The Nation Should Urgently Catch Up and Enhance Naval Knowledge

The Pacific is the Pacific of Asians, and it must be defended by Asians themselves. Historically, the severe threats to the Pacific have been resolved by the arduous battles of the Japanese Navy. The first time was the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago (1904-1905), and the second time is the ongoing Greater East Asia War. In the first war, Tsarist Russia attempted to provoke a foreign war to eliminate its domestic revolutionary forces, maintain its autocratic rule, and further defeat Japan to annex Manchuria and North China, competing with other powers to divide China. Fortunately, after the Meiji Restoration, Japan made rapid progress in national strength, its morale was high, and especially its new naval power was cultivated. In the battles outside Lushun Port and the Sea of Japan, it defeated the world-renowned Tsarist Russian fleet that had been sent to East Asia, laying the foundation for Japan's victory in the Russo-Japanese War. The prestige of our navy has since spread to the world's seven oceans. This is the most glorious history of the Pacific nations' navies. The second time, in the Greater East Asia War, the Japanese Navy, at the beginning of the war on December 8, 1941, destroyed the American naval outpost of Pearl Harbor in Hawaii, which dominated the Pacific, and then there were continuous victories in Hong Kong, Malaya, Manila, Singapore, and Java, causing the British and American navies, which had always held an absolutely superior position in the world's navies, to suffer fatal blows and annihilation. From then on, they were willing to retreat and seek to survive, but to no avail. This undertaking of the Japanese Navy will clearly occupy the most important position in future world history. However, we must recognize that the enemy's forces have not been completely eliminated or thoroughly annihilated. To maintain the victories already won and to consolidate the defenses in the Pacific, so that the enemy will never dare to cross the Pacific, not only requires greater efforts from the Japanese Navy, but also requires all East Asian countries to build up their naval power and, under the leadership of the Japanese Navy, to assume their respective inherent responsibilities. Here, China naturally has an extremely important position.

China is a continental country, and has always been known for its vast number of army soldiers. However, in terms of geographical and strategic situation, China is also a maritime country. Our eastern, southeastern, southern, and southwestern borders, from the Bohai Bay around the Shandong Peninsula, through the Yellow Sea and the East China Sea, along the provinces of Jiangsu, Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong, through the South China Sea to the Tokyo Bay, the length of the coastline is the first among East Asian countries. Along this coastline, from Shanghai downwards, are all our first-class modern metropolises. Moreover, along the waterways of the Yangtze River and the Pearl River, there are major cities all over the coast, which are the essence of the whole country. Therefore, China either does not talk about national defense, or if it is necessary to prepare for national defense, then, although the situation is different now and in the past, the essence of national defense is the same: to establish a true maritime defense and a strong navy. Otherwise, talking about national defense is inevitably self-deception. Especially in this Greater East Asia War, we are a participating country, but in reality, we have not mobilized most of our forces to assist Japan in the war. From the obligation of participation in the war, we cannot but feel even more ashamed. However, it is not too late to catch up quickly. The reason why we are calling on all Chinese people to make efforts in the research of naval construction lies in this.

In this important sense, we are starting today, for a period of ten days, excerpting records from our newspaper thirty-eight years ago about the Russo-Japanese War, and descriptions from current famous Japanese newspapers and magazines about the reasons for the Japanese Navy's victory, in order to arouse the interest of the Chinese people in the ocean and the navy, provide basic knowledge about the ocean and the navy, and promote the movement of our country's naval construction and coastal defense construction, so that in the new mission of defending the Pacific, in the near future, our country will also be able to fulfill its responsibilities. If this helps the country and the victory of the Greater East Asia War, then it is not only the good fortune of this newspaper.

### Russo-Japanese War: Records from This Newspaper Thirty-Eight Years Ago: Old Newspaper, New Copy (1)

Introduction

We recognize that defending the Pacific from now on will be entirely the responsibility of Asians, and the intrusion and aggression of Britain and the United States will no longer be allowed. However, fulfilling the task of defense depends on a strong naval force. Our friendly nation, Japan, has built its navy through decades of hard work and continuous improvement. In the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, it revealed its talent by defeating the many with the few. In the current Greater East Asia War, it has demonstrated its invincible power. At present, the friendly navy alone bears the difficult task of the entire Pacific defense, and we feel deeply ashamed that we have not been able to share the burden. Therefore, how we can learn from the friendly navy as a model, build a new Chinese navy, and participate in the task of defending the Pacific is a goal that the people of the country should strive to pursue together. In order to increase the Chinese people's naval knowledge and interest, this newspaper will excerpt and reprint the records from this newspaper during the Russo-Japanese War thirty-eight years ago, from the 21st to the 30th, for a period of ten days. We hope that readers will pay attention.

### On the Righteousness of the Japanese (Published in This Newspaper No. 11089, Guangxu 30th Year, First Month, 18th Day, Western Calendar March 4th, 1904, Friday)

A letter recently arrived from Tokyo, Japan, stating that since Japan went to war with Russia, it has solicited public bonds to finance military needs. Officials and dignitaries who are righteous and public-spirited are all vying to donate. It is estimated that Furukawa Junkichi donated 1 million yen to the Bank of Japan, Inoue Kaoru and Katsura Taro each donated 2 million yen, Tanaka Mitsuaki donated 25,000 yen, Hijikata Hisamoto and Watanabe Chiaki each donated 15,000 yen, Hanafusa Yoshimoto and Kagawa Keizo each donated 10,000 yen, plus the applicants from various banks: Sumitomo 5 million yen, Konoike 3 million yen, 34th 2 million yen, Yamaguchi Naniwa Osaka Savings Kitahama each 2 million yen, Japan Savings 2 million yen, Kato 700,000 yen, Omi Fujimoto each 500,000 yen, San Sho Kibara 58 each 200,000 yen, Toraya 150,000 yen, Jizendo Allied Industries Bishu Commerce Sakura each 500,000 yen, Kawakami 50,000 yen, Kawamitsu Nishi Roku Tomo Furuichi Tomioka each 20,000 yen, Katsuragi 10,000 yen. This newspaper has published this letter in the newspaper. Upon reading it, the writer could not help but sigh and say: How loyal to the country and how courageous in righteousness are the Japanese! The rise and fall of a country depends on the direction of the people's hearts. If everyone is loyal to their ruler and loves their country, then no matter what happens, they can handle it with ease. The rise of Japan is attributed by everyone to the effects of the Meiji Restoration: changing politics, reforming laws, changing clothing, establishing schools, strengthening military power, studying physics, and refining manufacturing. Initially, they learned from the West, and then they reaped its benefits. The island nation in the East Sea, which was once despised by European and American countries, can now compete with them and is respected by all. Since the victory over China in the Sino-Japanese War, its national strength has become increasingly prosperous and its military power has become increasingly strong. Chinese scholars and officials are all shocked and amazed by this, believing that China is weak because it cannot reform, and Japan is strong because it is courageous in reform. I believe that the effect of the Japanese Restoration is indeed as such. But does one know that its rise is not only due to the Restoration, but also to the fact that everyone is loyal to their ruler and loves their country? If everyone knows to be loyal to their ruler and love their country, then they will unite as one, with one heart and one mind, knowing only the ruler and not themselves; knowing only the country and not their families; forgetting themselves and their families, and they will naturally not feel brave in performing their duties, and their hearts will naturally be selfless. In this way, everything will be done with sincerity and strength, abuses can be eliminated, benefits can be promoted, and the country will prosper. It is not only in the current war with Russia that its ministers generously donate huge sums of money to help with military expenses, which is enough to show their loyalty to the ruler and love for the country. But even this one thing is enough to show the Japanese people's loyalty to the ruler and their love for the country. It is appropriate that they can confront the strong Russia, exert their courage, and destroy the enemy's forces. In the future, they will work together with one heart, and with one battle, they will dominate. The leadership of Asia may be held in the hands of the Japanese, which is also not an unpredictable thing, and it is all achieved by the Japanese people's heart of loyalty to the ruler and love for the country. Although, because of the Japanese people's loyalty to the ruler and love for the country, and thus the country's rise, I cannot help but sigh for our China. Our China is weak because everyone thinks that it does not know how to reform. The laws have indeed been changed, but if the hearts of the people of the whole country do not focus on the ruler and the country, then talking about revitalization will only lead to chaos; talking about consolidation will only lead to disintegration. How can one hope that it will turn from weak to strong? Moreover, those above are all ministers who deceive and embellish, encroach on public funds for personal gain, hoard wealth for their families, and do not know how to relieve the difficulties of the ruler and father. Those below are all commoners who are stingy and frugal, meticulous in accounting, enrich their own wealth, and do not know the meaning of contributing. Therefore, among the ministers today, there are those who have millions of wealth, and there are those who have several million; among the commoners, there are those who have tens of thousands, and there are those who have millions. But at this time of financial strain, I have never heard of anyone voluntarily contributing their meager resources to help the country. If this war were to be moved to China, I know that even if the country intended to borrow public bonds, it would definitely not be able to match the Japanese people's public-spiritedness and righteousness. Alas! Everyone does not know how to be loyal to the ruler and love the country. This is the source of our China's weakness, and not knowing how to devote themselves to implementing new policies is a later matter! I am discussing the righteousness of the Japanese, and connecting it to this. I cannot help but throw down my pen and sigh three times, feeling ashamed and sweating!

### The Japanese Captured the Russian Volunteer Ship (Published in This Newspaper No. 11074, Guangxu 30th Year, First Month, 3rd Day, Western Calendar February 18th, 1904, Thursday)

A letter from Hanjing, Korea, said: On February 6th of the Eastern Calendar (that is, December 21st of the Chinese Calendar last year), the Japanese captured a Russian volunteer ship, weighing 7,000 tons, and the China Eastern Railway Bureau transport ship Morokoron between Jeoryeong Island and Mok Island in Busan. At 10:12 AM that day, a Japanese warship saw a large Russian steamer circling westward from Wonsan. It quickly used binoculars to measure it, and the Japanese flag was raised high on the stern. By 11:00 AM, it sailed near the Tsushima Strait. The Japanese warship then pursued it, and when it was ten nautical miles away from the mouth of Busan, it ran alongside it. After forty minutes, it approached Baek Island. Two Japanese torpedo boats intercepted it in front. At 12:00, the Japanese warship Jiyuan ordered it to stop its engine. The Japanese warships then surrounded it on three sides, and then lowered a small boat. The officers drew their swords in their hands, and the sailors held their knives and guns. They approached the ship, jumped on board, and searched it thoroughly, finding many weapons and more than two thousand army officers and soldiers. The ship weighed more than 7,000 tons, and it was then known that it was a volunteer ship, transporting weapons from Urakawa to Lushun, fearing danger en route, and therefore posing as a Japanese flag. As for the China Eastern Railway Bureau transport ship, it usually traveled between Shanghai and Urakawa. On February 5th of the Eastern Calendar (that is, December 20th of the Chinese Calendar last year), it went from Urakawa to Busan to transport military grain to Lushun. At 5:00 PM on the 6th, it raised its flag and started its anchor, sailing out of the gate. The Japanese warships A and B and the torpedo ships C, D, E, and F blocked its path forward, surrounding it on all sides. The Fuso and Tsukushi ships aimed their cannons at it from a distance, ordering it to stop its engine. The ship then did not move forward. The Japanese warships then lowered several small boats, and the officers and sailors rushed aboard, bringing the ship back and ordering all the sailors on the deck to enter the cabin and search them one by one, seeing that they were all the materials needed by the army. They were then escorted back, and at 7:00 PM, they arrived in Sasebo.

### Comparison of Naval Tonnage Between Japan and Russia (Published in This Newspaper No. 11082, Guangxu 30th Year, First Month, 11th Day, Western Calendar February 26th, 1904, Friday)

A certain daily newspaper in Japan said: Before the war, the warships in our Japanese navy weighed approximately 165,237 tons. Since the addition of the two new ships "Kasuga" and "Nisshin," they weigh 192,517 tons. As of January 14th of the Eastern Calendar, the Russian ships had a reduced combat power of 91,572 tons, with a current total of 73,465 tons.

### Vichy Announces the Return of Concessions in China; Chongqing Protests but France Ignores; Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou Issues Statement

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) The announcement by the French government that it would return the Guangdong, Tianjin, and Hankou concessions in China and the signing of detailed clauses and understandings shocked Chongqing. According to reliable sources, Foreign Minister Song Ziwen of Chongqing lodged a strong protest with France over this matter, saying that the French government's move was inappropriate. However, the French government has made no response to this, which shows that Chongqing's so-called protest is merely to confuse the public in the war zone.

Vichy, 20th (Central News Agency) The French government's abandonment of rights in China has been confirmed by a statement issued by the French Foreign Ministry last night. The content is as follows: Based on its desire to enhance friendly relations with China, France issued a public declaration on February 23, 1943, deciding to abandon the rights of the French Concessions in Tianjin, Hankou, and Guangzhou. Regarding this matter, China and France signed a treaty on May 17, which will be implemented on June 5, 1943.

Guangzhou, 20th (Central News Agency) Regarding the return of concessions in China by France, the Japanese Consul General in Guangzhou recently issued the following statement: The French Concessions in Shamian, Guangzhou, and Tianjin and Hankou were simultaneously decided on the 18th to be returned by France to the Republic of China, and representatives of the two countries have completed the signing of detailed clauses in Nanjing. France's voluntary return of concessions in China during the Greater East Asia War is of profound significance. Under this wartime system, China and Japan are advancing towards the destruction of Britain and the United States in the spirit of living and dying together. The complete independence of China and the strengthening of national power have also been our country's long-cherished wish for many years. At this time, France's move to return concessions in China is a result of a genuine understanding of the position of the East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere and its future. We express our full respect for this measure. In the future, the friendly relations between China, Japan, and France will be even more profound, and they will make a great contribution to the construction of a new world order.

In addition, the Japanese army units and the Chinese anti-communist forces have also cut off the Communist army's retreat to the south, advancing westward to the Yushe area. It is reported that a certain Japanese army unit launched a night attack on the Communist army in Shuangfeng Town (50 kilometers southwest of Heyu) on the 18th, inflicting an annihilating blow.

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Yu Xuezhong, Commander of the Chongqing-Lu-Su War Zone, is making efforts to reorganize the remnants of the 14th Division and the Chongqing "Shandong Provincial Government Army" and a portion of Li Xianzhou's "32nd Army" recently moving north, totaling more than 20,000 men, and is preparing to reorganize them. After the Japanese army detected this encirclement, they are currently launching an annihilation campaign. The Japanese army units and the Shandong Army of the National Government, under General Wu Huawen, are working closely together to tightly encircle the Chongqing army strongholds in Puli Village, Dashi Gou, Zhao Jia Zhuang, and other places 40 kilometers west of Yishui in central Shandong, and are gradually tightening the encirclement. On the 17th, they captured the strong Chongqing army positions of Pangzhixie, Ban Gu, Da Gu, Di, etc., and completely annihilated the Chongqing army attempting to break out of the encirclement. As of the 19th, it had been confirmed that there were 2,300 Chongqing army corpses left behind, and 2,760 people were captured. The Japanese army captured 2 anti-aircraft guns, 2 heavy machine guns, 72 light machine guns, 1,700 rifles, and a large quantity of other communication equipment, ammunition, and military supplies.

### Chairman Wang Expresses Concern for the Disaster Situation in North China, Large Quantities of Food Transported North for Relief

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The provinces of North China have suffered from successive years of floods and last year's locust plagues and drought, resulting in poor harvests and widespread suffering. During this time of scarcity before the new harvest, food shortages have become increasingly severe. Chairman Wang has received repeated reports from North China and is extremely concerned. Some time ago, President Chen Gongbo and Vice President Zhou Fo Hai were sent as envoys to Japan and Manchuria, and they witnessed the disaster situation when they passed through North China, and were deeply shocked. After reporting back to Nanjing, Chairman Wang became even more anxious and instructed all relevant parties to find ways to provide relief. Through the joint efforts of the Ministries of Finance and Food and the assistance of friendly nations, a large sum of money has been allocated and food has been mobilized. At the same time, Wang Yintai, the Superintendent of the North China Industrial Bureau, sent Section Chief Zhang Lingqing south to seek instructions and oversee the purchase of food, assisted by personnel from the Ministry of Food. It is reported that various types of food have been purchased, including more than 105,000 bags of flour, more than 1,000 shi of wheat, and more than 1,500 shi of soybeans. In addition, the Ministry of Food has allocated 2,000 shi of broken rice from its inventory. It is understood that the Ministry of Food will continue to purchase and transport food to the north, so the serious food problem in North China can be slightly alleviated.

### Turkey's Future Direction Becomes the Focus of World Attention, Turkey's Policy Avoids Being Drawn into the Vortex of War, Pays Close Attention to the Loj Conference

Istanbul, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - After the end of the Tunisian campaign, the direction of the Turkish government has become the focus of attention for all countries in the world. The Turkish government and people also feel deeply that they are one step closer to the flames of war, and are closely watching the evolution of the international political situation, and are paying the greatest attention to the determination of the anti-Axis military strategy at the Washington-Loj Conference. What Turkey hopes for now is that the United Kingdom and the United States will postpone the opening of the second front and first devote all their efforts to the Pacific front. In his speech in Istanbul on the 14th, Turkish Foreign Minister Menemencioğlu reiterated Turkey's policy of adhering to neutrality, so the primary goal of Turkey now is to avoid being drawn into the war. Since the Adana Conference, the anti-Axis countries' policy of appeasement towards Turkey has become increasingly blatant, but it has not achieved any results. Therefore, from this point of view, it can also be understood that Turkey is making efforts to avoid being drawn into the war. If the decisive battle between the Axis and anti-Axis can be launched outside of the Eastern Mediterranean or the Balkan Peninsula, it will be beneficial to the psychology of the Turkish people, because what the Turkish people hope for is a peaceful life and do not want to be involved in the war. Their greatest concern is only to defend their country against foreign enemies.

Ankara, 20th (German News Agency) - Political and diplomatic figures in Ankara are paying close attention to the calm attitude maintained by Turkish officials towards the end of the North African campaign and the Loj Conference. Last winter, Ankara often believed that after the North African campaign, it would be followed by an invasion of Europe, and was particularly concerned about the location of the attack, especially the Balkans. Turkish officials have also repeatedly expressed publicly that they hope that the military activities of the anti-Axis countries will be as far away as possible from Turkey's sphere of interest, including the Aegean Sea. However, Turkish officials all believe that the United States will shift its main battlefield to the Pacific for military and domestic political reasons. According to Turkish Congressman Esmir, who is close to the US Ambassador to Turkey, in an article published in the semi-official Ulus newspaper, the activities of the United States may be limited to participating in the air war against the European Axis powers in conjunction with the United Kingdom and providing material assistance to the Soviet Union. Regarding the internal politics of the United States and the upcoming presidential election, Turkish observers believe that Roosevelt must show American voters who vote better results than the military expeditions in Africa and the Near East. Regarding this point, these observers strongly argued that disagreements within the anti-Axis camp are increasing, because Stalin has publicly stated that he intends to act independently in the conduct of the war, and the United States' attempts to contain the Soviet-Polish conflict have also failed. Therefore, Roosevelt may also direct the war according to his own wishes. In this case, the main force of the US military will be transferred to the Pacific, and in the Mediterranean Sea, which is of most concern to the Turks, only the United Kingdom will deal with the Axis powers alone. Regarding the British and American propaganda in the Balkans, the Turkish side also deals with it from a realistic point of view.

### Churchill Admits that the Strength of the Axis Powers is Immense, Delivers a Speech at a Joint Session of the US Congress, Hopes that a Four-Power Summit Can be Realized Soon

Argentina, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to a Washington dispatch, British Prime Minister Churchill delivered his views on the world war situation at a joint session of the US Senate and House of Representatives on the 19th. He said, since I decided to attend your Congress and deliver a speech, it has been 17 months. At that time, the people of your country were in an uproar because of the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor and the declarations of war against the United States by Germany and Italy. Since then, we have fought shoulder to shoulder against the powerful Axis forces. Excellent British and American people are united with each other because of common crises, solemn beliefs, and lofty ideals. I firmly believe that the close unity of the United Kingdom and the United States in peacetime or wartime is more important than any other issue. The anti-Axis forces have suffered repeated defeats in the Pacific War, especially the battles of the Malay Peninsula and Singapore, which were unprecedented defeats in British history. My visit to your country this time with Field Marshal Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Expeditionary Force, and other military leaders is by no means to crush the Japanese victory. The British people are actually more concerned about continuing to fight the Japanese army than the people of your country. At present, the war against Japan is concentrated on the eastern border of India, and the United Kingdom has to deal with it with the army, navy, and air force. It is also the most important common task of the anti-Axis countries to provide effective assistance to the Chongqing regime as soon as possible. When the time is ripe, the United Kingdom will use all its strength to fight the Japanese army. If the British army in India has completed all preparations for the invasion of Burma, then I can order the attack this afternoon, but the reality is not that simple. Although we must now fight in both Europe and East Asia, the European war is actually important. I said this not meaning that we cannot launch offensives on both sides at the same time. In 1942, although the United States deployed the main force of the US military on the Pacific front to fight against Japan, the British army shouldered the heavy responsibility on the Atlantic front, and the merchant ships lost by the United Kingdom in the Atlantic were several times the number lost by the United States in the Pacific after its entry into the war. Recently, we have made considerable progress in dealing with submarine tactics. Although the situation in the submarine war has improved slightly, the threat of Axis submarines is still the greatest crisis that the United Kingdom and the United States cannot avoid at present. The British Air Force has recently launched an offensive against the European continent with the strong assistance of the US Air Force, but it is still controversial whether it can win after obtaining air supremacy, but I think this move is worth a try. We must also face the Japanese army with air power as soon as possible. The United Kingdom and the United States have reached an agreement on this point. Regarding the use of the army, I think we should discuss it carefully to ensure its perfection due to the activity of Axis submarines and other major difficulties. The Soviet Union will still face major threats this year, and the United Kingdom and the United States should work hard to reduce the threats faced by the Soviet Union. President Roosevelt and I both hope to hold a meeting with Chairman Stalin and Chairman Chiang as soon as possible. But at present, the Axis forces still have a huge army and abundant resources, and ensure various strategic locations. If the war is prolonged, how complex events will occur, and the democratic countries may fall into division after being exhausted. Therefore, the prolongation of the war is a major crisis for the anti-Axis countries.

### The Purpose of the British Prime Minister's Speech

Stockholm, Sweden, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to the Swedish correspondent in London, Churchill's speech to the US Congress on the Pacific War was aimed at arousing the US to focus on the war against Japan, while Britain and the Soviet Union were responsible for dealing with Germany. There was much discussion in London about Churchill's speech. The correspondent also said that Churchill's statement that Britain would assist the United States in concert against Japan when the time was ripe was aimed at the Americans. Churchill did not mention General Teague, nor did he add a word to the rumors spread by British and American newspapers that Italy would be eliminated by political pressure, which was regrettable.

### Washington Conference Continues to be Held

Argentina, 20th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Washington Loj Conference is currently continuing with the participation of Canadian Prime Minister King, Australian Foreign Minister Evatt, and Chongqing Foreign Minister Song Ziwen.

Stockholm, 19th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Washington News: Field Marshal Wavell, Commander-in-Chief of the British Indian Army, who is currently participating in the Loj Conference in Washington, may soon leave his post in India and take a new post in Europe.

### The Disparity in Japanese and British Tactical Thought (1)

— Itō Masanori

(1) The Tactics of Two Admirals

During the First European War, both British Admirals Jellicoe and Beatty, who participated in the Battle of Jutland, embraced British-style individualism, treating the British Navy as their own personal fleet. We should critique this matter from both strategic and tactical perspectives. Representing the former is the competition over the Thomas Squadron.

Rear Admiral Thomas's 5th Battle Squadron consisted of four of the newest battleships: the Barham, the Osbert, the Malaya, and the Valiant (27,500 tons, eight 15-inch guns, 25 knots). It was known to be the strongest squadron in the world at the time. Five days before the outbreak of the Battle of Jutland (May 26, 1916), this squadron was an effective wing—a decisive wing—of Jellicoe's main fleet and was highly valued. Jellicoe, like Marshal Tōgō during the Battle of Tsushima who relied on the Nisshin and Kasuga, placed his faith (two of the six main ships, with armored cruisers acting as battleships) in these four newest battleships. Jellicoe then possessed twenty-eight battleships, of which ten had 12-inch guns, eleven at the center had 13.5-inch guns (the other two had 15-inch guns, and one had 14-inch guns); however, Thomas's four battleships, all equipped with 15-inch guns and boasting a speed of 25 knots, were the most important capital ships. Why were they assigned to Beatty? The details are quite interesting.

(2) Jellicoe's Failed Competition

After the start of the European War, these elite battleships were organized (Queen Elizabeth class); however, before this, a problem had already arisen: should these fast battleships belong to Jellicoe's main force or Beatty's battlecruiser squadron? The former argued that, based on the ship type (battleship), they should naturally be the central force of the main battleship fleet; conversely, the latter pointed out that the squadron's speed was naturally designed for cooperation with the battlecruiser fleet. Neither side would yield, and the Admiralty and Naval General Staff found themselves in a difficult position, but in the end, they decided to keep the ships under Jellicoe's command as before. However, the competitive Beatty was never willing to give up and, whenever he had the opportunity, advocated for the transfer of the Thomas Squadron, his words even containing a rather激烈的tone.

But on May 12, at a major meeting held in Rosyth focusing on the naval base issue, the First Lord of the Admiralty Balfour, Jellicoe, and Beatty met. At the meeting, Beatty demanded from the First Lord and commander that the transfer be implemented, and a heated discussion broke out between the two admirals, leading to a scene where Balfour was sweating profusely to mediate. In the end, a compromise was reached: Jellicoe was ordered to frequently return the 5th Battle Squadron to Rosyth (Beatty's squadron's base) to participate in joint training; conversely, the 3rd Battlecruiser Squadron (Rear Admiral Evan-Thomas's Invincible and the following three ships) would return to Scapa Flow (Jellicoe's main base) to participate in training at any time.

This was a British-style compromise. The worst aspect of this compromise was exposed on the battlefield of the Battle of Jutland. In other words, the Thomas Squadron sailed into Rosyth Naval Port on May 26, and without having the time for formal joint training, it was faced with the great naval battle of the 31st. Therefore, there was no coordination between Beatty's squadron and Thomas's squadron. Although the Thomas Squadron was Admiral Beatty's most powerful arm, unfortunately, it was not his own arm but someone else's. There was no action at the moment when the signal came from his nerve center, and there were often delays. As a result, the British forces missed two good opportunities, and Beatty's squadron suffered a defeat with two large warships being sunk. Now, let's briefly prove this fact from a tactical perspective.

(3) The Cause and Effect of Internal Discord

At 2:32 PM, the signal "Heading South-Southeast" that Beatty sent to Thomas was not seen by Thomas until five minutes later, and it took another three minutes to implement. Therefore, the distance between the two squadrons increased from the predetermined five nautical miles to ten nautical miles. Such a large gap later had a detrimental effect on the British forces. Secondly, at 3:30 PM, when Beatty was deploying for battle, he ordered Thomas to "advance towards the East (77 degrees) at the full speed of 25 knots." Rear Admiral Thomas hesitated. Why? Because the German Hipper Squadron was in the process of executing a double right-angle turn to the south, and the battle would inevitably occur not in the "East" but in the "South-East." But according to the commander's order, he steered east (77 degrees), and only the third signal changed it to South-East (122 degrees).

By the time this deployment was completed, it was too late. The German and British forces began to engage, and soon the British ship Invincible was sunk. The Thomas Squadron watched the tragic scene of black flames engulfing the sky, without firing a single shot in participation. Although they possessed the largest 15-inch guns of the German and British forces, they were merely rushing to the battlefield at full speed. The firepower of the Barham, the flagship of the Thomas Squadron, barely reached the German rearguard ship Von der Tann, but it was already ten minutes after the start of the battle. These were indeed extremely valuable ten minutes, and also ten minutes of great loss for the British forces.

What would a Japanese admiral do? He certainly would not issue a signal like Beatty's. Different from the direction and speed command at 3:30 PM, he would simply order: "I immediately demand a decisive battle in the South-South-East, cutting off the enemy's retreat. All squadrons participate in the shortest possible time! Immediately!" Japanese commanders do not issue detailed orders to flag officers. They only state their intention for a decisive battle and the direction of attack, allowing them to exert their best efforts, and if there is anything inappropriate, they immediately adopt a method of corrective guidance.

Then, what would a Japanese commander in Rear Admiral Thomas's position do? After receiving the commander's order and understanding his intention, he would immediately turn to the right at 3:30 PM, so as to burst into the predictable battlefield in twenty minutes. Rather than deploying in a single line astern behind Beatty's main force in the South-South-East, he would try to become the vanguard, using his unique 15-inch guns to attack the enemy's front lines. In this way, the Thomas Squadron could cut off the German Hipper Squadron from the Westa Squadron (main force), staging a fierce battle that would force it towards the Danish coast.

Strategically, compared from the root, the commander of the Japanese Second Fleet would never dream of competing with the commander of the Combined Fleet for the affiliation of powerful units. Private opinions requesting the Naval General Staff to increase their strength would be absolutely regarded as an inappropriate concept and rejected. Therefore, if the Thomas Squadron were in Japan's situation, it should have been the commander (Jellicoe's position) who would have headed to the decisive battle scene. Also, if it had been transferred to the battlecruiser fleet five days prior, they would have been paying attention to recognizing the tactics of the second commander (Beatty's position) day and night. They would be working hard to make themselves a true right-hand man of the new commander, and the new commander would also come up with various methods to control him.

In the first battle of the Battle of Jutland, the British forces were fighting with a mismatched fleet, and in the meantime, they lost two large warships, allowing the German forces to make a name for themselves. What a pity!

(4) Utmost Fear of Deployment

Next is the famous "Fleet Deployment." Among the several reasons that determined the victory or defeat of the Battle of Jutland, the biggest was the battle deployment of the Royal Battleship Fleet around 6 PM. This involved the problem of the timing and impropriety of deploying six columns, each with four ships, into a single column of twenty-four ships.

Regarding this point, it has already been explained in considerable detail when explaining the course of the battle, so it will not be repeated here. It will just be summarized into the following three points to serve as a basis for criticism:

(1) Deploying on the starboard side at 5:55 PM was the best tactic.

(2) The deployment at 6:15 PM should also have been done on the starboard side (southwest).

(3) Jellicoe deployed on the port side (east).

That day, sunset in the northern North Sea was at 8:19 PM, so although there were still more than two hours of gun battle time, as the results showed, it was by no means sufficient time. In order to achieve a "decisive battle," the gun battle should have started earlier. Therefore, Jellicoe could have deployed twenty minutes earlier than he actually did. Why? Because the Thomas Squadron, at 5:55 PM, discovered the German main force at a distance of 18,000 yards and reported it to Jellicoe. Beatty's report identified them as the Hipper Squadron, lacking consistency; however, the enemy's location was more than 90% accurate, and an admiral who demanded a decisive battle early on should have decided to deploy at this time. Even if the opponent was Hipper's battlecruiser squadron, there was no reason why the time would not be sufficient, and it would not have been too late to carry out a battle turn against the Westa Squadron afterwards.

However, Jellicoe, at 5:55 PM, 6:00 PM, and 6:05 PM, asked in all directions, "Where are the enemy's battleships?" While heading south, he always wanted to grasp the position of the Westa Squadron without the slightest mistake. This was more of a desire, but it was actually for preparation. In his book "The Grand Fleet," he inadvertently revealed this idea:

"The German main battleship fleet, with a powerful torpedo boat squadron gathered in its vanguard, was probing our fleet's deployment. At that time, there was a great danger of a major torpedo attack, so when deploying, I keenly felt the need to take precautions first."

Therefore, Jellicoe encountered an enemy he was extremely fearful of, and even kept it secret from the commanders until the moment he implemented the deployment direction. In other words, in his mind, rather than the enemy's battleship fleet that he wanted to attack, the enemy's torpedo boat squadron that wanted to attack him occupied his thoughts.

(5) Confusion of the Ideas of Destruction and Defense

Regarding this matter, there is one more thing that should be explained. Jellicoe was very fearful of the German torpedo boat squadron, which is clear from the strategic basic items he presented to the Admiralty on October 30, 1914, where he emphasized this point in bold letters. He said:

"Is the movement of the fleet without a single mistake possible? But before our Grand Fleet opens fire, there is no guarantee that half of it will not be buried by the enemy's underwater attacks. Therefore, I always keep this kind of attack in mind and firmly believe that there is an absolute need to consider tactics to successfully prevent the enemy's torpedo boat attacks."

This letter of opinion consisted of twelve items, but the Admiralty immediately issued a document of "full approval." Jellicoe used this as an amulet to implement a "safety first strategy"; therefore, if the battle deployment of the Battle of Jutland was said to be "implemented based on the policy of avoiding attacks by the German torpedo boat squadron," then one could throw a fit and hide behind the doors of the Admiralty. Our conclusion is that the then First Lord of the Admiralty Churchill should bear a large part of the responsibility.

Jellicoe also admitted in his writings that the German torpedo boat squadron was the best in the world, and he had been fearful of those eighty-eight destroyers since before the war. But the German destroyers that appeared at Jutland numbered sixty-one, and only thirty-one belonged directly to the Westa Squadron and were listed on the non-combat side of the main force. The shape that Jellicoe was worried about was not discovered at all. In other words, his maximum paranoia actually delayed the establishment of a decisive battle posture.

However, the starboard deployment mentioned in (1) above (5:55 PM) is a deployment that the Japanese commander would have resolutely implemented. In this way, with the Marlborough squadron (Vice Admiral Burnaby) on the extreme right wing as the front, the main battle squadron would be heading on a course of 224 degrees, with the Beatty squadron in front and the Thomas Squadron as the vanguard, achieving an ideal position (the latter two squadrons could execute a double right-angle turn). Thus, the posture of encircling the German forces, who had deployed a single column with thirty-three large ships, from the left would be successful. Then, at the latest by 6:05 PM, the British heavy guns could open fire.

Not only that, this starboard deployment at 5:55 PM was a kind of heart-pounding, terrifying surprise attack on the German main force, for which even terms like "unexpected event" and "trouble arising from within" could not fully express the feeling. It seemed like a large crocodile had appeared from behind. Why? Because the German Admiral Scheer believed that the British main force was in the north-northeast (Rear Admiral Boedicker mistakenly identified the British battlecruiser squadron Invincible as Jellicoe's main force), and he was calculating what kind of tactics to use when it appeared in that direction. Therefore, if the British forces had deployed from the starboard side and appeared in the west-northwest, then the German forces would have had to stand by and watch for a while, allowing them to be taken by surprise. Moreover, Admiral Scheer underestimated the time of the British forces' appearance by thirty minutes, so regardless of time or location, the British forces could have taken the initiative completely.

### Navy Memorial Day: City Commemoration Program from the 21st to the 30th: All Japanese Residents in Shanghai Hold Grand Celebrations

Amidst the frequent victories reported in the Greater East Asia War, the second Navy Memorial Day on May 27 is rapidly approaching. Looking back thirty-eight years, our Japanese ancestors, embracing the declaration of war, went to battle in the Sea of Japan. In the Tsushima Strait, they captured and annihilated the Russian fleet that had come with ambitions to dominate the Far East. Reviewing the past thirty-eight years, it cannot be said to be a long time. From the perspective of the long Japanese history, it is just a very short moment. However, what has been achieved during these thirty-eight years under the might of the Japanese Navy can be compared to thousands of years of history. Now, the Japanese Navy is using the spirit of attack passed down from its ancestors to engage in fierce battles to destroy the enemy in the decisive arenas of the south, north, and mainland China. Thirty-eight years ago, the Japanese ancestors, in order to cut off Russia's evil hand of invasion in East Asia, rose up with determination. Now, for the same purpose, to destroy the great enemy of East Asia for a hundred years, Great Britain and the United States, they have once again raised the beacon of holy war. The Navy Memorial Day, which Japan takes pride in, is being enthusiastically welcomed not only in Japan itself but also in the countries of East Asia. In the Shanghai area, from the 21st until the 30th, the anniversary of Marshal Tōgō's death, it has been designated as a commemoration week for joint celebrations. The following are the programs for the commemoration week determined by the civilian sector:

### Murder Case at Jingyi Machinery Factory

At Jingyi Machinery Factory, No. 35 Caishi Alley, Robert Sheng Road, West Shanghai, an apprentice named He Xiaobao, from Jiangyin, aged 19, who had been working for two years, went to sleep in the upstairs workshop after finishing work the night before. Yesterday morning around 7:00 AM, he was struck on the head by an iron object. Before he could be treated, he died. The constabulary station brought eighteen workers from the factory into the police station for investigation.

### Details of the Trial of the Zhang Jinhai Case

The case of the French Concession constabulary detective torturing and coercing young Zhang Jinhai to death was reopened at the Special No. 2 Court yesterday (20th) at 10:30 AM. The audience seats were filled with people, and Japanese military police, central tax police, and court police maintained order. However, the constabulary's investigation of the case was not yet completed, so it was scheduled for continued trial at 9:30 AM on the 31st of this month in the First Criminal Court. Yesterday, only Zhang Yuebo, Zhang Yuanji, Peng Shuanglong, and others were summoned for questioning. Zhang and Peng's testimonies vividly described the details of the torture, and the audience shed tears of sympathy. The family has formally filed a lawsuit regarding Peng Shuanglong's injuries.

Chief Judge Qian Senting Presides Personally

Chief Judge Qian Senting of the Criminal Court personally presided over the trial yesterday. First, the defendants Ji Xiuying, Guo Shiyuan, Feng Quansheng, Li Mingda, Zhu Songcheng, Zai Shu, and six others were brought to the court. Xu Wufang, the constabulary's lawyer, immediately stood up and stated that the constabulary's investigation of the case was not yet completed, so he requested the Chief Judge to postpone the trial for another ten days. Chief Judge Qian asked if they could expedite the investigation and complete it in a short period. Lawyer Xu replied that due to the complexity of the case, it could not be completed in less than ten days. Chief Judge Qian then summoned Zhang Yuebo and others for questioning.

Peng Shuanglong Testifies

"I am from Danyang, 17 years old. I have a mother, sister, and younger sister at home. Zhang Yuebo is my cousin. I can't remember when I started working at the store, but it was roughly only two weeks before the incident. I was a student, not serving customers. I don't know if Li Xiuying came to the store to buy something." (Question and Answer abbreviated as Q&A below) Q: Did you know that she came to the store the next day to negotiate? A: "I didn't know about her first visit. I was drying clothes upstairs when the detectives came with him (pointing to Feng Quansheng in court). He forced me to take the clothes and handcuffed me, taking me back to the police station. Zhu Songcheng and Li Songsheng beat me. A foreign police officer (No. 23) punched me and kicked me. Zhu also hit me with a thick stick. I refused to admit it, so they took me to another room. The foreigner wanted to pick me up and slam me down, demanding that I confess, and said to me, 'Didn't you see someone else take it?' At this time, I couldn't take it anymore, so I said nonsense: the paper was upstairs in the store. Then Detective Zhu took me to the store, but there was no paper to take. Then Kang Wanqing was brought in." Q: What happened later? A: Later, I talked nonsense again, and they beat me again. I said it seemed like Zhang Jinhai had picked up a piece of paper, but I didn't know if it was it. Zhu Songcheng brought me to the store, and Jinhai was brought in. Then another foreigner (pointing to Miller) locked us in another room. Translator Li and Miller beat us, hitting Jinhai's buttocks with a door bolt. (Q:) "Were there any outsiders when they were hitting you?" (A:) "Yes, he (pointing to Guo Shiyuan). He also asked us if we took it. When we didn't admit it, they slapped us. (Q:) "Did he speak to the foreigners?" He spoke to the second foreigner, but I didn't understand. He also spoke to the foreigner while they were hitting Jinhai. (Q:) How often did the person surnamed Guo hit you? (A:) I don't remember clearly. (Q:) Were you still handcuffed after they poured water on you? (A:) It had been removed. (Q:) Did they hit you again? Later, I was knocked down and beaten on the ground by the detective. (Q:) What happened later? (A:) We two slept in the prison cell, under one quilt. When dawn broke, Jinhai wanted to drink tea, but he didn't have the strength to get up, and there was no tea to drink. He just leaned on the iron railing, completely exhausted. By the time it was just dawn, Jinhai had died. (Q:) Did you know when Zhang Jinhai died and was taken away? (A:) I knew. They also took me to another room to ask questions. (Q:) What did they ask? (A:) They asked if Zhang Jinhai died in the police station. I said yes, the foreigner beat him to death in the station. (Q:) What happened to you later? (A:) Later, they locked me up in the underground prison and told us, if anyone asks you later, just say the foreigner only slapped Zhang Jinhai once. (Q:) Were there other people in the prison cell? (A:) There were many people. (Q:) When did they release you? (A:) They released me the next evening. (Q:) What did you eat in the prison? (A:) I ate prison food, but I couldn't swallow it," and so on.

### Responding to the North China Disaster Relief: Hoping for Support from All Sectors

Due to the disaster and famine in North China, the provinces of Shandong and Henan are experiencing food shortages due to transportation issues. Starving people are seen on the roads. Even members of the middle class have become beggars. The tragic situation is heartbreaking to those who hear of it. The following is an overview of the situation in the old capital, as reported by those returning to Shanghai from North China:

Current Situation in the Old Capital

Those suffering the most from this food shortage are the educated class. The political path has become narrower, making the lives of intellectuals increasingly difficult. However, intellectuals still value their reputation. Fearing the scorn of their neighbors, those living in the eastern part of the city beg for food in the western part, and those living in the western part beg in the eastern part. The working class mostly makes a living by pulling rickshaws. Due to the food shortage, business has plummeted. Unable to do otherwise, they have no choice but to abandon their rickshaws and beg on the streets. Landlords have increased rents in the past year, but the increase is far less than what is needed for essential goods. As a result, there is a large gap between income and expenses. These people have no way to sustain themselves and have become beggars.

### Mr. Yuan Ludeng's Sale of Famous Cigars for North China Disaster Relief - Awaiting Bids from All Sectors

Mr. Yuan Ludeng is a figure of great social prestige. He leads the Shanghai business community in various public welfare endeavors, taking the lead in responding. Given the severity of the disaster in North China, Mr. Yuan generously decided to sell fifty boxes of the most valuable cigars given to him by friends, in order to aid the disaster victims and to encourage others. Mr. Yang Fusheng, the owner of Heming Shoes and Hats Store, magnanimously wrote to this newspaper, willing to be the first to buy the cigars for charity. His letter stated: "Mr. Yuan Ludeng's valuable cigars at home are piled up on the ground, almost reaching the height of a person. Anyone who has seen them sighs in admiration. Yesterday, for the sake of North China disaster relief, Mr. Yuan expressed his intention to cut back on smoking and food, and to sell these cigars for charity. In the Old Book of Tang, there is a phrase: 'Reward him with gold equal to his height.' Today, Mr. Yuan can be said to be 'donating cigars equal to his height.' Now, Fusheng is willing to contribute 10,000 yuan to purchase these famous cigars. I wonder if Mr. Yuan is willing to part with them? However, I am not a smoker, so even if the cigars are good, what use are they to me? It would be better to transfer them to someone else. Therefore, in accordance with the bidding method, please let your newspaper preside over the open bidding, with the minimum price being the original price of 10,000 yuan. All proceeds from the bidding will be used for disaster relief, benefiting the disaster victims and fulfilling Mr. Yuan's good intentions. As the old saying goes, 'Relief of hunger does not require a grand feast, and rescuing the drowning does not wait for proper procedures.' Fusheng is merely doing his best. Yang Fusheng, May 20th." He also enclosed a check for 10,000 yuan. It is expected that all sectors of the Shanghai business community will be inspired by this news. This newspaper, with its mission of serving society, will do its best. We invite all bidders to submit their bids to this newspaper immediately. The highest bidder will obtain these famous cigars, subject to further consultation and decision with Mr. Yuan. Mr. Yang's payment will be temporarily held in the social services department of this newspaper.

Brief Commentary

### Some Points Regarding Urgent Accounts for North China

Regarding the urgent relief for the disaster victims in North China, this newspaper has already written articles appealing for help. However, our intentions are not yet fully expressed, so we reiterate our views as follows:

(1) The day before yesterday, at the tea party of Chief Chen and Chief Ding, our reporter proposed on the spot the establishment of an urgent relief organization in Shanghai for North China, to handle relief matters in a unified manner, so that authority would be concentrated and the effect of rapid action could be achieved. At that time, Minister Ding also considered it necessary and agreed to plan for its establishment and announcement. Secretary-General Zhao also advocated careful selection of personnel. We not only hope for an early establishment, but also agree with Secretary-General Zhao's proposal that the core personnel should be mainly socially just individuals with a good reputation, while government agencies should be in a position to promote and supervise, so that the steps taken by all parties are consistent and efforts are not wasted.

(2) "Disaster relief is like fighting a fire." This newspaper has advocated that from fundraising to on-site distribution, the first stage should be completed in one month. Minister Ding, in consideration of the facts, set the period at two months, but time flies, and even two months will soon pass. We further hope for the speedy establishment of a unified agency to promote all urgent relief work.

(3) Yesterday, Mr. Yang Fusheng wrote, willing to purchase Mr. Yuan Ludeng's cigars, which were "turned into relief goods," for 10,000 yuan, and suggested using a bidding method with 10,000 yuan as the minimum price, with all proceeds used as donations. Mr. Yang, since he does not smoke and does not want to enjoy them alone, had already sent 1,000 yuan in Joint Reserve Bank Certificates to this newspaper to be collected as donations the day before yesterday. This spirit of mutual assistance and sympathy is truly admirable. We hope that powerful readers will participate in the bidding, "benefiting the disaster victims and fulfilling Mr. Yuan's good intentions," and also echoing Mr. Yang's enthusiasm.

(4) Various activities aimed at charitable donations should be launched, such as charity soccer matches, charity drama and film performances, etc. We hope that those who participate in these events will fulfill their obligations, try their best to reduce the necessary administrative expenses, and hire renowned accountants such as Mr. Xu Yongzuo, Li Wenjie, and Wang Haifan to audit the accounts on a voluntary basis, ensuring that every penny of the donations is used for public purposes and to replenish the funds.

### Bombing of Jingji Airdrome in Jian'ou - Spokesman for the Japanese News Department Spoke to the Press Corps Yesterday

The Japanese Army Press Department in Shanghai held its routine reception for the Chinese press corps of this city yesterday (20th) at 3:00 PM. At the regular meeting, the Japanese spokesperson reported on the purpose of the Japanese Air Force's destruction of the US-China Air Force base in Jian'ou, Fujian. The spokesperson first stated that the news of the Japanese Air Force bombing Jian'ou Airport carried in today's newspapers should be examined. Jian'ou Airport is now being used by the US-China Air Force as a base for air raids against Japan. Initially, the US used Guilin as a base, attempting to attack Japan, but because it was impossible, they moved the base to Jian'ou, plotting a possible attack on Kyushu, Japan. The aircraft stationed at this airfield are B-24 heavy bombers. The US is painstakingly plotting various planned attempts to attack Japan. Recently, the Japanese military has been closely watching and severely destroying these attempts. This bombing of the US-China airfield in Jian'ou is a preemptive strike to crush their dreams of attacking. If the US takes such action, Japan will continue to bomb and extinguish it. If the US actions were to succeed, it would inevitably suffer guerrilla-style harassment. Therefore, the Japanese military will never allow the US's dreams of harassment to exist and will severely attack them until the enemy is unable to act, and so on.

### City Games to be Held Starting Tomorrow

The third city games in this city have been prepared and will be held at Hongkou Park at the end of North Sichuan Road on the 22nd and 23rd. At that time, there will be a mass calisthenics performance by more than 1,600 people.

### Qingmige Calligraphy and Painting Exhibition

Mr. Zhang Jingchen, head of Qingmige, recently brought valuable works by many famous domestic artists from the former capital to Shanghai for exhibition, such as Zhang Daqian's Huangshan Pine Clouds and Qingcheng Emei True Scenery, and Pu Xinhui's scroll, which is five zhang long, painted with several famous painting styles, can be called the most precious. Other works, such as landscapes and horses by Pu Xueshai and his brothers, and inscriptions by famous calligraphers and painters, number several hundred, all of which are exquisite works. It is scheduled to open today at the Ningbo Fellow Association on Yu Qiaqing Road. Calligraphy and painting enthusiasts in Shanghai are welcome to visit.

Yesterday the newspaper was released at 7:30

Economic Commentary

### Agricultural Loans as a Good Outlet for the Financial Industry in the Future

Our country is founded on agriculture, and the countryside is the foundation of the national economy. Its prosperity and decline are of great importance to the national destiny. In recent years, the countryside has been depleted, and people's livelihoods have become increasingly difficult. Examining the reasons, although there are several, the adverse trade balance between the countryside and the city has led to the concentration of funds in the city, making it difficult for the countryside to circulate funds. This is a major problem that many contemporary scholars have already discussed, so there is no need to repeat it. Recently, the financial industry has recognized the current situation, and is doing its best to provide assistance, as its duty lies, and it cannot shirk its responsibility. Therefore, the banks that have recently handled agricultural loans include the China Bank, the Communications Bank, the Jiangsu Bank, and the Fuxing Bank. The procedures for agricultural loans handled by each bank are complicated, and the interest rates are low, which is a special difficulty. However, farmers value credit and bad debts are not common. Therefore, investing in the countryside is a good outlet for the surplus funds of our banking industry. Currently, if the banks can cooperate in handling agricultural loans, the advantages are as follows:

(1) The collapse of the countryside is becoming more and more serious. If this continues, even the false prosperity of the city will decline due to the collapse of the foundation. When the nest is overturned, will there be any unbroken eggs? Timely rescue is an action for the banking industry to get to the bottom of things.

(2) The procedures for agricultural loans are indeed more complicated, but according to experience, farmers pay attention to credit and bad debts are not common, so it is still a good investment path for the banking industry.

(3) In the past, Shanghai colleagues have achieved good results in handling agricultural loans. Although they knew that the capital was heavy and the profits were light, they were still able to work hard and make progress, which has been well received by society. Each bank should take the lead as soon as possible, which can win the goodwill of the public.

(4) Agricultural loans must go deep into the interior, close to the farmers, and the business of each bank can also be spread to various places, deeply into the people, invisibly increasing a strong asset for the financial industry.

### Flour and Wheat Special Committee Held Inaugural Meeting Yesterday

The Flour and Wheat Special Committee, under the command and supervision of the Ministry of Food and the National Commerce and Trade Council, has been prepared and held an inaugural meeting ceremony at the Hua Mao Hotel on the ninth floor at 4:30 PM yesterday (20th). At the same time, a tea party was held for all sectors, attended by hundreds of officials from Chinese and Japanese agencies and representatives from the financial and industrial sectors. Sun Zhongli, chairman of the committee, reported on the preparations. Minister Gu Baoheng of the Ministry of Food and Minister Tajiri of the Allied Nations gave instructions successively. Mayor Chen's representative, Secretary Zhao Zunyue, delivered a speech. Finally, Tang Shoumin, chairman of the Commerce and Trade Council, gave a thank-you speech, and the meeting ended happily at about 6 o'clock.

Chairman's Inaugural Report

Chairman Sun Zhongli's report briefly stated: This committee is one of the internal institutions of the National Commerce and Trade Council. It was the first to start organizing among the various professional committees. Everything has no precedent to follow. Today, I am fortunate to announce its establishment. This is due to the deep understanding and trust given to the industry by the Chinese and Japanese authorities, giving the industry the opportunity for autonomy, and it should be attributed to the guidance of both the Ministry of Food and the Commerce and Trade Council. My strength is weak, and I am truly wary of "being on the brink of an abyss" for the progress of the work. But I will try my best to do it. If there are any achievements, I will be grateful for the various assistance given by the Chinese and Japanese authorities and the enthusiastic cooperation of my colleagues. In the event of encountering difficulties in the middle and failing to achieve the ideal goal, I will ask the two governments to give practical instructions on solutions. This is my urgent hope.

Instructions from Minister Gu of the Ministry of Grains

Minister Gu's instructions briefly stated: Since our government accepted the good intentions of the Allied Nations last month and returned the material management rights, there has been the organization of the General Council of Commerce and Trade, with the trade associations and their federations in each industry as its lower-level institutions. Furthermore, for the convenience of execution, there is the organization of this Flour and Wheat Committee for flour and wheat. In a short period of time, it was able to be successfully established, which is commendable. The trade associations and regional federations in each major grain and material area under the Ministry of Grain have been established one after another. In the future, each industry should be guided by the Commerce and Trade Council to carry out its business and carry out concrete operations. As for the establishment of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee, I sincerely hope that it can exert its strength and serve as a model for other industries. I also hope that this committee will take the purpose of specializing in the interests of its peers. In addition, it should also aim at the welfare of farmers and consumers, the rationalization of industry operations, and the reduction of costs and expenses.

### Materials Control Review Committee Held Executive Meeting Yesterday

The Materials Control Review Committee held its sixth executive meeting at the Central Reserve Bank Shanghai Branch yesterday (20th). The executives present included Councilor Zhang Shizheng of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce, Director Wang Jiajun, Deputy Director Zhang Jun, Director Yin Yixuan of the Ministry of Food, Director Wang Zhigang of the Municipal Economic Bureau, Secretary-General Zhang Peishen of the Commercial and Trade Council, and from the Allied Nations, Economic Minister Okuda, Advisor Okada, Advisor Kabashima, Clerk Ishiguro, Lieutenant Aikawa, Investigator Uchida, Secretary Tokunaga, Major Egawa, Lieutenant Ishiguro, Advisor Yamazaki, and Investigator Kuwa.

### Spot Checks on Cloth and Gauze After Registration Will Be Handled by the Investigation Committee

The National Commerce and Trade Council convened a joint meeting of directors and supervisors yesterday, chaired by Chairman Tang, to approve the rules of procedure for the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and to appoint members of the Flour and Wheat Special Committee and the Sugar Special Committee. It was also learned that with regard to the spot checks on cotton yarn and cotton cloth after the supplementary registration, the government has now established a Materials Investigation Committee. In order to handle matters in a unified manner, a telegram has been sent to the Ministry of Industry and Commerce requesting that the spot checks on cotton yarn and cotton cloth be handled by the Investigation Committee.

### Price Lists of Industry Associations Must Be Inspected and Stamped by the Economic Bureau

The Municipal Economic Bureau, in view of the fact that industry associations in the city have recently been printing price lists of goods that have not been approved by the Bureau and distributing them to various merchants for implementation, which is not in conformity with the regulations of the Central Provisional Regulations for Stabilizing Prices, and in accordance with the provisions of Article 3 of the Provisional Regulations for Suppressing Private Price Increases, in order to effectively prevent abuses, has specially ordered that all industry associations should submit all printed price lists to the Bureau for inspection in advance. Only after the inspection seal is affixed can they be distributed for implementation. Otherwise, once discovered, they will be severely punished. It is reported that this regulation has been approved by the Municipal Government for implementation.

### The Commerce and Trade Council Charges a Cost Fee for Removal Certificates

The National Commerce and Trade Council's Materials Permit Office issued three announcements yesterday: (1) Starting from the 20th of this month, all applicants for removal permits must fill out one application form and one removal permit. Applicants for approval of transfer must also fill out one application form and one approval of transfer. (2) Due to the recent soaring prices of paper and printing, the visa paper will be charged at cost in order to slightly reduce the loss of the government, starting from the 20th of this month. The regulated prices are announced as follows: Application form and permit for removal, two copies per set, priced at 1.20 yuan in Central Reserve Currency. Application form and approval for transfer, two copies per set, priced at 1.20 yuan in Central Reserve Currency. Detailed list of goods, two copies per set, priced at 80 cents in Central Reserve Currency.

### Hua Share Trends

Yesterday, the Hua share market was mediocre, and the prices of all shares were sluggish, with minimal increases and decreases, and transactions were very scarce. The once most active New Pharmaceutical Stock also saw a scarcity of demand. The Sino-French Pharmacy still hovered within the customs, and remained unresponsive, lacking any vigor. The New Asia Pharmaceutical Factory was bought by investors after a decline, and eventually broke even. The selling price of the Great China Match Company continued to rise, and the Nanyang Tobacco Company also saw a slight increase. In the department store industry, Wing On and Sun Sun once declined, but the final price was not much different from the previous day. The National Goods Company remained at the original price. In the textile industry, Wing On Spinning and Meea Silk Weaving went in opposite directions, with the former being weak and the latter slightly firm. The China Underwear Company did not see much trading, and the price was also weak and listless. The remaining small denomination textile industry shares saw mostly scarce trading and stagnant prices. In the cultural industry, the selling price of the Commercial Press was slightly higher, while the China and World Book Companies saw less change. In the public utility sector, Zhabei Water and Electricity and China Electric each saw a small increase. New Eagle Real Estate saw few buyers for its new shares, slightly lower than the previous day, and Jiu'an Industrial also saw many sell-offs. Jingfu Sock Factory saw new investors buying in, and the price was progressing.

### Correction

Recently received a letter from Huazhong Sericulture Co., Ltd., correcting an error in the published official price of the cocoon price assessment committee of the Ministry of Industry and Commerce on the 19th. The corrections are as follows:

(1) Raw cocoons of 380 jin per load on the Sima scale are priced at 2,253 yuan per load. (2) 420 jin at 2,038 yuan. (3) 450 jin at 1,902 yuan. The above are the prices of improved varieties of fresh cocoons, while local varieties are calculated at 75%.

### The Significance of the National Commercial Control Council's Transfer to the Executive Yuan

Nanjing, 20th (Central News Agency) - The 15th Supreme National Defense Conference passed many important cases, among which the transfer of the National Commercial Control Council to the Executive Yuan is noteworthy. The significance of the establishment of the Council is of great importance, as it lies in adjusting the organization of various industry associations, improving the past weaknesses, so that they can generate strong power, and can convey information upwards and downwards. Now that it is transferred to the Executive Yuan, not only will the organization of the Council be further strengthened in the future, but it can also be directly directed by the Executive Yuan for smooth operation. Therefore, the purpose of this move is roughly of several kinds: (1) To strengthen the investigation of materials control, (2) To establish the system and management method between the investigating authorities and the commercial control agencies, (3) The overall organization of the control council and its lower-level organizations can benefit from being more thorough, (4) It can better adapt to the current actual situation, (5) The abolition of supervisory officials is to make the commercial control system popular among the people.

### The Division of Love and Hate

— Yan Yanchu

The bee, it is the most diligent of animals. Every spring and summer, it spreads its innate wings and weaves back and forth between the fields, collecting nectar, fighting for survival, and using its own strength to seek the continuation of its life. This is the most logical way of survival and the characteristic of the bee.

Teachers, clerks... and other salaried people, they use their innate bodies and brains all day long to exchange for various essential materials, using the noblest and purest methods to seek survival, with the same characteristics as bees. Therefore, I say that teachers and clerks are like bees.

The cunning of the fox is well known to women and children. The mention of a fox evokes a kind of dislike. On the one hand, it is because of its unpleasant appearance, and the biggest reason is that it speculates and takes advantage of others. It often puts aside its own limbs and specializes in luring other creatures to hunt for things. Its way of survival is somewhat like a group of speculators and hoarders among humans. They use insidious and vicious means to plunder the results of other people's labor and are despised by people.

Bees and foxes are both animals; teachers, clerks, and hoarding gentlemen are all human beings. Due to the different ways of survival, mentioning bees, teachers, and clerks will make people admire and love them; talking about foxes and hoarding gentlemen will make people abandon them. Perhaps this is the division of love and hate for mankind!

### The Bright and Dark Sides of the Shanghai Theater Scene

— Little Window

It should be said that after the outbreak of the Greater East Asia War, the Shanghai Drama Society, with its long history, and the Shanghai Professional Drama Troupe, which had many excellent actors, both announced their dissolution one after another. At that time, the only existing troupe with a history was the China Travel Drama Troupe, which staged some new plays that did not attract attention, and a troupe organized by some people using movie stars as a gimmick, which staged a few of Cao Yu's plays, but otherwise there was little activity. But not long after, Rongwei Company, organized by some former members of the Drama Society and the Shanghai Professional Troupe, staged several plays based on Ba Jin's "Spring" and "Autumn" and Cao Yu's "Gilding," etc. The theater scene, which had been silent for a while, seemed to have revived, but it soon dissolved and split again.

Following this, Yao Ke's "Chu Bawang" was staged at the Lyceum Theatre, but the results were not satisfactory. At the same time, the Shanghai Art Theatre, presided over by Fei Mu, was established and performed for a long period. The first play was "Yang Guifei," written and directed by Fei Mu, and it attempted to enhance the atmosphere of the performance with music, which resulted in very good results. Thus, Shanghai Art Theatre decided that every play afterwards would have the rhythm of an orchestra. The second play was Yuan Muzhi's adaptation of "The Hunchback of Notre Dame," co-directed by Ma-Xu Weibang and Fei Mu. This play depicted the ugliness of the upper class, the simplicity, ignorance, and lovable dullness of the lower class, and a cry for freedom. The directors created a unique and new style, giving the audience an indelible impression. The performances of "Hero of the Deserted Island" and "The Second Dream" followed, both of which were plays translated from Barrie's original works. The plot was very profound, the satire on life was very intense, and it had a very deep suggestion of the errors of life. The successive performances of these two plays undoubtedly also gave the audience a good impression. Later, there were performances of "The Money Tree" and "Fourth Sister," etc., and the results were also quite good. The Shanghai Art Theatre was very hardworking during this period. Perhaps it was due to the inability to sell tickets? Performances at the Carlton Theatre were discontinued. The next performance was the China Art Drama Troupe's "The Human World," written by Hu Tiwei, and then "Liang Shanbo and Zhu Yingtai" and "Important Events in Life" were staged. Except for "Important Events in Life," which was barely satisfactory, the results were not very good. Then, the Shanghai Art Theatre expanded its internal organization and added a group of hard-working personnel, and staged Shi Tuo's "The Circus," starring Shi Hui and Yingzi, etc. Ticket sales were not weak, and the staging of Li Zhihua's "Between Men and Women" was also above standard. Then, "Autumn Begonia" was staged. A large amount of manpower and material resources were spent on this play. Because it catered to the low-level interests of the petty bourgeoisie, ticket sales were extraordinarily high, a miracle unprecedented in the theater scene, but it was difficult to obtain the approval of audiences who loved art.

The Yiguang Drama Troupe was established and staged Li Jianwu's "Yun Caixia" and Western plays such as "Sweet Sister," "Dinner Party," and "Spring Boudoir Customs," Fang Junyi's "Qinhuai Moon," and Huang Zongjiang's "The Earth," all of which were up to standard. In particular, "Dinner Party" was a world-famous play, adapted by Shi Huaifu, and director Hong Mo's techniques were also very novel. The actors, including Lan Lan, Huang Zongjiang, Hu Dao, and Jiang Tianliu, etc., also had good acting skills, but they could not sell tickets, which must be the theater scene's dilemma.

The new theater, Lihua Grand Theatre, was opened, and the Zhongzhong Drama Troupe, organized by some actors from China Travel Drama Troupe, performed. They staged Zhou Yibai's "Spring River Flower Moon," Xia Xia's "Widow's Home," Luo Ming's "Lu Manzi," and other plays such as "Little Women," "Les Misérables," and "The Glamorous Country," etc., all of which used individuals as a gimmick. Although they had a large audience, the results were not necessarily good, and recently performances have been discontinued.

The Jindu Theatre was converted into a drama theater, and the Shanglian Drama Troupe was established, performing regularly at the Jindu. The first play was "Flower Signal Wind," written by Li Jianwu and directed by Wu Renzhi. The second play was Chen Baichen's "Wedding March." The writer used realistic subject matter to expose the ugliness of society as much as possible, suggesting the immediate problems of young people. How can the problem of marriage be solved? Director Zhang Jie's handling was also very concise. The actors, except for some who were slightly lacking, performed very diligently. This was one of the rare plays recently. "A Line of Sky" also had a very pure theme, but it could not sell tickets. Was this the reason? Then, Zhang Henshui's novel "Man Jiang Hong" was brought to the stage, also using the gimmick of joint writing and directing by all directors and joint performance by all actors. Although they had their difficulties, the decline in standards cannot be denied.

These are the outlines of the theater scene in recent years, telling us that in terms of quantity, one drama theater has one troupe performing, the number of performance venues is increasing, and the number of performing troupes is also increasing. Of course, the audience is also increasing. In terms of quantity, it is considered very sufficient. It seems that the theater scene is quite lively. In terms of quality, some theater people have gone to perform in other places, and some have stopped doing theater. Although new talents have emerged, with the increase in troupes, it is difficult to cope. The director of this troupe is also the director of that troupe, and the actors of this troupe are also the actors of that troupe. The playwrights similarly write plays for this troupe and also write plays for that troupe, etc. In order to compete for business, each troupe pays attention to which actor has many audience members who love his acting skills, and pays a lot of money to invite him to star in the play. Some troupes, in order to prevent actors from joining another troupe, raise their compensation, increasing the salaries of so-called backbone actors. The salaries of some actors without status are still pitifully low. On the one hand, theaters are raising seat prices without limit under the slogan of increasing profits and maintaining expenses, and some art-loving audiences are being squeezed out and cannot step inside. In order to sell tickets, they are thinking about whether each play has gimmicks for the audience, and the plot is not paid attention to. Joint writing and directing by all, plays written on topics, regardless of whether they are meaningful, and say things in a well-organized manner, exposing darkness, indicating light, the true meaning of love, anti-feudalism, a long list of pleasant words, all deviate from the meaning of drama. Doing drama is to promote the theater movement, but it has been taken as a goal to make money. Although actors' lives also need to be maintained, there should not be excessive enjoyment. These are all the dark sides of the theater scene. On the other hand, there are also some people who do drama who have always stood in their position and worked very hard. They sometimes endure hunger and all kinds of difficulties and continue to do it. In order to protect the life of the troupe, they suppress their tears and walk in a direction they do not want to go. May these promising artists no longer linger on the idea of selling tickets. Doing drama is for eating, but don't forget the meaning of doing drama work – to work hard to promote the theater movement.

### The Shadow of a Light Breeze

— Hai Ying

I like it,

On the silent earth,

Only I walk alone; and, in—

The shining of the moonlight

Let me say to my own,

Thick black shadow:

"This is still my young shadow!"

Vast life!

You are the green smoke floating from the chimney,

Seize the moment before you disappear!

### Strange Tales of the Japanese Navy (1)

— Oshita Udaer

(1) The Miraculous Scarf

On that historic day of the start of the war, Pearl Harbor was hidden from her true face by thick [clouds].

"Ah! There it is!" Before our naval aircraft discovered it, there was real anxiety and worry. The [cloud] layer did not completely seal off the entire world, and in its gaps, the military port was discovered.

However, it is said that our air force initially almost missed this most important [gap].

At that time, a brave warrior on board a certain aircraft was wearing a scarf around his neck. It was a scarf specially made by this warrior's sister, who thought about the cold when flying in an airplane at altitudes of several thousand meters, before the sortie. When the aircraft was searching over Pearl Harbor, the line of sight was blocked by thick cloud layers. The military port that was to be searched for could not be found. At that time, the wind speed on the ground was seventeen meters. They were really thinking that a storm was about to strike! Sure enough, the scarf around the warrior's neck was suddenly blown off by the wind. Alas! What a pity! The warrior turned his head and looked diagonally behind him in mid-air to see where the scarf was falling, and then he saw a [gap] there. In an instant, the cloud gap flew in front of him. As if in a dream, he discovered a large area of Pearl Harbor. The heavy black shadows of enemy ships were scattered there, and were clearly visible.

The warrior shouted with joy.

Thus, our large naval aircraft broke through the cloud layer, flew over the military port, and launched an unprecedentedly magnificent bombing, gaining a major victory that is forever worth commemorating.

(2) Arduous Endurance

Everyone knows the [submarine] that first discovered the "Prince of Wales" and the "Repulse". Regarding that discovery, perhaps there is something strange, but I have not heard any legends about it yet.

But the endurance of this submarine is worth mentioning.

"The long-awaited period is about to come. The insatiable British and Americans could be attacked as soon as they were seen at that time." A certain sergeant – who self-bombed on a naval aircraft in the South China area in the autumn of Showa 16 – said this when he returned on vacation. He had been to Chongqing more than twenty times. The one thing he regretted was that although Chongqing was covered in bomb scars, the area where the British and Americans lived had never been bombed, and was safe and sound. Going there, he always thought that even if he could drop a bomb, it would be good to vent the hatred in his chest, but in fact, not a single bomb was allowed to fall in that area, so he was tearful when he spoke. Soon there was finally an air battle with the British and Americans, and as soon as he saw the British and Americans, British and American things, everything British and American, he could bomb them at any time and anywhere. Unfortunately, he had already passed away before this. The submarines in the waters off Malaysia believed that the first bomb they fired would not be enough to kill the enemy. In an environment lacking supplies and with ammunition and food exhausted, they still resolutely dived into the water. In their minds, there was only the contact mission of spying on the whereabouts of enemy ships, and transmitting their discovery to the air force.

This endurance is commendable. They can read their achievements to others, they only seek to complete their goals and do not ask for anything else. (Note: Translated from the four Asahi Shimbun)

### Please Save Books at Schools

— Zhang Xi

At present, there is a shortage of paper, and problems have arisen with textbooks for students. The psychology of general educators is that, for levels above senior elementary school, the textbooks selected should be thick and large books, with each volume between two and three hundred pages, believing that this is necessary to highlight the level of the students. In reality, only a few dozen pages of each book are taught each semester. When it comes to the time of further education, the remaining books from the previous semester are discarded and useless, which is really a pity. At a time when everything is expensive and the price of books is rising again and again, the price of large and thick textbooks is between twenty and thirty yuan per book, so for each student, with eight books, the value is more than two hundred yuan. This is not something that ordinary parents can afford. Moreover, although there are many names of textbooks published by major bookstores, many have been discontinued and sold out. It is quite difficult to search for textbooks, and there is a real need to cherish them. The remedy is to start from junior high school and continue to teach the original readers, so that they are not discarded, saving money and cherishing things, which is very beneficial. What do the school authorities think?

### Elementary School Teachers Plead for Help with Blood

All the teachers of Qicheng Elementary School sent a letter yesterday, stating: Our colleague Zhou Wenjun has been teaching at this elementary school for seven or eight years, and is usually patient and tireless in his teaching. Last winter, he suddenly suffered from hemoptysis. After treatment at Renji and Zhenxin Hospitals, he gradually recovered. After hearing the news, the colleagues were all relieved. However, Zhenxin Hospital was originally established for epidemics. In a blink of an eye, the epidemic will be approaching, and other patients must be moved out. Zhou Jun is no exception. In addition, future medical and pharmaceutical expenses are needed everywhere. The colleagues are in the same situation. The past fundraising has exhausted our meager resources. We really have no ability to provide for the future. Sitting idly by and not helping, we cannot rest easy. Failing at the last hurdle is unwise. With no other option, we specially described our predicament and earnestly request your office to appeal to enthusiastic people in the community to lend a helping hand, so that he can recover soon, return to his old job, and repay the kindness with greater efforts, increase teaching effectiveness, and benefit more than one person. (According to Zhou Jun, he is a rare good teacher at present, and it is necessary to allocate funds to help him. In addition to this office donating 200 yuan, we also hope that enthusiastic readers will rise up to help, so that he can recover to health soon.)

### Commemorating Professor Cai - Donating Cash to Support Medicine

— Sun Choucheng

It has been five years since the death of Dr. Cai Shicun, professor of Southeast Medical College. Colleagues in the medical and pharmaceutical circles of this city believe that Dr. Cai was enthusiastic about education and beneficial to society during his lifetime. They plan to leave a permanent memorial in the college during the fifth anniversary to commend him. Therefore, they held a meeting yesterday to discuss it. They all agreed that Southeast Medical College has achieved remarkable results, but unfortunately, it has suffered property losses due to the war, which is quite large. It requires a great deal of expense to add one by one. The family of Dr. Cai is willing to save 50,000 yuan for the fifth anniversary memorial service to supplement the college's expenses. It should expand the scope so that Cai's relatives and friends and people from all walks of life who admire the doctor will generally convert the gifts that should be sent into cash and allocate them to the college's expenses to promote achievements.

Bonsai Collection Exhibition: The Baxianqiao Youth Association will hold the second bonsai exhibition for five days starting from the 21st of this month.

There will also be a calligraphy and painting exhibition, with many Chinese and Western paintings by Shi Chongpeng, Xu Ziling, Shi Piao, Bai Jiao, Zhao Baishan, etc. participating in the display.
