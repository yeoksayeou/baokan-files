### Responsibility for the Sinking of the Huatai Steamer

The Huatai steamer of the China Merchants Steam Navigation Company in this city sank in the Xin'gang [New Port] river area on the 9th of this month. Of the more than one thousand passengers and crew, only about two hundred and fifty were rescued. The remaining three-quarters or more were buried in the bellies of fish. This is truly a tragedy unprecedented in recent years.

Regarding the cause of the Huatai steamer's sinking, the company side blamed the passengers for not maintaining order, rushing on board before all the passengers had disembarked. As a result, passengers coming and going were concentrated on one side of the ship, causing it to tilt. Water poured in through the portholes with great force, and it was impossible to stop it. According to the accounts of passengers who escaped, most of the passengers on the ship were "single-carry" merchants. The goods they carried were piled on the highest deck. They were not allowed to enter the cabins until the crew had negotiated terms and received fees. Thus, the top was heavy and the bottom light, causing the ship to tilt and capsize. However, the navigation authorities stated that the main reason for the ship's capsizing was that the load exceeded the prescribed limit by more than double. Furthermore, the crew did not follow the regulations and were not inspected. There may also have been negligence in driving and management. Combining the statements from these three sides and analyzing them, the issue of responsibility can be roughly understood.

That the passengers did not maintain order, rushing on board before all the passengers had disembarked, causing the passengers coming and going to be concentrated on one side of the ship, thereby losing its center of gravity and eventually capsizing and sinking, may be the company's excuse, but it may also be the truth. Because not maintaining order and rushing ahead is a deeply ingrained bad habit of our countrymen. This phenomenon can be seen at any time in front of train stations, tram stations, post offices, and rice shops. Especially recently, with the shortage of ships and the increase in "single-carry" merchants, crowding and disorder are even more expected. If the sinking of the Huatai steamer was indeed caused by this reason, we hope that after this lesson, the general public will be able to strictly maintain order at all times and in all places, benefiting others and themselves.

As for the accounts of the escaped passengers, we believe they are closer to the truth. In recent years, among the service personnel of transportation agencies, only a few do not exploit and oppress passengers. Moreover, the navigation bureau limited the Huatai steamer's passenger capacity to only five hundred and thirty-eight people, while the crew reached two hundred. If they did not exploit passengers and squeeze out fees, how would these two hundred people maintain their livelihoods? From this perspective, piling passengers' goods on the deck and negotiating prices item by item before allowing them into the cabins is not only imaginable but also inevitable. On this point alone, it is already clear that the China Merchants Company cannot shirk responsibility.

Furthermore, there are two other points for which the China Merchants Company cannot shirk responsibility. First, before the Huatai steamer had the accident in Xin'gang, it had already run aground on the Changyinsha river area due to the negligence of the driver and unfamiliarity with the route. The whole ship nearly suffered an accident. The drivers are entrusted with the lives of all the passengers on board. What a great responsibility! Why did the company assign personnel unfamiliar with the route to be drivers? The navigation bureau has repeatedly ordered that the company's crew members be inspected, why did the company not comply? Second, the navigation bureau has stipulated that the passenger limit for the Huatai steamer is five hundred and thirty-eight people. Why did the company exceed the limit and carry more than double the number of passengers? How will the company explain this fact?

In addition, we also believe that the navigation authorities are not without dereliction of duty. It has long been a common phenomenon for ships to carry passengers beyond the limit. The Huatai steamer's carrying passengers beyond the limit was definitely not a one-time occurrence. The navigation bureau should have corrected this earlier so that this kind of major tragedy would not have occurred. As for the inspection of crew members, since it is stipulated by the Ministry order, it should be strictly enforced, and the company should not be allowed to delay compliance. If the limit can be exceeded at will, and the crew members can be exempted from inspection, wouldn't the laws and regulations be equivalent to empty words, and the navigation bureau be equivalent to a nominal institution? Then why do we have these laws and regulations, and why do we have this institution?

Finally, our suggestion is that the chaos in the current transportation order is mainly due to the lack of smooth exchange of goods and materials, and the number of "single-carry" merchants is increasing day by day. We believe that to maintain transportation order, we must first start with facilitating the flow of goods and materials and clearing out the "single-carry" merchants. This is also the greatest responsibility of the controlling authorities.

### The Spirit and Aspirations of the Greater East Asia Must Be Realized Universally Throughout the Region: Konoe on the Profound Significance of the Joint Declaration

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - Prince Fumimaro Konoe, since resigning from office and residing in seclusion, has not published his political views for a long time. Recently, he suddenly wrote an article titled "On the Greater East Asia Declaration," published in the December issue of the "China" magazine published by the East Asia Tongwen Society. In it, he painstakingly explained the original intention of the Greater East Asia Joint Declaration and the Sino-Japanese alliance, and strongly advocated that the great spirit of promoting Asia must be universally realized throughout East Asia. This is Prince Konoe's first formal expression of views as a private citizen and is worthy of attention. The full text is excerpted below:

The "Greater East Asia Joint Declaration" resolved by the representatives of China, Japan, Thailand, Manchuria, the Philippines, and Burma at the Greater East Asia Conference held on November 6 of this year and announced to the world is a non-extinguishing torch lit in the history of mankind and has an eternal commemorative value. There is no one who should not be inspired. The five major principles of coexistence and co-prosperity, independence and amity, promoting culture, and economic prosperity articulated in the Declaration are not only the guiding principles for building the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere but also the foundation for establishing world peace. Therefore, in the history of the entire world, it can be said to open a new era. The significance of the Declaration is entirely based on the spirit of Hakkō ichiu. The Declaration begins by stating: "To enable all countries in the world to find their proper place, help each other, and share the joy of universal prosperity is the fundamental key to establishing world peace." This point alone is sufficient to prove the above-mentioned facts. The grand ideal of Hakkō ichiu, as it appears in Greater East Asia, is to "build an order of coexistence and co-prosperity based on morality." When this matter is materialized, it may be "mutual respect for autonomy and independence, and the result of mutual assistance and harmony, to achieve the amity of Greater East Asia," or it may be "mutual respect for their traditions, and the extension of the creativity of various ethnic groups," to "enhance the culture of Greater East Asia," or it may be "close cooperation on the basis of mutual benefit, and the promotion of economic development," to increase "the prosperity of Greater East Asia." In this way, the countries of Greater East Asia can live in harmony with all countries, eliminate racial discrimination, promote cultural exchanges, and further develop resources to contribute to the progress of the world. Amidst this unprecedentedly severe war, the publication of this great Declaration has profound significance and cannot be overstated. However, the center of the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere is China, Japan, and Manchuria. The direction of China and Japan has a great impact on the fate of the entire Greater East Asia war. For China and Japan, since the establishment of the Chinese National Government in Nanjing, a completely new appearance has emerged. From the relationship of "sharing joys and sorrows" as described by Chairman Wang Jingwei, they have gone a step further, regarding "sharing life and death" as the spirit and jointly shouldering the fate of rise and fall. Since the Republic of China declared war on January 9 of this year, China and Japan have jointly declared their determination and belief to completely defeat the Anglo-American countries, and they have decided to fully cooperate in military, political, and economic aspects. We are still fresh in our minds about this matter. Subsequently, Japan gradually returned all the exclusive concessions in China or recognized the recovery of the Shanghai and Xiamen public concessions and the Peiping Legation Quarter, and further implemented the abolition of extraterritoriality laws. This has further consolidated the friendship between China and Japan. Since the revolution, the autonomy and independence that the Republic of China has long desired has now been formally completed. The political power of the National Government and the civil power of the people of the Republic of China have been further enhanced, reaching the dawn of restoring the five thousand years of glorious culture. This is truly worthy of celebration for our Asian compatriots. Moreover, the Sino-Japanese Alliance Treaty was established on October 30 of this year, with the two countries mutually respecting their autonomy and independence, closely cooperating to build a Greater East Asia based on morality, and contributing to world peace. This is to fulfill the mission of the Axis powers that was pledged before the Greater East Asia Declaration and has attracted the unanimous attention of the world. Japan has established a close cooperative relationship based on morality with Manchuria, Thailand, Burma, and the Philippines, recognized the independence of the Indian government and the political participation of the southern residents, and on the one hand, has established an alliance with China. This is unprecedented in ancient and modern history, but the world may distort or fail to understand this great ambition and ideal, or think that this matter is difficult to realize in practice, which is prone to cause obstruction. We express our deep regret for this kind of rumor. We would like to take this opportunity to make great efforts to clarify the original intention of the Greater East Asia Declaration and the Sino-Japanese Alliance. At the same time, we hope to launch a large-scale movement for this spirit of promoting Asia so that the tens of millions of people in East Asia can gain a deep understanding.

### Tokyo to Build Greater East Asia Reception Hall

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The former Tokyo Prefecture purchased the former residence of Prince General Kawagoe in Shibuya Ward within the camp area to build a Martial Arts Hall to commemorate the 2600th anniversary of the founding of the Empire. However, with the change of Tokyo into a metropolis, the authorities decided to use this as a place for joint training by various ethnic groups within the Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere. Therefore, it was decided to change this into the Greater East Asia Reception Hall and a walkway and training ground. It is now being actively repaired and will soon be completed. According to reports, the area covers a total of 12,773 tsubo, and the building area is 1,281 tsubo. All kinds of buildings are extremely luxurious and beautiful.

### Thai Parliament Passes Next Year's Budget: Revenues and Expenditures Both Increase Compared to Last Year

Bangkok, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - The Thai Parliament passed next year's budget on the 16th. The expenditures are 339,741,000 baht, including 183,000,000 baht for general expenditures and 151,448,300 baht for investment accounts. This is an increase of 280 million baht in expenditures and 141 million baht in revenues compared to this year's budget (including supplementary budget). In particular, general expenditures increased by 30 million baht compared to last year's 150 million baht. Due to the increase in expenditures, it is necessary to increase revenues and adopt measures such as issuing public bonds to make up for the deficit. Regarding tax increases, there is a tendency to gradually increase income tax, property tax, and various other taxes. In addition, the government is planning to raise tariff rates and collect sand tax, single tax, food and entertainment tax, and other new taxes. The revenue for next year can indeed be increased to offset general expenditures. In order to offset investment account expenditures, public bonds will be issued. Due to the implementation of the "Special Temporary Funds Statistics Law" previously passed by the parliament, the deposits of banks and credit institutions that purchase public bonds according to the regulations on public bonds and the increase in savings of the general public, it will not be difficult to absorb 120 million baht of public bonds. Therefore, Thailand's finances can still maintain their soundness.

### Manchuria Leverages National Power with the Implementation of Citizen Handbooks: Identification Cards Facilitate Rationing of Supplies

Xinjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - In order to ensure the clear identification of every citizen, leverage the total power of the nation, and ensure the smooth operation of national administration, the Manchurian government formulated the "Citizen Handbook Implementation Guidelines" this spring and is rapidly preparing to promulgate the "Citizen Handbook Law."

### Japanese Wartime Economy Is Becoming Stronger: Conversation with Finance Minister Kaya

Tokyo, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - According to Osaka Telephone, Japanese Finance Minister Kaya held a banquet here at noon on the 16th to entertain financial figures. During the banquet, he delivered a speech explaining how Japan's economic power is becoming stronger under wartime conditions. The main points are as follows: The results of this year's public bond absorption are very good. From the beginning of the year to the end of November, in eight months, tax revenue alone reached more than 9.8 billion yuan. Compared with the issuance of 10.8 billion yuan of public bonds, 95% of the public bonds issued have been absorbed. In addition, there is approximately 3 billion yuan in stock revenue and approximately 1.8 billion yuan in new corporate bond issuance. Japan's decisive battle policies are progressing very smoothly. Regarding national savings, such as postal savings and various other savings, there has been a significant increase. The amount of national savings in the first half of this year is estimated to have reached more than 13.7 billion yuan, accounting for 59% of the annual target of 27 billion yuan. The total amount of national savings since the beginning of the Sino-Japanese War until the end of September of this year is estimated to be approximately 86.7 billion yuan, and it is now feared that it has exceeded 90 billion yuan. The total amount of the general budget estimate for fiscal year 1944, decided on the 10th of this month, is more than 15.3 billion yuan, and the supplementary budget for temporary military expenses will also be quite large. Most of this increased finance must rely on taxes and public bonds. Regarding taxes, a tax increase bill will be submitted to the regular Diet. The amount of tax increase will exceed the additional budget. The amount of public bonds issued (required) including the general accounting and temporary military expenses will also be greater than this year. It is also estimated that the need for funds to expand production will also be considerable. Currently, the only way to meet these large financial and industrial demands is to increase national savings.

### Conserving Electricity to Cultivate War Power: Sino-Japanese Council in Nanjing Decides on Measures

Nanjing, 17th (Central News Agency Telegram) - As the Greater East Asia War has entered a decisive phase, we should devote all materials to cultivating war power in order to complete the war. In this regard, a joint Sino-Japanese council was held in Nanjing on the 17th, and the content of the agreement included the following points:

Recently, the amount of fuel for electricity and lighting has been reduced by about 30% since November. This is not because coal production has decreased, but to preserve resources and use them for war power. The raw materials for Nanjing's electricity have been reduced by 30%. If the use of electricity and lighting does not decrease, power supply will be suspended for the last ten days of the month. Therefore, in order to complete this war objective, both China and Japan should conserve electricity. Japanese residents have been implementing electricity conservation since December. "The military has issued orders twice to remove unnecessary lighting fixtures and replace them with smaller light bulbs where necessary. The 100,000 citizens of Nanjing should also implement this immediately, but in the future, countermeasures need to be requested to find ways to save 30% to 45% of electricity. In the future, when large-scale power saving is implemented, the security and public order in Nanjing will inevitably be affected to some extent, and the citizens will also feel quite inconvenient. However, if we recognize the true meaning of the facts, there will be no anxiety or inconvenience. Some may think that saving electricity will affect industrial production and refuse to save electricity. However, according to expert surveys, Japan implemented electricity saving of up to 30%, and the results were as effective as before the reduction, and even achieved higher efficiency. The electrical machinery and electricity used in China are lower. Reducing it by 30% is not a problem at all. Electric heaters consume more electricity than ordinary electric lights, so it is necessary to avoid using them as much as possible. Based on the above agreement, the following policies are decided: Stipulate electricity saving propaganda and thoroughly publicize it to the public. Thoroughly investigate those who hoard small candle-type light bulbs, strictly crack down on them, and find ways to transport in small candle-type light bulbs. At a certain time, order the prohibition of selling electric water heaters, electric irons, and other electric heating products. Actively strengthen the inspection of electricity theft and crack down on it. Those who steal electricity and do not cooperate with electricity saving will be completely cut off from supply.

### General Takahashi of Japan Expresses Determination to Win; Delivers Speech at Sino-Japanese Press Conference

Central News Agency – Naval Elder General Takahashi of Japan, at a reception held yesterday (17th) by the press department of the Japanese fleet in China, met with the Sino-Japanese press corps, expressing Japan's determination to win and detailing the current combat situation. The details are as follows:

Visit and Inspection

His Excellency Takahashi first stated: I hope to see the solidarity between China, Japan, and Manchuria strengthened through this East Asia Conference, with the three nations forming a united front to strive for victory in the Greater East Asia War. My task this time is to first earnestly discuss matters with various Chinese figures in Peiping and Tianjin, aiming to promote and establish future East Asian groups, and to promote exchanges between East Asian entities. I am ashamed to admit that my abilities are inadequate. I have never been to Peiping and Tianjin before, and this is my first visit. At the same time, I will also go to Kalgan, Baotou, Zhangjiakou and other places to conduct on-site inspections. I serve as an advisor to the Japan East Asia General Headquarters. In the past, I was unable to understand the real situation in Peiping, Tianjin, and other places. This time, I personally went to observe and gained results, which makes me quite satisfied. Currently, the Japan East Asia General Headquarters is under the jurisdiction of the Great Political Assistance Council. The Director General is Mr. Mizuno, the former Minister of Internal Affairs and Minister of Education. The advisors are Lieutenant General Matsui Ishine, Mr. Nagamori Kakutaro, the former Minister of Colonial Affairs, and myself.

Current War Situation

His Excellency Takahashi expressed his views on the current war situation in Greater East Asia, saying that since the start of the Greater East Asia War two years ago, the progress and state of the battles have been clear to everyone. From January to November of this year, the frontline battles, such as Guadalcanal and the Aleutian Islands, were fierce. The tragic and great martyrdom of the Yamazaki unit on Attu Island caused great pain and damage to the enemy. Next, the Japanese army achieved a major victory on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands. Regarding the landing of several U.S. troops on Bougainville Island, the Japanese army launched a fierce attack and encirclement, achieving a great victory. Furthermore, the battles on Bougainville Island and the Gilbert Islands were extraordinary. After winning a major victory on these two islands, this mentality was completely eliminated. Therefore, these two air battles are of great significance. However, the concerns of the general public about the future of the war are a fact. However, the general public needs to understand the situation in the vast Pacific Ocean and the different nature of land operations. This point should also be particularly clear.

Heavy Losses Suffered by the Enemy

The greatest purpose of naval warfare is to annihilate the enemy fleet and establish air base strongholds on the islands, using them to destroy the enemy fleet. Observing the process of the U.S. military's operations, the United States launched operations on Guadalcanal, Attu Island, and New Georgia Island, and then created new bases in several locations. Each time it attempted to move, it launched large-scale battleships and destroyers. Therefore, the damage suffered by them is well known to everyone. In short, the means used by the U.S. Navy will ultimately fail to achieve its intended purpose and will suffer heavy losses. Therefore, although they seize value, the value and significance of the islands occupied by our side are obviously far greater. From this perspective, our side is extremely advantageous. Therefore, based on factual observations and judgments, we are not concerned about the enemy's intentions and are quite secure in our defense.

Observing the Future

Next, observing the future prospects of the war, it is extremely difficult to predict the future of the war. It is still impossible to predict what the enemy will do. I would like to point out two important points. Firstly, I predict that the future war will be a long-term war. Secondly, no matter how long the future war is extended, victory will definitely belong to Japan. There are many reasons for a long-term war. In naval warfare, Japan has unwavering confidence. Thinking of the situation during the Russo-Japanese War, there is even more certainty. During the Russo-Japanese War, there were no submarines or aircraft. Japan used miraculous weapons to destroy the enemy's main battleships. Therefore, recalling the past and predicting the future, Japan will definitely achieve victory, displaying great combat power. First, aircraft are the main force at sea. In this war, no matter how the enemy plots, we will shatter the U.S. plan with our past strength and future attacks. It takes two or three years to build a warship, but aircraft can be completed in a short period of time. Japan has a vast air force that can destroy enemy ships. This is a war that benefits Japan's agility. Second, observing the reasons for a long-term war, the international situation during the Russo-Japanese War was different from the present. At that time, it was a war between Japan and Russia, but now it is the Greater East Asia War, with a wider scope. Furthermore, during the Russo-Japanese War, there were people who mediated, but now there is no one to mediate. Therefore, the current war is entirely fought on strength and will undoubtedly be a long-term war. The above is my personal judgment on the long-term war.

Victory in Spirit

Then, I will reveal that Japan's strength can win this war, and Japan will overcome it with material and spiritual courage. This is Japan's only strength. Regarding this point of view, the enemy relies on material things, while Japan wins with spirit and technological power. Although the United States also has spirit and technological power, it is ultimately not as good as Japan. General Takahashi specifically mentioned the following four key factors in comparing the manpower of the two countries: The mobilization of university students and other students into the army and navy shows that the United States is mobilizing those over the age of twenty, which shows that the United States lacks manpower. On the other hand, Japan only recently began to train university students in military affairs. At the same time, it has formed women's armies. Therefore, in terms of military strength and manpower, Japan's manpower is always more abundant than that of the United States. Based on the above judgments, it can be seen that the United States is extremely panicked about manpower. Furthermore, in terms of resources and materials, such as warships, aircraft, and other things, Japan has sufficient production, sufficient equipment, and rapid growth, which fully supplies the needs of the army and navy. The rear production provides ample supplies. Therefore, in terms of manpower and resources, Japan is extraordinarily abundant and confident that it will never lose to the United States.

Japanese Advantage

Regarding scientific issues, before the Greater East Asia War, the United States had electronic wave detectors and civil engineering disciplines, working hard in obscurity. Now, it has progressed rapidly and surpassed its past achievements. Therefore, it is certain that Japan is no worse than the United States in scientific warfare. In comparing the spirits of Japan and the United States, I am confident that we are above the United States, which need not be repeated. The spiritual power of Japan has already been demonstrated to the world in this war. Regarding the issue of technical power, after the Washington Conference, in the first World War, Japan and Britain were allies and were forced to declare war on Germany. At that time, the Japanese Navy replaced the British Navy in defending the Pacific Ocean, displaying great spirit. Britain had only a few cruisers, and all its strength was concentrated in its own country. Therefore, Japan not only defended the Pacific Ocean but also bore the responsibility of defending the Indian Ocean. The base at that time was in Singapore, now known as Syonan Island. Britain was not satisfied with its desires and repeatedly requested greater assistance from Japan. Later, it concentrated its naval power in Malta, creating another base. In the first World War, Britain defeated Germany because Japan and Britain won together. Shortly after the war, Britain, the United States, France, Italy, and Japan held a military reduction conference. At the conference, Britain and the United States arbitrarily suppressed Japan. The Anglo-Japanese Alliance treaty was declared invalid due to Britain's rejection, and Japan was forced to reduce its military, to a ratio of 5:3 with the United States. At that time, the representatives present were dissatisfied, but due to the situation in Japan and various relationships, they swallowed their anger and recognized it. In the next two or three years, Japan endured everything to abide by the treaty. Under these circumstances, the United States sank unfinished warships, and Japan sank its completed second-rate battleships Katori, Settsu, Aki, Satsuma, and more than a dozen others. Japan shed tears at this situation, enduring the sacrifice while feeling heartbroken for the naval cadets. However, even though Japan was suppressed during the military reduction, it remained steadfast in its belief, determined that one day, Japan would go to war with Britain and the United States and would not stop until it achieved a great victory. Therefore, at that time, with the determination to overcome inferiority and to defeat the majority with the few, it worked hard with all its strength. Marshal Togo stated that there are "limitations on the number of ships, but no limitations on training." Although the number of Japanese ships was small, its spiritual strength and training were not defeated. In the following ten years, the Japanese military's fierce training did not cease, which is why it achieved this effect, not hesitating to sacrifice one warship to exert the power of two or three, and using one aircraft to exert the power of five or ten. This great power of one against ten and one hundred against a thousand was fully demonstrated in the Greater East Asia War. Therefore, Japan's strength surpasses that of Britain and the United States. In particular, the front-line soldiers and the rear civilians are becoming more and more prosperous, and their confidence is becoming even stronger. Victory in the Greater East Asia War will undoubtedly belong to Japan.

Spiritual Mobilization

General Takahashi finally added that the Japanese army's combat power is the same as the navy's. In the Japanese rear, the entire nation will cooperate with the front-line soldiers, promote that spirit, unanimously engage in spiritual mobilization, firmly believe, and strive for final victory. The victory in this war does not only belong to Japan alone, but to the people of China, Manchuria, Burma, and the various ethnic groups in East Asia. In other words, East Asia, which has suffered oppression for many years, has been restored to the East Asians through this war. Asia has been restored to the Asians. He said that during his visit to Manchuria, North China, and Central China, he saw that the people in various places were taking the same steps as Japan, working diligently, and contributing to the Greater East Asia War. He felt very gratified about this. He respectfully wishes that the people of the Republic of China would be of one heart and one mind, unite and strive for the complete success of the East Asia War. He eagerly anticipates this. Therefore, in this spirit, everyone must strive hard and believe that the war will be successful. He can assert that the Greater East Asia War will never fail, and he hopes that all of China will firmly believe that Japan will definitely achieve victory. With this belief, the future will be favorable. As members of the press, fulfill your heavenly duty of reporting and spread the message widely.

### Retention and Exemption from Purchasing Yarn and Cloth; Applications Deadline within the Year; Late Applications Will Not Be Accepted

The National General Association for Commercial Control, under orders, is handling the purchase of cotton yarn and cloth within Shanghai. All procedures are in accordance with government regulations. As the variety of yarn and cloth to be purchased is complex, with many brand names, and assessment is difficult, and in order to accurately determine the actual monthly needs of each factory and retailer fairly, the association first hired impartial individuals from the industry to form various committees responsible for identifying quality and investigating the actual situation, so as to approve retention or exemption from purchase accordingly. All these have been announced in advance. However, many applicants often misunderstand the meaning and request retention or exemption from purchase for yarn and cloth that should be purchased. Upon inquiring with the person in charge of the Commercial Control Association, it was learned that the association has ordered the Cotton Industry Management Office to complete all purchasing work within the current year. If any factory or business with approved retention or exemption from purchase of yarn and cotton cloth does not apply for purchase from the Commercial Control Association before the deadline, it will not be accepted thereafter. The association has listed in detail the three categories of items approved for retention, exempt from purchase, and specially approved for management below, so that factories and businesses have a basis to follow, so as to avoid discrepancies and self-created troubles.

German and French Yarn and Cloth Approved for Exemption from Purchase

Since its establishment, the Cotton Yarn and Cloth Purchasing Office of the National General Association for Commercial Control has actively launched the work of purchasing cotton yarn and cloth nationwide. It has conducted cotton yarn and cloth registration in nine cities including Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Wuhu. The entire task has largely come to an end. As for merchants of third-country nationality (excluding Japanese) holding cotton yarn and cloth, they were originally required to follow the purchase procedures as well. However, most of the cotton yarn and cloth owned by French merchants in Shanghai were ordered by Annam before the Greater East Asia War, but due to difficulties in maritime transportation, they could not be shipped out. It is said that the French residents requested the Commercial Control Association to exempt them from purchase, which has been approved by the association. However, if the cotton yarn and cloth are sold in Shanghai, the Commercial Control Association should have the priority to purchase them. The quantity of special cotton yarn and cloth owned by Germans is very small, only 0.05 percent of the total. They requested exemption from purchase, which has been approved by the Commercial Control Association.

### Loss of the Huatai Steamer; Company Studies Aftermath; Five County Associations Form Assistance Association

Central News Agency – Regarding the accident of the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Huatai steamer sinking at the entrance of the Xingang River, with more than a thousand passengers tragically drowning, this reporter interviewed Mr. Yamamoto, the vice president of the company, yesterday afternoon. The conversation lasted for one hour, and the details are recorded below:

(Question) The cause of the Huatai steamer accident and the company's handling of the aftermath are of great concern to all sectors of society. We hope you can explain. (Answer) According to reports, the Huatai steamer had 459 passengers apart from the crew when it departed from Shanghai. Later, it picked up more than two hundred passengers along the way. The time of arrival at Xingang was 7:30 AM. The sky was not completely bright, and in the faint morning light, more than thirty sampans were parked in front of the Huatai, waiting for the Huatai to arrive. Passengers in the sampans then wanted to board the ship. At that time, passengers disembarking from the Huatai had not completely disembarked, causing the ship's body to tilt excessively to one side. River water entered the deck and cabin doors, causing it to sink, resulting in the tragedy. The company expresses its sincere apologies. It immediately organized a committee and dispatched the Xuchang ship overnight to investigate and search for the remaining corpses in the cabin. It also sent fifteen divers to the accident site to start work a few days ago. It is also scheduled to accompany the affected families to Xingang on the Xin Yuan boat today at 2 pm. As for the aftermath, the company is currently studying it as much as possible. (Question) It is also heard that when the Huatai steamer had an accident, it closed the cabin doors tightly, and some of the ship's employees and servants used extortion, forcing passengers to give money before letting them descend from the ship, resulting in a large number of passengers being unable to escape the ship and tragically drowning. Is this true? (Answer) It is true that the lower cabin doors were closed when the ship had an accident to slow the flow of river water. At the same time, personnel were sent to climb onto the ship from outside to rescue people. As for the crew using extortion, it is unlikely to have happened, but it cannot be ruled out. (Question) I heard that your company has sent fifteen divers to the accident site to search for the remaining corpses in the cabin. If the divers discover valuable items near the bodies of drowned passengers when diving, will the company consider a plan to deal with the above situation? (Answer) The company will conduct strict inspections of the divers before and after entering the water to prevent illegal behavior.

Registration of Affected Families

On the 12th of this month, the China Merchant Steam Navigation Company's Huatai steamer sank at Xingang Port in Rugao County, with no fewer than a thousand people tragically drowned. Among them, peddlers from Nantong, Rugao, Haimen, and Qidong accounted for the majority. The affected families, driving in the past, have gathered at the Bund Jianghai Customs Pier in this city for days, wailing and crying, which is too painful to bear. The Tong Rugao Changhai Qidong Five County Association in this city believes that the victims of this unfortunate event are mostly fellow villagers, so it feels the pain personally. Therefore, it held an emergency standing director meeting on the 17th of this month, resolving to organize a Huatai Steamer Victims Assistance Committee. It appointed Ni Bu-chang, Qian Xia-xiang, Qiang Xi-qi, Zhang Tong-sheng, Ji Jiu-yu, Lu Ting-zhu, and He Tian-jiong as members. It immediately announced in the newspaper that the affected families should go to the association's office at Room 29, 4th Floor, Beijing Road Trade Building, to register. It is also scheduled to hold the first Assistance Committee meeting on the 18th to prepare for various assistance matters.

### Japanese Naval Elder General Takahashi Arrives in Shanghai; Meets with Sino-Japanese Journalists in This City Yesterday

Fleet press director Colonel Matsushima, subordinate Captain Morita, and entrusted Sakazume, Anchi, and Wang Bing-kun to receive General Takahashi at the meeting on time. No fewer than forty Sino-Japanese reporters attended the meeting.

General Takahashi has a long history in the Japanese Navy and has a clear understanding of the current stage of operations. Today, we are inviting the journalists in this city to meet with him and listen to General Takahashi's high opinions and instructions. I believe it is a great honor, and I think everyone feels the same. The victory that Japan has achieved in the Greater East Asia War can be said to be a triumphant opening, which is also the result of his many years of painstaking efforts, courageous spirit, and cultivation of talent. General Takahashi has served as the commander-in-chief of the former Combined Fleet and the former president of the Naval War College. His great achievements in diligently preparing and serving the country for many years are worthy of introduction to everyone." Then, General Takahashi delivered a speech, briefly reporting on the mission of this visit to China and the current situation of the Greater East Asia War, and revealing Japan's determination to win this war. Finally, he bitterly criticized the Anglo-American oppression of Japan at the Washington Conference [please see page 2]. At the end, Director Matsushima expressed his thanks, roughly saying: "Today, we have obtained General Takahashi's valuable high opinions in this precious time, for which I am very grateful. When I was studying at the Naval War College, Your Excellency was the president, and I received profound guidance. Today, I have once again received your valuable high opinions, which I consider to be very fortunate. According to Your Excellency's remarks just now, which can be said to be Your Excellency's long-held aspirations, Your Excellency based this on diligent training during the military reduction conference, which has produced many talents, and has resulted in today's achievements. Therefore, Your Excellency's contribution can be called great. The greatest foundation of the navy has just been created, allowing us to gain a full understanding of it. We are especially grateful." It lasted about three hours and ended with tea and refreshments.

### Economic Section of the First District: Remarks by Director Feng

Central News Agency: Chen Riping, the Director of the Economic Section of the First District Public Office of the Shanghai Special Municipality, has resigned due to mourning the death of a parent. Mayor Chen has appointed Feng [blank space] to succeed him. The Director has already taken office. He issued a statement yesterday, saying... I have been appointed by the Mayor to handle the affairs of this section. I will certainly understand the Mayor's intentions and, under his guidance, work with all the senior officials of the Municipal Government to do my best within the scope of my duties. However, as this city is an important economic area of ​​China, various economic problems are extraordinarily complex. I am of limited talent and shallow knowledge. I hope that people from all walks of life and the citizens will provide assistance at any time so that the affairs under the management of this section can be further improved and can better meet the hopes of the general public in the district. The establishment of the Economic Section of the First District has been some time ago. It manages the allocation of materials in the first and eighth districts of the city and rectifies and suppresses economic affairs within its jurisdiction. It has already achieved considerable political achievements, which I greatly admired before joining the First District Public Office. For example, in the matter of material allocation, at the [blank space] stage of being able to allocate, the colleagues of the Economic Section must go through a lot of hard work and trouble in terms of negotiation, procurement, transportation, and storage before they can achieve the purpose of allocation. At this time of wartime material shortage, when [blank space] the need to increase production, handling it is even more difficult. In short, the wartime economy is different from the peacetime economy. In wartime, materials and labor are bound to feel scarce. In order to take care of the economic life of the public, the government has to rigorously implement economic control in order to seek fair and universal allocation, while striving to increase production and [blank space] to ensure smooth cargo transportation. However, before the above-mentioned goals can be fully achieved, inconvenience will inevitably be felt in life. I hope that the gentlemen of the press can understand the Municipal Government's painstaking efforts to improve the city's economy and explain it to the public. It would be very fortunate. In addition, regarding the personnel issues of the various sections of the Economic Section, all the staff have been diligent in their work in the past and are already experienced, so everything remains the same and there are no changes.

Economic Circles' Comments

### Restricting Capital Increases for Enterprises

The Deputy Minister of the Ministry of Industry stated yesterday that the government will restrict the arbitrary capital increases of companies and factories in various regions. He explained that the use of investment must be coordinated with the development of various enterprises, otherwise it will inevitably lead to abnormal operations. Secondly, companies and factories that have been established for a long time have assets whose value is no longer what it used to be. Raising prices and increasing shares is naturally inappropriate. [blank space] If the asset appreciation ratio is not subject to considerable restrictions, and the price is allowed to be raised arbitrarily, once prices [blank space] flatten, the company's assets will superficially [blank space] retain [blank space] a large number, but the value of its shares has depreciated, and the company's foundation will also be shaken. Thirdly, the method of increasing shares also lacks legal basis.

The above paragraph can be said to be a preventive medicine for the unrestricted capital increases of general companies and factories. From the first point in the speech, it is in line with what Deputy Propaganda Minister Guo said in his broadcast a few days ago: "Some people, when they hear that the country is advocating production, also say that they are increasing production, but when it comes time to do it, they treat it as a game, and of course there will be no good results." From the second point [blank space], companies and factories must be cautious when raising prices and increasing shares to prevent excessive inflation of shares and avoid the danger of "being top-heavy" in the future. From the third point [blank space], the method of increasing shares, in the company's and factory's opinion, may be considered "everyone knows the tricks, but each has their own cleverness." However, the competent authorities should consider forming a most reasonable standard for everyone to follow.

### China Fertilizer Popularization Association Establishes Experimental Farms

### A Hospital on Luoyang Road: A Visit to Shanghai Nanyang Hospital

From Luoyang Road (formerly Route Foch), from Nantong Road (formerly Rue Sapey), or from Taishan Road (formerly [blank space] Fei Road), you can see the grand and imposing gate of the "Shanghai Nanyang Hospital". From these three main gates of the hospital, can you guess the scale of the hospital? However, let's go inside and take a look. This is a hospital with a rich history and also a modern hospital. It is a large hospital that serves not only the wealthy but also the public, and it is a large hospital that not only engages in treatment but also cultivates new medical talents!

A Glorious History

The gate of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital at No. 77 Luoyang Road, in front of the new building, also stands an antique archway, which embellishes this as a historical medical institution.

Filled with the quiet and sublime atmosphere of a French aristocratic residence, the hospital is surrounded by small courtyards, but the palm trees that sweep into the clouds like giants are just like a song from the South. It seems that this is the origin of the name of Nanyang Hospital. However, Mr. Lu Ping of the hospital mentioned that there is also a palm tree here that has a close relationship with the Chinese revolution! He led [blank space] to the courtyard [blank space], where it stands tall and graceful. It seems that it is still the hospital tree of Nanyang Hospital today. If some commemorative embellishments are added, wouldn't it give people a more admired and hopeful mood?

Speaking of Nanyang Hospital, it also has its own glorious past. It was still in the early years of the Republic of China, when the national and democratic revolutions, although nominally successful, actually showed a situation of warlord strife. For a time, people with lofty ideals were discouraged and disappointed. Some were preparing for new revolutionary undertakings, and some were concentrating on social reform undertakings. Among them, quite a few people followed the ancient motto of "If I can't be a good minister, I will be a good doctor" and strived to rid China [blank space] of the shame of "sick man of East Asia". At that time, there was Dr. Gu Nanqun, who graduated from Ai Ru Medical University and returned to China. In order to cultivate new medical talents, he founded Nanyang Medical College, and for the convenience of students' numb practice, he attached a hospital, originally named Nanyang Medical College Practice [blank space] Hospital, formerly known as [blank space] Yang Hospital. It was still in the [blank space] of the seventh year of the Republic of China. At that time, the hospital was located on Carter Road. Later, because the two businesses of the school and the hospital gradually developed, it moved to Shanhai Pass Road in the eighth year of the Republic of China, and to Xiaonanmen in the ninth year of the Republic of China. In the fourteenth year of the Republic of China, because the number of patients in the hospital [blank space] increased sharply, the hospital affairs became increasingly busy. In order to prevent Gu Yuan from dividing, the school part was entrusted to capable experts to be responsible for the management. In the spring of the twenty-first year of the Republic of China, the hospital affairs developed far, and a branch was built in Gangyang, with a clinic at the New Kaihe section. In the winter of this year, it also rented a large [blank space] in Xiaodongmen. In order to meet the needs of development and conform to the ideal new hospital, it merged the Nanyang [blank space] Branch and the New Kaihe [blank space] Office, and divided them into departments for diagnosis and treatment. At the same time, it strived to enrich the medical equipment. In the autumn of the twenty-third year of the Republic of China, it purchased an X-ray machine and attached a senior parliamentary vocational school. In the winter of the twenty-fourth year, it also established a branch in Yangjiadu, gradually becoming the newest and most complete hospital in Shanghai.

However, the Shanghai battle in the twenty-sixth year of the Republic of China turned Nanyang Hospital, which had been painstakingly managed and scaled up for more than ten years, into ashes. It only did not destroy the determination of the hospital's staff to serve the society wholeheartedly. Therefore, they immediately used No. 380 Route Lafayette as a temporary hospital and continued the social undertaking of benevolence and medical skills. In March of the following year, they leased the Shangxian Hall Building and the house to its east and transformed it into a news hospital, and moved in for diagnosis and treatment from June 1st. Under active management, the hospital affairs developed again, and those seeking medical treatment came one after another, and they were exhausted to cope with it. Therefore, starting from the twenty-eighth year of the Republic of China, they renovated the residential building [blank space]. The construction project was completed in January of the thirtieth year, and the decoration and equipment were also successful one after another. At the same time, they focused on the medical and administrative affairs. The general affairs departments have undergone a major renovation, improving the medical administration and system on one hand, and improving the academic standards of doctors on the other, strengthening the medical lineup. By June of this year, they were standing in Luoyang Road with the perfect posture of a modern hospital that combines form and content. Here, people can see clearly that Dr. Gu Nanqun has been [blank space] at the gate of Shanghai Nanyang Hospital for more than twenty years; but to this day, the hospital is still seeking new innovations every day. Is it just his personal achievement?
