### Overall Economic Construction Coordination

The purpose of economic construction is to enrich the country and improve the people's livelihood. Therefore, modern countries are actively engaged in developing their economies. This is important in peacetime, but even more so in wartime. Because wartime material consumption is greater than in peacetime, winning the war requires all economic activities to focus on adapting to the needs of the war. At the same time, in order to quickly restore national strength and vitality after the war, and to improve the people's economic living standards after the war, we must especially focus on promoting economic construction. The scope of economics is extremely broad, and the techniques of construction are endless. How can we expect to completely build up all economic undertakings and achieve an ideal state? This is naturally a very difficult thing to do. However, we are a country that has been poor and weak for a long time, and our economic organizational foundation is fragile. Currently, we are also at war with foreign countries. Objectively, there is a very urgent need to actively engage in economic construction. Even if it is extremely difficult to complete, we must make every effort with a do-or-die spirit. The government formulates plans and earnestly implements them from above, and the people do their best to assist and promote them from below. If the top and bottom are united and the whole country is of one mind, I firmly believe that there will be a day of completion.

The government previously formulated a three-year construction plan. We do not know the details of how far it has progressed recently. However, we believe that all of the government's economic measures should be related to the entire economic construction. In other words, every economic measure must take into account its overall relationship with economic construction. Because economic construction is a whole system, like the human body, or like a machine. If one part of the human body is uncomfortable, the whole body feels pain. If one part of the machine is damaged, the whole thing loses its flexibility. Economic construction projects, if observed separately, even if each one is satisfactory, but when combined, if there is a lack of coordination in the middle, the result is no different from the pain caused by one part of the human body being uncomfortable affecting the whole body, or the damage of one part of the machine affecting the loss of flexibility of the whole. Therefore, the measures of economic construction should have overall proper coordination, not only to make each department of economic construction have good achievements, but also to pay attention to the overall coordinated development.

How to achieve overall coordination? This is the government's inescapable responsibility. We suggest that the government should have a central organization responsible for the entire economic construction. The central task of this organization is to coordinate the affairs of all departments of national economic construction. The promotion and implementation of construction plans in various departments can be entrusted to the responsible authorities to implement the division of labor, and the work of comprehensive connection between each other should be the responsibility of this central organization. At the same time, private economic operators should automatically adapt to the government's overall plan and develop together. If they only take the interests of individual businesses as the premise and do not cooperate with each other, the result will be that individuals may be successful, but the collective will still be a failure. For the sake of the future of the war victory, the future of economic construction, and the future of the national economy and the people's livelihood, this issue of overall coordination is worth raising, and all sectors of society should attach importance to it.

### Improve the Treatment of Public School Personnel

Civil servants are those who implement policies and decrees, and the level of administrative efficiency illustrates the effectiveness of policies and decrees. And the level of administrative efficiency depends on the efforts of civil servants. Teachers are those who educate talents, and the level of educational efficiency illustrates the existence of talents, and the level of educational efficiency depends on the efforts of teachers.

The success of all undertakings depends on appropriate talents. Of course, education is not the only way to cultivate talents, but education is undoubtedly the most basic point in cultivating talents. If we want to improve educational efficiency, we should first improve the treatment of teachers to stabilize their minimum living standards. At present, the meager treatment of teachers is on the verge of not being able to maintain the pain of minimum living, not only teachers have repeatedly issued urgent demands, but also all sectors of society and public opinion have expressed very concerned sympathy and appeals.

Civil servants, especially low-level civil servants, are responsible for any major responsibilities, and their treatment is extremely meager, with the same situation as teachers. The country wants political progress and improved administrative efficiency; it wants to cultivate talents and improve educational efficiency; it is undoubtedly necessary, but the treatment of public school personnel related to administrative and educational efficiency has not been improved, which is a regrettable thing, and as a result, some civil servants are engaged in private fraud to meet their living requirements, and some teachers change careers if they can, otherwise they will also do things perfunctorily without energy, and in terms of efficiency, it is a far cry from the goal. Where can we talk about the requirements for political improvement and talent cultivation?

Today, we solemnly and urgently call for raising the proper treatment of public school personnel, and strive to make them able to maintain their minimum living standards as the goal. At this time of fluctuating prices, a little subsidy cannot compete with the speed of prices. In order to thoroughly stabilize the lives of public school personnel, we advocate issuing in-kind benefits. The in-kind salary system passed by the Executive Yuan a few months ago has not been implemented in concrete terms. Moreover, the extra rations of rice and grain for civil servants have not been issued since July, according to reports. Before finalizing the whole method, we hope that the government will first organize the distribution of sufficient food to the direct relatives of public school personnel residing in the same place, and provide special relief subsidies to public school personnel with heavier family burdens and large populations. First, each agency or school should report the actual number of direct relatives reported in the personnel record forms of public school personnel, and after investigation and verification, the food and subsidies should be distributed accordingly. If the government fails to meet this minimum condition, then it is difficult to avoid the suspicion of hypocrisy and ineffectiveness when chanting about clean government and administrative efficiency.

### Italian King Sets Up Temporary Capital in Bari

Stockholm, 30th – Central News Agency: According to a diplomatic special correspondent quoted in the Stockholm newspaper, although the Anti-Axis countries support the Badoglio regime as the responsible authority for signing the treaty, they want to expand the regime to include liberals and leftists, and have informed Marshal Badoglio of this intention. Qualified sources in London announced that technically, Italy is still regarded as a defeated enemy, the armistice conditions are still valid, and the Anti-Axis countries' interpretation of these conditions depends on Italy's actions after the armistice and how effective Italy's war against Germany is. The Anti-Axis countries and the Badoglio faction have a common interest in driving the German army out of Italy.

Stockholm, 30th – Central News Agency: According to news from the Eastern Front, since the Soviet army launched an offensive on the Sousa River front from east of Gomel to Smolensk, it has recently become more intense. The Soviet army has mobilized a reserve force, attempting to break through the south-eastern part of Belarus from the center. On the 29th, the battle situation became extremely tense. According to a German military announcement, the war line is connected to the Kiev front, so its trend has a significant impact on the fighting on the Dnieper River bridgehead. At present, the German army has also increased its new elite forces, trying to stop the Soviet army from advancing, and launching mobile counterattacks to defeat the main force of the Soviet army. Fierce fighting is currently underway. At the same time, it weakened the Soviet offensive against Mogilev and Minsk, but the Soviet offensive on the Vitebsk front is still very fierce. The German army is currently attacking the vanguard of the Soviet army in the Ruthenia region, a few kilometers inside the Belarusian border.

Berlin, 30th – Central News Agency: The offensive on the southern route of the Eastern Front, from Chaplise to Kiev, a front line of 160 kilometers, has become fierce. Especially in the north-eastern area of Kiev, the Soviet army has tried to cross the west bank by using the islands in the middle of the Dnieper River, but the German army opened fire and destroyed all of its assault teams. The German positions on the Kiev bridgehead have not been shaken at all, and some Soviet troops that reached the west bank have been encircled, so it has no impact on the battle situation.

### German Army Builds New Positions in the Mountainous Areas of Southern Italy; Allied Advance Blocked

Berlin, 30th – Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that the incessant torrential rain in southern Italy severely restricted military activities there on Tuesday. The Salerno area, previously guarded by British forces, is now guarded by American forces. Major General Clark's corps in that area is advancing along the highway from Vietri to the northwest, attempting to advance towards the plain northwest of Naples after the German troops divided into new positions in the mountains. The German army withdrew from Saint Giorgio, Baronissi, and Montoro after destroying all important military equipment. The enemy was completely unaware at the time, and only discovered it several hours later. The British and American forces launched a fierce attack along the highway from Vietri to Pompeii, encountering stubborn resistance from the German covering troops. The artillery fire arranged by the German army in the area was very clever, and the enemy's advance was blocked by concentrated artillery fire. The enemy's offensive was ineffective several times, and they retreated backwards without crossing the highway, leaving behind many dead and captured. On the eastern side, the German rear guard put up a strong resistance to the troops of General Montgomery, who attempted to advance by crossing the minefield. In some small-scale local conflicts, the British army suffered considerable losses, so the German rear guard was able to protect the large German forces moving towards the eastern side in order to establish new positions there. These new positions are located in the mountains and are more conducive to defense.

It is especially necessary to establish these quarantine camps in the Canton of Bern.

### Meeting of British, American, and Soviet Foreign Ministers to be Held in London Instead

Geneva, 30th – Central News Agency: German News Agency reports that according to a diplomatic correspondent for the Daily Mail, Broadbent, there is a possibility that the "War and Peace" conference of the United Kingdom, the United States, and the Soviet Union will be held in London instead. This location issue is currently being negotiated and decided by Washington and Moscow. The US government has recently requested that the Soviet Union suspend preparations for holding the meeting in Moscow, the reason being that US Secretary of State Hull himself wants to lead the US delegation, because Hull's health cannot withstand the long journey to the Soviet Union, especially in the autumn and winter seasons, so there is a discussion of changing the location. Last night, some speculated that the Soviet Union would agree to change its plans and send Foreign Commissar Molotov to lead the Soviet delegation to London for the meeting.

### End of Military and Political Leaders' Conference: Chairman Wang Personally Delivers Instructions

All attendees listened intently and were greatly inspired. Thus, the conference of concerned senior military and political leaders concluded successfully.

Original Text of the Instructions

Nanjing, 30th (Central News Agency) - At 9:00 AM on the 28th of this month, the leaders attending the national conference of senior military and political officials paid their respects at the Sun Yat-sen Mausoleum. At 10:00 AM, all attendees gathered in the National Government Auditorium, where Chairman Wang personally delivered instructions. He gave a comprehensive political report on the European war situation, the Greater East Asia war situation, Sino-Japanese relations, and the trends of the current situation, lasting over an hour. At the conclusion of the conference on the 30th, Chairman Wang again gave instructions, pointing out two major essentials for future efforts. After listening to the instructions, all attendees learned that the current situation had leaped forward to a newer, more realistic, and brighter new phase. In addition to feeling extremely inspired, they strengthened their belief in striving for victory in the war and promoting comprehensive peace. The concluding remarks of Chairman Wang's two instructions are respectfully recorded below:

Instructions at the Opening Session

Since the Greater East Asia War, people of all races in Asia have developed a sense of racial self-awareness, knowing that this war is about the rise and fall, survival and demise of East Asia. Without sharing hardships, there can be no sharing of sweets; without the determination to share death, there can be no sharing of life. Japan, as an advanced country, has taken the lead in defending East Asia with its national power and all the spiritual and material strength accumulated and taught since the Meiji Restoration, with the mission of defeating Britain and the United States. It has strengthened good-neighborly and friendly relations with its East Asian brethren, China, Manchukuo, and Thailand. It has assisted Burma and the Philippines in their independence and the fulfillment of their aspirations to build modern nations. For the British and Dutch colonies in Southeast Asia, it has removed their political and economic shackles and cleansed the remnants of colonialism. It appeals with a spirit of righteousness, hoping to unite all the people of East Asia to jointly defend East Asia and realize the construction of co-existence and co-prosperity.

As for Sino-Japanese relations, an agreement was signed on January 9th of this year to return concessions in advance and abolish extraterritorial rights. This was realized on August 1st. The Basic Treaty of Sino-Japanese Relations was signed on November 30, 1929. At that time, the Greater East Asia War had not yet begun, and British and American forces were still entrenched within China. Out of concern for the environment, there had to be special restrictions. Issues such as troop deployment and the establishment of special zones in military and economic affairs arose from this. After the Greater East Asia War, this environmental concern no longer existed, hence the declaration of fundamental revision. Now, the principles of revision have been decided. The future new treaty will be based purely on a good-neighborly and friendly standpoint, with independence, freedom, reciprocity, and equality as the unchanging principles. Japan has no other demands on China except to work together to cut off relations with Britain and the United States and complete the Greater East Asia War. Many of you present here were previously on the front lines of resistance. In the past, the resistance believed that China and Japan could not coexist. Now, the coexistence of China and Japan not only has a theoretical basis but also has factual proof. The meaning of resistance has long lost its existence. There is no other path but to follow the Greater Asianism that Sun Yat-sen proclaimed and work with Japan to move forward with one heart and one mind.

Chongqing should know that if it does not follow this path, it will send China into a tragic future. For example, Chongqing is now supplying Chinese territory to the United States as an air force base, and those being bombed in places like Wuhan and Guangzhou are none other than their own compatriots. It is truly tragic to use one's own land to provide others for the purpose of bombing one's own compatriots. We absolutely cannot bear for Chongqing to do this. Brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing should not bear to do this in good conscience.

Furthermore, Britain and the United States are instigating Chongqing to attack Burma. Think about it, Burma is a member of the East Asian community, having long suffered oppression under British imperialism. Recently, it has received assistance from Japan to cultivate some pioneers of independence. Confucius said it well, "Do not impose on others what you yourself do not desire." If we Chinese want independence and freedom, Burma naturally wants independence and freedom as well. If the Chongqing side is aware that they are East Asians, then following Britain and the United States to attack a newly independent Burma, insisting on returning it to a state of slavery, is terribly heartless and unreasonable. We absolutely cannot bear for Chongqing to do this. Brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing should not bear to do this in good conscience.

On January 11th, Britain and the United States also proposed to Chongqing the abolition of unequal treaties. It must be known that there are no British or American forces within China today. The privileges they obtained based on the unequal treaties since the Opium War, such as concessions and extraterritorial rights, have long been crushed by the cooperation of China and Japan since the Greater East Asia War. For Britain and the United States to talk about abolishing treaties at this time is even more pointless than empty talk. Moreover, it is just a promissory note, and whether it can be cashed will only be considered after the war. It cannot even be considered empty talk.

The problem today is not whether British and American forces can be restored in East Asia, but whether Chongqing can awaken. Because British and American forces absolutely cannot be restored in East Asia.

Britain and the United States are now focusing all their efforts on Europe. Germany in Europe has military strength and resources far surpassing those of the last World War. Although Britain and the United States may gain some small advantages at sea, they will certainly run into a brick wall once they engage in battle. Even if they do not completely collapse for a time, a long-term war is inevitable. How can Britain and the United States have time to restore their forces in East Asia?

Britain and the United States' hope in East Asia lies entirely in bewitching Chongqing, causing it to stubbornly persist in its errors and leave some stains on the history of East Asian unity. It is truly regrettable if Chongqing ultimately does not awaken. Chongqing's current resistance is completely different from the previous resistance. The previous resistance was because it was believed that China and Japan could not coexist. Now, theory and facts clearly prove that China and Japan can coexist, so what is the point of resisting? This is not fighting for China, but fighting for Britain and the United States.

Some people may think that since Chongqing is standing on the British and American side, would it not be like Italy's Badoglio breaking away from the Axis powers if it were to break away from Britain and the United States at this time? This is far from the case. First, the Sino-Japanese conflict predates the European war. Now that the cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict has been eliminated, the Sino-Japanese conflict should naturally stop and cannot be confused with the European war. Second, it goes without saying that the cause of the Sino-Japanese conflict has now been eliminated. Moreover, due to East Asian relations, Sino-Japanese unity has already begun anew, and its sincerity and solidity far surpasses what it was before. Japan is doing its best to help China achieve independence, and China is doing its best to assist the Greater East Asia War in liberating East Asia, which is equivalent to liberating itself. It is open and righteous, how can it be compared to Italy's Badoglio's betrayal and abandonment of trust?

I have a word to say, brothers are brothers after all, and Chongqing will ultimately walk the same path as us. However, what I hope for is the sooner the better, do not hesitate and wait, increasing the suffering of our compatriots.

All of you here, after hearing my report, must take this genuine news and definitive judgment to inform your colleagues and subordinates, so that everyone can clearly recognize the current situation and strengthen their beliefs. At the same time, propagate the righteousness of the Greater East Asia War and the only path to liberation for China today to the entire country, so that comprehensive peace can be achieved as soon as possible, and the mission of revitalizing China and defending East Asia can be completed as soon as possible.

Instructions at the Closing Session

At the opening session the other day, I made a concise report on the truth of the current situation, the foundation for victory in the Greater East Asia War, based on my daily observations and what I gained from my talks with Prime Minister Tojo and other officials in Tokyo this time. Over the past few days, I have also received detailed explanations from friendly military authorities and the two Supreme Military and Economic Advisors. Just now, I also received sincere sharing from the military and political leaders attending the conference. We deeply believe that this conference has given everyone a lot of valuable insights. After returning, you will surely be able to make your colleagues and subordinates understand more clearly and strengthen their beliefs, and work together to strive for victory. At the same time, you will also be able to promote comprehensive peace. Now, there are only two important points that I wish to tell all the military and political leaders.

Within the military, the soldiers' creed of the Army, Navy, and Air Force should be used. In general society, the outline of the New Citizens' Movement should be the central belief, so that the people of the country can exert their spiritual strength to join the total war effort.

In order to ensure people's livelihoods, efforts should begin with suppressing prices and stabilizing finance, in order to continue to increase the people's productivity. All localities should abandon regional economic thinking, so that they can proceed in a unified manner and develop equally. I offer these two important points to encourage myself and to encourage each other.

South Pacific War Situation Expected to Become Prolonged: Roosevelt Convenes War Meeting

Lisbon, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to Washington news: Since Lord Mountbatten was appointed as the Supreme Commander of Southeast Asia, President Roosevelt convened the Pacific War Meeting for the first time yesterday. Beforehand, he also consulted with the four giants of Congress, namely Speaker of the House Rayburn, Majority Leader McCormack, President of the Senate and Vice President Wallace, and Majority Leader Barkley. It is believed that manpower and post-war issues were discussed at the meeting. American Ambassador to the Soviet Union, Steinhardt, also paid a visit to the President yesterday to report on the situation in the Soviet Union.

Stockholm, 30th (Central News Agency) - According to a dispatch from Washington, Senators Miller (Democrat) and Brewster (Republican), who had inspected the various war fronts by plane in the past two months, returned to Los Angeles from the Pacific front on the 29th. They told reporters: The most important thing on the Pacific front is to ensure transportation. The anti-Axis army, navy, and air force are currently implementing the closest joint operations in this regard. However, the Japanese army has a full understanding of the tactics of the anti-Axis forces, and they are also actively preparing for this. No matter how much the US military strengthens its combat power in that area, the future of the war should not be underestimated, so it cannot be expected that the war will end in a short period of time.

### Adulteration of Household Oil Under Strict Investigation

The sale of household oil based on housing donation certificates in the fifth district has been implemented successively in various districts. However, it has recently been found that some illegal retail oil shops are recklessly adulterating the allocated oil with water or replacing it with inferior oil for sale, which violates the principles of allocation and harms the people's food. The wholesalers have already dispatched personnel for secret investigations, and it is hoped that citizens will report any violations truthfully to the competent police station or wholesale office. If the investigation proves to be true, the allocation rights will be revoked and punished according to the law.

### Commercial Control Association Staff Not to Undertake Inspection Work

It has been verified that there are no restrictions on the movement of woolen textiles in this city. The Commercial Control Association has dispatched personnel to discuss this with the police authorities, and once verified, they will be released. However, foreigners are still unclear about the fact that woolen fabrics can be freely moved in this city, and there have been rumors that staff from the Commercial Control Association are working with the police to carry out searches, causing difficulties for woolen products. The person in charge of the association has solemnly stated that the association's staff will not undertake any inspection duties. If there are any imposters, they can be immediately arrested and handed over to the nearby police station for legal action to avoid being deceived.

### First and Third Police Bureau Deputy Director Watanabe Masami Travels to Japan; To Refresh Police Administration Upon Return to Shanghai

(Datong News Agency) The Times reported that Deputy Director Watanabe Masami of the Second and Third Police Bureaus left Shanghai for Tokyo yesterday morning on official business. According to well-informed sources, since the recovery of the two concessions, Watanabe Masami has been responsible for managing the police affairs of the First and Eighth Districts. At the same time, the unification of the organization of the two districts is also progressing smoothly.

Efforts to Integrate Police Affairs in Both Districts

It is understood that prior to August 1st, the organization of police officers in the First and Eighth Districts was not the same. However, since Watanabe Masami was assigned as Deputy Director of the Police Bureaus of the two districts under Mayor Chen Gongbo, efforts have been made to integrate the police affairs of the two districts, and plans are actively being made to create a system so that the First and Third Police Bureaus can cooperate and contact each other closely. Although the uniforms of the police officers in the two districts have not yet been standardized, the similarity of the cap badges already indicates unification. Currently, Chinese police officers bear a greater responsibility, especially for Chinese residents, in the police organization. They are like the keel that supports the entire body, so Chinese police officers should do their best to serve in the future. It has also been learned that Watanabe Masami is expected to return to Shanghai next week, and the First Police Bureau is expected to become a unified unit and be implemented immediately. The jurisdiction of the First Police Bureau has now been expanded to the old western district of Shanghai and part of the city center. However, in order to achieve good results in the planned plan, the relevant authorities are still in contact and consultation at any time.

### First District Public Office Changes Office Hours

From October 1st of this year until otherwise notified, the office hours of all departments of the First District Public Office will be changed to 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM and 2:00 PM to 5:00 PM from Monday to Friday, and 9:00 AM to 12:00 PM on Saturday.

### Purchasing Tickets to Ningbo Requires a Certificate

The number of passengers traveling to and from Ningbo is increasing daily, and the available tickets are insufficient, leading to the rise of a "ticket scalping gang" and a black market for tickets. To improve the ticket distribution process, authorities announced that starting October 1st, all passengers traveling to Ningbo for business must provide a certificate with the official stamp of their company, factory, and responsible person, or other documents proving that they are indeed returning to their hometown for legitimate reasons and not reselling tickets. Otherwise, tickets will not be issued. Passengers are urged to cooperate with their companies to streamline travel procedures.

### Civilian Police in the McTyeire District on Duty All Night

According to a reporter from the Datong News Agency, civilian police in the Eighth District (McTyeire District) are now on duty throughout the night. The district chief stated that drain covers, water faucets, and electric wires in the alleyways are often stolen by petty thieves late at night. Furthermore, the district has many small inns that often harbor criminals. Therefore, to establish public order, the district's civilian police are implementing overnight duty to combat theft.

Increased Duty Hours for the Eighth District

The original duty time for each shift of the civilian police in the Eighth District was two hours. According to information obtained by a Datong News Agency reporter from the Third Police Bureau, starting October 1st, the duty time for each shift has been extended to three hours, an increase of one hour from the original schedule.

### Lost Children to Be Claimed

### Soap and Match Purchase Certificates to Be Issued to Residents with Rice Noodle Tickets

### Measures for Taxing the Purchase of Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth: Ten Procedures for Collecting Unified Taxes

Central News Agency report: Regarding the measures for taxing the purchase of cotton yarn and cotton cloth, the tax collection procedures have been determined by the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance, with reference to the regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn. The ten procedures for the temporary collection of unified taxes on the purchase and sale of cotton yarn and cotton cloth are as follows:

Temporary Procedures of the Taxation Department of the Ministry of Finance for Collecting Unified Taxes During the Purchase and Sale of Yarn and Cloth

For domestically manufactured cotton yarn or cotton cloth that is also produced, if the goods have not yet been taxed upon purchase and sale, the original Article 6 of the revised regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn will be followed. Tax authorities will dispatch personnel to the factory to collect a unified tax of 5% on the purchase price and issue a tax payment certificate. This tax will be paid by the National Commercial Control Council (hereinafter referred to as "Shang Tong Hui") and temporarily recorded in the account. If the goods have already been taxed, there is no need to make supplemental tax payments based on purchase price.

Before shipping cotton yarn or cotton cloth, each yarn factory will submit a completed application form for the transport and sale of cotton yarn or cotton cloth to Shang Tong Hui, signed and stamped by the council and its responsible person. This form will be sent to the resident factory representative for verification and issuance of a completed tax payment certificate for the cotton yarn or cotton yarn directly woven products. There will be four copies of the issued tax payment certificate. The first and second copies will be submitted to Shang Tong Hui, and the responsible person of Shang Tong Hui will provide a receipt for the certificate. The first copy will have the official seal of the factory affixed to it, and after Shang Tong Hui and its responsible person stamp it, it will be submitted to the resident factory representative to be forwarded to the Tax Department for storage and verification. The second copy will be given to the person transporting the goods for use in shipping the goods from the factory.

When Shang Tong Hui presents the second copy of the tax payment certificate to the resident factory representative to ship the goods from the factory, the representative will still verify the goods and the certificate to ensure that they match. Then, a stamp with the words "Unified Tax Paid" will be added to the outer packaging of each item to allow for identification during transport.

After receiving the receipt for the certificate from Shang Tong Hui and the first copy of the stamped tax payment certificate, the resident factory representative should immediately submit them along with relevant reports to the Tax Department for verification and accounting. During the specified period, the tax payments will be collected from Shang Tong Hui based on the receipt. At the same time that the first copy and the receipt are submitted, the third copy of the certificate and the report should be submitted to the managing district for review and transfer to the relevant tax bureau for storage and verification. The fourth copy of the certificate will be retained by the resident factory representative for future reference.

For yarn and cloth shipped directly abroad by the yarn factory, Shang Tong Hui must submit a separate application for shipping yarn and cloth abroad to the Tax Department for verification and issuance of a tax-free transport permit. The permit will be given to the person transporting the goods for use in shipping the goods from the factory. However, when the goods are shipped from the factory, the tax-free transport permit must still be verified and registered by the resident factory representative for future inspection. If the goods have already been taxed and are then shipped abroad, the standard tax refund procedures may be followed to apply for a tax refund.

The seals used by Shang Tong Hui on various application forms, receipts, and the first copy of the tax certificate must be identical. Two copies of each seal should be submitted to the Tax Department and the resident factory representative for verification.

The application form and receipt for these procedures will be determined separately.

These procedures are temporarily limited to yarn factories in the Shanghai urban area. The tax collection and transport procedures for yarn factories in other cities and pure weaving factories in Shanghai will be determined separately.

For matters not covered in these procedures, the regulations of the revised regulations for the unified taxation of cotton yarn shall apply to tax refunds, changes in transportation routes, distribution, and verification.

These procedures will be implemented from the date they are submitted to the Ministry of Finance for record. If there are any omissions, the Tax Department may submit a request to the Ministry of Finance for revision.

Economic Commentary

### A Second Discussion on Welfare Lottery Tickets

Since the National Government announced the "Provisional Regulations for Welfare Lottery Tickets" in June of this year, it was not until recently that the Central Savings Society announced that the first welfare lottery tickets would be issued starting today, with the drawing to be held at the end of November. The largest prize is a first prize of one million yuan, and the smallest prize is a thirteenth prize of twenty yuan.

Regarding the idea of issuing lottery tickets to contract the currency, Mr. Shohachi Ishiwata, the highest economic advisor to the National Government, said in the spring of this year: "In the future, the National Government may consider issuing lottery tickets and encouraging prize-winning savings as one of the measures to recover currency." From this, it is known that the special savings lottery tickets of ten million yuan issued in early July and the regular market prize-winning savings week held in late last month, which absorbed hundreds of thousands of yuan in floating capital, were just the vanguard.

The ancients said: "To govern a chaotic country, use heavy laws." However, in addition to "heavy laws," "heavy rewards" are also an effective strategy. The currency inflation and abundance of floating capital that come with chaotic times can certainly be rectified with heavy rewards. In this column on June 9th, we discussed "Welfare Lottery Tickets," but only focused on the "people's welfare" aspect. Today, we will discuss the "heavy rewards" aspect to further elaborate on its meaning.

Some people believe that lottery tickets can arouse people's gambling mentality, which is not commendable. However, in today's world, it is already difficult to suppress people's gambling mentality. The government's issuance of various lottery tickets, especially "welfare lottery tickets," can ultimately integrate welfare into gambling, which is what everyone should recognize.

### Business Community in This City Plans to Establish a National Federation of Commerce

The business community in this city, with Shanghai as the national business champion and one of the world's six largest cities, had a National Chamber of Commerce Federation before the war to convey the government's will from above and communicate the conditions of the business community from below.

The relationship was close.

The effects were great. Due to a series of connections, the National Chamber of Commerce Federation was suspended until recently. Now, as the war progresses, it is particularly important for the rear to have a unified commercial organization as its support, especially as the government implements

commercial control

policies. If commercial organizations in various regions are scattered and not united, it will not only affect the prospects of the war, but also hinder the implementation of government policies. Therefore, the connection work of commercial organizations in various regions is very urgent. As a result, influential figures in the business community of this city are planning to initiate the establishment of a National Chamber of Commerce Federation. The method is to have the chambers of commerce of Shanghai, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, and Nanjing as the initiators, and on the one hand,

report to the government

for approval according to law, and on the other hand, formally invite chambers of commerce from the three provinces and two cities, as well as the four provinces and three cities in the north, to join. Detailed and comprehensive methods are currently being secretly drafted by relevant personnel, and a preparatory committee will be formed to take charge of the matter.

### Establishment of the Tea Specialty Department Awaits

According to Datong News Agency, the establishment of the tea specialty department of the Shang Tong Hui has been delayed because the internal organization has not yet been fully prepared. The Chinese side is represented by the Tea Industry Association Federation, including the tea industry associations of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Bengbu, Wuhu, Qingbo, Shaoxing, Zhenjiang, and Wuxi. The Japanese side is represented by the China Central Tea Industry Association, including the tea industry associations of Shanghai, Nanjing, Suzhou, Hangzhou, Wuhu, and Bengbu.

### Shang Tong Hui Establishes Cotton Specialty Department to Handle Cotton Purchasing Work

According to a responsible person from the National Commercial Control Council, the council originally had a Cotton Industry Professional Committee to handle all cotton industry control matters. Later, due to orders to establish a "Cotton Yarn and Cotton Cloth Purchasing Office" to implement purchases, which was different from the previous situation, the council's seventh joint board meeting decided to first revoke the Cotton Industry Professional Committee. After the yarn and cloth purchasing work is completed, another organization will be formed to handle various allocation matters. However, the cotton purchasing season is now in full swing and needs to be promoted. Another organization must be formed to respond to the situation. Recently, a Cotton Specialty Department has been established within the council to be responsible for handling cotton purchasing work. The specialty department is not a committee system. It only has one director and two deputy directors. The position of director is temporarily held by Chairman Tang Du, and Tong Lüqing and Di Xiaoer have been hired as deputy directors.

### Trend of Chinese Stocks

Yesterday in the Chinese stock market, due to the significant decline in the past two days, it triggered the activity of bargain hunters. Investor sentiment shifted from weak to strong, and at 2:45 PM, led by major investors making purchases, retail investors also jumped in to buy, and prices gradually rose. However, the closing prices were still slightly lower than the prices at noon the previous day, but higher than the final transaction prices in the afternoon. The dynamics of each stock are recorded below:

Textiles: Wing On Textile was the firmest. The opening bid was quite high, but soon fell back. It was stable at noon, and gradually rose in the afternoon, with the highest price being the final transaction price, which was higher than the previous day. Da Sheng 1, 2, and 3 factories were flat. China Textile, Xinhe, and Mei Ya all saw declines, and the latter also rose in the afternoon. Mei Lun, Wool, and Lunhua Dyeing were traded around the previous day's price. Rui Tai Wool was traded at more than 1.5 times its face value. Rong Feng Textile was firm. Among the small face value weaving stocks, only Hong Xing declined slightly. Anxing and Da Zhonghua Weaving were both firm. Jingfu Shirt and Socks fell and then rose.

Department Stores: Wing On and Sincere Company fluctuated, and the final prices were higher than the previous afternoon's prices. National Goods was particularly weak and listless. China Underwear also declined slightly in the fluctuation.

New Medicines: Xin Ya Pharmaceutical Factory was pulled up by major investors after falling. The final prices of both China-France Pharmacy fell. Wu Zhou, China-West, and Xin Xing Pharmaceutical Factories also declined. All of them recovered in the afternoon.

Finance: The selling pressure was still low. Mainland Bank once exceeded its face value, but then fell back, and both Shanghai and Zhejiang Industrial were flat. Jin Cheng was slightly higher, and Salt Industry was slightly lower. Communication Easy Trust

Culture: Commercial Press and China Bookstore both fell, making up for the previous day's uncorrected losses. World Bookstore was stable. Standard Paper opened today, and investments were inclined to the stock, so it rose. Quan Gong and Jin Feng Paper were both stable.

Public Utilities: Zhabei Water and Electricity has recovered slightly, Huashang Electric was flat and weak, and Xiang Sheng Tricycle and Public Utilities Electrical were stable.

Real Estate: Declined significantly. New Yi, Lianhua, and Yongxing all fell slightly.

Industry: Jiu An and Da Zhonghua Industry were both flat and weak. Xin Ya Construction fell and then rose. Da Zhonghua Matches also fell slightly. Huacheng and Nanyang Tobacco were both slightly lower. Guohua and China Investment were still flat and weak. Xinghua Industry's new shares officially began trading today. Other: Mei Lin and Kang Yuan Canning were both slightly lower. Standard MSG was still being held up by major investors. Baoan Glass and Scientific Chemical were stable.

### Summary of Market Conditions

Public Bonds: The market for unified public bonds continued to decline yesterday. Investor sentiment remained weak, probably due to the end of the month, which made funds tight. When the stock market starts trading, most of them will gradually return to the right track. Yesterday, Class C bonds opened flat, then rose, but due to many selling households, the supply exceeded demand, and the final price was slightly lower than the previous day. Classes A, B, D, and E also followed suit.

Interbank Interest: The Shanghai Money Trade Association's interbank interest rate was 0.8%, unchanged.

Grains: Rice and grains rose due to low supply. Oil grains also saw slightly higher bids, but transactions were generally low.

Medicinal Materials: Transactions decreased yesterday due to the end of the month. Investor sentiment remained fairly stable. Guangdong merchants had previously imported large quantities of medicinal materials, which were shipped south yesterday, so bids were slightly higher.

Raw Silk: The market remained fluctuating. Later, due to slight movement from the factory, a glimmer of hope emerged, and the foundation remained firm.

Tea: Transactions remained slow. The market was quiet, and prices were slightly firm in the quiet. Only Ding Yaotai and Qing Maochun, two tea companies, each imported six to seven cases of green tea, sold by Yongshun Tea Company. Discussions for other varieties, idle black tea sales and trade variations, were still underway.

Daily Necessities: Although the price limit for soap has been raised, the market is still weak, so the selling price in the market is still within the limit. At the same time, Wuzhou Gu Ben Factory suddenly increased its deliveries, and most of the industry gave up on shipping goods due to the difficult market conditions. The match market was also brought down. It will not be easy to reverse the decline.

### Flour and Wheat Specialty Committee Actively Promotes Work; Committee Members Go North to Discuss Trade Matters

Since the adoption of the plan to control and purchase wheat by the Flour and Wheat Specialty Committee, it has been proceeding according to the planned schedule. It has also formulated various measures for foreign exports and exchanges. According to reports, the details are as follows:

Exchange of Materials

The planned purchase volume for this year is 6.5 million bags, of which 2.5 million bags are assured. The implementation of new purchase strategies this year is more effective than in previous years, so there is no cause for pessimism. All parties have great expectations for the specialty committee. In addition, the Central China region lacks soybeans and coal, so some of the wheat will be exchanged for Manchurian soybeans and North China coal.

Committee Members Go North

According to reports, Sun Zhongli, the chief director of the Flour and Wheat Specialty Committee, and Inoue Yasutada, the deputy director, will travel to Beijing this week to explain the operating situation to relevant parties and the specialty committee of the North China Political Affairs Committee and discuss various wheat trade matters.

### Speculation Retreats, Prices Fall

Since the authorities have severely cracked down on hoarding and implemented the purchase of yarn and cloth in this city, speculators have slightly restrained themselves. In particular, the authorities' efforts to smooth the exchange of materials and implement unified collection and allocation of all food items have suddenly curbed the fierce price increases of the past. Recently, prices have gradually fallen, and the burden on people's livelihoods has been significantly reduced. It is reported that most of the general floating capital in this city after the elimination of speculation has returned to the banks, seeking to invest in property construction projects. If production increases, transportation becomes active, and unified allocation is reasonably effective, then prices will definitely tend to decline step by step.

### Grain Problem

— Wu Zhizhan

The importance of the grain problem is known to everyone and need not be elaborated. Here, I will point out the shortcomings of the past grain administration in Shanghai, and then, based on my limited understanding, briefly describe the future policies that should be followed, for the reference of the authorities.

A. Review of the Reasons for Past Failures in Grain Administration

1. Human Factors Not Matching Expectations: Everything depends on human effort, and human effort can even overcome fate. A major shortcoming of past failures in grain administration was the improper appointment of talent and the lack of smooth operation of the administrative machinery. The Shen Bao newspaper of September 9th carried the following passage: "...Since the Ministry of Food planned to control the procurement, transportation, and distribution of rice, the inadequate organization of the rice procurement and transportation agencies has affected the rice distribution to households..." From this, it can be seen that the past mechanisms were not entirely satisfactory.

2. Lack of Overall Planning: Looking at the recent rice distribution in Shanghai, not only is it unable to be distributed on time, but the quantity is even less than before. The embarrassing situation of being stretched thin is clearly evident. It is clear that the grain administration authorities lacked pre-established plans and failed to prepare in time, so that supply and demand were disorganized and things were merely dealt with as they came, paying only superficial attention. Few measures were effective, and even fewer failed to arouse public resentment.

3. Failure to Strictly Enforce Grain Control: The past grain control seemed to be strict on the surface but lax internally. Although under control, the black market for grain still existed, and the prices on the black market were much higher than the controlled prices. For example, the controlled price of rice was 600 yuan per picul (stone), while the black market price reached as high as 2,000 yuan per picul. This caused farmers who produced grain to be unwilling to sell to the controlled agencies at the controlled price, and they were happy to sell to private merchants on the black market. After purchasing the grain, the merchants resold it to other merchants through a chain of transfers. In this way, it was transferred into the Shanghai urban area, where profits could be made. Control was control, and the black market was the black market, forming an unrelated situation. How could such a contradictory phenomenon exist under control? Even if we take a step back and say that the buying and selling of grain is allowed within a certain range, then at a minimum, the controlled price must be strictly observed. However, the authorities simply allowed it, allowing them to engage in black market sales at black market prices, which was a mistake. The result of this laxity was to fuel the rampant activity of the black market and undermine the control work. The impact on the implementation and effectiveness of grain control was extremely serious.

4. Insufficient Distribution Quantity: The people consider food as heaven, and they live by eating; otherwise, there is a danger of turmoil. The past amount of grain distributed to households was far from what people needed, so the black market took the opportunity to breed. Especially when grain rations encountered troubles, the black market became even more rampant. I have heard that benevolent people do not distance themselves from the masses to carry out righteousness. If you want to achieve a certain goal and carry out an event, then you must do it thoroughly, so that it reaches its goal and then stops, otherwise, I am afraid there will be a danger of "not only being useless but also harmful." In the past Shanghai grain administration, the lack of perfection in the handling of affairs and the insufficient distribution quantity were among the biggest shortcomings. If this shortcoming cannot be remedied, then to seek the grain problem to get on track, the controlled prices to be implemented, and the black market to be eliminated, will be like climbing a tree to catch fish, and it is believed that it will be forever difficult to achieve the goal.

The above are the major reasons for the failure of the past grain administration. Other factors, such as the lack of political power, transportation restrictions, and security in the grain-producing areas, all directly or indirectly affected the grain administration work. Political power is the most important, because national affairs often require strong political power, otherwise, they are often half as effective as they should be and cannot be promoted smoothly.

B. Countermeasures to be Followed in the Future

1. Carefully Select Talent and Plan Institutions Well: The past failures in human affairs have been described above. Since we have learned from the past, we should use it as a lesson for the future. Sima Guang once said, "If officials are competent, all affairs will be well-managed." Therefore, today's gatherings of affairs should start with the careful selection of talent. We must first examine their abilities, and then give them positions and grant them powers, so that they can integrate power with responsibility and combine connections with accountability. Only by being completely selfless and forgetting personal interests can we ensure that talent and position match, and all affairs are well-managed. We must abandon the inferior habit of only using relatives, old friends, and acquaintances, and forgetting public interests for personal gain. Once talent is in place, the problem of planning can also be more than half solved. If there are people in charge, then policy will be well-implemented. Those past organizations that were nominal and unnecessary should be eliminated; those indispensable organizations that were not sound should be strengthened; and those organizations that should have been established but were not should be added. Make the entire institutional organization organically adjusted. Only in this way can the expected efficiency be produced. For example, the soul and trunk of a person can only express themselves as "the spirit of all things" when they are mutually adjusted. If one of the two is missing, it will become a ghost and a zombie.

2. Establish a Complete Supply and Demand Plan: "Prepare in advance, and you will succeed; fail to prepare, and you will fail" is a constant and unchanging truth. Especially in today's era of scientific development, if you want to start a business, you must first conduct a complete investigation and recognition of the business. After the object is clear, you can start to proceed, so that you will not get twice the result with half the effort. The same principle applies to handling grain administration. You must first recognize the actual situation and conditions, and then establish a supply and demand plan based on this understanding. Follow this plan to proceed, and then there is hope of success. The main points are described as follows:

(1) General Situation of Rice and Wheat Production in Central China: Rice and wheat are the main food materials of our people, with rice being the most important and wheat next. Rice and wheat together account for more than 45% of our people's food materials. Just looking at the position occupied by Central China, it is even more important, without saying. Although there is a lot of rice in our country, only the middle and lower reaches of the Yangtze River—Central China—have a slight surplus; the production area of wheat is widely spread throughout the provinces and is sufficient for self-sufficiency. So, is the rice and wheat produced in Central China enough for Central China's self-sufficiency, and why was foreign rice imported in the past? In order to answer those who insist that the failure of Shanghai's grain administration was due to a lack of supply, I would like to explain the following reasons: Foreign rice was imported to supplement areas with insufficient production. The area in our country with the most severe shortage of rice is not Central China, but Guangdong Province in South China. According to the investigation in the eighth year of the Republic of China, the national rice import surplus was 1.8 million dan, and Guangdong alone accounted for 1.6 million dan (about 89%); in the twelfth year of the Republic of China, the national rice import surplus was more than 22 million dan, and Guangdong accounted for more than 17 million dan (about 77%). From this, we can see that Guangdong often accounted for 70% to 90% of the past foreign rice imports in our country. It is clear that it was not imported for the needs of Central China. Foreign food prices were low. From the second to the ninth years of the Republic of China, the import price of foreign rice was higher than the selling price, so the import volume was small. After the tenth year of the Republic of China, the import price of foreign rice was lower than the selling price, which led to a sharp increase in imports. This is the natural result of dumping. It was only a price relationship, and it was not caused by a lack of rice in Central China. The quality of domestic rice and wheat is mostly poor. Imported rice, wheat, and flour are mostly sold in big cities. This is because consumers in these places seek excellent quality, as do manufacturers. Foreign food naturally comes in response. However, it has nothing to do with the production of Central China. From the above three points, the import of foreign food has very little impact on the self-sufficiency of Central China. Even though foreign food cannot be imported today, Central China's production can be self-sufficient.

(2) Estimation of Rice and Wheat Production in Central China and the Needs of Shanghai Citizens:

Rice and Wheat Production in the Lower Reaches of the Yangtze River:

Rice: 435,740,000 dan

Wheat: 120,877,773 dan

(Note: The lower reaches of the Yangtze River include the five provinces of Jiangsu, Anhui, Hubei, Hunan, and Jiangxi. Wheat only records wheat. If other types of wheat are fully included, the number should be even more considerable.)

Assuming that there are 5 million citizens in Shanghai, and that each person needs at least 1.5 catties of rice and wheat a day to maintain life, then the annual demand of Shanghai City is 27,375,000 dan, accounting for about 6% of the rice and wheat production in the lower reaches of the Yangtze River. This small number is definitely not difficult to obtain from the total production. In the past, the amount of distribution was at most 15 catties per person per month (9 catties of rice, calculated at 6 sheng, and 6 catties of flour), averaging only half a catty per day. And it seems that it has been very difficult to handle, which is really difficult to understand. In my humble opinion, the reason for this is not the question of the production of Central China, but it is caused by poor handling.

(3) Procurement and Storage Plan: From the above, it can be seen that the grain needed by Shanghai City should be able to be obtained entirely from Central China. Please discuss the procurement and storage plan as follows:

A. Procurement Plan:

The best time for procurement is during the harvest period of each crop. At this time, there are many people who want to sell, and it is easy to buy.

Regional allocation for procurement: A detailed on-site investigation should be conducted first. Based on the investigation, divide the producing areas into several areas. Formulate the possible purchase quantity for each area. So that the grain needed for a year can be purchased in full within a certain area and within a limited time, so as to avoid future excavation.

Examination and approval of procurement prices: The level of procurement prices is enough to determine the success or failure of the procurement work. If the controlled price is too low, producers will not want to sell. If the controlled price is too high, then there is only the name of control, and the benefits of control cannot be obtained. Therefore, it must be carefully examined and approved to avoid unfavorable situations.

Flexible use of the procurement plan: When taros, potatoes, and other crops are harvested, they should be purchased and distributed in appropriate quantities to supplement a portion of rice and wheat. The nutritional value of these plants is also very good. The latter has always been our country's famine relief food, and the grain planting is widespread. Xu Guangqi of the Qing Dynasty tried his best to promote it, citing as many as 13 benefits.

B. Storage Plan: The newly needed food is purchased, and it cannot be used up in a day or a month. It is necessary to set up warehouses to store it. According to the storage of grain in warehouses, our country has a long history, with three types: Ever-Normal Granary, Community Granary, and Charitable Granary. I heard that the authorities are already running it. The Shen Bao newspaper of September 5th of this year recorded the following passage: "The Ministry of Food is building warehouses in appropriate locations in various provinces. The warehouses in Jiangsu, Zhejiang, and Anhui provinces have been completed within a time limit..." As for whether this warehouse under construction is related to storing the grain needed by Shanghai, it is not known. However, the management of the warehouse is more difficult than its construction. However, the authorities already have a concrete plan, so I will not repeat it here.

C. Distribution Method: The past distribution method was to distribute grain according to the number of people. According to the household registration book, grain purchase certificates were issued for purchase. This is a good method. It can be handled in the same way in the future. However, in the past, the date of issue, the type of staple food, and the quantity were different between the old concession and the Nanshi, and between the Nanshi and Pudong. Even in the same area (such as Yangjingbang and Jinjiaqiao Town in Pudong), there were often new preparations. This grain situation is not a good sign. It is hoped that the authorities can unify it in the future. This will not only facilitate management, but also make it difficult for retailers to commit fraud. (Villagers are foolish and easily deceived.)

3. Grain Control Must be Strictly Enforced: Control economics is a new method of modern economics, and it is often used during wartime to establish the country's wartime economy. Grain control is a department of control economics. During the last European war, Germany's mighty iron cavalry was invincible, but it eventually failed because the sea mouth was blocked, and the grain was insufficient. What is the importance of grain control? In the past, the grain in Shanghai City, although under the jurisdiction of control, eventually did not see any effect due to the lack of strict control and poor management, so that 5 million common people were panting on the line of hunger. If we do not learn from the past and change our ways, and tighten control, the future will be unimaginable. Here are the ways to tighten control:

(1) Buying and Selling Control:

Buying Control: Control of food in the production area should be exercised separately. Private buying and selling in agricultural areas should be limited as much as possible, such as forcing the implementation of controlled prices, and investigating their inventory at any time. The control authorities may purchase it at the officially set controlled price when necessary. For secret hoarding, once found, in addition to confiscating all of it, they will also be punished with the crimes they deserve. In this way, Shanghai City's need for grain will not be in danger of not being purchased.

Selling Control: The sale of producers in the production area is purchased by the control authorities, as described above. The demand of Shanghai citizens is completely implemented by selling according to the number of people, and those who sell on the black market will be severely punished.

(2) Transportation Control: All rights to transport grain should be completely controlled by the authorities. Those who transport privately will be prosecuted and their materials will be confiscated.

(3) Price Control: Officially set prices should be absolutely observed. Private buying and selling in the production area should also be based on officially set prices to prevent price increases and black markets.

If the above three control tasks can be fully and thoroughly implemented, then the grain problem will be able to get on track, and the threat of grain to Shanghai citizens can be lifted. Maintaining the minimum amount of distribution: From this, it can be known that the failure of the past grain administration was not due to a lack of supply. Therefore, the possibility of increasing the amount of distribution in the future is great. If the above three points can be fully and earnestly implemented, then increasing the amount of distribution to maintain the minimum living of citizens can be expected soon.

The reasons for the failure of Shanghai's past grain administration are briefly described above, and the countermeasures have also been briefly stated. If it can be thoroughly implemented, the food problem of Shanghai City can be solved clearly. However, the plan for a hundred years is still to increase agricultural production. First, use political power to protect farmers and enable them to live and work in peace; then, use scientific methods to implement agricultural extension and increase production. So that the land can be used to its full advantage, then the people will have sufficient food, and when the people have sufficient food, the foundation of the country will be solid. The future of China, I hope for it?
